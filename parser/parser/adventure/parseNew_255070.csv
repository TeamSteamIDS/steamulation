												Just going to start it off with a good 'Buy it'. For 15 dollars this game damn well worth it, with beautiful visual, great soundtrack, small story but good, nice side background notes to read, great gameplay with a lot of variation in terms of play styles, and so much more. The game is also extremely challenging, even the non-boss enemies (aka trash mobs) are hard to deal with, and they aren't just 'tough' they dodge, block, parry, and strike when necessary, they sometimes even gang-beat you. One cool thing the game has is that you can control all creatures you encounter if you're higher level than them and if you used a certain special attack so that you can collect their soul and transform into them, and each creature/character have their own attacks and play styles which is really awesome. Also the local versus mode (4-players) is great, choose any character you want in the game (assuming you unlocked it in the campaign) and duke it out with your friends.The bad about the game is that the controls are sluggish when turning your character's direction from right to left or vice versa, which to some might annoy very much, but can be coped with and just have patience when doing so. The game also features campaign coop, but for me it's not fun as friendly-fire is enabled and there is no option to turn it off, and because of this i (or my friend) find my self doing most of the killing or not doing anything while my friend does the killing to prevent any of us from getting damaged and lose health, and because of this it's hard to recommend to play the game in coop mode. Unless the patch it to disable friendly-fire. [UPDATE: There developer's have patched the game and friendly fire can be turned of. So! If you want to play this with a friends, then go for it and you'll have a blast =3]To sum it up, it's an amazing game that's high quality, brutal, full of content, and high replay value. With randomly generated levels, great combat, and a lot of characters to play from with different play styles. Plus the extra versus mode and coop mode (that will hopefully have an option to disable friendly-fire). It's hard not to recommend this game for the asking price, unless you don't like hard games.UPDATE: There is now an option to turn off friendly-fire. so my recommendation of this game went up from 80% to 90% . Coop is now fun to play.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is one of those games where the plot is clearly spelled out...in the title. As Katrien, Pincoya, or the Ghost Monk, you must brave the depths, fight countless abominations, and end the Warlock's demonic nightmares. This is a rather unique game, with its combination of rogue-like elements, fighting game mechanics, and semi-cooperative play.There are three paths available, though the player can sometimes detour into either of the other paths. This may be necessary to access special events such as boss-fights, arenas, and meetings with strange individuals. The bosses are self-explanatory, but the arenas put you in control of a random adversary. One of the selling points of this game is that nearly everyone you fight is playable, and they all have their own move-sets. Completing these arenas restores your character's HP and grants them a summon. Think of it as a third life-bar, which is necessary because healing opportunities are few and far between in the Abyss. If your heroine (or hero) is wiped out, a random soldier will take their place. If he dies, it's all over (unless you spent a checkpoint token), but he can revive the main characters if he uncovers a shrine. The combat is a bit tricky to get used to, and starting players shouldn't even think of touching the nightmare mode. My advice is to play defensively, but don't just sit around blocking. There's a lot of maneuvering in this game, and you'll find yourself fighting just for a better position. In short, you want to push your enemies against the wall so you can easily juggle them to death. As a fighting game, AO features standard attacks like anti-airs, pokes, dash-attacks, and so on. Coming to grips with everything will take practice, as you can't really approach this title like Street Fighter, Smash Bros. or even Mortal Kombat. It shares elements of all those games, but it does its own thing with them, which might be offputting to some. Keep in mind also that stage layouts can change the way a fight plays out. Expect to be outnumbered 4 to 1, or dealing with traps while fighting. Something as simple as a platform or a wall can change things dramatically. Aside from danger, the Abyss is also home to a number of merchants and treasures. Gold can be spent to buy equipment and healing items, though good luck ever finding something you actually need. The main characters can also level-up, which provide very slight stat-boosts. Experience and gold are persistent through every odyssey, however once you die you lose everything else. While there is a standard Versus mode, typically your interactions with other players will be semi-cooperative. I say semi because AO is one of the rare games where players can hurt each other. An option was recently added to turn this off, which is nice, but I guess the developers aren't particularly fond of its inclusion. This design-decision was employed so that players simply don't spam moves all the time and trivialize fights. When playing with a friend (or a complete stranger) you have to time your attacks, fight nearby opponents, or even ""tag-in"" during prolonged fights if one player is low on health. All that said, turning off friendly-fire doesn't affect anything aside from one of the achievements, and it's a pain to get since it involves playing through nightmare mode (more aggressive AI, bosses tend to have assistants, etc). It's safe to say that Abyss Odyssey, isn't for everyone. Yes I know that is one of the most overused descriptions on the planet, but it definitely applies here. The fighting system can appear wonky and random, it gets frustrating when you can't land a hit for anything,  and what's with every game having rogue-like elements? Maybe I want to keep my stuff when I die! Ever thought of that!? But...whatever. I can't promise anything, but this game is good enough for me.			"

												I dunno what to say about this one. The game soundtrack is amazing, the art is pretty damn good, the story is equally interesting. All in all, it would be a perfect game, BUT! Yes, there is always a but!This game suffers from a fatal flaw that makes people dislike this game, and personally, it doesn't really bother me, at least before nightmare mode. This game suffers from INCREDIBLY awkward controls. You character feels heavy, your moves slightly powerless, jumping is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ it would be perfect if the combat was slightly faster in pace, and the movement wasn't that clunky, but this game is stiff as all hell. I do not like games where you can easily reach a combo of 100 without any kind of effort, but in this game, no matter how hard I try (I might suck, too), I can BARELY pull a 10 hit combo. I enjoyed this game a lot, and it's always nice and addictive to level up and go down the levels of the abyss, like a dungeon crawler game, and the clunky controls, as I said, aren't much of a problem UNTIL you reach nightmare mode, and enemies gangbang you while you can barely do 4 hit combos. I don't mind stiff controls, but most of the people out there who want a fluid, fast paced adventure beat 'em up....I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is a platforming action rogue-like type game released in mid 2014 on PC and consoles, although sadly there are only approximately 70k owners of this game on SteamYou play as Katrien as you try and stop a Warlock who is at the bottom of an abyss. The warlock's dreams are infecting reality and must be stopped! The gameplay is very simple. You have a number of different attacks which you can also unlock and upgrade their abilities and power through leveling up. You also have a number of a different spells which again can be improved by spending talent points in them.  There is also a block/parry system in the game; however I had very little need to use them even on the harder stages. The combat system is very easy to grasp. It follows the same sort of system as beat'em up games and you can quite easily pull of a couple of cool combos.  Throughout the game; there are also shops in which you can purchase equipment and weapons, these offer special effects such as being able to charm an enemy to fight on your side, which is something a little different to add some variety to your gameplay. The art is actually based on the Nouveau movement.The graphics are standard 2D style, but the art style is beautiful; it sets the mood and the atmosphere is perfectly portrayed through the art.  The backgrounds on each level are gorgeous, even though most of them look dark and deathy (is that a word ?). Speaking of the levels; they are all procedural generated; no playthrough will ever be the same which adds tons of replay ability to this type of game. There are three stages of difficulty to each level, Easy, Normal and Hard. You are able to tell which difficulty each stage is by using the map system in the game which easily shows you a path you take, and maybe if you want to readjust your course to skip a few hard stages, you can. After you finish one playthrough, you unlock a different set of levels; however there seems to be a community based unlock system in the game too; once a certain number of players defeat final bosses on each stage, the next phase of the game unlocks which is something I've not seen before apart from in MMOs.Roguelikes are one of my favorite genre's of games; this has the feature of not actually resetting you completely after you die, you get to keep your gold in order to buy weapons/equipment on your next run through, you also stay the same level, meaning you can grind out a few levels and then eventually you'll be able to take down the final boss. I managed to complete a couple of playthroughs in the two and a half hours I have been playing so far; and I am still enjoying it thoroughly; this kind of feels a little bit like Risk of Rain, while although not as complex, it still has feel to it with the equipment side of things. The game needs to be played with a controller; don't even attempt to play it with your keyboard.I can easily recommend Abyss Odyssey; I will certainly be keeping it installed on my PC for the odd jump in every now and again. Rogue-like fans will love it. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Fun game so far. This is a Beat em up / rogue like with some RPG elements. You decend down levels each having a merchant and a ""potential"" save point at the end. you find weapons as you decend deeper but it looks like the majority of your items will be bought. when you die you get a much weaker hero that carries your weapon and any keys you dropped when you died and if he makes it to the end of the level your original hero gets ressurected.If you decide to quit without saving which costs 9000 gold for a save token you start from the top of the tower but your hero level and gold stay with you but you lose all items. So it seems you need to run this a few times without buying any equipment so you can save for good stuff to beat it. I decended about 1/2 way down the tower in an hour so it seems to have a game length of binding of issac but a much better equipment/money system.ProsGraphics - pretty cool graphics style.Levels and money earned dont disapear - makes it feel like your not starting from scratch when you quit or die.Co-Op - playing with your friends should be funLooks like there are lots of heros to unlock to add to the replayability factorConsSave Token - For people that dont play for more than a few hours at a time you have to spend a decent amount of gold to save your progress down the tower, so if you cant play for more than an hour or two at a time you might want to think hard about getting this.Controls - Right now Configurations for controllers except the 360 controller are buggy (my Logitech F710 doesnt work right) the keyboard and mouse controlls are doable but not recomended. So unless you have a Xbox 360 controller I would wait a few for a patch.Over all the game is good , I just think it needs a little fine tuning. for the sale price of 9.99 im happy with it. full price of 15 bucks should be worth it once the problems are fixed.

												I was intrigued by all the negative reviews mentioning the controls. Seems like everyone agrees something is not right but they can't quite put their fingers on it. ""Feels heavy"" some say, ""jumping is awkward"" others say. So I bought it out of curiosity! Before buying the game I even had a theory about the jump profile, but my theory was wrong.I find the movements ok. Nothing particularly good or bad about it. It's functional. Grabbing ledges can be annoying at times though. The combat, with all honesty, is actually pretty damn good! I was shocked and surprised by it, judging by my low expectations. I am not sure why the poor reviews focus on that aspect. Maybe people went in expecting something alike Dust: An Elysian Tail, which has a very fluid and easy fighting mechanics. You can just mash the buttons in different ways and there's always a new combo there. But Abyss Odyssey is a completely different deal. Combat is extremely tactical, your movements are not instantaneous and you are not invulnerable while attacking, so you have to plan when to attack, watch your timing, be aware of other enemies around you, use defense correctly, use evasion etc etc. It reminds me a lot of Dark Souls actually. Not so unforgiving, fortunately, but the pacing is similar and it also requires focus and skill.I still haven't finished the game, and some reviews made sure to point out that the game becomes unforgivable during the nightmare modes (each level has a random difficulty level). So I might change my recommendation if these modes are bad enough to make me dislike the game altogether.So I find the combat good and the controls ok, what else? Yeah, the rest of the game is not successfully engaging me I'm afraid. First time I played I died pretty quickly, but the second time went on forever! I was starting to get tired and I wanted to stop playing the game but I never died, I just kept going and going and going. The environments are all too similar and the gameplay doesn't change in any way. I find the progression very tedious so far. Probably (this is me just guessing now) the game lacks more gameplay elements. There is platforming, but it's trivial challenge, and the controls wouldn't even support more than that. I'm thinking it needs sections with a slower pace, so we can catch our breath, look at the scenery, absorb some of the story, solve a couple of puzzles. I'm digressing now though.This is my recommendation with a handful of salt (instead of a pinch, get it?). It's an interesting thing this game, I'm glad I bought it, even if I lose interest before finishing it.			"

Abyss Odyssey feels like a mix between alot of different games.The combat and the combat system feel like the Super Smash Bros games.The combat area gets isolated so that you can't run until you've fought your foes, much like in the Devil May Cry (or other Hack n' Slash/Slay) games.When you die you'll have to start again from the beginning (except you have a checkpoint token), much like in rogue like games like Rogue Legacy or Binding of Isaac.Otherwise than that, the game has 3 playable main characters (from which you have to unlock 2 first) and the ability to capture enemy souls and play as these, nice combat (you have to get used to it first), a really basic story that no one actually should care about, a lack of tutorials so that you'll be confused until you've figured things out on your own and a really short play time (I played through the whole game thrice on the release day... in just 5 hours (2.6 h for the first playthrough, 1.4 for the second, 1h for the third (as you can say from my times, there's not much of a challenge after the first playthrough))).Final conclusion:Overall I had alot of fun playing this game, but considering how short it is (and not everyone want's to play through the game multiple times) and the fact that the challenge will decrease very fast after the first playthrough, I wouldn't recommend buying this game for it's full 15$ price.

												As much as I wanted this game to work, it simply does not. The idea is solid, but the controls just don't respond in real-time combat. The monsters defend against your tactics quickly, but your ability to react is lost in a highly-limited, unresponsive combat UI. The game looks like it would be so fun, if only you could hit back; just getting your character to face the right direction is a chore. You can execute combos all day in the training dojo (against a motionless combat dummy), but none of those moves will work once the UI tries to interact with the AI.			"

												** EDIT **The developers did tweak this game to make it more responsive, and the feel of combat in the game is no longer the dismal creature it was when I wrote my original review.  Ultimately, the long-form mechanics of the game bored me, and I still can't recommend it as a masterpiece for anyone (such as castle crashers), but it is now at least a competent game, and not the steaming pile I encountered when it first came out.Consider buying it if you are on the fence, to support devs who do their best to change from criticism, but don't expect too much or you'll probably be disappointed.** /EDIT **I heard the devs tuned the controls to make them more responsive, which is shocking, because the patched version is one of the most unresponsive brawlers I've ever played.  It's Bad Dudes NES bad.  Turning to face the other direction is a chore and moves spend more time finishing animations than they do starting them.  Essentially, you're vulnerable whenever actual strategy is required, which means the only way to progress is to stay out of the action and spam cheap shots.  This lack of engagement is only compounded by the limited number of attacks available.  Not only is the combat unengaging, it is extremely reptitive.The only thing that stops the game from being completely unplayable is that the AI is tuned to be moronic.  This may be incidental, as the enemies are also designed to be player characters.  Either way, they're adding nothing to the combat experience, other than cheap shots when you're facing the wrong direction.I want to like this game, it's got many creative notions and the presentation is fantastic, but it's just not fun to play.  I have my fingers crossed that the developers will continue to tweak it into a more engaging product, but my skepticism is high based on what I've experienced so far.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  The ability to play as all the characters you fought by capturing their souls was appealing, and I was thinking there would be many characters to unlock and many abilities to master.But 'unlocking' a character means capturing its soul and using the character at least once because you never get to start or customize any except for the 3 that you're allowed to start a dungeon with.  And then the captured soul character is basically just a damage sponge as you explore the abyss.That being said, the combat is decent.  Attacks flow into one another nicely and it's easy to get an intuitive sense of combat motion.  However movement during combat is extremely clunky due to you only being able to walk unless you have an ability that includes a running start.  And most enemies have good weapons reach so jumping is fairly pointless unless you're facing something on four legs that you can't just use dodge to avoid.The construction of the dungeons themselves are extremely linear which makes them rather boring.  They're never technically identical, but they're all basically the same.  Once you've finished your first run top to bottom of the abyss, there really isn't anything surprising that gets thrown at you.I enjoy rogue games generally, but this one just doesn't leave any rewards at the end of your trip and doesn't give you anything to work for.  You enter a room, kill 2 things, then explore the map until you run into another 2 things that need to be killed.  Do this for 15 minutes aaaand boss fight.  Repeat until you win. Then repeat the whole cycle until the monotony breaks the game for you.			"

Posted: July 17, 2014
												I'd like to break the game down for you in this review. I'm gonna talk about the combat mechanics, the visuals, and the various features that make it stand out as a platformer/fighting game. When reading about this game you see it compared to Super Smash Brothers, Dark Souls, ect. The truth is that with its combined features, Abyss Odyssey does not at all play like any of the games anyone is comparing it to. So, in an effort to give you a realistic perspective of what you can expect in this game, lets get started.The first thing to open up is the combat. The combat in Abyss Odyssey seems to be difficult for some people to grasp and understand without playing -and it is difficult. you have several moves at your disposal... Light attack - This is the basic one-two punch for most characters. a light attack can be performed stationary to perform a one-two combo, or while moving forward to deliver a leading blow. Light attacks can also be executed in the air, and you are able to direct them up, down, left, right, and neutral (no direction). Special attack - this attack behaves differently than the standard attack. while playing as a main character, you will unlock their special attacks over time. Each special attack behaves differently, and characters each have a completely unique moveset. Special attacks are performed by pressing the special attack button combined with up, down, left and right. Performing a neutral special attack will simply execute the left/right attack in the direction you are facing. Special attacks can be performed in air, and the only directions you can attack with them are the direction the animation sends you. (often a special attack is a lunge, dive, fireball, projectile, and will typically propel you in some direction, though every move is different.)Guard - Blocking works like you would expect. Holding the block will bring up a ""shield"" displayed as a circular Chilean art design, which will protect you form some ammount of damage before shattering. after shattering, it will be unusable for some time, and the decorative circle turns bright red for all to see. To parry one must simply block the attack ""at the right time"" there is no way to gauge this timing other than to learn it naturally by playing.Cancel points - this is really all there is left to talk about for the combat, and its the most important part! Cancel points allow you to chain your moves together to create unique combos. Unlike Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, you create the combos yourself -There is no premade list of garbled button controls to refer to. This said, cancel points were the hardest concept of Abyss Odyssey for me to learn however, once I did I became able to beat the game in about an hour.There are several different ways to cancel, but lets define cancel for this game first. A cancel is a method of ""move interuption,"" meaning you will be interupting your attacks before they finish...with either a special attack, or dodge. So read that last part again if you are totally confused by this. Here's an example of how this works:You perform a light attack, almost immediately after the attack, you can activate your up special attack, which will cause a brief flash of light to indicate you have used a cancel point, followed immediately by your up special attack. You can take this even farther, by activating a different special attack just after your last one, and chain them together. You can do this up to three times, and then it will require a cooldown. the cooldown is only in effect if you arent dodgeing or attacking for 0.5 seconds. You can also cancel with dodges. This allows for fluid attack patterns.Whew, now that all thats done lets go on to talk about the visual style and qualities of Abyss Odyssey. All of Abyss Odysseys undergound generated levels is themed after a vibrant jungle, a glacial cavern, a graveyard, fire, that sort of thing. they all look marvelous, and you'll always have something pretty to look at, whether its the detailed characters, (with maybe the exception of the wraith -has always looked like kind of a lazy character model/concept to me. Still my main though.) or the lush backgrounds.Now, I don't know too much about Chilean art style, or really what it attempts to model itself after, but I'll say this. The designs that show up in the game are clearly a labor of love. The sheer ammount of detail that comes along with this style is overwhelming -not to mention is something completely fresh. I mean, all of a sudden I'm learning about chilean folklore and all the weird, crazy monsters this world has to offer. It provides a new atmosphere for losing yourself in, and those that explore the Warlocks journal will be even further immersed in a well-written backstory of the warlocks life and the reason for the various monsters in the abyss. My favorite part about the story is that its unique. In a world where game narrative is becoming suprisingly boring and blurred together, its always welcome when someone provides a fresh story.Now I just wanna list some cool various features of this game and then go play it so...Unlockable characters - there are only 3 main characters, but the real fun is collecting all the monster souls. each character can transform into, and capture enemy souls enabling them to take their form, and moveset. The enemy souls are important because they have their own hp bar you can use to soak up damage before laying waste with your main character. to capture one, all you have to do is hit the enemy with your capture attack (a large blue orb that appears in front of you that does DoT) and then kill it. Your chance to capture the enemy monster goes up with your level.Hard - Look, I didn't say it much in the review because its a major selling point for the game, but I REALLY like the difficulty level of this game. It throws out the hand-holding, the tutorial levels, the handicaps, and just drops you in to the conflict. What some fail to realize is that its this lack of information when begining a game that creates the mystique of the continuity. The less we know going in, the more reason we have to keep playing to discover the world.2 player coop, 4 player battle - yep, this ones coming to a couch near you. You have the ability to unlock every character in the game (with the exception of spiders, fish, and other enviornment enemies.) Cons - There are some bugs here and there, and any major complaints about the design or mechanics of the game are likely to be met with ""we're just a small indie team."" But I hope we don't forget that these small teams are much more willing to break mainstream game design concepts. And speaking objectively, the AO team is really making the community part of the game. The entire concept of this game is based on the community working together to beat the Warlocks nightmare. I'm really excited to see how it turns out.Honestly, this game needs a demo like everyone else is saying. the combat is just not for everyone. It takes time to learn, but not much if you play videogames regularly. Thats the end!			"

												The first thing I took heed of was the developer’s nationality; ACE Team went and did the brave thing to actually utilize Chile’s history to set the context of our adventure. It’s 1890, hot dogs had just been proposed in the mid-west of North America, the term “World War” didn’t yet bore middle school students to death and Michael Bay hasn’t destroyed Transformers yet. It’s an age ripe for exploration and happiness! That is, until someone starts having bad dreams.So, in a twist to complicate the incipient Chilean civil war, ACE Team decides to literally drop a hole in the middle of a city street called the Abyss, where evil spirits and monsters spew from. Brave soldiers race to bottom, thinking to find the source of this disaster only to meet certain doom at the hands of the lurking monstrosities. In this time of dire need, a heroine appears, brandishing a beautiful rapier and with the determination to beat any foe. She assists the soldiers against their new enemy and is then promptly squished flat under falling debris.Then she comes back to life! She’s Katrien, an apparition of the Abyss on a seemingly endless struggle to end the evil curse by stopping the Warlock, a dark mage whose haunting nightmares are the reason this whole mess has happened. No, the story isn’t anything fancy or anything to dally on for a long time, but at least it’s simple to understand and sets your main goal as early as the tutorial. Abyss Odyssey counts with a procedurally generated dungeon which changes every time you die, although each “Area” basically consists of the same deal: sections are blocked off until you defeat baddies, boxes containing a bit of loot here and there, an altar where you may raise a check point and merchants and secret areas. With this kind of filling, all you have to look forwards to in each new Area is perhaps a change of scenery and a new soundtrack to match the landscape. The music is one of the things I simultaneously like and dislike about the game. It is good and composed with meaning to set the mood but sadly, the music is too low key in contrast to sound effects. Sometimes, like in the brimstone area, you can’t even hear it. Every bit of the dialogue in the game is spoken, giving the player authentic performance to fill in the narrative, so that adds to the charm.We’ll find ourselves side-scrolling in each Area, fighting with combos using a weapon of choice, facing enemies with finely crafted AI and a variety of different move-sets. This an important thing to note: Every enemy is allowed to pull off any tech you might, like double jumping, climbing, animation-canceling, blocking and parrying. In addition to this, every enemy counts with their own arsenal of abilities that can devastate you in the blink of an eye if you’re not paying attention. Another feature this game counts with is the monster capture ability. Filling your mana bar by using magical attacks  enables a powerful one-time attack that can be unleashed on enemies. In addition to its powerful damage output, this attack will paint monsters with a lower level than the character blue, and upon defeat these monsters will drop their souls. Soul items can transform into monsters at any time during the game, letting you play a different character as an extra gaming experience. This is a very useful yet limited gimmick that effectively gives you an “extra life” since the death of the monster avatar does not mean death for your character, you are instead transformed back to normal.Pulling off specific tasks such as defeating bosses in your journey will sometimes reward you with extra skills you can freely equip on your character, allowing players a certain degree of character customization. Leveling up not only increases HP and damage dealt and bolsters defense, this is hard to judge without seeing non-health and offensive stats, but existing skills are improved every three levels which adds a sense of progression. Transforming into creatures sometimes modifies stats depending on the enemy type. Items can be used by any character as long as they are equipped. Precious gold is gained through the descent in the Abyss and can be given to merchants in exchange for new equipment or checkpoint tokens.Only when reaching the bottom will we finally see what the fuss is all about. At the end of the Abyss is the Warlock responsible for the mess in Chile. Defeating him grants the same sense of closure as in any other rogue-like, so be prepared to go down the Abyss over and over and over again to fight him! Abyss Odyssey is a simple and enjoyable game. That is, if you have patience for its learning curve!			"

""You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream...All that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream."" - Edgar Allan PoeI'll start with a quick breakdown of the common gameplay paradigms found in Abyss Odyssey so you understand the basic structure from which the game's extraordinary dream poetry is built.  Furthermore, Steam tagging can obfuscate a game's nature as easily as it can enumerate it, so I generally find it helpful to reconcile the competing descriptions.""Battle is an orgy of disorder."" -George S. PattonAt its heart Abyss Odyssey is a brawler.  As in any other brawler the player moves through discrete play fields (""rooms"") attempting to beat the crap out of, well, everyone.  Control is simple to pick up though as you continue to play new vistas of subtleties and complexities to be mastered reveal themselves.  Again, like most other brawlers, the game is built to be played with a controller (in fact, a controller is so crucial to this game that it's a condition of my recommendation).  One button is basic attack, one button is special attack (also called ""light"" and ""heavy""), and there's jump and block and dodge etc etc- and then there are conditional controls for things like npc interaction.  The conformity with tradition makes combat feel intuitive and the controls are extremely tight and responsive.Then why, you ask, am I getting repeatedly slaughtered by crowds of ridiculously skilled and clever enemies, in what looks and feels like ""an orgy of disorder""?I have two things to say to that. First, in addition to being a brawler, AOd is a roguelite.  You will die repeatedly but take solace in the fact that your characters will keep their levels and gold (but not their items) for the next run. The rooms, enemies, loot, etc, are all proceduraly generated from a limited set of predetermined allowable variable combinations. So don't worry about the map too much. Besides, once you get your skills right, a run from start to final boss on normal only takes a few hours (and doesn't ""end"" the game).Second, what appears to be chaos is in fact highly refined technique moving very quickly.  You'll notice that pressing different directions and using different timing even just with your basic attacks will result in an enormous variety of moves.  Your enemies have just as many, and they know how to use them.  They are clever.  If you stand there blocking waiting for them to come to you they won't.  They will either try to get around behind your back and grapple you or they will wait for a comrade with a guard break move to arrive so they can all hack you to pieces as a team as soon as you are exposed. They also will not fall for the same combo more than once or twice, then if you try it again they'll find exploits. What often appears as chaos is actually your enemies coordinating their attacks for best effect. The maps are always different, the enemy combinations are always different...eventually you'll need to think on your toes and be creative about your brawl.In some ways it's comparable to a very very fast, 2D Dark Souls: every battle has the potential to be fatal. And once I started to get the patterns and the flow of the controls I had that same familiar Dark Souls feeling- that I lost because of human error, but it's in my ability to win.“I dream. Sometimes I think that's the only right thing to do.” - Haruki Murakami ""Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake up in the day to find it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible.” - T.E. LawrenceThe setting of AOd is a vaguely Brazilian early 19th century city under which a great...abyss...has opened.  Deep down at the very bottom of the pit a mysterious warlock conjures strange shifting realms filled with nightmare creatures.  In fact, it slowly becomes apparent that the abyss is indeed a figment of the warlock's dreams...and perhaps you are too. After all, how else do you explain the elusiveness of your own death?I call it a setting rather than a plot because evoking a fundamentally poetic context for the game is evidently far more important than providing a traditional storyline.  If you are looking for a coherent plot arc with a tidy bow, you'll have to look elsewhere.  But the poetry! The game drips on the one hand with the heady unease, even terror, of that moment before you're able to seperate the dream from the waking day.  And on the other hand, it oozes the narcotic stupor that always accompanies the most ornate dream-nonsense.The character design is a perfect fit for the setting- beautifully hand-drawn and styled after the posters and ads of the French Post-Impressionists of the 1890s (think Toulouse-Lautrec) but augmented with a far richer and deeper color palette.  The levels are lush and overwrought, depicting feelings and sensations more accurately than places and materials.I'll stop here before this becomes a master's thesis.  I hope it's clear by now that I have added this game to my list of games that offer very strong evidence for my assertion that video games are a legitimate and important literary medium.Highly recommended.  But this game is hard, and...eccentric.  A lot of the early criticism came from mistaken expectations about its paradigms.  But it's also really beautiful and poetic.  Most importantly, it's quality work that is both engaging and enjoyable.EDIT: I realized rewatching my video I should probably mention the enemy soul capturing mechanic.  There are 3 main playable characters (1 start, 2 unlock) but if your level is far enough above theirs you can capture the soul of any enemy in the game. Once you've captured a particular creature that soul will occasionally appear for sale at shops. At any time you can only hold one soul, but you can take its form at will.  The soul-form has its own lifebar and the soul is yours until you drop it or its life is fully depleted.  If your main character dies, besotted soldiers will give their lives in an attempt to reach an altar and revive you.  So in most cases you effectively have three life bars to go through before game over.

												If you decide to play this game you should know that It's hard; for me at least maybe co-op is more fun. The fighting system needs a lot of practice to master the controls and combos. Additionally everything is random.. foes, level difficulty, even the story progression has no order. Levels are like rooms within rooms which if your main character dies then you can control an 'officer' 'till you go to an altar and 'resurrect' the main char if you fail then you start from the beginning. There are no auto-checkpoints and none of your items are kept after death except gold, char level and skills. Luckily you can farm gold and health/mana potions easy. *mana is used to capture a foe and use him/her in battle*Despite all that It has:+ Dark atmosphere  + Not bad story+ Nice graphics + Good soundtrack + Surreal foes ~well designed+ 3 characters to choose (must unlock the other 2 first)+ Every enemy is playable if you capture him (mana)+ There is a dude you pay *100g* to tell you a nice quote!cons:- Checkpoints require 'camp token' which you buy from shops (high-priced)- Stuff you buy from shops are also gone if you die- Bad loot (weapons mostly)- Lack of a tutorial - 1 skill every 3 levelsVerdict... better buy on sale;)			"

												This somewhat procedurally generated somewhat rogue-like game is beautiful both visually and aurally.  Unfortunately, the stiff ""Smash Brothers"" style control scheme introduces the same issues that made Subspace Emmisary and Smash Run unpleasant to play. Character movement is so muddy and thick with animation delays and lag that it's very easy to be stun-locked, unable to do anything, while enemies juggle your useless body. Watch someone play the game to appreciate its art. I can't recommend playing it if you easily become frustrated by control issues.			"

												This game is a lot better than many reviews here give it credit for. Yes the controls are a little odd, but it's part of the challenge of the game.Go through a randomly generated dungeon with 3 different characters and kill the warlock. Kind of a rogue-like with smash brothers style combat (standard and special attacks, combos).Replayability is good until you can consistently kill the Warlock, and then it kind of falls off. Still good for 15-20 hours of gameplay, and to revisit every once in a while.			"

												This is another weird little game by the masters of this category, the Chilean ACE Studios. Games are usually exciting and fun, yet they are seldom beautiful - this game is. It looks, sounds, plays and FEELS like a fever dream of the good kind. One you might have had as a child after drinking too much codeine-based cough syrup, say. The mechanics tent to be somewhat obtuse, thus enhancing this impresssion, but there are some great community guides on Steam, so you really shouldn't worry about it. The controls are tricky at first, but when you get used to their quirks (you REALLY need to time 180° turns of your character), ""Abyss Odyssey"" becomes a real barn-burner. So, dear reader, if you're one of the girls or guys who like to yammer about the lack of truly original ""out there"" games that will give your brain a proper kick in the bum and have you dreaming about them, fret no more: This is your game.

												Abyss Odyssey is often misunderstood.  I would best categorize it as an adventure/platformer/roguelite, but there is nuance which cannot be conveyed by those genres alone.If you like a game with mystery, challenge, and a weird hybrid of fighting game (a la Street Fighter) and platforming beat-em-up, Abyss Odyssey may be in your lane.Let's start with the art direction and soundtrack, both of which are phenomenal.  There is also a metagame, by which the ways other people play the game as a whole influence the difficulty and types of enemies you may encounter as bosses.  I don't completely understand how it works, but it is interesting to know.The controls, for me at least, are fine.  When you consider them to be closer to a fighting game than something which requires immense precision like Metroid or Ori and the Blind Forest, they seem properly tuned.  Many complain about this, but I think it is alright once your expectations are set, rather than expecting a tight platformer and getting something ""sluggish"".Replayability is high, as that is a main draw for this game.  It took me a few plays to get to the final boss, but now I'm downing the Warlock regularly, and I still don't feel like I'm finished with it.Of course, this is best played with a friend (local or over the internet) so grab a 2-pack and game it up.

												Abyss Odyssey has a skeleton wearing a hat that plays guitar and sells you experience points in the form of sage advice. There are unlockable characters, you can play as the monsters once you capture them, there are a ton of different items, bosses, and areas, and every fight feels like it's from a fighting game. If you like Dark Souls or roguelikes (roguelites?) then Abyss Odyssey will intrigue you. I haven't poked around all of its secrets yet, but I've had a blast so far and will keep going. While it's not as weird as Zeno Clash, it definitely has the same charm with a unique setting and interesting visuals and music. It rules that Atlus keeps putting out these weird♥♥♥♥♥PC games on Steam.			"

												EDIT 1: (adding TL;DR.)[TL;DR: ]-Game is beautiful but has some terrible dissonace in visuals and a little bit in music. -Gameplay is mostly Artificial difficulty. (Explained in review and comments).-Closest comparison: Rogue Legacy is way better.[/tl;dr ]I was super hyped for this game, i hyped myself with the idea of a beautiful platform figher procedurally generated.That was until i finally got it and regret.For easier reading i will try to put this in bullet points:-Enemies sometimes attack instantly without any kind of telegraph, your health chip down slowly every enemy you fight.-Enemies also defend attacks instantly, the grab move to break defenses requires proximity but impossible to execute because AI is frantic and react instantly.-Making my best combat strategy was EXPLOITING AI on ledges and walls. They cannot execute more than one action sometimes when climbing ledges, and walls prevent knockback so i can attack and stunlock most enemies besides the big ones that are immune to staggering.-One of the things i most hate on all games is animation locking, every action you start you are locked until it finishes.-The music, sometimes i hear 2 or 3 musics at the same time, so i stopped to analise and 1 of 3 was actually the skeleton guitar dude. the other 2 was actually only one music, good music but sounds like there are someone completely lost on the music background.-Double jump sucks, the crazy spinning animation is just odd, also misleading, when i double jump and see the whole character above the platform i think i made it but actually the hitbox did not, the then i fall back down.-When collecting gold from breaking jars a big load of coins explode from them, but actually just a few coins are collectable, most of it are just particles, this is nitpicking but is a little disorienting and freaking annoying.-When i die the ""lost items but keeping gold system"" is bad, this basically makes the player to grind for gold, the buy equipment all at once like ""this run is all in"". -I didn't played enough but seems that level is also kept between lives, same problem, grind for exp.This last part can be easily compared to Rogue Legacy. Actually this whole game can be compared to Rogue Legacy. But the thing is that Rogue Legacy is way better than Abyss Odyssey.The game is good and beautiful, but negative points are multiplicative for me, individual points weren't too bad but them all together just made me rage.

												An amazing game with high replayability. It feels very much rogue like, with a simi-perma death. Upgrades can be kept each life (Like your level/HP/skill tree and Gold) however you may not keep your weapons, souls gotten from enemies and keys for unlocking chests and doors. Luckily there is quite a few ways to get all of these items as well as shops around each stage for you to buy these along with HP vials and Camp Tokens. Camp Tokens allow you to come back to the spot you've placed it if you were to die. Very good for newer players wanting to save their progress. However, I found myself never using them.The art style is pleasing to the eyes and pulls you in at times. Aside from the ""cut scenes"" being sometimes choppy and somewhat a downgrade to the standard gameplay look, it's passable. This game has a very fun style to it and it actually allows for two player co-op, KB&M with a controller or a mixture of the two; however I found that online co-op was really slow, quite buggy and not a whole lot of worth in it. I've connected to people close by and hosted myself yet it doesn't seem like it helped any. There is online PVP as well, which still has a bit of lag and buggy in nature. It's still quite fun regardless of the prior said.The story was not interesting at all really, however that didn't stop my enjoyment. I felt as if the voice acting was mediocre at best, not trying to complain too hard, as yet again; the gameplay sells it completely. Overall I have enjoyed this game and I would say it's worth a buy, bonus if you can snag it on sale.			"

So I finally got my hands on this roguelike dungeon crawler after a year of having it in my wishlist and I have to say I was not dissappointed. The story, the controls, the art, the music all so unique and beautiful and pretty challenging too, so lets see.Pros:Beautiful and colorful asthetic. Nice musicResposive controls Versus modeInteresting storyEvery enemy is playableCons:Awful tutorialCo-op riddled with bugs and a shared cameraEnemy design could be betterKeep in mind: Really challenging.Platforming elements So lets start with the good why don't we. This game looks beautiful, it absolutely does. It's colorful, pleasant to look at and the animations are nothing short of great. You won't get tired of listening to the music either. Although the design of the enemies is not the best There isn't much else to really say about itThe story is really interesting, it seems like it is a twist on a story from the 1890's but I wouldn't know. For me it was really unique and the presentation of the whole thing is one of the things that kept me really interested although it had a rather abrupt ending that leaves little to no closure but aside from that the game being roguelike, the respawns, the monsters and pretty much everything is explained by the nature of the story. They all mix together rather nicely. There's some decent voice acting as well. Don't expect anything great from the soldiers but what little lines the other characters have are nice. The combat... Here is what a lot of people have a problem with. I personally think it's because they go into the game expecting something else. The game includes 3 characters, 2 of which are unlockable. One fast character, one slow heavy hitter and one with a crazy reach. You can have up to 3 specials with each character and there are 5 in total for each one.  You can bind each special to whichever direction you want, front, up or down(that's how the normal attacks work as well).The combat system is based around cancels. Canceling your current move / animation to do a fast combo, canceling from normal to special to dodge etc. You can have up to 3 cancel points which act like stamina. There's also a block and grab button, the grab ignores the enemy block. You can upgrade specials with up to 3 different traits. One for defence, extra damage and mana regeneration. When the mana bar is full you can do a seal attack and the enemies you hit will be marked. If you defeat them in time and if you are on the same level as them you can capture them and turn into them. Here is where the game shines the most for me. Each and every enemy you encounter, bosses included, is playable each with their own skillset. It's amazing and there's a decent enemy variety. I personally love all of it. The mechanics are robust and the controls are responsive. The AI. So when you first play this game you will get your butt kicked in and you will be so frustrated you will want to punch a hole through your monitor. Fear not, it does get better, although you will have to read a couple of guides. This should never be the case but the tutorial and in-game guide are not good at all. There IS a trainning mode where you can experiment at your own pace though. So anyway the AI will seem really unfair at first. It will seem like they are reacting based on what button you just pressed but it really is just AI done right. With time you will get better and you will feel good about overpowering it. Some people though give up from the first hour and write a negative review on steam :lol: The platforming. There's a certain degree of challenge to be found in the platforming elements as well. Lots of traps which you can use in your advantage in fights as well. The procedural generation is done really well. With most dead ends leading to trasure / check points and sometimes secret ""doors"". So the actual bad of the game which is not a lot but is important. The multiplayer. Now there are 2 modes. The coop and the fighting mode which acts as a regural fighting game with each person having 2 characters. That mode works as intended for the most part but the coop is buggy as hell. If you actually manage to get through the connection lost errors you will encounter the following: Your character level resetting to lvl 1. Don't worry it's only for the game session (not working as intended)Knocked down and not being able to get up. A looooot of lag. SHARED CAMERA. IT'S GREAT WHEN YOU FALL IN A PIT AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE YOU ARE (working as intended) At least there's local coop as well... Plug in a second controller and play with a friend of yours. Also the game comes with it's fair share of crashes. Mainly when you alt tab and tab back in but it's not a big deal. All in all this game is great aside from the coop mode. Which will turn a lot of people away. Worth full price if you don't mind the multiplayer and definitly on a sale. Usually drops around to ~3$. "

												With all the updates, I think that this game is a well-balanced 2D dungeon crawler, with a fairly robust, if at times a little flawed combat system. It is a fairly short game to beat; you'll probably be able to beat it in 5-12 hours depending on your skill, but it has a lot of replay value, thanks to the very compelling combat system, and the polish and brooding, odd atmosphere and lore are compelling enough to make me want to replay this game often. If there are any flaws to point out, it's how the enemy and boss design can be a bit lacking sometimes. I think that the final boss's arena is too small for it to be entirely fair, and that some of the other bosses can seemingly devolve into grab and dodge for inexperienced players over and over, and some attacks need hyper armour, but up until you master the fairly deep combat system ), you won't notice that anyways. This is a game where I'm willing to acknowledge its flaws, and be okay with them, because the game as a whole is so great. An atmospheric, minimalistic 2D dungeon crawler with a deep, robust and rewarding combat system, amazing real-world and folklore inspiration and a great backstory behind everything which I won't spoil; but if you like the sad backstories behind games like Dark Souls and Majora's Mask, you'll love this game's lore.Highly reccommended.EDIT: Also the versus mode is actually amazing and shows off how good the combat system is. If you own this game, please play it. It's actually so much fun.			"

I like the artwork its beautiful, I like the enemy capture system and the character classes seem neat but until something changes with the controls and movement I won't be touching this again.			"

												Beautiful, innovative and filled with fresh ideas, Abyss Odyssey is an incredible game made by an indie team from Chile. With a gameplay that mixes roguelikes with Castlevania, and completely unique visuals, Abyss Odyssey tells us a fantastic story while teaching us about Chilean folklore. It's a fascinating experience, visual, audio and game-wise, and one of the most underrated indie games of 2014 -  a shining jewel floating amidst a sea of lookalike, boring pixel-art indies.

												From Ace teams the creators of zenoclash comes a Very interesting game with fighting game mechanic combined with aesthetically pleasing arts and music. The game combat feels just a bit clunky sometimes and the hitbox a bit off at times and looking past that, the Abyss Odyssey has something to offer for those who wants some 2d/3d platforming rpg game with rogue-like elements with co-op included.The game starts you off playing as one of the 3 main characters (Ghost monk is my favorite). Wielding a sabre Katrien who is part of a warlocks dream is who you'll start your game off with, your goal is to reach the heart of the abyss and defeat him. You'll encounter mostly blue soldiers npcs, sellers that you can pick a fight with, and singing skeletons along your way some of the wierd and unique npcs you'll meet with fully voiced and well done dialogues. You'll be able to explore and Collect money,potions, weapons and keys to access certain chests. There are tons of content to unlock and secrets to discover while traveling down the abyssIf you die in the game a soldier will take over your place where you'll have to find the ressurection altar before you really die and lose all your items causing you to restart the abyss. The abyss is an ever changing dungeon with random difficulties so each time you play or enter the dungeon it is always changing bringing the rogue-like element to the table.The gameplay itself offers some interesting fighting game mechanic from double jumping, 2 hit combos, ground recovery, special cancels into combos, blocks, dodge, and parries. The game also has an rpg system in place so that you can modify your weapons and items you have on your character, you'll also be able to customize your moves the way you want and even add enhancement to them when you acquire skill points enabaling more damage. There is also a capture system in place where you can capture your enemies and use thier powers becoming the enemies itself. Each of the enemy type themselves offers completely different move sets and abilities that will aid you, along with thier strength and weaknesses. While the game is very interesting and unique the controls of the character itself felt very wonky, I didn't like the initial keyboard set up so I ended up plugging in my controller, It is possible to play with Keyboard and mouse but the game feels much better on a controller perhaps preference here. Either way the character movements in the game felt clunky at times and the enemies look like they are much smoother than me. The hitboxes seems to be off at times because I remember hitting enemies at certain times and having them walk past my hits easily hopefully these issues can be fixable.The coop itself is a pretty cool idea because it lets you play along with a friend, there isn't an online arena and the only thing that bugged me from playing coop is the FRIENDLY FIRE, which someone can easily join your game just to troll you out ruining your gameplay if you leave your game public. + The game is challenging depending on the path you take, quite brutal at certain areas. Choose Carefully+ 3 main characters, over 30 enemies you can capture or buy to become each with thier very own combat elements.+ Interesting mix of gameplay, fighting game mechanic with most of those elements combined into a 2d action platformer+ Rogue-like dungeons, it's always changing+ The music is good and fits each area really well+ Voice overs for ever character adds immersion+ Beautiful art and backdrops+ Rpg elements will keep you optimizing your gear+ Mix and match combos + skill system- Controls felt kinda wonky, moving the character just did not feel very smooth-hitboxes are off at time.- Combining combos are fun when ya get them, but the initial combos itself isn't too interesting, sub par at best and felt that way.- Friendly fire during coop is dumb, the first person who came in started attacking me so I ended up attacking him back until he was dead. It should be a choice- VS MODE IS LAN ONLY, WHY ISNT THIS MODE ONLINE!?  =(   "

												I'm mostly writing this to counter the negative reviews this is getting, which are very undeserved to me.I'm not going to say too much about the aesthetics of this game, as it becomes clear with a single visit to this game's screenshot hub that they're brilliant. I love the character designs and level backgrounds so much. The soul capture mechanic is great as well, as you can literally capture the soul of any enemy in the game - as long as your level is high enough - and assume control over them, giving you an entirely different move set as well as an extra life, since your character doesn't die when the controlled creature dies. The roguelike elements in this aren't too strong because you keep your level and the gold you collected upon death, but the stages and loot are randomly generated.What I do want to elaborate on, are the controls and combat. Most of the negative reviews mention solely that the combat is broken and the controls are bad, which to me really isn't the case. This will probably sound elitist, but I feel like anyone saying the combat is broken and cheap just hasn't gotten good enough at it, doesn't want to get good enough at it or has never played fighting games a lot. The combat just takes practice and getting used to, and I personally really like this combat and its learning curve. This game takes a lot of inspiration from the combat of Super Smash Bros., one of the most beloved fighting game franchises which also harbors a learning curve. How can people adore Smash but hate on this game's combat, when they're identical in quite some ways? It even has i-frame upgrades on specific attacks which can be used very tactfully and there is also a button to cancel your move/combo, which is one of the most important mechanics to master to do well in this game. Most of the negative comments on the combat and controls do come from people who have played the game for around one hour, maybe two tops. So that just makes my first points that much more valid.I definitely also don't agree with people saying that button mashing is rewarded or that memorizing one or two overpowered combos will get you through the game, because I find myself playing very differently against different enemies. A specific powerful combo against one enemy could be horrible against another depending on what attacks they have and how quickly they can interrupt you and such, because they WILL take advantage of any openings in your attacks. Learning your enemy's attacks is probably even more important than learning your own attacks, just like in any decent fighting game.This game definitely deserves a chance if you are up for taking your time to learn the game and not jumping in and complaining about it being bad, when it really is you not wanting to learn the mechanics.

												Once you get used to the controls, you'll die less and then the game gets interesting. One thing i recommend changing is the physics of the Soldier character, often times it'll be difficult to navigate around the level because it's hard for him to get up high enough to get over a ledge; which is a problem since when you die he is the one you control to revive yourself, but if he cant get around to revive you it can be frustrating.Overall I recommend it, because what it does well, it does great			"

												good game. good graphic, nice enemy movement i.e. enemies move like if they are being controlled by real player. But, the control is too laggy for pc player, simple moves must be made be pressing many different keys and the moves are not clean enough, i.e. leaving too much gaps for emeny attacks especially if you play ghost monk and surrounded by 3 mobs like the peacock or jackel. the skills of each charater are also slightly unbalanced. on the 3rd charater i rarely use the special attack since it is too slow and merely disrupt enemy attack.but still, this game resembles an old school 8 bit game so anyone looking for a challenging should try it.

												Looks like a great game, cool style and theme. Unfortunately, the controls were unplayable for me. There's some sort of weird issue with the keyboard and mouse controls for the game that make jumping really difficult in the game. Pretty consistently I wasn't able to do a forward jump in the game unless I was already moving at full tilt. I could understand if this was some sort of intentional design, but this made it impossible for me to advance through the game once I was a couple levels in. I tried in vain for 5 minutes to double jump and grab a ledge that was mandatory to proceed through the level and wasn't able to do it.Unfortunately, this was a gamebreaker for me and rendered the game unplayable.I've tried using a gamepad with the game, to see if the controls worked better there, but I and many other people were having issues with our 3rd party controllers for the game. So, I tried to play off of keyboard and mouse, and hit the problem above.What little I played seemed like a great game, but unfortunately, I'm done with it, and I can't recommend you buy it either. Sad times.			"

												This is a pretty challenging procedurally generated platformer/fighting/rogue-like/metroidvania game.  It's got a pretty amazing art style, with a good amount of enemy and boss variety.  You start out with one character in the campaign, and can earn two more for campaign mode.  Some say it is too easy, personally I disagree though part of that could be that I use a keyboard and mouse and they have a controller.  They recently added a higher difficulty level however (along with online co-op and other features), so that shouldn't be much of a problem now.    This game has two particularly unique things going for it.  The first is that you can capture your enemies souls (even bosses) and that will make them playable both in the Training Room and in Versus.  The second thing, is that over time you can earn new special skills and choose which ones you like (three on a character at once), as well as upgrade them with various bonuses.The story is kinda cool too, with influence from Chilean mythology and also being set in Chile.  I should also note that they have continually updated the game as the community progresses together to ""break the seals"" by defeating the end boss.  Definitely worth playing.""And I am vengeance, here to strip your power away."" -Ghost Monk			"

												Honestly I was excited for this game based on the trailers I saw for it when it was coming out, and even pre-ordered it, as I usually trust Atlus made or published games. I have to say though, I'm disappointed. For what appears to be a 2D beat-em-up, the combat is extremely slow. There are only a few combos, and the delay after each is frustratingly long. I will say that the art style is very unique, the music is great, and I appreciate some of the rogue-like aspects of this game, but the combat, being the core mechanic, just feels way too slow for me to properly enjoy it.It's not just that it's slow, mind you. There can be slow paced gameplay that's done really well, but enemies tend to take a while to kill, and sometimes feel like they can easily get more hits in than I can to them, or that there are just too many of them for only being able to attack as much as I can. In addition, I don't feel very mobile while I'm playing this. I don't expect to be speeding through this game, but games like Rogue Legacy or Ascendant, similar 2D roguelikes, make me feel much faster and make the game more bearable in comparison.  There are hardly any mobile attacks either, leaving you standing in place for most attacks. In the end, as much as my character is supposed to be some type of experienced swordswoman, I just don't feel like I am while playing as her. If you're used to either of the two games mentioned before, or even something like Super Smash Bros., you will likely be disappointed with the combat system.If you're not convinced, I implore you to at least look at the videos, and I mean really look at them (the first few moments of the second video show it pretty well). If you don't care about the combat (there is quite a bit), then by all means get it for the art, music, and rogue-like elements. But if you really want a roguelike with a fun combat system, I suggest looking elsewhere.			"

												Got this game today on a sale in hope to enjoy co-op with my bro. After about 4 hours of singleplayer and co-op gameplay decided to wright a review as the game itself is really controversial.Let me start with some sad moments. After first 15 minutes of the gameplay I regretted the money spent on this game...-There were no any training or introduction in the start so I had to check the controls, combos, etc. and to find out how everything works in this game using that training mode with a dummy (probably it is this way only for PC version as on youtube I have seen a prologue as a training mission on xbox).-The control in this game appeared to be not very smooth for a 2d platformer as I've expected. Sometimes it just drives me up a wall, expecially jumps and character rotation. -I've tried to play with gamepad and keybord and unfortunately I liked the latter more, as for my gamepad not all the functions were available (like skills upgrade, just can't understand which button should I push to get the sub menu).-I've tried co-op with my bro and found out that co-op is pretty buggy here. Sometimes characters just stuck and do not react to anything, for example after resurection on the altar.That is all bad sides so far, maybe just IMHO, but still. I think more will be revealed later.But now when I have already looked closer into the game I'd like to say that the game is not bad, I even liked it.-First of all it looks just wonderful to me, I mean graph and art, atmosphere-It is not quite easy (especially taking into account control issues)-Co-op is still fun with its friendly fire enabled-Decent musicI would like to add that the deeper you get into the game the more positive sides appear. It is not a typical 2d platformer where you can win by hitting 1-2 buttons and you may gladly spend several hours in the game mastering your skill. But ptobably after those several hours most people will get bored as the gameplay is not diverse. Anyway I will recommend to try this game to anyone who enjoys platformer/fighting/dungeon-crowler sort of games. Expecially now with a 50% discount)) p.s. still I personally wouldn't pay full price for it so god save steam sales xD			"

Abyss Odyssey is a beautiful, rewarding and highly replayable 2D action adventure.The game looks phenomenal.  I can honestly not think of a better looking 2D side scroller.  The backgrounds are bright and beautifully detailed.  The characters are large, colorful and well animated.  There is some floatiness and screen tearing, but nothing that detracted from the gameplay.Combat is deep and engaging and of a higher complexity than similar games in the genre.  The player will not get far by simply charging through and mashing the same attack.  One must vary attacks, defend and utilize level changes to effectively negotiate an adversary.  The parallels others have drawn between the combat in Abyss Odyssey and fighting games are warranted.The replayability of this game is high.  The levels and layouts of enemies and treasure are randomly generated each play through.  You can unlock and play as multiple characters and even capture and play as the game’s enemies.  The dying and extra lives mechanic is quite unique and adds to the overall creativity.Abyss Odyssey has its own style, which was appreciated. The story unfolds succintly and is of interest without being too laborious or text heavy.  I like to play games and not read or watch them.The game is initially challenging, but some progress is persistent as character levels, starting areas, learned creatures and gathered, unspent gold carry over between plays.  I had some quick runs before I improved my play and gradually became stronger.Overall I really enjoyed this game and will continue to come back to it due to its replayability.  I am baffled by the mixed and negative reviews and encourage anyone looking for the high points I laid out to play this game.			"

												Game Score: 6/10Abyss Odyssey allows you to choose one of three characters (once unlocked) to battle monsters as a you delve deaper into the abyss. Once at the bottom, you battle a creature dreamed up by The Warlock... And then the game repeats. This game took me about 3 hours to beat, and then I palyed a while longer just to unlock the other characters and level up a bit more, but there really wasn't any reason for me to do so. This game was ok, but I feel like they could have done a lot more with it. Maybe include extra bosses or varied final ""nightmare"" bosses. After two or three runs through the dungeon it all feels the same. The only real tactic is to save up enough money to buy camp tokens and potions, then just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up.Pros:- Character selection- Collect and transform into enemy creatures- RPG elements- Gorgeous artwork (except the final screen... seriously, WTF?)Cons:- Sluggish controls- Having to grab on an edge while jumping is a terrible- Limited number of enemiesAbyss Odyssey is more fun with a friend, but if you can get it on sale, I'd say it's worth a play.

												Fighting seems very slow, like playing Smash Brothers Brawl, then trying to play the oringal N64 game again.  It's very cumbersome and finicky, and too many enemies move faster than your character.  It is also difficult to understand whether or not you are actually progressing toward unlocking the other two classes as you start restricted to one.Even without the curse debuff, I felt that my character was covered in molasses and could not act as quickly as many of the mobs, and when surrounded my 3 quicker mobs, I was quickly outgunned and simply died regardless of my health.For reference, I played up to level 15 before losing interest in this game.  While pretty and audibly pleasing, the gameplay lacks direction and polish.			"

Musics are Good but nothing that remarkable  (at least for me) Last, there isn't much that keep you play long, nor collectables, nor much things to unlock, nor that much of rare weapons...

												Abyss Odyssey exists at this weird crossroads between art nouveau stylings, Smash Bros mechanics, and roguelike design. It's a potent mix that you never fully get used to, one of those rare indie games that feels incredibly indie no matter how long you play it. Perhaps even more remarkable is the way these elements harmonize to form something not just unique, but entertaining as well.It's the close of the 19th century and something nasty is happening under the streets of Santiago, Chile. You get dumped into the world as the absolutely drop-dead gorgeous Katrien, a hardy swordswoman who is refreshingly up-front about her mysterious origins. There's a warlock slumbering deep beneath the surface, and his nightmares are becoming reality. To put a stop to it, you descend through a randomly-generated network of caves, collect gold, weapons, and items, and defeat a bizarre host of monsters on your way to end the warlock once and for all.The way this plays out is in a long series of short levels that are light on platforming and heavy on beat-em-upping. Comparisons to Smash Bros are not lazy, because this game uses the same facing systems, same jump mechanics, and it even has a sort of Smash button for special moves. If you ever played the story mode in SSB Brawl, this will feel very familiar. Monsters range from jaunty skeletons to deer people to flying regalia, and the bosses that you sometimes run across are some of the most unique I've ever seen. There's also a really cool capture system where you can claim an enemy's soul to use as a second character, making the wide variety of creative foes even more appealing.My only real knock against this game is the uneven difficulty curve... or maybe it's actually the learning curve. The first few times I played, I couldn't make it more than a few floors. Then one night I had some kind of breakthrough, and I haven't died since. One irritation is what happens when you die, because you get replaced with a weak, clunky soldier and you can't get Katrien back unless you find a special shrine that only appears once every few floors. Floors can be rated easy, medium, or hard, which has a dramatic effect on how aggressive enemies will be. However, the AI can get confused pretty easily, slipping between countering every move and standing there to get wailed on. You'll need to stick with it awhile to really get into the flow, but there's a surprising amount of secrets and special floors to discover along the way.I don't need to tell you how good this game looks, because just look at it. The art style sets the whole thing off, working perfectly with the late 19th century setting and the dreamworld motifs. There are two additional characters to unlock, additional special moves to upgrade, and a colorful cast of NPCs to learn about. Once you learn the rhythm of the game and learn where to spend your gold, you'll have plenty of fun venturing into the abyss again and again.			"

YouTube™ Video: Abyss Odyssey: Impressions 

			Views: 727		

			Abyss Odyssey: Impressions Abyss Odyssey is one of the deepest and mechanically sound action platformers with rogue-like elements that I've played.		

Abyss Odyssey blends multiple genres to create some thing very unique. If I was to sum the game up I would call it ""Super DarkSoulsVania 2 Turbo"". It blends rpg, action platforming, and fighting game sensibilities. The fighting mechanics are deep with a lot of elements for the player to master. Abyss Odyssey is actually quite a challenging game that demands precision mastery of your attacks, as well as your platforming skills. The game also features many unique mechanics that really helps separate this game from the heard. On death, you get a 2nd chance by having a normal, human solder to take your place. He's basically a nerfed version of other playable characters, but if you manage to reach an alter with him, you can resurrect your hero and continue your journey. If your solder dies, that's game over, the game state is reset to the beginning. You can also capture enemy souls and become them, allowing you to play as a huge number of creatures, all with their own move sets, all with their own combat style. This game is incredibly diverse. Lastly, one of the most interesting features that makes this game so unique is the ability to work with all your fellow source hunters who are playing this game to unlock new things in Abyss Odyssey. Every time some one kills the end boss while online, they contribute to the destruction of the stone mask in the game. Once the mask is destroyed, whole new elements of this game become unlocked. This is a brilliant idea that helps with replayabilityThrow in some local and online multiplayer, add some classic Mucha inspired art nouveau, with a pinch of punishment, and we have one of the most unique, and gorgeous action platformer that has ever graced gaming culture.9001% recommended.Pros:- Gorgeous Mucha inspired art nouveau visual style- Great sound track- Incredibly deep mechanics- Diverse rogue gallery of playable creatures- Unique blend of rpg, action platforming, and fighting game sensibilities- Challenging but fair- Very replayableCons:- Large learning curb- Can feel sluggish at first- Some animation quirks- Could pose frustrating for some			"

												Controls are important in a game like this, and they feel blocky. Every single time I try playing this game I think to myself, ""Maybe this time i'll get the combo system down"" and I spend a few minutes failing to get past a 3-hit-combo with any character I have and then i'll play the game. The fighting system is just SO BAD in this game that I can't tell anyone to stay away from it enough. When playing a side-scroller fighting rogue-like RPG the player shouldn't feel like the character itself is fighting against them. I've seen and tried to replicate some of the combos i've seen on youtube and failed every time. I have also encountered my fair share of bugs where enemies will get stuck in walls (especially if you get a premature attack on them in that shadow wall that surrounds you whenever an enemy pops out) and there was even a time where a tutorial message kept me from jumping away from a swinging blade and being repeatedly knocked into a black abyss... This game looks nice and has a load of fun ideas, but the poor execution of the combat system is just too much for me to recommend this game to anyone. I'll continue to try to play it. Maybe mastering the combo/cancle system is the key to making this game fun and if it is i may change my tone of the game, but at the moment it is just a really pretty game that sucks at the whole ""gameplay"" thing.

												Like many others have already said, the controls are way off. It's not that they are ""too heavy"", but rather that they feel unpredictable. When I move my character, I don't feel like I have full control or at the very least can expect where my actions will take me. The UI is a bit of a buzz-kill. It's lacking the necessary information to help me understand what I'm doing. I ended up getting the ""special cancel"" ability (whatever that is) by mistake as I was interested in what it did. Nope. Turns out I wasted a skill point on it and still didn't figure out what it, or the other special abilities I received, actually did.Ultimately what got me to stop playing was when I died as Katreina and revived as a soldier, I was stuck in a pit. The controls for each character differ and the jumping for the solider is much shorter. Because of this, I couldn't jump up over a ledge (which did not at all seem intentional). Sorry, but I can't recommend a game that just doesn't feel complete. :-(			"

												I am honestly unable to understand the mixed reception of this game.Reading through some of the reviews I see many people complaining about ""difficult controls"" or ""bad gameplay"" which to my mind feel very unjustified because all gameplay elements are very thought through and serve a purpose.If you actually take your time to look at the control scheme and how to play, you will realise that most negative reviews are just people who didn't spent a single minute of their time to even learn the basics not to mention the actual depth of this game.You are able to:✘ cancel attacks into special attacks, dodges, dodge-jumps, allowing for large combo strings✘ short hop, fast fall and utilise the momentum of your airdodges, similiar to wavedashing in Super Smash Bros Melee✘ switch characters mid-combo for further stringsIt is true that you are unable to change directions mid-combo, but this just adds to the experience of having to make a commitment when attacking an enemy.Given the fact that there is no collision detection for enemy or player models and and the actually viable AI of most opponents, like in many fighting games, positioning is very important and knowing when to attack and when not.The missing collision detection also makes escaping easier when outnumbered or stuck in a tight spot, which you definately will be at times since enemies have their own unique moveset and never feel trivial (except slugs and spiders maybe).As a huge Souls fan and supporter of the fighting game community i definitely recommend this unique piece of art.

												This game could not have been any more of a pleasure. I must admit that when I decided to purchase the game, there was a little bit of worry coming alongside my purchase, but once I began playing, all my worries were gone. Abyss Odyssey is a game perfect for anyone seeking a challenge. After playing the game for a while I began to try to dig into the combat system to just be impressed over and over again with how interesting it is.The combat in this game has a similar feel to it as Smash Bros. Abyss Odyssey is not as loose at Smash, but the way you move and attack are similar. As you progress down deeper and fight you will level up your character and find alternate attacks you can equip to expand on your potential. Depending on what kind of skills you equip, you'll expand your combo potential and/or give yourself benifits such as more ranged attacks.I feel the need to stress that if you're not interested in games that will push you and challenge you, this game is not for you. If you want a game that will reward you with feeling like you really accomplished something worthwhile, then you need this game in your library.I don't like to rate games on a number scale because I don't believe that can be accurate, so I would rather inform you on what the game has to offer instead of trying to sell you on buying it regardless of your type of game. The player type I would recommend this game to is one who desires a difficult game with high reward in term of accomplishment. A player who is more into disecting a game to play it at its fullest potential will enjoy this game. A player who is interested in jumping in and just fighting without interest in mastery of the game will not get as much out of the game.			"

												Gameplay is bad. Character takes 2hours to take a swing and gets locked in an action for 3hours. Then you get chain stuned, jumping is horrible, maneuvrability is bad, game feels unresponsive and clunky.Just make the game react to key presses goddamit, i don't want to face the wrong way because ""running"" cancels ""switching direction"" for 2 seconds everytime and arrow + attack doesnt change direction + attack. would not buy again.

												Might still play again once or twice. Really enjoyed all of the Smash Brothers games(played them for an uncountable number of hours, way over 20k matches across all the games). But the combat in this game is not as smooth or balanced and the AI has an instant reaction time. The actual dungeon isn't even that hard defeated the warlock 2 hours after purchasing. The combat when you are controlling a monster mainly consists of spamming 1 move 15-20 times because they AI dosen't know how or cant react to it but if you do any other move the AI instatly reacts. I really wanted to enjoy this game and unlock everything and keep playing on hardcore mode but unfortunately the lack of consistently smooth and reliable combat ended that( its pretty lame that you can do more damage by spamming some monsters  move 20 times over than actually fighting). NOT WORTH FULL PRICE BUT FOR HALF OFF ITS OK.If you look at the other reviews almost no one has played this game for over 10 hours which means no matter what the review said they didnt unlock everything and gave up. very few people enjoyed this enough to keep playing it			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Abyss Odyssey 

			Views: 195		

			Abyss Odyssey is a platformer brawler, available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/255070/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

     Abyss Odyssey is a platform brawler with roguelite elements.  The story and platforming are simplistic but effective, and the voice acting is professionally done, but the game suffers from many small annoyances that chip away from immersion, and hurt it.     The game is artistically beautiful, full of rich detail and color, and is very distinctive.  The levels are randomly generated, which is a strong point of the game, as it offers a refreshing take at a basic linear path.   The characters and creatures are unique and creative, which draws you into the environment.     Unfortunately, the inventory is extremely limited, and the UI adds extra unnecessary steps making upgrading of items clunky and time consuming. The allies that help you in battle, should they kill the enemy, you will not gain any experience even if you take the enemy down from 100% hp to 5% and your ally gets final hit.  More than all of this, though, the combat is the downfall of this game; it is sluggish and clunky,with slow response times from the buttons and basic combat abilities, and a delay between those abilities, taking away from the fluidity of the game.     The enemies and characters are varied in their abilities, but the hero has a limited amount of attack, limiting the variability of combat.       While the voice acting and story progression of this game is well done, and the artwork and music are beautiful, the clunky inventory and clumsy UI combined with the sluggish combat makes for an awkward experience that I cannot recommend.For more reviews check out the channel here http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Abyss Odyssey is an extremely addicting mix of metroidvania, roguelike and fighting. It features a gorgeous art style and a surprising amount unlockable content.In concept, Abyss Odyssey sounds like the type of overambitious project that would fall into impossibly ambitious camp. In essence however, it's elevated by these types of ambitious ideas- which represent the type of risk most large developers stanchly avoid.It was a pleasure to review Abyss, not only was it more than worthy of a two person article. We even performed a platform review, comparing the PC version to its PS3 counterpart.http://www.tech-gaming.com/abyss-odyssey-review/ "

Do you like Super Smash Bros? Then this game is most likely something for you due to the similar mechanics.It's a bit like SSMBs advenure mode where you kill many enemies and collect items (equipment in this,for example rings or necklaces). You can play it with either random people or friends. Friendly fire is toggleable and if you think this game is too easy,there's also a nice ""nightmare"" difficulty which makes the enemies more aggresive and the bosses harder (e.g. by spawning more bossenemies).It also has a Versus mode (local only atm) where you can fight with 3 other people (FFA) with characters you unlock by playing the game.TLDR; get it,worth the money			"

												This game has beautiful visuals, great acting, and a great premise. Unfortunately it's difficult in ways that make it seem lazy, rather than by design; its controls are not quite so tight as they need to be, and while it does have the excitement of random dungeon layouts every time, it unfortunately is so random that it's frequently unfair. It would have been far better if it took the player's level and gave it any thought, but that is beyond Abyss Odyssey. While you do retain your money and experience even after a defeat, you unfortunately don't retain any items, adding to the frustration. The promise of playing as any number of characters is also similarly not what it is presented to be; an extremely unwieldy and difficult-to-use soul capture system, through the woefully slow-filling mana, is used to temporarily command that soul. All things considered, it's not really that worth bothering with. Additionally, the character designs for female characters in the game are elegant and beautiful, but of course male characters are either placeholders or hideous. Maybe if you like teeth-grindingly annoying 'roguelikes', you'll like this. But I personally found the promise far greater than the actual game itself. It's a shame, because I really liked the art nouveau aesthetic and the concept of the game. It simply did not deliver with all it seemed to offer.			"

												The game is just flat out broken.Moving through the menus is extremely laggy. Within the main game, controls simply will not work. And to top it off, the tool-tips seem to be entirely random – some are for the keyboard and some for the controller. Not that it matters as none of the controls work anyway... "

												Abyss Odyssey is a rather different game than I am used to seeing these days. The play style reminded me of the original Ninja Gaiden, but more modern. Each level is procedurally generated, which means that every time you play the game you will have a different experience. Visually I think there are certain aspects which look nice, such as the backgrounds, but the characters don't seem to have a lot of detail and are very repetitive. There isn't a lot of variety in the way the characters look. I do like the different levels, but after a while it feels like you are playing the same ones over and over even though they look different. I think a more robust fighting system and some NPC variety would go a long way toward making this a better game, but it can still be fun to play.			"

												The combat in this seems frustrating because it's not a side scrolling roguelike. It's a side scrolling roguelike fighting game. Remember that this is Atlus and ACE. This is what they do. The reviews here driving the response down to Mixed almost made me not play it. I am thankful I decided to trust my own judgement. Because as others have said when you start using your parries, blocking and dodging correctly you can snowball pretty quickly (and be humbled just as fast).The backgrounds and overall theme fascinate me to no end. I love the art style and general surreal nature of the story. Which is essentially that a Warlock so powerful he can shift reality is  locked into a dream and is for all intents and purposes the equivalent of the roguelike Random Number God. Which seems crazy enough, but this particular warlock is also apparently braindamaged and mentally traumatized. Leading to some truly Silent Hill level business.			"

												Abyss Odyssey offers what feels like a cross between a Souls-like and Street Fighter-like approach to complex combat mechanics amidst a gorgeous, sometimes whimsical, eerie 2D background.  Yes, the controls can feel counter-intuitive and frustrating as others have mentioned, but once you get into the groove of dashing, parrying, and cancelling out of and into actions and abilities, fighting begins to feel extremely rewarding.  You will most definitely want to use a controller.Enemy AI is sophisticated enough to make battle feel like a UFC squaredance.  Foes read you, and they are quite good at it.  They anticipate moves and react accordingly.  Hitboxes are fair and accurate. Enemies often provide enough time and space between moments of engagement to allow you some room for planning attacks.  Add to this the fact that each character has unique moves and skill sets, and the main playable characters have ability unlocks and customizable loadouts, and you have a ton of great replayability.  There are plenty of characters to master as you collect the souls of monsters you encounter, including some boss souls--gotta catch 'em all!Itemization leaves a little something to be desired.  The few weapons and items available have standard fantasy attributes (fire, ice, poison, curse, charm), and while they look aesthetically pleasing, help destroy foes more easily, and add another nice layer of complexity and fun to combat (especially charming and freezing), more could have been done by the developers to diversify and add to the repertoire.If you enjoy rewarding difficulty with precision control mastery, stunning art and music, smooth pacing from stage to stage, and a fairly unique spin on 2D action platforming, get this at full price or on sale.  Either way, it's worth it.			"

												TL;DRFun game, but punishes you on the regular until you learn the ropes, expect to die... A LOT.Pros+Collecting Enemy Souls to transform into enemy characters.Rogue-like - random levels Hard to master combatCo-OpCons-Combat feels very clunky at firstRogue-like is not for everyoneNo save pointsInexperienced players can be a huge hinderance in Co-Op===================================================================I wasn't sure about Abyss Oddyssey when I first fired it up. It felt like a really clunky side-scrolling beat 'em up, but I persevered as I'd coaxed a friend into playing Co-Op and found something well worth your time if you give it a chance. There are some cool features to this game, such as the fact you've technically got up to 3 lives. Whilst your main character has one life, if you die, you respawn as a variety of weaker soldiers (I believe there are 3 in total, one different soldier per main character) which you can use to reach an altar to respawn. However, you also have the ability to collect fallen enemies' souls and then by using altars, you can purchase the ability to transform into the various enemies, they have their own health bars and you can switch between the main character and the enemy at will. If there wasn't a tactical reason to use an enemy character, I'd usually use them as a buffer to keep my main character alive and developed a tiered system of use:  Enemy Character > Main Character > SoldierI had never really played a 'rogue-like' game before, so I wasn't too sure how enjoyable the random levels would be, but after quite a few deaths, you begin to realise that the randomness isn't TOO unsettling.I didn't realise this at the time, in fact, I didn't notice until the final fight with The Warlock, but this this game was created by the very same people responsible for Zeno Clash 1 & 2; two brilliant examples of First Person Beat 'Em Ups done right!Overall, I would recommend this game for around the £5 mark, I'd certainly not pay £10+ unless you are really desperate to give it a go. Fun game, good with friends, if a little frustrating for the first 3-4 hours of gameplay.			"

												This game feels as if 2D Castlevania married Devil May Cry, divorced and then married Dark Souls.The learning curve itself is a bit steep, as one may start the game it is just a standard Metroidvania. It's not. It takes some time to learn character facing, combos and skill work, but after you get further in the game and get used to its mechanic, it's quite unique.			"

Posted: September 5, 2015
												I echo the reviews of many here who note that incredible awkwardness and unresponsiveness of the controls -- especially the unreasonable difficulty in simply getting your character to face the right direction while enemies quickly and fluidly move around you.  Animations lock you too easily and quickly.The game is obtuse and offers almost no guidance on its quirky mechanics.  And I suppose I could handle death penalty if it wasn't so random and out of your control -- sometimes you just get mobbed by 3 fluid, well-aiming enemies who simultaneously kill you very quickly while you struggle with just aiming the right direction.  I don't want to grind for gold to replace expensive weapons so I can continue when that happens.There are a lot of other minor complaints, like the common problem that it is VERY evident that the game was quickly ported over to PC from consoles with as little change as possible in UI and control scheme.  Hint: ESC should not take you to main game menu from anywhere in the game; it should function as a ""back"" button when you are in in-game menus.  Do NOT require the player to press the B key to exit a menu on a PC game; we hate stuff like this.  It's more irritating over time than it would first appear.  In the world of PC ergonomics, it's like putting the doorbell button to your house on the mailbox 30 feet away from the door.Again, like others, I was attracted by the art and music and visually fluid animations, but had enough of the unresponsive controls; and terrible, poorly-ported UI; and the death penalty + death by UI + need for grinding to get equipment again.Note on hours played: I played a few hours on my son's account, so you can consider me as having about 4 hours in.  If there is indeed a gem buried under the punitive barriers to entry, I couldn't bring myself to play further to see it.  If I hear that these issues have been addressed later, I would be happy to try again and revise my review.			"

												This is a reveiw based souly on the  my experiance with fighting games and action platformers. I saw this game  that sounded liked Smash bros. mixed with castvania. Which is actually a perfect way to describe this game's controls.Point 1 combat - The combat is slightly clunky by design. It hards to turn around because you suffer from a massive amounts of ending lag. This means if you are overwelmed getting quickly comboed  by enemies can happen.        - You can cancel all your actions into dogdes or specials you must ,however have a charge in your cancel meter(which recharges over time). This makes you have to strategize on being more offencive or defencive        - You can also block in this game but so can enemies. Both can be simply grabbed out of block.Point 2 Platfroming- The jumping in this game feels the same as Smash brother if you hit back and jump at the same time you jump back facing in the same direction as when your feet were still planted. This allows for retreating attacks in fights but can make the platforming feel a bit comberson at times. Wall jumping is also by my experiance useless. You gain so little height it is better just to try to just make the jump with your mid-air jup alone. The wall slide is also delayed so wall jumps are even more delayed and useless. You can however use dodges in the air to get extra distance which is nice.Be prepared to get used to the controls, and have fun.			"

												Made by the developers of Zeno Clash, gorgeous art and interesting combat is, of course, present.  It feels more like a fighting game (with the ability to animation-cancel moves into others to combo), with a dash of Super Smash Brothers (Directional abilities, hitboxes), but also is a roguelike (permadeath-ish?). It's a weird game for sure, but a lot of fun. The entire campaign is co-op-enabled too! Weird, interesting game, totally recommended.			"

												The game felt really clunky and slow at first, but there's a combat mechanics guide made by one of the devs that turned the game on its head for me. It really changed how I felt about the game and it made it a whole lot more fun. I think if it was advertised as a rogue-like sidescrolling brawler, it'd have gotten more attention in its time, so as to get across the idea that it's unforgiving.The game has a combo counter but it never goes very high, but it's actually quite nice that way. Each hit feels heavier and more satisfying, that even a 5 hit combo is something to be happy about. That said, there are 10+ hit combos but it takes a bit of work. The game feels clunky at first but there's a curve that needs to be passed, it seems.It's like how people complained that Playstation All Stars (though it does have major flaws) was just a button-mashing mess when they couldn't even perform an AP Burst combo, so it became widespread that real combos weren't a thing you could really do.After getting used to the game's mechanics it's really fun, but it's a shame that the story seems to take a back seat to everything else. I love the aesthetic and the characters and wish I knew more about them. There could have been so many layers of mystery and intrigue that it feels like a lost opportunity.More enemy and level diversity would have been nice, too, even if it's enemies we couldn't transform into.Anyways, I enjoy the game a lot. I wish it got a sequel that would do it justice, but pick this game up if you have the chance- maybe wait for a sale if you have to.			"

												The way i would describe it by compairing games, is ""rouge legacy"" combined with ""tobal NO.1"" for ps1Problems: control / feel, Item labels / information, content / length, special moves, AI.Control / feel:game controls almost perfectly.The only problem i would face is when trying to jump and grab onto ledges, and jumping onto platforms you can pass through.The problem with ledge grabing comes from not being able to turn your character mid jump, and that the character automaticly turns when doing a wall slide.The character can only climb when facing the ledge, so many times when i would try and climb up a ledge (uses the same buttons as wallslide) i would go for a wall slide and then change direction.The problem with the platforms is that you can pass through the platform by holding jump and UP or down on the joypad. I have a habbit of holding up in games when jumping on passable ledges specificaly so I dont go through, so i had to retrain my self on that habit. There is also a problem when it comes to using a special move to go up higher than your jump I set the jump specials to UP and special, which will automaticly cause me to fall through the platforms aswell.Item labels:There is a lack of infortmation in game.The game is very basic and simple, so it is not a big fault point. That is unless you are like me, and love to have clear information on gear that your character equips. The problem is, main items have its damage values, and the magic effect / level. extra gear such as belts and rings may raise the magic effects stats by percentages, but I am not givin the base information on the main item to know excatly if what I have is doing anything significant.Content / length:The game feels short, and the main core of the game does not have alot of substance to it.Leveling only gives you the ability to add three stats to your special ablities, damage, damage reduction, add mana,a maximum of 3 times to each skill. The characters stats increase automaticly and are hidden.There are only a few special core events e.g.: buy hidden random stat till death, get a free item to be attacked later, certain walls only break to certain weapons.I beat the game in about 4 hours, and again in about 45 min to an hour and half. (I have yet to play nightmare or experiance everything)Replayablity feels limited, I expect people will get about 4 hours out of this game before moving on.I did fight a random boss after the last time I beat the game, and started another playthrough. I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me, but I have yet to see if it will happen again. I hate the feeling of missed oppertunity that may never return.(I returned, beat the game and the special boss a couple of more times, all playthroughs felt the same).I have mixed feelings on the AI because it does feel like they use input cheats, but at the same time I am not a programer, but I still think that is a neccessary thing for a fast pace fighting game. My feelings are the A.I feels balanced and not overly cheap.Pros:Simple combat with a basic set of moves that are easy to preform. game feels easy and natural to play.Graphics look awesome I give it a 10 for these reasons: Easy on the eyes, interesting to look at, little details, I can tell what and where things are, platforms and walkways are clear, hidden walls are not overly hidden.In game story is simple. I  skipped the starting cutscene, but still got what i think is all the story. The story is non intrusive to the gameplay.Each character is diffrent, e.g.: stats, speed, move set, specials, feel.Nothing feels tacked on.For a rougelite (intent to die alot, random level / item generation). I never felt the game was overly hard or impossible. Even the end boss fight felt “fair” in terms of fighting games.Unlockable content for free as people play. I would rather have it as I beat the game and not others.My thoughts and description:This game is a side scrolling beatum up/random generated scenarios rpg. It was alot of fun and some what challanging without being overly frustrating. There was some controls to get use to, but it didn't take long to get use to; with the exception of the cons i put above. This is a game that I recommend because there is no other game similar to it that I would recommend over it. A nich game for sure.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is one of the best indie games I have played this year. This game is a rogue-like 2d brawler with combat similar to the Smash Bros games set in an alternate universe 1890s Chile in which the dreams of a warlock have started physically manifest in the real world and threaten everyone's wellbeing. The story is actually very interesting. However most of it is told through notes you randomly find during gameplay and a few cut scenes. Animations and combat look and feel great. Also the visuals are some of the best I've seen from a 2d platformer. They aren't on Trine or Ori levels of greatness, but they are pretty damn good. There are 3 main playable characters each with a unique weapon and moveset complex enough that this game's combat system could have easily been made for a competitive fighting game. Not only that, you are also able to captures the souls of every enemy you defeat as long as your character's level is high enough. Then you can use those enemies, all of which also have their own unique and fun movesets. For a rogue-like game, this game is actually very lenient. When you die you get the chance to continue as a soldier, which while obviously being weaker than your main character, is sufficient enough a lot of the time to last until you get to a respawn point for your character. If your soldier dies then it's truly gameover and you must restart from the beginning. When you die your character keeps all of his or her levels and gold though. As a casual player of rogue-likes I actually enjoyed this aspect because it means that every run, no matter how bad, lead to some progress. However after a while when your character gets to the higher levels and becomes somewhat rich, the game becomes a bit too easy in my opinion. Every single playthrough has a randomized map with different paths all eventually leading to the Warlock, aka the final boss. The Warlock is one of the most interesting boss designs I have seen in any video game. The idea is that as more people across the whole world beat the Warlock, all players will be contributing to the game's future content. Basically, whenever the Warlock is killed ""x"" number of times worldwide, the Warlock will gain a new ability for every player to experience. This is interesting because it means that people who play this game later actually get the ""fuller"" experience. That being said this game isn't that popular anymore so I doubt the Warlock will be changing anytime soon. Enemy AI is generally quite good. I do suspect that the AI is cheating a bit in that it probably reads some of the player's inputs directly. However, I am fine with that because the AI doesn't actually feel unfair most of the time, rather it just gives a good challenge. The game also supports local co-op and online/local pvp multiplayer (which is sadly dead)So at this point you are probably wondering. If I am giving this game so much praise (which is does indeed deserve imo), who does this game currently have a ~50% mixed steam review rating? I can pinpoint one glaring flaw with the game which didn't really bother me all too much, but will definitely bother some. Simply when you are in the middle of a combo, you cannot break out of the animation until it is done or you get hit. This makes it somewhat frustrating when you are flailing away at the wrong side, open for the enemy to attack for several seconds. This will be a deal breaker for some. For me it was not.Also other people seem to be complaining about the controls in general. Yes they don't feel extremely crisp like a triple a brawler. But on a 360 pad they felt fine for me after a little getting used to.Replayability for this game is definitely high because it's a rogue-like. However, I think due to the nature of how the player will eventually snowball because of the permanent leveling system, this game has less replayability than most rogue-likes simply because eventually it will get too easy. There is a hard mode called nightmare mode tho.			"

												Despite the ABYSSAL movement, the fighting in this game has depth and is quite fun. The animations look clunky, and they added slippery levels. Still, there are a tons of enemies, tons of unlockable moves, 2 unlockable characters, it's quite fun if you are into metroidvanias. The generated maps are kinda linear though.			"

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221I know I haven't put as much time into this game as other players, but I really plan to.  This game has a lot going for it.  The graphics have a very particular style to them and the environments are truly phenomenal.  The music is also well matched to each particular environment to really make you feel as if you were in that area.  The entire game has a very dark and eerie feel, while still portraying enough action and even slight adventure to keep the player really involved.  In short, I really like this game.I love the uniqueness of the enemies throughout the game, and the ability to capture their souls and become them is just icing on the cake because it gives real variety to a game that establishes only three main characters.  This offers an enormous amount of replayability.  I was already enjoying the game as the main character, but right when I felt like she was becoming stale, I managed to capture the soul of a burning mummy, which is freaking awesome.  At any point now, I can become that mummy whenever I want to with no penalty until he dies and his abilities are vastly different from the main character's skillset.I do have to admit a certain affinity for the ghost monk.  I mean, come on.  It's a flippin ghost monk with a two-handed longsword.  Why would this not be the character you would want to play as?  The items come in massive variety as well.  Everything from swords and halberds with different elemental attacks, down to bracelets and necklaces that offer very helpful resistances or boosts.  All too often though, I seem to come across many more weapons that just happen to be for a character I'm not playing as.  If you can never equip these weapons in the current run you're in, and the game randomly generates a new dungeon run every time, why even have weapons that aren't for you appear?  They serve no purpose, rather than to taunt you with the hope of a gleaming new item, only to find out you can't use it.  Ever.  You can't even pick them up to sell them to a merchant.I'm also not too fond of the fact that you can't keep your items from playthrough to playthrough.  The only thing that remains yours throughout is gold.  Unless there is some banking system that I'm not aware of (and please let me know if there is)  Moving on from that though.  The character skillsets are nice and varied to offer up plenty of exciting playtime without getting boring and the skillpoints that can be used to level up different skills in different ways are nice too.  However, I do wish there was even more variety with that system.And then we come to the enemies in the game.  The baddies.  And some of them, randomly, can become very, very difficult.  It's interesting that in my short time that I've played this game, I've ran into the same enemies time and time again to find that at some times, the enemies will just stand there, while other times, will be relentless in their assaults, sometimes not ever offering up opportunities for counterattacks.  And this seems to happen regardless of what difficulty the current area is at.  This can get frustrating at times, considering how slow the controls can feel at points throughout the game.  After a while though, you do get used to the controls, because at first, they are not fun to deal with.  And I think that is a side-effect of other games that have similar fighting styles such as Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series where the controls are nearly flawless in every aspect.  The controls in Abyss Odyssey aren't that bad, Super Smash controls are just that good.  And we've been spoiled.Overall, I do really like this game and I know in the coming months I will pour countless hours into this game (because I LOVE randomly generated content like this game has to offer).  It has it's faults, but I highly recommend it.			"

												It's a pretty cool fighting roguelike type of game. But it's not very good. The controls aren't great and it's the kind of game where you have a lot of trouble just trying to attack in the right direction. And there are a lot of invulnerability frames for enemies that don't make any sense. And there is very little hint as to when an enemy is taking an action. And a lot of enemies are based around a mechanic that makes some amount of damage unavoidable (which is a huge issue in a roguelike).Also, the multiplayer is *completely* unplayable for the person who joins. There is just too much lag, even with <100 ping. It looks OK, but enemies hit you before they even begin an animation and it makes blocking utterly useless. And you teleport around a lot as the physics think you meant to dash / jump when you didn't, because you are in a slightly different position on the server. And even if you had a connection good enough to have little issues with lag, there aren't any servers. If you want to play this with a friend (like I did), it's a gamble of whether or not this will even work for you.Almost a good game. Try Rogue Legacy, it's 1000x better than this one. This one just looks better, but gets very boring (even in single player).			"

												A really good game after you get a hold of its control.At first glance it looked like a Metroidvania action exploration game, but it is actually a smash brother game with quite a big recovery time for every attack. More like fighting game, if you miss a attack you're going to be punished by your enemy. It reminds me of the combat system in Fortune Summoners, which is also about patience and timing rather than button smashing.I didn't have my hope up before playing because of the mixed review, but now I like it even more than Zeno Clash from the same developer. Like every game by ACE Team, Abyss Odyssey also has a wierd charm that no other game have.So, when do we get Abyss Odyssey 2?			"

												It's a good time killer. Get it on a sale. Basically, it's a trial and error type of game where you do runs in order to get to the final stage/boss, purchasing different weapons and upgrades along the way. It's fun for a couple of hours, when you want to kill time. You need to get adjusted and used to the combat because like others said, it is similar to a fighting game. Visuals are pretty cool and the dark atmosphere certainly helps. Voice acting is near awful except one or two major characters but that doesn't matter cause there isn't much dialogue anyway. The music fits with the overall atmosphere pretty good as well. For 2 to 5 bucks/euros, it's certainly worth it imo.			"

												This is a pretty good game. It's quite hard at first, and some things are frustrating but overall it's very fun. It's like a psuedo-rogue.  The idea is that you keep replaying, but all the levels are randomly generated, so it doesn't get boring. Each time you go through you unlock something new, be it charaters, areas, or whatever. Money in this game goes quick and seems hard to ever have enough of. If you keep dying, don't worry. You keep all experience despite losing items. Personally I think the item loss after a death is one of the most frustrating parts, but the items really dont do that much for you in the end. Your level is far more important to your damage and life bar. It seems that once I gain a sufficient level I'll no longer be dying all the time. Levels 15-20 seem like they're the sweet spot for making it through the game for the first time. Keep trying and you'll make it. I use a joystick (360 for windows), and everything is perfect except for the block. Sometimes it seems sluggish, but maybe its just my timing. Anyway, I really do recommend it if you like these types of games.			"

												For games like this we need a ""maybe"" recommendation option. The art and music are great, but the controls and AI are not. The roguelike advancement system works alright but ultimately can get frustrating before you've seen all the game has to offer. Becomes repetitive fast too, which isn't great for a game where you will be playing through it multiple times before you even get to the final boss. Still, the lore and characters are something different, and it is from an indie dev.			"

												Amazing game unfortunately I'm pretty sure the multiplayer is peer 2 peer so if you get a bad connection GGThe game is great don't get me wrong it just has much more potential it needs a second polishing! IMOThere are minimal bugs but I doubt they'll get fixed or we will get any new content from what I've seen online the devs aren't continuing this project anymore I could be wrong though. People are complaining that the controls are bad they aren't bad at all and if they were you can rebind them so don't complain if you're gonna be lazy. The next common complaint is it's jerky and doesn't run smooth??? Only if you're connected to somebody else that's a networking issue because no dedicated servers bruh or perhaps try not running the game on your mums dusty old hand me down lappy.-Art 9/10-Sound 8/10-Gameplay 8/10-Networking 5/10-Bugs I have encountered;Walls that you climb on a 45 degree angle ... can grief you big time!The jellyfish projectile can kill your npc allies and supposedly unkillable terrain monsters. 'extending vines can be killed''T' posing from undead soldiers on a particular tile looks kinda like this-->  \_'T'_/ You'll know him when you find him.No Borderless fullscreen setting.I wish this game had mod support if the devs aren't continuing with the project who knows we might get lucky 'shrug'Don't get me wrong the game is fun it just has more potential!

												Warlocks are real.You can hop on a planeand meet the gods today.Real hardcore warlocks have to stay in caves for a few years.They seperate themselves from society.In the caves, there are entrances to the land of the dead.They commune with dead and are able to access the brains full potential.This allows warlocks to remember the future.If you happen to have had Mexican or South American relatives,you have probably heard some very unsettling stories,in order to get you to behave or go to bed.Turns out that all the stories about""La Lechuza"" a flying woman with an owl body,""The Black Hand"" trust me...you do not want to know,and my personal favorite the ""Cukuy""were actually based on actual folklore.I could not understand how my parents storieswere scarier than horror movies! Hell, even Satan hangs out in Mexico.Who knew?!Knowing the folklore made the game fun.I beat Abyss Odyssey when it was first released.It is a hack & slash with ""hard to get used to"" controls.However, once you get into the flow of thingsIt is an intriguing & mysterious adventure.The artwork and freaky character designshooked me immediately.If you do not like the art style,you may not like the game.It feels stiff at times and may be frustrating to some.Online co-op is availablefor people that like people.This may not be your cup of teabut if you add some magical leavesto that cup of tea you just might find yourselfHaving a blast in the underworld.

												It's a beat'em up mixed with the 2.5 D perspective like Trine and with Rogue-like qualities of Super House of Dead Ninjas. Beat the whole game multiple times through, it's fairly easy once you've got the hang of it. The game is still being updated and includes many features like local versus mode, local co-op mode and online co-op mode. I do hope they fix the online co-op and perhaps add in an online versus mode with a leaderboard just like how there is one for how many times people have beat the game. The game takes a unique approach to updates where once an update is ready to be deployed, players need to beat the game multiple times to break this seal that unlocks more content. I'm really curious as to how long this will keep going.			"

												Well, I wasn't sure if I should write a review, but I saw that most of the others are just crap so I decided to ake 15 minutes and write my thoughts.This is a sort of 2D fighting game, simple and not pretencious, where you have to clear some levels until you eventually get to the big boss. Overall this is a good game, but there are some things that ought to be improved.Pros:Abyss Odyssey has a stunning visual, the artwork is marvellous, especially the artstyle of the enemies. You find yourself fighting against monsters never seen before. Also the music is beautiful, even if a bit limited. The three characters are different and balanced and the difficulty of the game is not too high. When you die you get ""revived"" as a second character and this is a quite god idea, so that you don't have to restart from the beginning. Cons:I'm afraid these are a bit more. There are some problems in this game that are quite annoying, The firs thing is that this game explains absolutely nothing. Ok, you know how to attack and move, but you don't know how to capture souls, how to use mana, how to respawn, and how to use the power ups. These and many other mechanics are not explained, and you need to play many times before knowing rules and tips. This might give the game more longevity but sometimes it becomes frustrating.Second is the combat. You'll find annoying trying to turn left/right, because either you attack or turn, many times I found myself swinging in the wrong direction. The counterattack is more or less useless, a bit better for the dodge, because you just have to do the same 2 combos to keep your enemies down.Other things badly managed are the inventory, when to buy weapons, and how merchants ar eplaced through the levels. Unfortunately when you die you lose your equipement (unless of course you find an altar with your soldier, but even there I lost all my potions bracelets, etc..) and you have to be lucky to find a merchant or a good weapon. Many times I was beaten because there wasn't anywhere to buy potions or a good weapon. I thought ""I just need to level up and it'll change"". Well that's not true because after 12 hours I still think levelling doesn't serve any purpose, the damage you inflict seems to be based on your weapon, not on your level.As for the power up section, I still don't know if it works, if I put all the power ups to the attack, mana or shield, I see the same results. One last thing I want to mention is about some traps, that in a very few cases are unavoidable and placed in a silly way. One time I died with my souls and the monk becouse I couldn't jump over a black hole (I  lost my equipement).Talking about the multiplayer, I played with a friend and the game is fun, we found it a lot easier than the single player and we enjoy beating those monsters, the only problem we have is that the game doesn't run well. Probably it's jjust us but I see my teammate halfway through the floor, and on my laptop lags. I followed instructions on some forums but still couldn't fix it. I resigned myself to lower the quality to improve the performace, and by the way I bought this laptop 2 weeks ago and it is a spaceship, this game shoul run smoothly.Well to sum up, this game is for sure enjoyable and it can keep you busy for more then 10 hours, but I wouldn't pay 15 bucks for it,  I think I got it in a bundle. There are some good ideas but some things ought to be improved, if not in this game, for the next one. Have fun playing			"

												Abyss Odyssey can really grow on you, if you give it a chance.The controls become intuitive with playing, whether you prefer playing with gamepad or with keyboard and mouse.Abyss Odyssey is an enjoyable experience. You can just sink somehours in it without leaving frustrated. Even if you got beaten up in an encounter, it always feels like you have a chance. It'smore of a 'Curiosity killed the cat' situation. I could justleave for the next floor, but, hey, may be there's one last treasure around the corner... Oh hell, I should've just left. Dying is a good chance to take a break. I always leave with anticipation for the next session, the surprise of what you will encounter.It helps, that you keep your gold, skills and unlocks, afterdying. So you will have more health and experience, whenfighting your way down the Abyss again.Also, when you have a sweet spot for enchanting 2d art, accompanied by haunting soundtracks, I'd say, give it a try.

												Anyone who says this game is short doesn't understand what is going on...there are multiple locations (I've unlocked 2 others so far) and multiple characters which change slightly your approach to each level due to different combat moves and abilites. I unlocked the monk by beating the game for the first time and unlocked two other levels after trying to win using the monk (the boss is much harder as the monk for me at least).  The randomly generated levels and different weapons, moves and summons (creature tansformation thing) all reflect the hard work and effort put into this game by the Devs and is by no means incorrectly priced based purely on content. I've had a blast so far and recommend this game based upon its solid and interesting game mechanics, awesome art style, great voice cast and extensive variablilty from one level to the next.This game is only as short as you want it to be and fans of side-scolling brawlers are sure to enjoy it.

												Great music, great artwork, great concept, poor execution. A clear example of a game where most of the time and money was spent on the music and artwork, but not enough time and money was spent on gameplay.- Clunky controls- Not enough feedback during fighting (sounds and visuals)- Not being able to replay previous areas - Being forced to use both the soldier and the woman. If I choose a character, that's the character I want to play. The woman is fast and agile and the soldier is slow and clunky and I just plain don't want to play the soldier character.- Annoying save point mechanic- Deceptive moving platforms where the same jump will sometimes end up with your character on the platform and most times not- Clunky Inventory and Skill Assignment UI that isn't intuitive at all- Very thin on tutorials e.g. when I see a weapon shrine and I don't know why I can't pick up the weapon in the shrine- Level design doesn't lend itself to character progression e.g. character gets new skill/ability and doesn't immediately have a space in the level to practice the skill after being given a tip on how to use the skill. Shovel Knight, Ori and Super Panda Adventures are games that do this REALLY well.			"

												* Combat is pretty standard hack'n'slash faire, though it feels almost like smash bros in some ways. It's a bit slow in certain cases, and you have to measure your strikes or you'll leave yourself open for enemies to murder you. The combo system is pretty deep too, and I'd comment on it further if I understood it properly.* The game expects you to die a lot, so there's no penalty for doing so, but it really just serves to prolong gameplay. The initial levels start to look a little samey, but since its all procedurally generated it's not a problem.* Visually this game is top notch. The backgrounds are gorgeous, monsters are really well done, and the dialogue portraiture is done in a really solid art-noveau style.* The music/sounds are appropriate, unobtrusive, but largely unmemorable. Probably for the best, as they aren't distracting.Here are our impressions in video form:

												Game has a Smash Bros.-esque combat system. From my extensive knowledge of smash brothers, even the best of people can get easily cheesed/comboed/killed when outnumbered with decent skill/AI; get ready to die when you're unlucky. This game requires  some skill level, and understanding of the combat system; tactiful mind knowing when to retreat, spacing, and etc. The speed of this game is not very fast paced compared to many other more recent fighting games so some might say it is slow/clunky so it takes a few tries to get use to (there is a training room). My friend is pretty bad at platformer games, so it was funny watching him die from failed jump attempts multiple times. I'm a terrible person.You can play as 3 main characters, but you are able to capture/buy ""souls"" to transform into monsters and play as them until you want to switch or it gets killed (which then you return to your character as they were before you transformed). Using monster transformations makes getting through the game easier. Some monsters suck while others have really cheesy skill sets and/or incredible mobility (centaurs can jump very high and far). You can purchase/find items, but they are temporary (you lose them on death) so the only thing you really keep is money. The game also updates based on how many times the final boss was defeated (total of leadboard scores).Co-op mode is fun, but with friendly fire on (default setting) in this type of game I can see why only 2 players are supported. You would spend more time getting beat up by your teammates than the monster. Luckily, there is an option to turn off friendly fire with minor limitations (leaderboard related). Monsters can't hit each other unless charmed so I think it isn't fair getting mobbed esp in co-op (increased number of monsters boss/miniboss)if they all ignore your friend and decide to♥♥♥♥♥♥you instead. HINT: if you solo play in online settings make sure FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON so you can kill monsters you've charmed instead of waiting for it to wear off.BTW PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT CONTROLS BEING INCOMPATIBLE.

												More like a rogue-like fighting game than a metroidvania style game, which will probably throw a lot of people off at first.  You're going to need to give the enemies more attention than you're used to, and the controls will not be like those of a platformer.But if you're willing to put some effort into learning the controls, it can be a very challenging and fun title.  The art style and  atmosphere created make this one of my favorite games.  The enemies are interesting and well scripted, so that you'll need to learn their individual strategies and weaknesses in order to deal with them.  The three main playable characters have very different fighting styles and allow for customization of weapons, accessories and special moves.  These can synergize to give the player much more power when the right combinations are found.The levels are procedurally generated, so each playthrough you'll want to pay attention to the map layout to find the most desirable route.  The different difficulties make quite a bit of difference in AI ability, and you'll want to stick to the easy levels until you get the hang of it.  "

												The things you should know about this game:Only Personal inventory of one weapon and a couple trinkets, if you die you loose them, if you quit out, you loose themNo save, play the game beginning to end, or start over,It does have milestones ""Towns"" but you only start a new game in the town you nevver get to it through progressionYou level but I have no real clue why.Everything is expensive to buy, and since none of it stays when you die, the store in town is a whole lot of useless.Only one starting character unlock the other two.Stealing souls is like a shot in the dark, plus they go away too.In a nutshell, it is a classic game(No real innovation), demanding grinding and perfection.Yet, offering no real reward to gameplay.  You get done with the game thinking;""I look the same, I do the same stuff, and if I play this again, nothing will change.""Has potential, but you forgot the one simple thing, our need as players to grow, to create our unique style, and more importantly keep it despite failure.

												An absolutely gorgeous game, Abyss Odyssey entrances with carefully designed visuals, and a captivating musical score. While the game is worth buying for the unique art style alone, it's roguelike elements, coupled with an elegant combat system are greatly done themselves.The game's narrative isn't exactly high prose, but it neatly ties together all the gameplay elements with the art style and character designs.All of this together makes the player yearn to explore further and further into the Abyss.

												This game wants to be like Castlevania very badly. It had a good idea and somewhere along the line the development team took a page out of the Sonic Team book to do a bunch of cocaine. This is the only explanation for putting fighting-game like controls in a game that requires fast responses and mobility (you know, like Castlevania). A clunky, slow, and tedious battle system plaques this game like the warlock you are to stop. The opening song is awesome and then the rest of music is lack luster, yay. You may think the updates they will be coming out with will improve it, but i prefer a more playable product from the get go. The first patch improved the game by 1%, hooray, 99% yet to be improved. Co-op is crazy, it has friendly fire in a close quarters side scrolling combat game, ""oh, but you can turn it off"", and to that I say it hurts the overall community progress towards ""defeating the warlock"" so whats the point.Maybe one day it will be in a better state, I really wanted this to be good, to scratch my castlevania itch (lords of shadow is a disgrace and doesn't count imho)Overall: Go play Castlevania Harmony of Despair on PS3 or Xbox 360, its the game this was trying to be.

												The brilliant and strange art style from the Zeno Clash series, combined with lots of historical flavor and fun gameplay. It has a combination of persistent RPG and roguelike elements that ensures that no two playthroughs are the same, and that you will have to adapt according to random events and drops. There are three different characters who each cater to very different playstyles, and you can also get almost every single monster as a random ""item"" or ""drop"" to conserve health for your main.Only real downsides are that there aren't even more main characters, and the final boss is ridiculously harder than the rest of the game.

												I want to recommend this game. I really do- the sound track is beautiful, the art is superb. But I can't. The controls are extremely strange. I'm STILL re-mapping them to something that works. There are a few instances in game where it'll glitch and you can't get rid of a helpful tip pop-up. The game is also meant to be played with a controller. Good luck with a mouse and keyboard as the controls are even worse- yes my controller broke and I had to suffer a few levels before I decided it wasn't working.Also- when you die the soilder you control feels even heavier than the one you were playing. It's almost twice as hard to jump and attack- which the combat is a bit sluggish. Also certain enemies will almost instantly defeat you with a few hits. It's pretty much the player struggling with the hit box and the AI fluidly defeating you. I'll still probably mess around with this game- as I said I really want to like this game. But recommend I do not.			"

												This humble little game comes with a fairly reliable and customisable moveset for all characters. Even though movement and attacking can feel sluggish and inappropriate for navigating platforming (like how adventure mode in Smash Bros Brawl felt to navigate) the visuals, the interesting systems and variety of enemies kept me playing. As you learn characters moves and also recognise attack patterns in the opponents then a feeling of decision making and skill on your part is rewarded. For example, you might recognise a short-range attack, back up then hit them with a long-distance attack on their recovery.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is a weird little game. At first I wasn't too happy with it, because the game literally tells you nothing going in. However, after about a half hour or so it started to click - it's a a roguelike platformer with a combat focus, basically. I was expecting the combat to be similar to something like Marvel vs Capcom based on videos, but in reality it's much closer to Smash Bros, with normal and special attacks based on directional commands. Once you get the hang of it, taking down a bunch of dudes feels pretty satisfying. I strongly recommend getting the special cancel upgrades when you can, because it gives you a lot more freedom to play how you want.I also love the art and sound design - If you've played ACE Team's other games like Zeno Clash you know they have a tendency to get weird, but the atmosphere in AO skews much more towards ""pleasantly trippy"" than ""uncomfortably disturbing"" like parts of ZC did.  One complaint I have is that for a roguelike, the main difficulty isn't too hard - I beat the final boss on my second try, though it's worth mentioning the difficulty scales as you level up. Also, the devs just added a ""Nightmare Mode,"" and it they're already tweaking game balance via patches. It sounds like ACE Team has every intention of continuing to update for months to come, so I'm definitely curious to see how the game changes in the future.  Worth a look if you like games like Spelunky.			"

 Summary: A game that may not have the longevity to warrant comparisons to Rogue Legacy, but definitely has a unique battle system that relies more of slow but pointed movement. The combat system at its core felt like a good changeup for the genre as it reminded me of having influences from fencing, and it's complemented by a beautiful art style and a great soundtrack. The game does have content problems, as it's corridors and enemies do start to grow stale over time, especially in the layout department. However, combat surprisingly never felt TOO repetitive for me due to its mechanics, and I disagree with a lot of users saying that the controls are bad for the game: they perfectly fit in for what the combat was trying to do. In the end, the mixed rating on Steam really surprised me about Abyss Odyssey: I felt the game did give a great experience that stood out from others in the genre, and is definitely worth a look for fans looking for a slower, but more detailed combat experience in the end.

			Views: 271		

			In the court of Gaming opinion, can Abyss Odyssey be acquitted from the accusations made against it? In this episode of Objection, we take a look at some of the biggest arguments against the game,...		

 Lists: +: Combat feels pointed and well refined with all the different characters and monsters that you can play as, and yet it working well for all of them. If you're looking for Smash/Rogue Legacy, it's not that, but something a bit different, where it punishes you for big mistakes.  Precision is rewarded well and I really enjoy that. You really do feel like you master combat in the game once you get a hang of it. Some claim the controls are bad for the game, and I have to say: nonsense. It works well for the kind of game that it was going for, that it complements the game in the right ways.  Like the basic storyline they go for here, despite it not being that big in the overall picture. Enough intrigue to make you want to know more. Interesting mechanic in the soldier picking up where the hero leaves off, being a bit underpowered but having to fight his way to resurrect the hero. Liked it. Characters feel unique despite seeing some of them before in other games of their series. Always loved these character designs, even the human ones.  Wonderful aesthetic with a great soundtrack makes a game that hits well with it's overall art style and unique 2D/3D models.-: Over time, the lack of variety in the environments will make the game feels repetitive. Could have used a lot more “random” events to spice things up over time.  Leveling feels unbalanced in the long run, as having higher levels seems to make the game significantly easier, or at least it feels like it. Wasn't having problems at all around level 50. There's some weird glitches that happen, and a reasonable slowdown at times when defeating enemies. It's not the most optimized of games, that's for sure.  Some double jumps can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥with the secondary characters in particular. Too little leeway at times can lead to a lot of frustration. "

												This is a pretty challenging procedurally generated platformer/fighting/rogue-like/metroidvania game. It's got a pretty amazing art style, with a good amount of enemy and boss variety. You start out with one character in the campaign, and can earn two more for campaign mode. Some say it is too easy, personally I disagree though part of that could be that I use a keyboard and mouse and they have a controller. They recently added a higher difficulty level however (along with online co-op and other features), so that shouldn't be much of a problem now. ProsDark atmosphere storyNice graphics Good soundtrack Surreal foes ~well designed3 characters to choose (must unlock the other 2 first)Every enemy is playable if you capture him (mana)cons:Checkpoints require 'camp token' which you buy from shops (high-priced)Stuff you buy from shops go away when you dieLack of a tutorial 1 skill every 3 levels			"

												Was looking for a side-scrolling action game and got this as part of a bundle so decided to give it a shot despite the mixed reviews. How pleasantly surprised I was! The game doesn't take long to complete and once you get used to the somewhat clunky combat-system, it becomes quite enjoyable. Visually, the game is stunning and I was very impressed with what I saw. I honestly didn't know what to expect so that probably helped. Dying means losing all your equipment but you retain your skills and experience. The game also has a unique option of giving you a ""second chance"" where a soldier steps in to take over the fight once you are down (at least for me). From there, it becomes a frantic rush to stay alive and find the next altar to revive your fallen hero! It is a relatively easy game to pick up and one where you can end up spending more time than you had anticipated.Definitely worth getting when it goes on sale!			"

												I do and I don't recommend this game. While starting out the controls felt clunky and heavy-ish, after some time in combat I understood that the way fighting was designed its just something you have to get used to. It does become more tactical, but in a sort of rock paper scissors advanced kind of way. Move in, are they blocking? I should throw or move away or throw a fireball to goad them into a dodge to catch them at the end of their animation. Which became more enjoyable as I continued playing the game.I didn't really play the other characters, however I was more concentrated on beating the game. If you're looking for a game to enjoy a playthrough and have a good experience based on that single playthrough, I don't recommend this game. However if you're looking for a game where you jump in, fight enemies for a while and enjoy a randomized dungeon experience through a bunch of playthroughs. I would recommend this game. I beat the game in two sittings and enjoyed the experience but its not a game that really sticks with me and makes me want to talk about it with everyone. If  someone was like ""Hey I saw you play Abyss Odyssey on Steam, how is it?"" I'd just be like ""Its aight."" and that's all. But it does feel like a good game for when I come home and just want to beat up some stuff with some strategy and don't want to put too much effort into. To sound like an old fogey gamer (which I might very well be at this point) the gameplay is reminiscent of games from the SNES era where you just played it and got used to the controls, clunky controls weren't something to be like ""Screw this game."" as long as the clunkiness worked with the gameplay. Then it was just getting used to how to play the game and finding the experience you were meant to enjoy because you had 5 more days with the rental and you beat all your other games already, also you just moved to the area and realized it was a neighborhood of grandparents mainly so you had no other kids to play with.

												This game kinda grew on me.I was first drawn to Abyss Odyssey because of its art style. Really enjoyed it and I think it’s one of its main distinctive features.At first, when I started playing, it felt a bit awkward, the controls (keyboard and mouse) felt a bit clumsy and chunky, and I was thinking ""disappointed with a great looking game"". But I got used really fast.After this adaptation period, no more felt awkward controls, all went smoothly.Added to really nice art style, Abyss Odyssey has enough variety to keep a player engaged for a few hours, in my case, 27 hours. It has lots of characters to play with, each with its play style, and the 3 main characters have different abilities to choose from and upgrade. The player starts by choosing one of this main characters to play with, but during the game he can capture the essence of fallen enemies and turn into them.The game structure is another of the features that caught my attention: on each playthrough, the player has the opportunity to play randomly generated rooms with different difficulty levels, to play special rooms, to play with different characters, to play against an assortment of enemies and to choose and upgrade your equipment, adding to replayability and longevity.All in all, Abyss Odyssey is a good action sidescroller, with great art style, interesting gameplay and design, and enough to keep a player engaged for a few dozen hours.On some side notes, it has achievements, which always add value to the game, and also competitive multiplayer, although mostly ""dead"" due to lack of players, which is fine by me, since I usually don't care much for MP features. I do get annoyed when games have achievements for MP, but in this case I found some friend on steam to help me with the game single MP achievement.			"

												I'm going to keep this very short. Abyss Odyssey is an okay game with a pretty neat art style.The combat seems complex with move cancels, blocks, dodges, normal attack, jumping attacks, special attacks, and the ability to combine them in interesting ways. It can be a little overwhelming when trying to keep track of all the movesets that you have to fight with and against. Every monster has their own movelist. The player also tends to have access to at least 3 movesets in a run if you're not switching out captured monsters often. The one bad thing about combat is facing which can become frustrating quickly. It can be sometimes difficult to face the correct direction, especially if the enemy walks just far enough to be on the other side of you and evade all your hits. The feeling can be amplified if there are multiple enemies around. I quickly became a big fan of any fast or sweeping/aoe attacks.You aren't just the character you select, you can be various monsters depending on your level since that determines which ones you can capture. If you die, you come back as a soldier that wields a weapon dependent on your main character until you hit a shrine or trigger a monster stage in-between areas. I saved up 25K gold and spent it on the wishing well to purchase a pretty cool halberd character with plenty of sweeping attacks that covered both sides. She's the one I could beat the game with since her normal attacks are pretty boss, although the monster that wears the sombrero really helped me out in the end. Some monsters feel much better than others and I enjoy playing as the good ones.Finally, I thought the story had an interesting Chilean flavor (journal pages), the environments were mostly nice (hazards sometimes blended in a little well), and the game is built around replayability if you like collecting monsters or enjoy the fighting system. The map is randomized for every fresh run. The only thing you keep is gold while weapons and equipment will go poof upon game overs.Abyss Odyssey is okay. You need to be willing to learn how the combat works. I definitely recommend dropping 25K in the treasure room (it's the gold room on the map) for the halberd character for an easier time.			"

												Here you have quite an unique game.I could have played a lot of games, but there's occasionally one that could surprise me for its originality.It has a captivating story and setting, creatures are from Chilean lore or common imaginary, but they're presented with a new interpretation.- ... and one with some useful npc: they gave me impression of being part of the fictional world without the usual "" just here for the player to pass by"", and they have some good artworks too :D -It's an action platformer that seems to wink to a lot of different genres, here are some aspects: roguelike - you may find/buy objects but when you've reached endgame you will only keep your level, skill points and money; no savegame during a ""run"" of the dreamlike abyss;levels are randomly generated with each play. rpg elements - characters gather exp with kills or with a special encounter, gaining more HP and the ability to capture and transform in the various creatures (only one at a time) they could encounter, weapons have a single stat and attributes like fire, poison etc..fighting elements - each creature you may encounter is a force to recon with, because each character/creature/npc have its moveset so it's like a 2D fighting game when doing battles. This aspects shine as the principal one.Since it's relies so much on frenetic, quick and precise controls, like old days games, you need to be prepared to learn well how to use all the functions.Anyway it's simple to get used to the controls functions, but...It seems that some people had input delays on controls.I had the same issue and was really about to upset me.Anyway I understood that the reason for that delay was for my pc specs, so, lowering the resolution and removing effects with a bit of patience, trying, until the right one configuration was found.Keep in mind that this game works perfectly with a gamepad ( I use xinput compatible 360 pad), and is definitely high recommended.I have really enjoyed how works using the right analog stick for normal attacks, this function gives a sense of ""fencing"" to all the fights.About gameplay and replayability.Since it has roguelike elements it's intended to be played a LOT of times and it's quite enjoyable doing so, especially if you'll like the story since using one character will unlock new dialogs lines with the final boss.One appoint could be done for the lenght of each stage-level for being too short: once the player get accustomed to various   game elements one run could be done pretty fast, around 45 min.-It reminds me old school games I used to play that I could replay day after day beating each time the game.Using the main character made me recall the first Prince of Persia, maybe for the platform action and each fight was an actual duel-Anyway seems that more additional content will be done as well some adjustments for the options and configuration.Graphic and soundFluid animations, great pc/npc/creatures models, a lot of stunning background visible in distance (another unique aspect with some nice light effects) and a wonderful artwork set.Music themes change on levels, nice, but not its strenghtpoint, proper voiceacting.Recommended to those in search for an original story and atmosphere, visually appealing artworks, and a bite of old school gaming.

												Did you notice the 'Rogue-like' tag on the store page? i did not. So i thought this was a story driven beat em up game  just like earlier ACE team made Zeno clash games (awesome games btw) but now as a platformer. Well it really is a Rogue-like game and a very unique one. Is it any good? Depends. It is very hard. frustrating in fact. rage quits are never far away. But at the same time it got a very unique recipe for making you come back and have some more punishment. Unique. That's the word i will use to describe this game.  Everything about it is unique. I dont think i have ever played a rogue-like game that takes it's combat system from a real beat em up game and mixes it with flowing game play such as Dust:Elysian Tail. But unlike Dust in this game it is not possible to just mash the buttons and get a good combo. Getting 'in to the flow' in fights and timing are essential. Also getting the proper moves and really getting into things like 'juggling' or 'teching' or 'normal attack cancel into a special move' -stuff. Sound too much like a beat em up? Well no it's not that but you will need to learn these things. vice versa just being good at Rogue games will not cut it. But if you like Rogue games then this game will provide you with a nice challenge with it's learning curve so fans of both genres should at least check this game out. Be patient. Thats the one advice i give on this game. Be patient and learn. read guides if you must and train with the training doll.			"

												Completing this game is in so far not possible as you can play it over and over again. The levels change each time, the encounters as well.One time I met a skeleton with a violin (really scary sounding one) who asked me to take the curse from him... he was actually a nice guy... except for the, you know, trying to kill me part.The game plays a whole lot like Super Smash Bros. which is great! Finally a game that picks up on the game machenics. Too bad there are only 3 buildable characters, the other once are set, but nice to play as well. Took me about 4 hours for my first playthrough, since you have to start over again after too many mistakes... and always remember... being swapped to a soldier sucks... but nice to know he is always there.Edit: You as FYI: Friendly fire sucks when playing with my mates.

												This game has done more to scratch that beat-em-up itch I've had than pretty much anything released in the last couple of years. The fighting is slow, but really solid. The art is gorgeous. It's surprisingly challenging. Not a fan of the way friendly fire works in multiplayer right now, but that aside it's pretty fair. The transformation gimmick works really well in keeping things fresh and swapping between two characters with two health bars means another layer of strategy to consider when you're low on health and supplies. Definitely a much more original and successful attempt at putting together a dungeon crawler than I've seen most indie turds on Steam attempt to churn out.TLDR It's flawed, but I like it. A lot.			"

												So, I bought this game under sale, and I don`t see why people gave it so many negative reviews, it is pretty much a very good game for an affordable price.  Pros:  -Replay value - Randomly Generated Abyss you fall into, with some different characters with unique play styles and abilities you choose.  -Story - Theres a little lore behind the Abyss.  -You will feel like you`re playing a mix of The Binding of Isaac (because of the structure of the `rooms`) with Risk of Rain (The way enemies come) and some fighting game with cool combos.   Cons:  -You might get bored in some playtime, just like many Randomly Generated games, because even if there`s a different scenario everytime, it`s the same `kind` of feel, do you get me?  -Not so easy to get used to the attack controls.  -Controller port is not so good, you`ll take a tame to get used to the way your abilities are cast.  So... Buy it on sale and enjoy!			"

												Seems this game has gotten a strangely bad rap that is quite undeserving. If you like story, sure, there's not much to be had, but the combat system is decent and rewarding by how well you can understand and chain combos. The areas you get to explore have a unique art story and a verticality, and enemies are very much just as interesting, all looking like they were out of a Tim Burton movie.If you liked Super Smash Bros, and like exotic fantasy settings, you will find more than a few hours of enjoyment out of the game.Is the game worth $30? No. Is it worth $15? Sure.			"

												Disclaimer: Got this game for free from a friend's bundle code.Abyss Odyssey is a fighting game disguised as a beat 'em up/platformer/roguelike. You do the basic things one would expect from those latter 3 genres -- fighting heaps of disposable bad guys, hopping around on moving floors, and crawling through variable dungeons that change with each iteration. But it's the fighting game mechanics that will carry you. Your use of animation cancels, unforgiving parries, launches, juggles, and general purpose combo mastery will carry you. The better you are at these fighting game mechanics, the faster you'll progress. A solid player can beat the boss within a few hours. There's a lot more to accomplish including fleshing out all the heroes, capturing all the enemies in the cool extra-life soul-stealing system, and multiplayer and nightmare difficulty.So take this recommendation with a caveat. The price you get Abyss Odyssey at should reflect the extent to which you can explore the game's mechanical depth and it should reflect your willingness to play to completion. If Abyss Odyssey is a one-and-done game to you, wait for a sale that justifies 3 hours of play. If your fighter mechanics are solid and you tend to be a completionist, feel free to pick it up for retail price.			"

TL;DR: Having played a few hours so far I can attest this game is fun if you like side scrolling beat 'em ups with rogue-like elements and is worth the price ($10 that I paid, but I would pay $15). You can progress in the normal game by using basic techniques and skills or you can excel and go for the harder stuff by really practicing advanced techniques.Non-TL;DR:Some cons:There really isn't a lot of balance when it comes to the enemy souls. Some dominate, others die way too easily. To be fair, though, some of this is based simply on how well you understand their playstyle. Some of them benefit from a semblance of button mashing, and others you will get horribly punished for trying that and require some finesse. Then there are those few that are just bad and need some work.The controls have some small issues, but overall I have experienced much worse. For one, the climb up ledges mechanic has really plagued me. I'm not sure if it's just me or if it others have the issue, but I find myself falling a lot more than I believe I should when I feel I was correct in my controls. That said, very few times (I'm looking at you fiery shadow pits) has it caused me any big issues. Most of the time it just impedes my speed in progress. Actual combat feels well except for some rare instances of your character not wanting to turn around as snappy as you might be used to in most games of this type. However, personally, I feel as though this was intended to keep people from being button mashy and spammy. As is, I think the item depth is a bit lacking. I am going to assume that the future will hold some updates that expand the library of items as well as souls so I am not too concerned with it right now.The environments, while pretty, sometimes feel a bit samey (and this is after only four hours of gameplay). I know this is a curse of rogue-like/procedurally generated games, but it should be mentioned all the same. A little more detailed variety could really spice things up.Some pros: The basic mode difficulty as it is now, is fair. I have gotten massacred quite a few times but also excelled quite a few times based almost completely on my performance with a bit of random thrown in for flavor. I have not tried Nightmare mode yet.The art style is beautiful.The music is great. I found myself grooving quite a few times while trouncing foes.I like having various souls and items show up randomly. It's fun having things not be the same all the time.The characters are all well designed, as well as the enemies. I have not found one yet that I disliked. Being able to respec your skills is a lot of fun and encourages experimentation and building for specific floors if you feel the need. (Small con: You can't respec your skill cancel orbs.)Final thoughts:Well worth the price I paid and with all the feedback from the community pouring in I expect it to get even better.			"

												If you want tight fighting game combat, this is not the game for you. However what this game lacks in smooth gameplay, it tries it's hardest to make up for in looks and variety. The game looks absolutely stunning, and the designs of the characters are varied and interesting. The different areas are all great, but I wish there was a little more variety in them. Once you've seen one particular ""tileset"" you've seen all the permutations of it.The combat, which should be the core of the game feels a little bit ""floaty"". This doesn't feel great for what is essentially a fighting game. Sometimes moves that look like they should be hitting just go through enemies completely, and this just makes the combat feel not that great at times. It's still serviceable and has a ton of depth since you can capture enemy souls and play as them, which is the main draw of the game. Each enemy has a pretty distinct moveset and while some are clearly better than others each enemy has their own style and this gives a ton of replay value for the game.This replayability is much needed, since the game is actually kind of easy. I played this both co-op and solo, and the solo experience actually felt a lot easier. Enemies are more passive when you are alone and usually come at you one at a time. While in co-op play you usually tend to get ganged up on and comboed by multiple enemies at a time which makes the experience frustrating at times.All in all amazing art and music, decent combat, fun exploration and good replayability make this an overall great experience.

												First, the art of the game caught my attention and after watching a few videos, I decide to give it a try. I was a bit disappointed at first b/c I was expecting something else (something like Dragon's Crown). However, after a few more hours, I am hooked. The game system remind me of Japanese dungeon RPG where you lose your progress and items when you die, but in this game, you get to keep the level/skills, money, and souls/characters for vs mode. Many have complaints about this mechanic in the forum, but I think it works just fine. Also, the game is designed for multiple play-through, so don't expect it to be long to reach the final boss (took me about an hour on the first try). Just think of this game as Super Smash Brothers Melee type of game with a fun single player mode for collecting characters.As for VS mode, I haven't try yet since I am still trying hard to convince my friends to get this game (they all are waiting for the next sale. Bunch of cheap asses). However, I hope the developer would tune/balance characters for the VS mode as time go by and hoping the game would be in FTG tournaments.			"

												It's a side scrolling action game with elements of a rogue-like and a platformer. Three playable characters, each with unique move list and a corresponding weapon. The game has some light equipment collecting and leveling, randomly generated dungeon lay outs and the ability to play as most enemies and bosses, once the player's character reaches the apropriate level and capture them with a particular move. The combat system seems heavily inspired by Nintendo's smash brothers series. on that note, the game supports two player co-op and feature a four-player versus mode. The multiplayer segment is probably the biggest selling point for a metroidvania trying to differntiate itself from the restAfter you get the hang of the game, progressing to the bottom of the dungeon is not particularly difficult, and can be accomplished relatively quickly. at that point of the game, emphasis changes from merely progressing through the dungeon to smaller objectives: collecting all note book peices (items that convey the game's lore) leveling and improving your character's equipment, and collecting all playable enemies.  While its fun, it does become tiresome quickly- the experiance is short but polished enough to reccomend. It helps that the game's art, music, and scant lore are all fantastic.			"

												Really wanted to actually play this game without getting pis*ed off but the controls are unresponsive, moving left to right is buggy and combat against all mobs and traps in the game are almost impossible to get through without dieing or losing more than half your health. The shopping in the game for better gear or health pots are way too costly and you have to buy atleast 9k - 21k for save points?! are you kidding me? There is not enough gold to even save until you reach the boss. This game is not single player friendly at all. Got to the boss and his AI is sooo cheap. The background for each stage is narrow and too distracting from combat and mobs almost blend in too well. weapons specfications are not specfic to which characters uses which. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. BIG WASTE OF TIME.			"

												Rougelite Muramasa. Three characters, many more monsters (which you can possess), and a huge, procedurally-generated dungeon. There's a lot to love here. The visuals are gorgeous, as well. It plays more like a fighting game than a beat-em-up (it even has a cancelling system!) but most of the moves have a lot of ending lag so the controls can seem a bit sluggish. I tend do only do aerial attacks because the ending lag is cancelled when you land (pro tip!). The game can get a bit repetative and easy after sinking several hours into it. I guarantee you won't get far at level 1, but by level 50 you won't even need to put much planning into your route or items. There is also a ""nightmare"" difficulty, but I haven't tried that out yet. I would have appreciated more character variety and faster-paced fighting, but I like what they gave me anyway. Definitely worth a play.Oh, and bring a controller.			"

												So I've give enough time for this game.This is art masterpiece. Beautiful created world, I love it. Very bizzare and weird. Characters are unique. The story is interesting.Music is good, sounds are good.But, Oh, My.... the combat system is horrible. The worst combat system I've seen for very long time. Sometimes the enemeies are super easy, other times they won't give you a chance to stand up and mostly the combats are 1 versus dozens and the whole screen swarms with enemes. The A.I. is horrible and sometimes it kills itself. So the gameplay kills everything with this game. Terrible, shocking how bad it could be.Not  to mention that when you ""die"", you WILL lose all you equipement and will start all over again, unless you put special totem to a checkpoint but believe me, this totem costs a lot and you will find yourself grinding the sparce gold to get those, rather get new equipement, which is extremely hard.Bossess are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and you do little damage with the nomal weapons.You level but there is almost no use of this leveling up.There are some annoying bugs like- the game won't let you close the pop-up screen (a hint from the game) so you need to quit the level and start all over again. Other bug like from the beginning of the tutorial, the game bugged and you could not progress.This game is made for console peasants and it is not for PC MASTER race. I wonder how Gaben let this game be on steam.I got the game on humble bundle sale, two copies and at least I got the cards.Probably if you play this game in co-op, it would be much better, that someone can help you out, but I do not have a co-op partner for this game, so it sucks to be solo.To the devs, do not make this kind of games anymore. You suck at them. Go make Zeno Clash 3 or something like that.			"

												I must admit that I love every game published by Atlus, regardless of their genre or developer. This one makes no exception. It's basically a 2D version of Demon's Souls (not to diminish the designer's work, it's just to give you an idea of what kind of game to expect) with random generated areas. Very good music, wonderful art, lot of playable characters and combat styles. Unfortunately it's not a masterpiece though: the combat mechanics could have been improved and since the game is basically a fighting game this is a bit of a problem. I'm not saying that the combat is bad like I've read on many reviews, far from it. It just could have been a bit better, some animations are a bit stiff, sometimes you feel like some moves link (or not) for random reasons, sometimes you don't  feel the combat as you should and some fights are a bit cheap, depending on the combination of moves of your character compared to the opponent. In conclusion, while the game has some defects, as a whole I can recommend it without reservations, given that you like hard and demanding games.			"

												The game has an amazing gameplay, especially people that like Smash Bros will notice the similarity, it was a very cool idea to make a rogue like with fighting game oriented gameplay.There is even a VS mode, how cool is that?? hahaThe art is okay, sound is fine, the only problem is the level design got kind of boring, aside from the fights, the stage didn`t bring much of a challenge, so you guys need to work better on that. The last boss should be harder, have more mechanics, and more fun, its too dull. The fight with the king was much more fun.There is really some control issues, but is only the dodge and shield system. They need to get more fluid, its funky, and it fails to respond if you try to act too quickly.Overall it was a great experience, i hope ACE team do better in the future!			"

Ace Team has risen to the top of my favorite game company after playing this and checking out their other titles.If you are looking for a downside, it's repetitive and it lacks depth. But, again, repitition and lack of depth are strong points. This game is ultimately about jumping in and going. It can be confusing when you are unable to pick up weapons (wrong character) or you find yourself playng as either a human (you died) or an enemy (you captured its spirit). You will figure it all out though.Also, if it wasn't clear from the screenshots: This game is gorgeous!			"

												A long time Coming     Well, what can i say?  This game has some excellent qualities, and holds on to you for a bit.  One of the greatest side-scrolling hack and slash games' I've found for those thirsty for some hack and slash, without the over-the-top gore and special effects, not to say it doesnt have it's own special effects.  Probably one of the most beautiful side scrollers I've played in a loooong time, the environments are either lush, or barren, dependening how deep into the abyss you get?  There is a Beautiful Soundtrack that enhances the mood tenfold, alot of thought was put into it, with beautifully instense piano clips, and music fitting the mood, perfect for the environments you find yourself in.  The Environments follow the old platforming standart of Earth,Wind,Water, and Fire, which are gorgeously Illustrated, with deep levels of parrallax scrolling.  You can sit and pick out details in the background that look like you could just reach out and grab them, not quite on the level of Trine or Trine 2, but beautiful, and effective nonetheless.       Now here is the news on combat, you can either play this game just mashing the buttons and not get as far, but more than likely, you are going to have to develop some sort of strategy, at some point,  The game basically ramps up the difficulty to make it more of a challenge when you rank up, and it does subtle changes to the AI when the game realises you are dying waay too much.  The combat system is pretty nice it uses the Xbox 360 controller very well, all of the buttons are taken into account from the beginning.  I'll let you discover the combos on your own, it'd be a spoiler to take away the fun of discovering how deep the control scheme actually is.  I actually found it good enough to go into the ""Practice"" gamemode, This game wants you to beat it, but not too quickly.  Therein lies the good and the bad, the story is paper thin, which allows you to basically hack and slash your way through it without thinking too deeply, and adds a little emptiness and sorrow to the game, without detracting from it's character.   It sometimes gets real hard to navigate through the abyss you hit a ""hard"" room and it can be all over in one encounter (I.E. the Life that you enter the Abyss with Is all you get), which isn't bad, but you don't want to give up even if you only have 400+ health out of 2200, and you can still pick up characters that you defeat. and add them to your inventory to use in a pinch.  It's all really fun, and frustrating, which I believe it strikes a perfect balance.       In Closing, i highly recommend this game to any hack and slash platform lovers, it will not dissappoint.			"

												...excellent initial impressions - reminds me the classic 2D platformer / explorer / action type games of old (very Castlevania-esque) - great controls, graphics and sound (although a bit of tearing when moving around - I'm sure a tinker with the graphics card would resolve) - it plays and feels great! Definitely one to revisit / purchase if you have the time...			"

												I really like this game. While it is not perfect, I think it deserves a higher score. The art style is very nice and macabe, although the graphics themselves are not perfect (what's with the womans hair!?), and some animations are stiff. The gameplay is intentionally slow, and you need to choose what you do, kinda like if Castlevania and Dark Souls had a kid. It's a solid 7/10, please give it a chance.			"

												First thoughts: Street Fighter combat meets classical Art Nouveu. Finely drawn stills with clumsy polygonal animation and stunted voice acting. Welcome to a rogue-lite adventure where the combat may drive you mad, or be your cup of tea. A well planned introduction that is going to steep you in combat mechanics you either have the reflexes for or are willing to practice to obtain.Having never been competent at fighting games (I beat Street Fighter II on the SNES but once at difficulty 'III'), I admit I'm in over my head and instantly grateful for the weapon and moveset upgrading system. If I've any chance at all, that alone is to be thanked.This is a lucious game, and there's a lot to love, if you're a genre fan. Awkward voiceovers can be overlooked, the base character leveling system gives less skilled players a chance. Unfortunately the character animations are quite stilted and lack the polish that would have better integrated them into the classic, 1890s art style.For an indie, this is an impressive start but for full price this is too much to ask for casual players. This is no minor distraction, but a lore rich, gorgeously presented nightmare. Know your quarry before spending your coin.			"

												I was excited for this game when I heard one curator describe it as ""metroidvania/super smash brothers"". That's not really accurate at all. The game was clearly designed to evoke that exact comparison, though - a lot of mechanics, the art style, and even the controls are largely cribbed from the above influences.Abyss Odyssey has controls of Super Smash Brothers, but does not play at all like Super Smash Brothers. It plays like a traditional fighter: slower, methodical, combo-based. Abyss Odyssey has the look of Castlevania, but does not play at all like Castlevania. You do not explore, and the dungeon isn't really that interesting or well-designed (indeed, it's not designed at all, because it's randomly generated). I still like this game for what it is, but I do feel that the hype is misleading. If you're interested in a semi-randomly-generated sidescrolling fighter game, this is the perfect game for you!			"

												although i choose to recommend this game it just barely made it.Clonky smash bros controls is about the best way i can say explain it.Besides this the clients can run into annoying teleportation from bad sync issues to weird glitches that dont allow you to get up anymore.The main reason i recommended it is, all in all it was still fun to play with a friend this rogue like coop game. (additionally the visuals are really nice and the story isn't that bad)Also i liked the ability to turn into any enemy that is in the game through the use of their item, that you can get through buying or killing that enemy with your special move. (if you are lucky)Although the game forces you to turn on friendly fire, turn it off anyway, its way to awful and completely gives the enemy the advantage for they do not have this setting turned on.conclusion: get the discount and play it with a friend should be a good night of fun.

												I tried to play the multi-player game during the free weekend. It's glitchy to the point of being unplayable. I turned display options down and off, with no improvement, despite having a system that exceeds the reqs.You do not play the tutorial level if you jump right to multiplayer. You're left to figure out the controls on your own, and the config screen does not cover everything.You all play the same character when you start. You'd think this would make it hard to keep track of which character is yours, but it's easy to tell. You are the only one that actually walks *on* the ground, everyone else is halfway inside it.The camera is jittery and unpredictable. My screen jittered and zoomed in and out whenever I stood still while another player moved around. Like the camera couldn't decide who to focus on.Your screen displays everything you and the other players are doing. If you talk to a merchant and your friend talks to a guard, your screen will display your friend's conversation and the merchant inventory screen. When you're done with the merchant, you also have to close the conversation with the guard.During the first fight I...was knocked out? I'm not really sure. My character was lying on the ground, had over 700 health, sort of flickered in and out of existence and would not get moving again. I quit at this point.The game has an interesting concept and the art is lovely, but the gameplay feels extremely amateurish and the number of bugs encountered within a couple minutes have me wondering why this was released as anything other than early access.

												Abyss Odyssey is amazing. It's a rogue lite action game that sort of resembles Super Smash Brosh in its control scheme. Simple but elegant. The game has some bugs though, the end boss is rather lame and the controls aren't sublime either, but despite this it's one of the best games I've played in a while. The reason is Abyss Odyssey is one of those games that prove that games can be art too, and that art doesn't have to be all that pretentious and self-important. Abyss Odyssey is a piece of art that's fun.The game has plenty of weird and interesting characters, like the duck man, the bull that shoots laser and samba Zorro. On top of that you can use all of them yourself. So although there are only three main characters, there's plenty of others you can use. The atmosphere is odd and mysterious. Its set in the Chilean civil war, there's the devil playing the fiddle, you can steal the shopkeeper's soul. You never know what you're gonna see next. The voice acting isn't that great though, but there's not much of it anyways.The extra life system is quite ingenious as well. When your main character dies, a Chilean soldier appears, and you can control him. If you find a shrine, you can revive the character. It feels weird at first, but it's more interesting than the traditional ""lose one life""-thing. There's also two player co-op that's fun and chaotic.Like I said earlier, Abyss Odyssey has some bugs, so it's not perfect, but despite playing it just left me happy, because I felt like I experienced something new and exciting. I've played hundreds of different games in my life, and games nowadays rarely make me feel like I did when I was 10; this one managed it. Abyss Odyssey is some group's incomprehensible Dantean vision which I was happy to share.			"

												Full review here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/07/13/abyss-odyssey-quick-dirty-review/TL;DR:Abyss Odyssey is an interesting game that has some great story concepts, cool art, and serviceable combat. If you enjoy Super Smash Bros., you'll likely feel comfortable picking it up, as the controls are almost identical. However, since it's not actually a fighting game, and you're only playing the part of Smash Bros. that's tacked on to add value (adventure mode, etc), it doesn't give much reason to keep playing after the first couple runs. The short amount of time I spent with it was satisfying for what it was, but there's not enough here to make me keep coming back. Pick it up for pennies and enjoy it between your bigger, more involved games.			"

												I picked this game up a while ago in a bundle and it's been sitting around for a few months so decided to finally pick it up and give a try. I had played ACE games before and am a huge fan so I was really excited going into and I wasn't dissapointed. Beautful art style and sound design with a small but interesting story, The one area I can see people having a hard time with are the controls and combat. The controls are similar to a beat em up game and can take some getting used to in the setting, very similar to playing Super Smash Bros. They can feel clunky at times and jumping can be a test of patience but once you get passed learning the control there is a wonderful game there and lots of fun to be had and a high level of replayability.

Like I said, it's not a BAD game but It couldn't hold my concentration for more than 30 minutes. I can't quite put my finger on it but it just seems so bland and boring. There's nothing to keep you wanting more, at best it's incredibly MEDIOCRE. TL;DR: Not GOOD, Not BAD. JUST AVERAGE. Give it a shot if you must.			"

The randomized structure of the game and the degree of persistent growth takes a bit to get used to, but its worth the journey.The only thing that really bothered me at first are the controls, partly because you cant bind movement to D pad and partly because the enemies seem to read your inputs at higher levels, which makes some of the fights very frustrating.All in all, really nice game especially for the price.

Despite somewhat clumsy controls and sometimes poor level design (unavoidable traps and sudden attacks from out of screen, seriously?) it is a fun and quality game.The game has three playable characters, each with different customizable attacks, weapons and playing style, and lots of enemies. One of the features I loved is the game's original take at granting lives to the player: you do not have several lives per se, but can capture enemy souls and play as them. While story  is optional in a game like that, you can have it in form of a journal, which is a nice read and gives background on the nightmares you meet as you go deeper into the Abyss.			"

												In a nutshell:* There are three characters, two of which need to be unlocked* Each character has three regular attacks as well as three special attacks, one of which is ranged. The rest are melee attacks.* The special attacks are upgradable.* You can find or buy weapons with special effects in the Abyss. Each character has a different weapon type. Weapons can give enemies different status effect like poison them, set them on fire etc.* The gold you find carries over between games, requiring you to do some forward planning.* You can plan your path through the Abyss. Usually the choice is between a faster and an easier route.* It is possible to capture and collect enemies, but I'm not sure what the point of it is.* There is a co-op mode, but I haven't tried it.I found the enemies pretty challenging, even after I got the hang of the game. Fighting enemies is also the main way to get health and mana - potions are pretty scarce - so you'll need to fight a lot. The variety of enemies, the fact that you get multiple enemies at once and the random environments make every fight different. Because of this, the game never feels repetitive. 4/5.			"

It is simple, and I think that is key here. The art is fantastic, audio well done, theme is very neat and gameplay simple yet deep.Simple and beautiful. I have only played as the main character a bit, however overall I enjoy it. The varying levels of difficulty that go through the descent make for a bit of a challenge. I feel that this would be a good game to play with a friend for a lazy evening. My issues with the game probably criticize the same things that I praise it for. I wish that a replay weren't so vanilla. There are only three characters to use, and levels don't change much on average. I am already feeling replay fatigue, so I don't see this game really getting a lot more time. Pick this up in the current humble bundle (2 keys!) or get it on sale for $5 or less.

												Im only an hour and a half into this game, and I'm already having a blast. One of the best features is that it has couch co op. Hook up two gamepads, and you and a friend can play through the main story together. And trust me, you will need all the help you can get. Combat is geniunely deep, and you can't button mash your way to victory. Attempting to do so results in you getting steamrolled by the enemies, who have full movesets just like you do. An interesting mechanic is that characters essentially have three ""layers"" that must be destroyed before they die. The top layer is the stolen soul of an enemy. You can capture enemies and become them, being able to use their unique moveset and stats. But when you run out of health you go to the secpond layer, which is one of the three heroes you chose to play as. Finally, if you lose as your hero, you end up as an emergency character, and your goal is to now find an alter to revive yourself. Should you fail, and die as the emergency characyer you are kicked back to the first floor of the abyss, money and skills intact, to try again. the atmosphere is beautiful, and truly dreamlike, and the audio is amazing. There are some issues with the yells and screams in combat getting grating, but thats not a huge issue.			"

												This will be my first review so while I am not the best at it I do want to share my small inputI waited weeks and weeks for the release of this game anticipating its release. Lets just say that I was not disappointed at all. I assume the description of the game above would suffice so I won't touch much on describing the setting or the events. I would like to start with the music, a core for such fantasy games if I do say so myself. This game has a rather memorable sound track that more then fits the setting and resounds with you as the adventurer traveling deep within the abyss. whether you are traveling through cold crystalized caverns or through the hot and humid depths covered with foliage and jungle vines the music seems to pop out and speak well with the player.  I rather like orchestra based music so a 9/10 will be my ratingThe graphics and art style are a good choice for such a game. The enviroment seems to pop and speak out very nicely. Not much else to say about the graphics so we will leave it with an 8/10Now the gameplay is what I liked the most. It reminded me of games like retro castlevenia with the side scrolling adventuring elements along with the diverse baddies and ability system. Its got a wonderful feel that I feel would have great replay value and while I keep dying and respawning just to die again I still have not felt that replay value lower for me. The AI is fun and advanced from the easy all the way to the hard floors and I have found no true patterns to their movement and attacks. oh.. I forgot to mention that you also have the ability to play as the enemies but that is only possible if you have obtained their soul through purchase of a merchant in the abyss or through a lucky drop. I would also like to say that you have no ability to collect equipment and that if you die you start back at ground zero, your levels and abilities stay at their respective level and status along with your gold value but your items themselves are lost to the abyss until you buy them or find them again.9/10 since it offers great gameplay and at a high replay valueMultiplayer seems to be finicky for me. If I invite my own friend or brother it will work fine but if I join another person or they join me it has a lagfest now and then. I do love the support of several players on the same PC and since I just so happen to have several controllers laying around I gotta say, this is a very useful feature. It just so happens that you can also attack your allies so in a fight sometimes it is best to isolate yourself away from your ally unless you can find a safe approach.  5/10 but when it is working 10/10Music - 9/10Graphics - 8/10gameplay - 9/10Multiplayer - 5/10 but if working 10/10Overall this game is amazing for its price and I would recommend it to anybody who is looking into buying it. You can add me to play with me if you want ;D "

												Haven't had so much fun since I don't remember when. Abyss Odyssey is a very stylish and good looking melee platformer with somewhat procedural levels. Yes, it can be beaten in a few hours, but it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. And the journey is very enjoyable. Each of the three characters plays differently and has responsive controls. The levels are very nicely done with some twisted and beatifully looking monsters. It is a game to play through and come back to.			"

												I got this on the humble bundle store on sale, and I've enjoyed it quite a bit. It's got many interesting aspects and if you're thinking about buying this, then go for it, you won't regret it. I will however give you a heads up.As someone who plays online A LOT, as you might guess I have friends all over the world, while most games are fine across the world, this game falls into the catagory of low latency required. Even though it's only a co-op game, and that would allow for a much better netcode, the devs have gone for something that doesn't compensate for lag well at all.If you join a game with a high ping, expect to fall though floors, hit/get hit often by your co-op mate. In general you're in for a bad time. This all would be a non-issue if friendly fire wasn't needed on, but if you want your progress to contribute, then you're going to need to keep it on. It's only a small issue in an otherwise very good game.			"

												            I'm 5 hrs in, and unlocked the 2nd character. I like this game a lot. Don't let the reviews whining about ""clunky controls"" turn you away. Use a controller, as it's a platfromer / brawler, and using a keyboard would just be silly.  This game operates on a combo system, so if you start a combo, your character finishes it before you can do a different move (you will unlock up to 3 combo-interrupts later on to cirumvent this).              To avoid getting killed, PLAN YOUR FIGHTS OUT. Button mashers will die. BLOCK, DODGE and STRIKE when an opening apears. THINK FIRST, and you'll find the controls work just fine. I'm excited to keep playing. Snatch this one up while it's on sale, though I'd argue it's worth the full price :) .			"

												I can't recommend this game, but not because it's bad.  For what it is it's quite good.  The combat system is a great synthesis of a brawler and Smash Bros. style combat with a few twists, though it does take some getting used to.  The visuals and sounds are both good with some minor issues that don't really detract from the experience.  There are also some questionable design choices, such as the oft maligned ""camp token"" save system, but the game's easy enough to complete without needing them.My issue is the length and longevity of the game.  I put about ten hours into the game, beat it with each of the three base characters and there's just not enough left in it to make replaying worthwhile.  It doesn't have the variety of most roguelikes to give it a  lot of replayability, there's just not enough characters, items, enemies, or floor layouts.  There's a harder difficulty you can play on and three seperate entrances to the abyss to start from, but I just don't think it justifies the fifteen dollar price tag.  Pick it up on sale and put your time into it and you'll find a game with deep combat but not enough longevity to make great use of it.  A good setting and memorable protagonists (I love the ghost monk), but it doesn't do enough with them.			"

												I love this game.  It's a mix of Smash Bros. and Castlevania with some roguelike elements.  The gameplay is addictive and the artwork is gorgeous.  The setting is completely unique - seriously, what other game has done Chilean folklore in 1800s underground Santiago?The controls might seem awkward at first, but give it a chance.  If you're familiar with Smash Bros. then the fighting will make sense to you, but the controls still take some getting used to.  I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard.  Grab a controller and give it a chance!  It takes some skill, but eventually you'll be gracefully double jumping through the air and doing 10 hit combos.This is the sort of game that is fun to play over and over again.  There's tons of stuff to unlock, and each playthrough is slightly different.  I probably beat the game 20+ times.  So, that's the type of game it is.  It's sort of like FTL, where you want to play again and again.(Note: I often play games in offline mode, so my gameplay time shown on Steam isn't accurate.  I've played more than that.)			"

												I was a bit on the wall about this game, I had played a few other sidescroll procedurally generated games similar to this, but for some reason this one really draws me in. It is simple, and I think that is key here. The art is fantastic, audio well done, theme is very neat and gameplay simple yet deep.Simple and beautiful. I have only played as the main character a bit, however overall I enjoy it. The varying levels of difficulty that go through the descent make for a bit of a challenge. I feel that this would be a good game to play with a friend for a lazy evening. My issues with the game probably criticize the same things that I praise it for. I wish that a replay weren't so vanilla. There are only three characters to use, and levels don't change much on average. I am already feeling replay fatigue, so I don't see this game really getting a lot more time. Pick this up in the current humble bundle (2 keys!) or get it on sale for $5 or less. Much more is up to you depending on if you really like the game.			"

												Im only an hour and a half into this game, and I'm already having a blast. One of the best features is that it has couch co op. Hook up two gamepads, and you and a friend can play through the main story together. And trust me, you will need all the help you can get. Combat is geniunely deep, and you can't button mash your way to victory. Attempting to do so results in you getting steamrolled by the enemies, who have full movesets just like you do. An interesting mechanic is that characters essentially have three ""layers"" that must be destroyed before they die. The top layer is the stolen soul of an enemy. You can capture enemies and become them, being able to use their unique moveset and stats. But when you run out of health you go to the secpond layer, which is one of the three heroes you chose to play as. Finally, if you lose as your hero, you end up as an emergency character, and your goal is to now find an alter to revive yourself. Should you fail, and die as the emergency characyer you are kicked back to the first floor of the abyss, money and skills intact, to try again. the atmosphere is beautiful, and truly dreamlike, and the audio is amazing. There are some issues with the yells and screams in combat getting grating, but thats not a huge issue.			"

												I'll admit, I wasn't sure I was going to like this game at first. The difficulty curve is steep if you're a noob at fighting games, and the rogue-like elements seem to only exacerbate that fact. Eventually, I started to get better at it, and I've even learned a thing or two about how fighting games operate, though I'm still largely a button-masher. My opinion of the game changed from mild dislike, to neutral, to active enjoyment. I'm glad I gave it a chance.Things I liked:+ Characters+ Light, yet enjoyable story that you need to play to discover+ Smooth combat mechanics+ Art style+ Every enemy is playable (nearly)+ Plenty of randomly generated secrets to findThings I didn't like:- Only 3 characters are selectable to start your game, two of which need unlocking- Forgettable soundtrack- Lack of variety to the power ups- The game doesn't do a good job of teaching you about the characters' abilities, though this is saved somewhat by an excellent tutorial by the devs on the steam forums. I had no idea there were more than 3 selectable ""moves"" for each character.Overall, I liked this game and while I'd hesitate at full price, when it's on sale, it's a bargain. I don't know if its fighting game elements are good from the perspective of someone who likes fighting games, as I'm awful at them. I do, however, love a good beat-em-up, and based on that, I ended up enjoying the fighting game elements when applied to that. Plays a bit like the beat-em-up mode in Tekken 3, or the adventure mode in Smash Bros.			"

												Abyss Odyssey has some beautiful graphics, but is ruined by horridly clunky controls. They take some serious getting used to. When using rapiers or another sword, your best to attack with some distance between yourself and the target, else the move will phase through the enemy and be ineffective. Once you get used to the controls, you'll be golden, since the art style is enough to make you want to come back. But with better controls that responded more purely this game could've become a nice cult hit, instead of a love-it-or-hate-it game with above average art.			"

												The concept and art of this game is good. But there are so many bugs I can't get past such as: AI issues, control issues, and general interactions with characters that just don't work. They had a great idea, but they didn't care if it was a quality product or not. Really disappointing...AI: Somehow know what you are doing as you are doing it, have incredibly fast reaction times in attacking and blocking, and difficulty levels of enemies do not match the difficulty of the level you are on. Control issues: Sometimes your character decides not to jump or block or dodge when you ask them to. Interactions: I think I've had two friendly soldiers freeze and kick me out of interaction with themI haven't even played the game for an hour and I ran into all these issues.

												I call this the Dark Souls of side-scrolling brawlers because of its difficulty level and how every move counts; attacking too early leaves you wide open for competent enemies capable of dodging, blocking and smart attacks. Abyss Odyssey is one beautiful game in design and combat with well-detailed classical art featuring creatures & lore from Chilean myth that makes for  a refreshing experience. You have the option of 3 playable main characters (2 that need to be unlocked) with the ability to capture the ""soul"" of enemy creatures with a special ability involving a full mana bar, thereby being able to play as these creatures in your dungeon run and versus mode. Also dat soundtrack.  A word of warning, play with a controller because with keyboard the character response timing will feel extra slow which adds to frustrating difficulty.			"

												Great game.There are three main warriors to play as, and they each have the ability to recruit enemies to their side using mana. You can only hold one recruited monster, and it is easy to switch between your main and the monster. Each character in the game has their own moves, and are well animated.The soundtrack is very nice.A powerful warlock sleeps in the bottom of the Abyss, and it's up to the warriors to end the nightmare. The story mode is very short, and can be beaten rather quickly. But I played it more than once, so I can say it has decent replayability. Plays well, and the multiplayer mode is fun too. Local co-op and versus is a great feature.			"

The goal or direction of the game is unclear other than you need to 'banish the darkness' and the controls feel largely unresponsive to key presses. Combat itself feels routine in the encounters I have experienced and the platforming elements need to be tweaked. Like I said before I felt I had purchased a complete game but it doesn't feel that way at all. It is currently on sale so I do not feel cheated by any means I just feel that I didn't get what I was expecting when I purchased the game.			"

												Plays similar to smash bros, but combat is not fluid enough (using KB + mouse) and enemies hit you in the middle of a roll/dodge. Co-op is impossible with the friendly fire - ON settingEarly on a lot of enemies are bullet sponges that don't get knocked back from hits, but simply absorb them before counter-attacking in the middle of your attacks. Some enemies dont show any visual hints about their attacks, so there is quite a lot of trial and error involved. You can't quickly hit or turn backwards to hit an enemy before it hits you in close combat as there is some delay in turning to attack. Some ledges have very tight hit detection and you might have to ""fall"" to the ledges in order to grab them. You have to be turned the right way to grab the ledge (can't turn mid-air), too.After the first few rooms you don't find much any NPCs to talk to or chests to loot for coins, so you can't even afford a camp token (checkpoint) for a long while - especially if you've spent just a little bit on equipment. After playing quite a lot further, you unlock a checkpoint with a token vendor that sells camp tokens for a lower price. This allows you to progress much more safely, especially when certain soul transformations (for example the mimic) can cheese through the enemies easily.I was looking to mainly play this in co-op, but it didn't work out. I don't recommend the game.			"

												When i played this game i could see the devs saying ""hey let's make a smash bros clone with some dungeon crawler element on it!"" and halfway through the project they realised how difficult was to actually make the fluid game play of smash was and decided to release the game with them half done.The game feels clunky and slow, the attacks hitboxes hit all the wrong places (one time, i had the foward attack miss the two guys right in front of me but hit a enemy behind me) the specials all start instantly and kinda end halfway leaving a very shallow experience on the player.The dodges and block feel underwhelming and heavy, and there is no complexity to the attacking and comboing mechanics.The main mechanic of the game is actually useless and you will be better off using your main character instead of the monsters.In the end, it's a game that has a lot of potencial, but squander it because the devs clearly don't have the expertise necessary to pull it through.

												Abyss Odyssey, it's a game you'll have to get used to before you can really enjoy it.I'm not saying it's bad, this game is REALLY fun and rewarding especially once you've got a hang of the controls.The game is paced like your average rogue-lite these days, delve into a dungeon that's randomized everytime (although currently the biomes for the dungeon always stay the same) fight things to get exp and money, use money to buy weapons, potions, camp tokens (Checkpoints) along the way and try to reach the end to defeat the Warlock.However some bits stick out, the game lets you keep all your gold through all your runs so no matter how much you fail, you'll always have your gold to buy better gear at the start with. Another thing is that your level is kind of... Not integrated with Roguelike elements. Basically it kind of starts getting a bit more like an RPG where dieing is a part of the game until you get strong enough. Your level never resets, letting you grind until you can just beat the game by having too high of a level, which lets you have more and more HP.BUT! Then another element comes into play, where beating the game isn't the goal anymore. You see, this game has a ""Capturing"" system that lets you take the souls of monsters your level or below and transform into them. Your mindset shifts from ""I want to beat the Warlock"" to ""I want to capture and BECOME the Warlock"". Of course, the Warlock is at a high level, 70.Now, from a gaming standpoint without having played this or something with a similar ""let you play as everything"" system like Guardian Heroes, you'd think, ""Why would I play as monsters? Aren't they usually weaker than players?"" In Abyss Odyssey, everything has the potential to be as good and if not better than the three player characters. Especially considering how free form this game's mechanics are. By that, I mean there's no limits or gimmicks with anything. Every single enemy and also the players all apply to the same Smash Bros. like combat mechanics, so everything can be grabbed and thrown no matter if it's the final boss or a random goon or even the player, everything has the same amount of fighting moves (the Heroes have more but you can only equip 3 at a time), and every enemy and player feel like they are strong enough to be able to go through the game. Of course, later monsters and bosses are more powerful but nothing feels too much like super weak throw away trash.This mechanic also works it's way into earlier gameplay as well because monsters you capture have their own seperate health bars, you can only have one monster soul at a time but the game lets you switch to them at any time so they can either give you another character to play as in that run totaling to 3 (Hero, Soldier, Monster) increasing your survivability and letting you delve deeper.Overall, I'd say this game is... Very niche. You have to like a lot of different game mechanics from various other games to really enjoy this. The game fights like Smash Bros. handles rogue-lites a bit like Rogue Legacy, platforms through dungeon areas like a Metroid-vania, lets you play as anything in the game (except small bugs that die in 1 hit) like Guardian Heroes or Code of Princess, and it also has Three Player Co-op with three characters that handle very differently almost giving it a Trine-ish feel, especially with the Art style.If all of that in a jumble seems really awesome to you, there's no way you won't like this game, but if all of that sounds like it'd clash and make everything awkward and the game kind of... just flat out weird, I'd avoid it.Still, for only $15, it's got enough content to match if not, surpass it's price point. Especially with the new content that was slyly promised for everyone beating the Warlock enough times.[EDIT]Friendly fire is now toggleable but if you have it off you won't contribute to breaking the Warlocks mask. Think of it like a practice mode.Dungeon variety could still use some more randomization since Biomes are still stationary, otherwise, it's a pretty enjoyable experience, especially with a friend.

												TL:DRITS MORE LIKE NEUTRAL REVIEW.Game is beautifulSoundtrack is amazingbut gameplay is 'meh'.Most of the time you will die because its insanely hard to control your character.Controls in 'Help' section are displayed using xbox pad symbols. (not very #PCMR)Game is very complex but there is no tutorial. I had to alt tab all time to see what thing 'x' does. For example: You can save using checkpoint tokens. I discovered it like after 1 hour. But how can I get one? I had to google this. [You can buy before starting 'dungeon run'. But there are 3 types of these tokens. And again its not explained, how they are different from each other]I was hyped for 'soul capturing' system. (capture soul of enemy and play as it). There was no notification that I can do it and how to. Again I had to google this.I read like 3 tutorials and still nothing. Combat is worst part: I ended with mashing left mouse button and exploiting AI by standing on the wall/platform. I am unable to land 3 hit combo. Maybe with gamepad it would be easier/possible.And worst thing about combat: I cannot force my character to look at right(proper) direction. Many many times I was fighting air instead of enemies.Dying is frustrating cause in most cases, it is caused by unresponsive controls.And yes, I was playing it during free week. But please do something with controls and combat and I will buy it.			"

												I see a lot of people having problems with the controls, let me justify.Aside from the game being ABSOLUTELY beautiful in both sound, art, and mechanic design (I’ll get to this later), the controls are evidently the tipping point for how much the average person enjoys this game.First of all, don’t play using a keyboardSecond of all, in my experience the xbone controller is great with this gameThird of all, stop complaining about what you can’t utilize wellI will explain, but first, some background; I first played through dark souls with a mouse and keyboard. it wasn’t very hard at all. I just had to get used to the control scheme and visually map out what my hands would do the instant a certain action on the screen would occur. From here I gained and eventually had strong instinct in my movement, even while enduring the hardest of boss battle patterns I’ve come across in dark souls. The problem that most people have in related to the controls of dark souls in using a keyboard, is that nothing works well and it requires too much thought to map out the visual que to the hand movements. Say jumping from windows 7 to windows 8 for instance, everything is better in windows 8 (EVERYTHING) but the ones who enjoy it in the end have a inky dinky windows 7 start menu program running and the ones who really don’t enjoy it say so because the god damn start menu is different. (Insofar, people who enjoy DS use a controller because it presents a much easier learning curve)I feel it tooWith these example scenarios (I could go on but I digress), the problem in the controls lies within a deep crevasse that in some way, disjoints the expectation of combat, and the reality. Being a super smash bros player for quite some time, I can tell that there are a lot of scenarios involving a much too specific time frame in executing an attack in order to fight proficiently. For the time I have spent playing this game, I may have encountered 6-7 situations where I actually feel sluggish because I instinctually committed to my next attack when an odd ending buffer proceeding an attack was still activated and overlaid the next button I pressed. I ended up falling to the ground, having done nothing as an enemy stands beside me.This sluggishness I felt really threw me for a loop as I did not expect it, but this doesn’t mean I can’t understand it. Every time this scenario happened I understood exactly how the mess of me losing 400 hp in a style uncanny to that of Oedipus's downfall came about.The style I would assume most people desire is that of faster paced action and blazing up enemies that were weak, and having a challenging time calculating the pattern of the strong enemies. This does not happen in this game. Period. The AI, somewhat fun to play with, tend to predict your next action right as you commit to it, and this requires deep thought into what would make this fight easier for you. At this point, I fireball a guy and he dashes towards me then I jab him, I think this would start to get boring if I put in a couple more hours. Back to the point though, most people would not think of this as an actual technique in the fight as it involves subconsciously predicting the systematic error that the developer created for the AI. The AI is incredibly bad in a sense that they know what move you might pull within a millisecond and so most people would do away with trying to efficiently combat this systematic error. ""Fix the [heartheartheart] controls"" is the next thought process because in order to combat the AI at this point is to have luck, hardcore desire for achieving, and deep active thinking. I don’t mean to undermine anyone who think the controls produce a steeper than normal learning curve (because they do), I’m just saying that it can still be learned even in an environment as effective as this game's, and learn it I did.But who has time for deep critical thinking when I just want to play games? let’s just give up right now because pressing the controls feel sluggish and between each attack, filled with hundreds of milliseconds (in a sense, bear with me) in desync between the user calculating his next move and emulating near instinct for enemies' patterns is morally crushing as they just come right back at you with a simple, 1 turn 100% prediction. Its psychological at this point in how people feel towards the combat of this game as well as its perceived sluggishness (maybe I’m just a good player as I only had 6-7 occasions where I wasn’t proficient (because of the desync, in which I noticed) in dealing with enemies up in the air, beside me, and/or firing a projectile at me at the same time)Run ons for days, boys, because this game is actually really good and unfortunately the enjoyment in its combat is based on how the average person deals with its near necessities. It may seem like I’m saying the combat is restrictive, but it’s not.The sheer mechanical design in terms of the games combat intricacies and how each ability/movement is nearly woven with the next alongside the characters in which envelope the quilt, pleases me greatly. It does so because in getting past the debilitative learning curve in learning why you feel so sluggish, the combat starts to open up new opportunities for combos because you start to feel relieved that you don’t actually suck at the game and you don’t tilt as much (tilting would lead to one mashing buttons and none of them would actually make a pattern here as a byproduct of how the combat system works). You can weave your own patterns and still be effective against a part of the systematic error within the AI. This is what, in my opinion, allows for the winning edge to be had in most fights in both actually winning fair and square, and feeling good about it. I see many people saying how they just smash and bash their enemies against the wall because it’s… [Necessary I suppose?]I feel this correlates to how people feel in the keyboard controls of dark souls and in switching from windows 7 to windows 8. One, because the learning curve for both are so steep that some don’t even want change in the first place (dark souls: take me back to where I have a controller in third person please. windows 7-8: take me back where there’s a start menu that I ""learned"" how to use my entire life please.) you see my point? there is an artificial learning curve for this game caused in the developer's lack of forethought (these are probably very inaccurate accusations, sorry cool guy/guys who enjoy actively updating this game in order to get out of the 68% (now 67%) rating crap hole) that has been evidently present because people don’t want to learn why things happen and just want to do what they already know.Those are pretty much my thoughts on why the general player base feels the need to act out and state why they feel that the controls are so bad (thanks for being vague guys, rock on).Also, I love the otherworldly kind of phases in which you change into a character (such as a skeleton or metal golem, or something else I’ve only gone through 2 of these zones) with a completely different move set as the walls and ground tremble in a sweet droopy mess  around you in a unique black and white fixture.Concluding StatementI give this game a 9/10, with a 10/10 sufficing if not for the negative connotation provided by unfortunate souls who can’t take 3 seconds to assess the games current abstract situation. (Much as dark souls with keyboard or windows 8 with metro theme/tiles)I'm going to buy this game now, thanks awesome developer(s?) for your hard work. I hope that through my means this post does not offend you in your ways of bringing such a great overall feel and concept alive. Peace			"

												It's not often that I fall victim to the ""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!1!"" routine, but when I saw the trailer for this, I almost threw my wallet at the monitor.  I mean, it looks like a Metroidvania with multiple characters and it's made by Atlus.  Impulse-bought.Having said that, it's not a true Metroidvania, but I'll get to that in a second.-Similar games:  Azure Tower, 2D Castlevania games, Rogue LegacyPros:-The art and animations are BEAUTIFUL.  I mean, really gorgeous.  All the assets.  Sound is also fantastic, the guitar strings are particularly well done and haunting.-Jumping/Double-jumping are spot on, a must for a platformer.-The combat system is deceptively simple and can be compared to your standard fighting game.  Attacking, specials, block and grab for any opponent who is blocking.  The best part is that ALL the enemies have these abilities, and you had better believe that if you're leaning on that block button too hard, you're going to get throw and probably comboed.  Best enemy combat for this kind of game I have ever seen.-One of the core game mechanics is to switch your character with a monster you have captured - they then have their own fighting moves as listed above, and there are versus and co-op modes where you can adventure with a friend or fight them, and the playing field is relatively even no matter what character/monster you choose.-Upon death, you respawn as a city guard and have to fight your way to the nearest altar to resurrect into your main character.  Pretty innovative, though the guards could be a little better at jumping.-ZERO BUGS.  Phenomenally clean release.  Altus keeps up the quality.Cons:-Though this looks like a Metroidvania in the trailer, it's not.  All the levels in the abyss are generic platforming sections with traps - your standard fare.  The backgrounds, though they change, do not affect the level play one iota - no monster is specific to a level theme unless you count the frozen fish.  So it's basically reskins all the way down the abyss, and there's no innovation in the level design at all.-The levels of experience are almost inconsequential.  Once you become good at the fighting system, this game becomes much easier, and I didn't notice much difference in the levels going down once I became semi-decent at getting combos.-Even though the game includes a training mode, this game could have benefitted from a tutorial and there was ample opportunity (with ALL, not just some, of the control scheme and abilities you have right off the bat) to present one in the prologue.  For example, I did not know I would dodge using the left and right shoulder buttons until I saw it in the menu, since the game only tells you to use the block+direction method.Neutral:-The story is sorta meh.  I get what they were going for, but there's no storytelling impact in finding random journal pages.  Outside of the intro wherein the heroine explains what she is and her purpose through expositional dialogue, I encountered almost no storyline in my playtime.Bottom line:  This game lives and dies on its fighting mechanic and ability to switch characters, and thankfully this is executed really well.  Though all the levels are pretty much interchangable and uninspiring, the challenge is constant and fast-paced, and unlocking new characters is rewarding even if obtaining them can be difficult.  Recommended at its current price, and can't wait to play co-op and versus.			"

												Invaded insane Warlock's nightmare as the manifestation of the souls killed in previous attempts to ""soothe"" his sleep habits. Met up with attractive looking female from Warlock's dream. killed lots of other dreams, felt good about it. accidently threw female into pit of darkness, felt good about it. Fought hordes off as a skeletal mimic in a shadowy monster arena with female, who was replaced by a ultra disgusting zombie body, felt . . . okay about it. Several dead shadows, giants, and animals later . . . died horribly, felt . . . it. Female brought me back several rooms of monsters later, so we could suffer more, felt great about it. Finally confronted and slew sleep man with his nightmares, felt victorious. upon emerging back into reality to attempt the quest again, brutally murdered by eyeball infested Manticore, best . . fight . . . ever. 12/10 would crush dreams again			"

												Couldn't really get into this game.  Sorta was expecting it to be fun like dust or bloodrayne.   But it isn't like those games.   It is sorta the control hell of assassins creed one where the monsters just dodge or block and one gets stuck fighting them for way too long.   Also, the maps seem randomly generated so there is not much of a sense of geography.  It is cool that there is a bunch of voice acting.But the tedious crawl and difficult controls just spoiled it for me.			"

												Currently I would give this game a 3/10.  I had high hopes for it, but I felt the game play was clunky, and had a moderate level of bugs.Clunkiness:The simple act of jumping on ledges or platforms is needlessly difficult.  Often times it takes me 5 attempts or more to jump up a wall just to progress to the next area.  Fighting, in my opinion, doesn't feel skill-based, it just feels random.  I am still a novice at the game, but speaking as someone who has a degree in animation I felt that the enemies lack anticipation and signals that might give you queues on how to fight them. Blocking, dodging, throwing, attacking- they all seem instant and unpredictable, so fights end up feeling more like a dice roll than anything you can handle skillfuly. Bugs:A friend and I were attempting to play co-op, but we had to host the game 4 times before it was even remotely playable.  Typically we'd load up the game, and one of us wouldn't be able to see enemies or platforms.  Even when we resolved this issue, one of us still wouldn't be able to see certain in game items like keys.Design:I'm not a fan of the segmented stages (Metroid like), mainly because each individual stage doesn't seem to have a purpose or goal.  You progress through one stage,  kill a few guys, maybe see a vendor- and then the stage ends with out any real kind of punctiation.  What is the purpose of splitting the game up into these segments if each one is the same as the one before it. There are unique encounters, but they are far too rare.			"

												If you're looking for a roguelike type game, you could do a lot worse.This one isn't great, but I have to give em points for a fairly neat concept - a 2.5D game that feels a bit like Diablo, but every time you die, the dungeon resets (and no, I'm not referring to Diablo III, get that out of your head, I refer to the first game here). It's got the same idea as the Cathedral.The controls are... um... awful. I hate to say it, but they just straight up are. I wouldn't really want to play this with a keyboard. I've played games of a 'certain type' which have better controls than this. The only way I can describe the combat, is like if you took Super Smash, and then made it really really really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slow, took out sprinting, and then made it awful to boot. Now, to be as specific as possible when explaining the controls, it feels unresponsive because of all the animations, and the way that animations differ in speed wildly all on the same character is utterly bizarre.Let me explain. So the first character you have, she has a sword. She has a few abilities, one of which is an uppercut, which is executed extremely quick. Her basic attacks are slow as hell. Her fireball is molasses by comparison, and same with her spin attack. She plays like Link from Smash, basically, but somehow worse.The combat is just tolerable. It's not fun. That's what drags this game down. It's just, mash your attack button, or spam your specials, and hope the enemy dies. You can't really play this on a fightstick, it's not that kind of game. It's like a... brawler. So I need to use my DS3 or whatever. And that sucks, because even then the control scheme is awful. So many wasted buttons.I have seen enough games done right to sort of judge the storyline and atmosphere as average at best. Pretty stock standard stuff, ""I'm gonna save the world"" and all that. Not in so few words, but that's what it boils down to. The graphics are pretty awful for the Unreal Engine in 2014 - I've definitely seen better.The soundtrack is... not that great. People like it, eh, it's alright. It's about as passable as everything else in this game.All in all though, I still can recommend this game. It's not a bad game, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just... okay.If you can pick it up on the cheap, maybe give it a go if you're really a die-hard roguelike fan.			"

												Beware of controller bugs!!!  I have died several times when my character could do no longer move left or right (until a game restart) and other times the controller is dead until the game restarts.  Also, the enemy AI basically cheats to be good (controller input reading) and your ability to response feels... clunky.  I also do not like games like this that do not place enemies but instead wall you off temporarily and spam enemies at you.  I also think this game is yet another in along series of random-map games that doesnt really do much to make you feel like it was hand crafted - at some point someone had to innvoate in this sub-genre!  To sum it all up - most of the time when I am getting hit, I do not feel like it is my fault, and the enemy AI and placement leaves something to be desired, as does the level design (however the art and music are a 20 out of 10!!!). EDIT - I will give the game major props for addictiveness.  Even though I think it would need some work before I could really love it, I am still feeling this odd pull to play it again!EDIT 2 - I wouldnt mind a game like this in a more metroidvania setup up (large, open worlds, random if possible, determined if not).

												Interesting concept. It's like Rogue Legacy, Torchlight, and Smash Bros mechanics jumbled into a pile and painted by Castlevania's lead artist. I recommend it if you like dungeon crawlers and rogue-lites. Someone explained that it was like a metroidvania, but really it's not at all. It's an infinite dungeon crawler, which changes every time you die. The attack/dodge mechanics feel pretty stiff unfortunately. Attacking is done in combos by pressing the attack button or special attack with directions in certain patterns similar to Smash Brothers. Even more similarities include shielding, rolling, fast falling, attack-cancelling, short-hopping, and grabbing. Most of which really slow down the game and make it slog a bit when progressing in fights. Enemies can do all of these things too, which makes it really frustrating when there are four on a screen at a time all attacking or shielding you. What's really pulling me to play more is the art style which looks beautiful.In the end what's here isn't a perfect gem, but it does have some pulling game elements. I'd recommend for someone who likes dungeon crawlers or Smash Brothers-esque combat.			"

												Tonight I beat this game six times in a row, and I plan on doing it all again. I really enjoy this game. The character and level designs alone are worth at least looking at YouTube videos of the game. The game itself is pretty fun to play on top of that. I'm really not the biggest rougue-like fan out there, but this one has me. On the positive side the combat is fun. It's not at all natural in how the characters turn. That is a giant flaw in the system, but when you figure out ways around it that combat flows really well and it's very satisfying to start laying in the combos. It's fun to swap out with an enemy that you've captured as well. Some of them are much better than others (like my personal favorite, the merchant). Some of them you can switch over and just take control of pretty much any fight. Some of them you switch to them and realize the only way the game could make that enemy challenging is if the game was reading my key imputs before deciding it's next move. Because some of these enemies are pretty awful to play as (like the boss with a sword for it's nose). Even then, just find enemies that work well with your play style and you'll be fine.I sort of put a couple of negatives in the review already, and really they're the only big ones. Sure the last boss could be more difficult, but I don't really mind the difficulty where it is. I haven't tried nightmare mode yet, but it seems like it's just a suped up version of the regular game, which is fine with me. I think the biggest thing working against the game is in the limited number of items and enemies. There's a good amount, but not that many. From what I can see there's three weapons for each element, a handful of trinkets and maybe... 25 or 35 enemy types. Ish. More variety would be nice. It seems like there are some characters missing too. The page where you choose a character has plenty of room for at least one more character, but it doesn't seem like there is one. Which is a shame.If you were already interesting in this game you should just get it. It's a solid game that's definitely worth adding to your library. If you're looking for a rogue-like that has as many options as something like Rogue Legacy you might want to go some place else.			"

												I definitely recommend this game. The animation and models have a great art style. A lot of time and love was clearly spent building this game. The movement and moveset takes a little bit to get used to. Starting off, the characters do feel a bit unwieldy or possibly clunky. After adjusting to this, it becomes less of an issue. Currently, there are only three playable characters, but I'm hoping more are added later. Despite a previous console release, this game is still in early access on Steam with more content promised. So far, my one big complaint is that the Abyss simply isn't deep enough. I've gotten a good amount of hours out of the game already, but a little bit more content with the Abyss deeped could significantly increase game time.			"

												It's a dungeon-crawling with some fighting-game control aesthetics. We love this game.My wife and I play it almost every night together. My 4-year old and 9-year old love playing as well. I have actually beaten the warlock multiple times with my 9-year old playing with me.You can play online or local cooperative. You can enable or disable friendly-fire. In our family, I always play with friendly-fire OFF so that we don't hit one another. This changes the game dynamics in a big way, but allows for me (who use to travel around to play street fighter tournaments) to play with my wife and kids without too much frustration.As you play the game you unlock more souls and are able to play them in Versus mode. Which is like Smash Brothers, but more fun. There's a lot more that I could go into in this review. But, I wanted to mostly touch on our satisfaction as a family with the game.			"

												Quite frankly, this is one of the best games I have bought in awhile. The Rogue like elements are perfect, the level design is great. Some rooms I had to fight in, I had moving saws AND death pits, and the neemies had curse and frozen weapons, so it was slow, not mobving, dead or being hit by a saw :D Combat is, I personally find it nostaligic, you do your combos to the direction are facing, not like some games today where you can change to face behind you mid combo, instead in this you dodge and restart it. The combo system itself is well excuted. Being able to do a simple attack combo, to a launcher with follow up and then a fireball all seemlessly, perfection. It's also published by Atlus, and personally to me that is a sign of quality. Is it worth the price? I say so, and I haven't even tried co-op, which I imagine makes this game even more fun, so get this game. If it goes on sale at all, then no doubts get it.			"

												An amazing side scrolling, platform action rogue-ish! It's like Castlevania and Guilty Gear double teamed Kirby. The ability to play almost anything in the game (bosses too), and have them be just as dynamic as a main toon is really a selling point. The fighting game mechanics in a dark, side scroller remind me of the Guilty Gear: Judgment days.Highly recommended			"

												I read so many review tell about how bad this game is but after i try it by self only real problem about this game is character turning speed and no way to cancel move action beside these peoblem this game is really fun and very addict. i like how random floor and enemy system work in this game make the game fresh eveytime i play it. Overall the game really good but you need to learn how to deal with sniff control which possible to drive you of in first minute... but still i recommend this game anyway.			"

												It looks amazing, it sounds amazing, and (once you get the hang of it) it plays like a dream. Seriously, I was a bit upset after playing it for the first time after buying it, but once I learned how to pull off certain combos, it grew on me like a bad case of hemmorrhoids. In a good way, of course. As of this writing, I only have an hour of play time in and there's a reason for that. My only beef with the game is that it's so unforgiving. An hour's worth of gameplay, and I have made so little progress, people have started nominating me for a position in the federal government. In order to respawn anywhere other than the starting area, you need a camp token. Where do you find them? Hell if I know. Some merchants (very few and far between) will sell one and only one, but they're ridiculously high, and you lose them permanently if you die. On rare occasions, you may stumble across one, but don't hold your breath. If you die (and you will die) you get one chance to respawn by means of fighting as a soldier until you reach an activated check point. My problem is that I've only found three tokens, of which I lost two, and my only activated checkpoint is a hell of a way away from anywhere I need or want to be.In conclusion, get it, but be prepared to punch-proof your monitor			"

												The basics of Abyss Odyssey could be described as 'Super Smash Spelunky'.The game's store page does a good job of describing the technical details, the character and ability unlocks etc, but it doesn't really describe how incredible the visuals and audio are.The environments are very atmospheric and the assorted, nightmarish enemies are absolutely stunning. You can see from the screenshots: giant peacock warriors, creatures with glowing circulatory systems exposed, and this variety permeates down to each of their charactistic move sets. The whole game is immensely, impeccably stylish, with surreal and dream like colour and variety - yet somehow it all makes a coherent vision, with everything underwritten by art nouveau stylings and Chilean culture and folklore.Combat was extremely satisfying; skillful and involving. And progression down through the levels felt substantial but forgiving of failure. Playing carefully, each death is a setback rather than game over, though die too many times and you will be forced further and further back towards the surface until you have no respawn options left. It's a perfect example of punishing but fair game design, the combat and death system both.It was a delight to play and a rich and fascinating world to explore. If you think you might like it, try it. You may be surprised at how deep it goes...			"

												I avoided this game for a long time because people said the controls were poor. After playing a demo on PS3, I decided to drop a few bucks on this game during a sale; and I'm glad I did. The turn speed that people were griping about is not that terrible. If you want a terrible turn mechanic, please go play Guilty Gear Isuka - you will then know turning pain.Otherwise, this game is beautiful, has a fun concept for a rogue-lite, and is definitely challenging and solid enough that I'm past my '$1/hour of fun' investment benchmark.

												This is a hard game, even more so on multiplayer. You will casually hit your co-op partner over and over.Some enemies can be brutal, but there are more than enough ranged attacks and specials for you to cheese your way through the game. However, there is no better feeling than taking out an enemy using nothing but pure skill, and no worse feeling than going from full health to no health against a single enemy.Aesthetically this game is awesome, with an art style similar to many of the developers previous games, realistic drawings accentuated with thick dark lines really pack a punch on your eyes.The games basic mechanics involve the characters abilities to move around and attack, which the player will quickly master. I never got into the advanced mechanics and combos, but there are videos on YouTube of people doing crazy high combos, so there is an indepth fighting system if your into that. Plus, multiplayer battles against your friends! Another mechanic is the ability to take over and use a single enemy as an extra life of sorts, this could've been explained better, as I could never seem to get it to work.This is a game that encourages multiple playthroughs, as there are so many characters to unlock, bosses to fight, and even a couple of weapons with elemental attributes. The ending is a little lackluster, but then again, what else could they have done.Level layouts are mostly the same, even in different environments, which can lead to slightly repetitive gameply, and I feel that there was a lack of differing content in each run, as each time I went down to fight the warlock, I was basically doing the same thing.I DEFINATELY recommend playing this on easy and without friendly fire if your with someone.Best brother relationship destroyer Christmas and again on New Years 2014-2015.

												Abyss is a dark fantasy game about adventurers going into the abyss to kill the demons and the warlock who summons them. Pros: The game settings and atmosphere are beyond perfect. The animations are fluid and hard to predict for enemies. The skills are nicely varied and fun to fiddle with. You can dodge and block attacks. You can grab enemies out of their blocking positions. There are a lot of weapons you can collect. Dying results in playing an army bro who you have to reach to the nearest shrine to resurrect your character. If you fail to do this, you lose all items collected, and go to a dark death room where you can change character, allocate skill points and choose which entrance point to start in, so it doesn't feel like permadeath as much since you keep your current level and health amount, but losing gear and weapon is still punisher enough that you will work hard not to die. There are multiple characters and creatures you get to play, which is never boring, as some are quite unique to use. There's also a ""training"" option in the main menu that you can choose only to practice using skills with certain characters, it does not actually train you on how to play the game. The game does not hold your hand, and you are forced to find things out on your own, there is a ""How to Play"" in the options menu under ""Help"", which I will strongly recommend checking out as you will not find any other way of doing things. Personally, I think that's a pro, but can also be seen as a con.Cons: Expect a challenge if you're set on playing this with a friend. The friendly fire is annoying at best, and the lag is ludicrous sometimes. The skills that you loved in single player are much harder to use when there's the CONSTANT risk of hitting your partner and feeling like an idiot. What's worse is sometimes the enemies will all dodge you skills, so even if you sandwiched the enemies, you still have a good chance of hurting your partner. That having been said, it makes it more difficult, frustrating, and yet oddly enjoyable to master with a friend, or kill eachother trying. The jumping does NOT improve the situation. There's a glitch, or rather, a difficulty with the programming where the player attempts to jump up onto a ledge and the programming cannot decide if it should jump onto the ledge or slide along the ledge, this causes the player to keep attempting to jump onto the ledge without success until they finally get it. I'm not sure to what purpose the ability to slide down ledges was added, but it's not nearly as useful as CLIMBING A LEDGE. I'm holding back a lot of rage on the matter, as with multiplayer games you will look the retard over and over again as you just can't make that jump, and your partner will be waiting for you... or you will be waiting for them to try and climb that god forsaken ledge that only took you one or a couple of attempts. There is no real tutorial in the game, and there should be. Even dark souls had a little tutorial on what to press and how to do certain things, especially when those skills are unique to the game (enemy capture!!!). The story is a little like dark souls as it does not go into much detail on why things are the way they are, and what exactly is happening in the game, which could be a game design choice as was with dark souls, so it's only a Con if it bothers you. Any other cons I could pitch off to my horrible skill in side scrollers/fighting games, so I will not mention them.Thanks for reading my review!			"

												It's like brawl or melee, but with more customization in moves. You can't choose where to throw, and the combat isn't as fluid as brawl (it's only slightly less fluid, like if you don't play brawl a lot you won't be able to tell, or if you play slower characters it's around the same). I haven't played that much but I got this game on sale, and even if I stopped playing right now it was worth the money. Highly recommend this, especially if you're a fan of the super smash series.

												It's a fighting game with combos and all sorts of juggle/cancel tricks that reward good execution, inside a rogue-like, where you have to sometimes fight multiple enemies (and bosses) at the same time.  Difficulty-wise I'd put it above Dark Souls, and below Monster Hunter in terms of how long it takes to master the mechanics/boss-fights.There's a coop and VS mode.You can capture and play as every monster, including the bosses.This game is amazing provided you're the type willing to learn, break-down, and practice mechanics instead of blaming them for sucking.  Once you've practiced with cancels you'll be flying around the screen like a ninja, pulling off 20+ hit combos and dodging everything with invincibility frames.Original art, unique mix of genres.  It's a masterpiece in my book. "

												Interesting concept. It's like Rogue Legacy, Torchlight, and Smash Bros mechanics jumbled into a pile and painted by Castlevania's lead artist. I recommend it if you like dungeon crawlers and rogue-lites. Someone explained that it was like a metroidvania, but really it's not at all. It's an infinite dungeon crawler, which changes every time you die. The attack/dodge mechanics feel pretty stiff unfortunately. Attacking is done in combos by pressing the attack button or special attack with directions in certain patterns similar to Smash Brothers. Even more similarities include shielding, rolling, fast falling, attack-cancelling, short-hopping, and grabbing. Most of which really slow down the game and make it slog a bit when progressing in fights. Enemies can do all of these things too, which makes it really frustrating when there are four on a screen at a time all attacking or shielding you. What's really pulling me to play more is the art style which looks beautiful.In the end what's here isn't a perfect gem, but it does have some pulling game elements. I'd recommend for someone who likes dungeon crawlers or Smash Brothers-esque combat.			"

												Abyss Odyssey  is an interesting game to say the leastt. It's a 2D beat em up style game with some fighting game elements and rogue-like exploring and item gathering. You start off as one of three characters, and unlock the other two as you progress through the game. Each time you start you have no items and the base weapon for the selected character, and you have to go through the abyss area by area and aquire better gear by either finding it off a shrine that can be in one of the many rooms, or by spending your gold at a merchant store, similar to games like binding of issac or risk of rain. As you progress through the game you gain levels which increase your hp and grants skill points for you to customise your character's skills. You can either add more damage, increase the amount of mana you gain after a skill hits, (mana will be explained in a sec) or add super armor (which prevents your skill from being interrupted mid action).Your mana is gathered up slowly as you progress and is used to capture the various enemies' souls. Landing skill hits builds it up and you can spend skill points to make your favorite moves build it faster. Once your mana bar is completely filled you will see a prompt (usually attack plus skill button) and it will activate a blast of energy that captures the enemy's soul if it dies while in the blast, if the enemy hasn't died but it has an aura on it then if you can kill it in a short amount of time it will also drop it's soul.Captured enemies souls are not perminant but when used let you become that enemy and gives you a second lifebar. You can freely switch between your main character and the captured soul but once you are killed while using the captured soul you revert back to your character. If you die in the dungeon you drop your equipment and are given control of a soldier based on what character you were using. The solider can collect the item and can revive your character by making it to one of the character statues located randomly in the dungeon. The dungeon has random rooms ranging from easy, moderate, and hard difficulty. Each room can be a certain style, like a underground grove of plants, an ice cavern,  and other regular areas, each with it's own hazards in it. There are random fights encounted and there are several different types of enemies you can encounter. There are mini bosses you can encounter, which are shadow versions of the three main characters. There are bigged boss fights also located in the dungeon. Finally there are challenge room which give you control of a random monster and force you to fight other monsters. If you win you are granted full hp and if you died and are a soldier, you are revived. When you make it to the bottom you face the warlock and once her is beaten you return to the start and can do it all over again.Co-op multiplayer is very frustrating, friendly fire exists and you can end up being each other's worst nightmare. You both must remain on the same screen, and certain rooms have more monsters due to the extra person. My advice is bring someone you can coordinate with.Overall it's a fun game with minor flaws. I would gladly reccomend it to people who love beat em ups with a decent combat system and skill progression. with the randomly place enemies and items it's a fun game if anything to just make it to the fish spewing warlock and beat him over the head.

												I follow ATLUS with interest because they often produce games for people with a hardcore or old-school sensibility in mind.  Most of their titles are either hit or miss, and I've been flipping back and forth but it looks more and more like this game has more promise than I initially thought.  Abyss Odyssey is a mashup of Metroidvania-style level navigation, roguelike aspects to finding items and the construction of the abyss, Prince of Persia-style level dangers, and a combat system that is some smooth fusion of Dark Souls' one-on-one and dodge/defense heavy action and side-scrolling fighting games.  There's a clunkiness to character movement that compels you to learn move distances and timing, so every moment of battle is tense and exhilarating.  There's also permanent death in the roguelike fashion, but as so much of your success is going to hinge on your own ability rather than what you gain along the way, it doesn't matter too much if you die and you should expect to die a lot.  Money is carried over between lives, as are character levels, but a lot of items are ridiculously expensive and it's often better just to thoroughly plumb the abyss for your powerups.Initially you play as one avatar, and you unlock two more (with their own advantages and disadvantages).  This sets itself up to be very limited, at least until you find that you can purchase or steal monster souls (with a special mana power attack that takes a long time to charge) which lets you wear their forms and use their attacks, effectively using their souls as a meat shield for a little while.  This is nice and adds a ton of variety to the fighting system.These features alone wouldn't hold my interest in the game, but I've noticed that it has a drop-in and drop-out online multiplayer.  Since I first purchased the game, they've released a patch to let people choose whether or not to enable friendly fire.  Friendly fire is enabled by default, and it introduces an interesting dynamic to online games;  You have to learn how to keep your space from your partner and learn how to block and dodge effectively so that you don't take the damage that's meant for the enemies.My only complaint is that there is still a lot of patching for ATLUS to do for this to be a game as solid as it promises itself to be.  There is no way to determine your latency to online games right now, and if you're too laggy, the desynchronization is very much not pretty:  You constantly fall through floors, and are stuck in a mid-jump animation glitching in and out of the floor.  Good luck jumping or even trying to fight.  I hope this is resolved soon, because if you can get into a game with low latency and a considerate and dangerous partenr, this game is a great way to kill a weekend or few.			"

8/10 ""An Odyssey for every Beat'em'Up/Jump'n'Run fan."" Abyss Odyssey is a 2.5D Beat'em'Up Jump'n'Run. 3 (difficulties) ways lead down to the Abyss, to fight the evil back. The controls might feel a bit clunky if U expect SF controls/moves - I think the devs tried to create ""prudent"" controls instead of button mashing. Anyways the little bit of ""everything"" like fighting / soul switching / leveling / skilling / looting makes this game absolutely fun. Additionally the setting, sound and background lvl design are very well composed and create a good atmosphere.Pros:+ great coop+ good atmosphere+ good controls (no button mashing!)+ good sound & ost+ good graphics (UT3)+ good gameplay+ flair of SNES titles+ fight as your enemies+ dev responds to community+ offline & online Co-Op Campaign+ full X360 controller support (highly rec.)Cons:- repetitive lvls (structure)- only offline 4 player Versus- controls are not exactly SF alike- no 100% combo feeling of Beat'em'UpsThe setting is not exactly my kind of style nevertheless the game is very well done & it's definately worth your time!

												This game is AMAZING. I was really impressed with it when I visited its booth at EVO 2014, and I immediately purchased it when I arrived home. I mainly got it for the multiplayer, and would like to say they have done everything right with the combat system. Fast falling, variety of moves (most platform fighters forget directions such as neutral and back for aerials, Abyss Odyssey didn't), dash cancelling for fast paced movement, the cancel system which brings tons of variability into combos, and C-STICKING (being able to perform moves with the right stick, which allows things such as retreating forward aerial attacks possible), which is a huge plus.The single player is really just a plus for me, and a way to unlock characters. The fact that you unlock characters by capturing enemies is super neat in my opinion.I really hope this game takes off, because it's well worth the $15.			"

Not sure what was supposed to happen there. Also, i have heard that you can transform into souls you pick up, but I haven't figured that one out yet either.-Saving progress... My number 1 pet peeve is games that make saving a hassle. You need to die to save, which means you have to redo a lot of work. Alternatively there are checkpoints, but you need to buy tokens first, and they are expensive and limited in use (literally up to three uses for the most expensive one I have seen so far). luckily redeeming quality of dying is that you keep you level, XP, and your money.

												Awesome game with lots of content, and amazing devs. Pros:+Randomly generated enviroments+Ability to capture enemy characters, and 3 customizable main characters+Great lore and story for this kind of game+Collective goal for the whole community +Local Vs. mode simmilar to smash bros seriesCons:- I find the game to be more difficult in co-op, even though it should be equally difficult- The Walrock fight is pretty frustrating, he relies on his cheap fish attack instead of fair fighting(this may be just me but I found it really annoying)- At the moment the Vs. mode is only local, but I believe online will be added to it in the future Overall, I think this is an awesome game and I hope they will add more main characters/enemies/bosses as updates arrive. I would also like if the walrock changed his form after the update, I was actually looking forward to getting to him so I can see what is he like.			"

												If you've come across Abyss Odyssey expecting a procedurally generated brawler/platformer hybrid, then you might find yourself slightly annoyed by the combat system. While the game's art direction, soundtrack and lore is charming and invigorating, the combat system plays much closer to an arcade fighter. Say goodbye to spectacle fighters' button-mashing and brawlers' single-button win-strategies. Abyss Odyssey's combat forces you to think before you act and make each move count. From zoning enemies using projectiles, to frame-canceling attacks into special moves.For all the good the game does, its tutorial is sparse and lacking, and puts players into the hotseat of ""die and learn"".The game's difficulty isn't excessive, with a single clear taking as little as a few hours of trial and error (your mileage may vary). If the game suffers from one single problem, it's the blatant input-reading that goes on during certain encounters. While this adds to the overall difficulty of the game, it's hard to tell whether an enemy is ""smart"", or simply cheating.			"

												A very pretty rogue-ish game with good graphics and an interesting story.  Addictive, too, with its share of good and bad.The GoodYou'll find yourself getting lost in the visuals.Challenging game, so you won't be able to plow through it in a single sitting.Replay factor is exceptionally high, with multiple characters and gameplay styles.Online co-op, since it's hard to find decent games with this feature (for me, at least).Lots of different mini-bosses.Nightmare mode keeps you from getting bored.The BadIt's hard.  Brutally hard, especially when you're first starting out.  Expect to die quite a bit.For a rogue-ish game, fully dying or completing a playthrough may take the better part of a couple of hours or so, and the limited save mechanic isn't going to help you there.No hand holding, especially when it comes to game mechanics.  If you want to know how to do something from the start of the game, you had better read the instructions, completely.  Even then, you'll be discovering things that you didn't know you could do, and things which seem intuitive are not (e.g. Save Token III means you'll get help from three guys, not that you'll be able to use it three times).Story is a bit light, but I'm not finished with the game yet, so it may get a bit deeper.  Still, the story to date is a little thin.Controls seem a bit unresponsive at times.  That said, I think it may be something where I was expecting Street Fighter-levels of control.  You get used to it.If you want to both progress and do co-op, you need to enable friendly fire.  I'm not a fan of this, because if one character is getting his♥♥♥♥♥handed to him, you can't go over and help without possibly hurting him.  It may be an intentional thing, but I'm not thrilled.  The recent option change helped with this.All in all, it's worth the purchase.  It may seem like I'm knocking it more than praising it, but it's only because the cons are like small obvious sore spots, whereas the game gets so many things right that it'd be a circle-jerk to list them all.  If you get past the first hour or so without getting frustrated (and really, just give it a shot), you'll easily put in another 10-15 or more, as I'm planning to. "

												Abyss Odyssey is like a very well made mix of Castlevania and a fighting game. With some customization, you can create your own combos while levelling up, choosing to add special abilities that will, if well chosen, make your combos longer. Being able to transform into enemies and monsters is also really fun. Each monsters have their own combo sets and special abilities. I'm a little saddened by the fact that these do not have levels and customization of their own, but them having a different Health bar can be very useful.The game is pretty hard. Until reaching a higher level, dying every time you enter a Hard floor isn't too surprising. Dodging and blocking is fully needed for survival. Jumping and grappling will also help a lot. Co-op mode is sadly very limited. Although it's fun, the camera always centers between both characters, and when a player goes too far, they disappear off-screen and can make things complicated. Friendly fire is also always on, and makes for very cautious battles, while enemies are not always affected by this.All in all, the game is fun, but better to play solo, (Unless playing in Versus mode, which is like playing a fighting game with the characters unlocked through the story) unless you and your friend are used to difficult/fighting games.Edit: The first patch will attend to some problems, as well as change something related to friendly fire being too harsh.

												This is a good game to play in co-op mode, provided you have a co-op buddy you can play Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, or other friendship destroying games with.  The combat closely resembles a Street Fighter style fighting mechanic, and by default, friendly fire is on.  That gives the co-op a great deal of depth, and requires partners to use screen space wisely and communicate well, but requires a great deal of patience.The game has an unfortunate nubmer of bugs, some of them game breaking, which can ruin a otherwise exciting evening of play.  While the game is most fun in co-op, it  really seems like it was designed to be played single player.  For instance, until you unlock the alternate characters, you may have difficulty telling your character apart from your partner's.  If you can get past these issues, there is something really unique and valuable here.  It's definitely worth a play.			"

												The game is not quite what I expected, but it is enjoyable and I look forward to continuing.As other reviewers have said, the game is  a rogue-like lite.  Similar in a number of ways to Rogue's Legacy, both in setting and in mechanics, you start the game with one of three characters who, upon death will need to restart with only the default weapon and no items.  However, you do get to keep your levels, your special maneuvers and your gold.  This is important because you'll need to build up a store of gold in order to purchase camp tokens- these are required for save points throughout the Abyss.  Fortunately, while the better weapons are, of course, useful, the combat system is such that you don't *need* to have that level 14 sword over the level 10 sword you start with.  You can get by on your own if you want to save the coin.The special attacks, meanwhile, cost no mana, which is a great aid and allows you to freely incorporate them into your combat style.  In fact, the attacks, which have a great deal of range- just the first two are a fireball and a jumping overhead arc with your sword- *build* your mana.  The only thing that appears, thus far, to consume your magic is the assimilation of your enemies, and that can only be done when you have a full mana counter.While I'm on the topic, one immediate con: so far as I've seen, you can only ever have one such enemy assimilated at a time.  There's no library of shapes you can shift into, which is disappointing, but the mechanic still does add some interesting variety to the game, as well as present you with a means of surviving (monster forms have full health when you first shift into them, giving your main character a respite).Of course, the most striking thing about the game, and what likely drew you to it in the first place- it's gorgeous.  Every character is individually painted and rendered and it looks beautiful.  The settings do not disappoint.  It's a lovely game and easy on the eyes.Metroidvania is going to be the watchword for any review- the game clinches it.  The fighting style, though, brings to mind something closer to fighting games.  Some enemies are setting-dressing, and you'll finish them off quickly.  Others, though, have a more dramatic flair, with the screen darkening at the borders and preventing you from advancing or retreating until the enemies are dead.  Fortunately, you are not without allies- the soldiers who are policing the hole leading into the Abyss have come down with and ahead of you.  They can easily pop up during a fight to lend a hand, an axe or a gun.Controls are not as tight as I would like.  The right joystick both operates to pick up and interact with things, if you press it in, and has limited operation in moving and attacking.  However, because it's sensitive to that movement, you have to be careful about pushing it when you're in combat.  Further, even out of combat and away from a tense screen of platforming, you're going to be frustrated with figuring out which button, the direction pad or left joystick, actually has to be pressed to set your special attacks.  These are relatively minor in the scheme of things, but they add an unnecessary frustration.Overall the game is fun, and I wasn't surprised to see how quickly I was engrossed.7/10- will interrupt Skyrim to play.

												Just picked this up from the latest Humble Bundle and was pleasantly surprised with how good this game plays. Most of the negative reviews of Abyss Odyssey were that the controls were bad, or weird but I'd only agree with people playing with the keyboard. WITH A CONTROLLER this game plays very well and its play style is reminiscent of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Granted, the actual story and game progression is different from castlevania, but the many different abilites triggered from different directions of attack gave similar feelings.I like the idea that the play-throughs are a bit different everytime and things unlock as you play so that there's a want to go back an play again. Definitely worth 2-5 play, and with the 3 hours I've played so far I've beaten the boss 3 times. So overall about an hour of gameplay per playthrough.I would say I wish the story was a bit grander. The visuals have all these beautiful accents and details that are wonderful, but the story is a bit like ""Get to the bottom, you win. Do it again!"" There are these journal pages, and they give more insight to what's going on. But they feel more like an explanation of the world rather than key elements to the story that will engage a player.Overall, as a game it's fun. It's worth a couple of bucks, and will keep you interested for a few hours. Do I see myself going back to it? Probably not for a while. But was it worth the purchase? Yes, this is worth a go.			"

												Quite challenging in a good way. No handholding, like in Dark Souls you have to explore to figure things out, story is totally optional.Friendly fire makes it a bit tactical, because you don't wanna end up killing your friend and start all over again, you have to think about positioning and moreover it requires actual cooperation just to get through a level, unlike many other ""co-op"" games where teamwork reduced to opening doors.Combat is fluid once you get used to it, yet it can seem clunky at the begining.The best part about this game is pacing, stages are pretty small, it only takes from 3 to 7 minutes to complete one, you won't get bored, and it has its ""one more level"" feel.7/10 — it's ok			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but seeing that at the time I'm writing this the game's reviews on Steam are ""Mixed"" I feel the obligation to give you guys my opnion:Man, do I love ACE Team games? And this one is no exception.  It's an action platformer that supports online co-op. The art style, the music, the setting, it's all gorgeous, even if the story might feel too simple. I noticed some people complaining the controls were clunky, I think that doesn't do this game justice at all. The controls do feel heavy, but it sounds to me clear as day that it was a design decision. They didn't want to make another generic action game, they want you to think before attacking. Also, there are some really neat mechanics that help the game to stand out even more among other similar titles. My favorite one being releasing a charged attack that lets you ""capture"" an enemy and use him as a playable character in the current run. You're probably gonna chance characters a lot when running out of life in the lower levels (forgot to mention this game is all about venturing deep inside a dungeon to reach and kill an old man). This game is its own thing, just like all other ACE Team games. I highly recommend giving it a chance.			"

												I am loving Abyss Odyssey, One of ACE Team's newer games. Like ACE Teams other games Abyss Odyssey has amazing art, its surreal, grotesque, macabre but overall colorful and inviting! All of ACE Teams games remind of of Salvador Dali paintings and that does not look to be changing any time soon. The gameplay in Abyss Odyssey and the music are just as good as the art.  It combines hack and slash, platformer, adventure and rouglike features to make itself a really unique feeling game!Im probably be repeating myself, but this is a game I really enjoy. I recommend it to anyone who is an ACE fan, or just likes platforming, action games with rouglike elements.			"

												Buy it if you like hard games, want some challenges, replayability and like nice graphic, sounds and story.OrBuy it so to leave a negative comment because you're not good with videogames but it's never your fault.10/10 will stop reading stupid comments someday.			"

												If you are a fan of art nouveau, that style of art is everywhere (with some very Alphonse Mucha inspired images). Has a Castlevania feel to it, which is nice (stealing the ""souls""/bodies of your enemies as an alternate form, is pretty neat). The 3d backgrounds are lush and lovely.			"

												I vastly enjpoy this game so far, flaws and all. I will start this off by saying that i reccomend this game. With that said, the actual review:-The story so far is great (at the time of this writing I haven't beaten the game yet, and have only unlocked up to the second character).-The music is nice and i can only assume there will be more of it as I progress.-Conceptually, the characters are awesome and exotic to me.The Flaws:-Attacking seems slow and lagged.-There is little in-game explanation for how to do certain things, like switching between your special moves or how to perform cancels. I specifically recall in the prologue level a blade pendulum obstacle where it seemed to indicate that you could jump through the pendulum. But doing so would hurt you. Not sure what was supposed to happen there. Also, i have heard that you can transform into souls you pick up, but I haven't figured that one out yet either.-Saving progress... My number 1 pet peeve is games that make saving a hassle. You need to die to save, which means you have to redo a lot of work. Alternatively there are checkpoints, but you need to buy tokens first, and they are expensive and limited in use (literally up to three uses for the most expensive one I have seen so far). luckily redeeming quality of dying is that you keep you level, XP, and your money. But nothing else. Found some cool equipment? Gone. Picked up a soul? Gone.			"

												A very pretty rogue-ish game with good graphics and an interesting story.  Addictive, too, with its share of good and bad.The GoodYou'll find yourself getting lost in the visuals.Challenging game, so you won't be able to plow through it in a single sitting.Replay factor is exceptionally high, with multiple characters and gameplay styles.Online co-op, since it's hard to find decent games with this feature (for me, at least).Lots of different mini-bosses.Nightmare mode keeps you from getting bored.The BadIt's hard.  Brutally hard, especially when you're first starting out.  Expect to die quite a bit.For a rogue-ish game, fully dying or completing a playthrough may take the better part of a couple of hours or so, and the limited save mechanic isn't going to help you there.No hand holding, especially when it comes to game mechanics.  If you want to know how to do something from the start of the game, you had better read the instructions, completely.  Even then, you'll be discovering things that you didn't know you could do, and things which seem intuitive are not (e.g. Save Token III means you'll get help from three guys, not that you'll be able to use it three times).Story is a bit light, but I'm not finished with the game yet, so it may get a bit deeper.  Still, the story to date is a little thin.Controls seem a bit unresponsive at times.  That said, I think it may be something where I was expecting Street Fighter-levels of control.  You get used to it.If you want to both progress and do co-op, you need to enable friendly fire.  I'm not a fan of this, because if one character is getting his♥♥♥♥♥handed to him, you can't go over and help without possibly hurting him.  It may be an intentional thing, but I'm not thrilled.  The recent option change helped with this.All in all, it's worth the purchase.  It may seem like I'm knocking it more than praising it, but it's only because the cons are like small obvious sore spots, whereas the game gets so many things right that it'd be a circle-jerk to list them all.  If you get past the first hour or so without getting frustrated (and really, just give it a shot), you'll easily put in another 10-15 or more, as I'm planning to. "

												This is a really nice looking kind of cross between a platformer and a beat-em-up. The art direction is great, and the combo system is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it's a bit too easy to clear the game at the moment. The developers plan to add a harder difficulty mode which may improve this.			"

												Awesome game with lots of content, and amazing devs. Pros:+Randomly generated enviroments+Ability to capture enemy characters, and 3 customizable main characters+Great lore and story for this kind of game+Collective goal for the whole community +Local Vs. mode simmilar to smash bros seriesCons:- I find the game to be more difficult in co-op, even though it should be equally difficult- The Walrock fight is pretty frustrating, he relies on his cheap fish attack instead of fair fighting(this may be just me but I found it really annoying)- At the moment the Vs. mode is only local, but I believe online will be added to it in the future Overall, I think this is an awesome game and I hope they will add more main characters/enemies/bosses as updates arrive. I would also like if the walrock changed his form after the update, I was actually looking forward to getting to him so I can see what is he like.			"

												If you've come across Abyss Odyssey expecting a procedurally generated brawler/platformer hybrid, then you might find yourself slightly annoyed by the combat system. While the game's art direction, soundtrack and lore is charming and invigorating, the combat system plays much closer to an arcade fighter. Say goodbye to spectacle fighters' button-mashing and brawlers' single-button win-strategies. Abyss Odyssey's combat forces you to think before you act and make each move count. From zoning enemies using projectiles, to frame-canceling attacks into special moves.For all the good the game does, its tutorial is sparse and lacking, and puts players into the hotseat of ""die and learn"".The game's difficulty isn't excessive, with a single clear taking as little as a few hours of trial and error (your mileage may vary). If the game suffers from one single problem, it's the blatant input-reading that goes on during certain encounters. While this adds to the overall difficulty of the game, it's hard to tell whether an enemy is ""smart"", or simply cheating.			"

												This is a good game to play in co-op mode, provided you have a co-op buddy you can play Monopoly, Settlers of Catan, or other friendship destroying games with.  The combat closely resembles a Street Fighter style fighting mechanic, and by default, friendly fire is on.  That gives the co-op a great deal of depth, and requires partners to use screen space wisely and communicate well, but requires a great deal of patience.The game has an unfortunate nubmer of bugs, some of them game breaking, which can ruin a otherwise exciting evening of play.  While the game is most fun in co-op, it  really seems like it was designed to be played single player.  For instance, until you unlock the alternate characters, you may have difficulty telling your character apart from your partner's.  If you can get past these issues, there is something really unique and valuable here.  It's definitely worth a play.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is like a very well made mix of Castlevania and a fighting game. With some customization, you can create your own combos while levelling up, choosing to add special abilities that will, if well chosen, make your combos longer. Being able to transform into enemies and monsters is also really fun. Each monsters have their own combo sets and special abilities. I'm a little saddened by the fact that these do not have levels and customization of their own, but them having a different Health bar can be very useful.The game is pretty hard. Until reaching a higher level, dying every time you enter a Hard floor isn't too surprising. Dodging and blocking is fully needed for survival. Jumping and grappling will also help a lot. Co-op mode is sadly very limited. Although it's fun, the camera always centers between both characters, and when a player goes too far, they disappear off-screen and can make things complicated. Friendly fire is also always on, and makes for very cautious battles, while enemies are not always affected by this.All in all, the game is fun, but better to play solo, (Unless playing in Versus mode, which is like playing a fighting game with the characters unlocked through the story) unless you and your friend are used to difficult/fighting games.Edit: The first patch will attend to some problems, as well as change something related to friendly fire being too harsh.

												Combining elements from different genres and mixing them together in a very interesting fashion, Abyss Odyssey manages to meld together fighting game gameplay with platforming and procedurally generated environments, items, grinding, hidden characters and tonnes of secrets to give a satisfying experience that falls short due to a short campaign and imbalanced competitive play, but that as a bedrock for ideas manages to shine in a sea of copycats of the popular and punishing rogue-like style.Not for everyone, but highly recommended if you're looking for a solid adventure.Check out my video review for more info.

												This game blends a well balanced combo system with a platformer pretty well, although the controls are a little choppy. Once you get the hang of it you'll be stomping baddies into the ground with combinations of aerial attacks, special moves and dashing. Decent replay value as there's 3 characters, each with an ability that captures enemies to tag-out and use in place of your hero. Once you run out of ""lives"" you have to start over, the dungeon resets but you keep all gold earned (so you can buy epic weapons early).Without saying too much, I expected more from the end of this game but it didn't ruin the experience.

												Great platformer style game. Wonderful graphics, audio, and attention to detail. To be critical and split a few hairs: Audio and voice overs could be polished by 5% or so in terms of quality of sound and delivery of scripted lines. Graphics with all effects activated feel like they could use 5% polish. Maybe a bit of gentle AA (eg. 2x AA) or perhaps some texture filtering? Otherwise the experience is great.An obvious, if small note. This is a game you want to play with a controller such as a 360 controller or similar. There are keyboard control options but i can't imagine trying to use them due to the twitch nature of this platformer.			"

												I think this game is amazing, I got it on my ps3 and now here on pc.The game is simple, you need to defeat the ""bad guy"", you go down into a abyss to fight against him, you need upgrades and level up to do it, so you need to calculate the best option to follow to reach the ending of the journey, if you do it in a bad way, you aren't going to defeat the final boss, you defeat him, you will found yourself at the beginning all over again and new stuff will appear.I see a lot of people talking bad about controls and difficult, but I don't that's a flaw, but yes, it's a fight against the game before you get the chance to have real fun, its like learning a fighting game, execution is important, much more than normal games, you need a high level of strategy and learning to beat the game.I recommend, but you will need to take a time in the training room.Sorry about my english :3			"

												An artistic fighting game, and a welcome challenge.A large variety of enemies adds some depth. Some enemies are quick and agile while other are large and slow with powerful or long range attacks. The ability to play as all of them except ghosts encourages you to learn how characters fight and counter them.No two traps work the same and you are likely to fall for them. Randomly generated areas change the location of terrain, traps, and goodies. But it does not change the difficulty, level type (like ice or jungle) and therefore the enemies you will fight in tha area, or the prescence of a mini-boss, so it is largely predictable.The combat is exciting yet unforgiving.  The game locks you into enemy encounters with more than one enemy until youve killed some of them, which can lead to one versus four scenarios. In spite of that, enemies tend to engage one at a time unless you have nightmare difficulty turned on, so the challenge is not impossible. Enemy AI (except in 'easy' areas) knows how to utilize all of their moves and will likely punish you for using the same move twice, staying shielded for too long or shoot projectiles if youre running. Learning how to grab, air dodge, and special cancel is essential to fighting AI opponents.One simple improvement they could have made is too give more options to getting up. Against humans opponents who can be fooled it wouldn't be a problem but AI opponents know where you will get up and then knock you over again.The PC version suffers from the game having been developed for console. The controls are hard to get used to, and features like co-op and versus fall short. Co-op online even between two computers in the same room was prone to crash often. And although versus mode is great and you can play bots you probaly wont find games without friends who play it.			"

Now let me just say that despite the side-scrolling nature of the game, it does not hinder the game-play at all. In fact it somewhat keeps the player from being overwhelmed by the entirety of everything around you. The graphics are beautifully made, and the gameplay is really smooth. Even on online, the gameplay does not get hindered at all. While the fact that the game costs money to play is a factor, it shouldnt detract from this amazing game.			"

												In summary:Not necessarily bad. For someone who can make this game work, which I'm sure they're out there, it might even be a great game. But I am not that person.  I'll be surprised if I can force myself into a few more hours of gameplay on it. If you can pick it up for cheap, give it a shot! Chances are you might like it. If you dig Smash Bros style combat, you might dig this too.___So, after rage quitting somewhere in my third NG+ attempt at Dark Souls, I've decided to go through my library, give all the games I've accumulated a fair shake. First up is Abyss Odyssey.Full disclosure, I got Abyss Odyssey because it was thrown in with a humble bundle, and I am playing it with a mouse and keyboard. I am also realizing this is less than ideal. My initial intention with it was to beat it before settling on a full opinion of it. That very quickly became ""give it five hours."" That has now become ""an hour and a half might be enough."" Abyss Odyssey isn't necessarily bad. It might even be good. Visually, it's actually pretty inviting - the setting is evocative and immersive, the full character illustrations are pretty neat. While the characters are very, very much broad strokes, that works for the setting. The narrative setting itself is also largely intriguing, as the player finds themselves delving into the dream of a slumbering warlock made reality in 1890's Chile. I can't call that anything but unique, especially with the character's confession that they too are a part of the dream. Between the visuals and the mysterious narrative context, Abyss Odyssey certainly motivates the player to explore.Furthermore, exploration is a big part of the game, with the world changing each time you enter the abyss. Each time you can find new items and try a different approach into a new version of the dream. It's really a cool idea.My problem arises with the actual gameplay mechanics. All of this setting and presentation is well and good, but it serves merely as a backdrop for the meat of the game, which is side scrolling brawler / fighting game in the style of the adventure mode for things like Street Fighter. So as the player moves sideways and up and down through the abyss they are confronted with mobs of different dream creatures, which drop keys and health and mana and what have you.My personal inclination is to to say the mechanics are horribly clunky. The character moves very slowly and feels unresponsive. Constructing actual combos and meaingfully positioning yourself feels cumbersome. Now, people have said elsewhere that this is essentially the combat mode from Smash Bros, which I can see, and I am terrible at and do not enjoy. It is possible that this game is very fulfilling for someone who takes to this style of gameplay, but I do not. So overall my verdict on the gameplay is that it is horribly frustrating and ungratifying. My attempts to acclimate myself to the play style were so heavily thwarted in my short attempts at the game that I can't bring myself to go any further, even given how inviting the world is. Which is a shame.So. A beautiful, intruiging game world. Massively clunky and frustrating fighting game mechanics pitting you against hyper responsive AI - though this hinges on my sucking at this game. A platformer utilizing unresponsive and clunky movement. This to me constitutes Abyss Odyssey. Not necessarily bad. For someone who can make this game work, which I'm sure they're out there, it might even be a great game. But I am not that person.  I'll be surprised if I can force myself into a few more hours of gameplay on it. If you can pick it up for cheap, give it a shot! Chances are you might like it. If you dig Smash Bros style combat, you might dig this too.			"

The problem with this game, regardless the difficulty, are the frustrations you have to endure due laglike feel when playing the game. It just isn't fluid enough for a platformer or a fighting game. So how can it be fluid enough to be both if it can't even do each part well individualy? You might wanna give it a shot. But find a friend who has it first and play it or you might just regret it.

												I've played through this game a bunch, and it's really fun, similar to Subspace Emissary in Super Smash Brawl.  The aesthetic, needless to say, is gorgeous and has its own style, and the characters actually feel pretty different depending on how you set their special moves.  I'm not sure why there are so many jabs at the controls.  They felt fine to me, though I'm not sure if that's more my taste or their hardware configuration or it's sloppy netcode or whatever else.  It is a bit slower than a true fighting game, but you can do some cool stuff here, and I'd say it's worth the buy, even if only for the art direction.			"

												You hear your Summer-Rain yell in frustration as a controller is thrown out of the gaming room. Puzzled, you investigate. She looks absolutely peeved, sulking in front of a strange, yet beautifully-designedgame blaring in front of her.ABYSS ODYSSEY.You ask what's wrong, and she pointsin irritation at the the screen. She saysthat it was on sale, buying the gamefor the pretty dark-deco world found inher favourite influences, such asBatman: The Animated Series and Skullgirls.You pull Summer-Rain close as you siton the chair now, holding her in your arms as she describes the hair-triggercombat of Abyss Odyssey (or Kombat, and you manage a chuckle) while youtry to calm her down. It is as if she hasgone through some sort of war-tornbattle.You ask her if the game is really that bad and attempt to cheer her up. But she looksat you mortified, trying to be free of youas she exclaims that 18th century Chilemust not fall to the evil dreams of theWarlock running amok!You know something is terribly wrong.The last time a game did this to you (orher, for that matter) was DARK SOULS.The look in Summer-Rain's eyes as she grabs the controller once more, eager to be punished by the game but wanting to see what happens next in the story, her wanting to go to the final level, driven to new depthsof tenacity as the soundtrack lulls and droneson beautifully, endlessly hypnotic.She returns to the game as the beautifulKATRIEN, Player 1. You see her die again andagain, but the lore and simple, but hard-to-master combat intrigues you. The voiceacting makes you pause and wonder if theWarlock can ever be defeated.So you exhale and kiss Summer-Rain on hercheek, a kiss which she does not feel. Notanymore. Deep breaths, and you plug in asecond controller so Summer-Rain need notfight the Warlock alone.You enter the game as the all-too-awesomeGHOST MONK, Player 2. You now see this game, this Abyss Odyssey not as entertainment, but a real deal-breaker, the fate of 18th centuryChile rests in your hands now!The ultimate lovechild between Super Mario, Mortal Kombat, Dark Souls and God of War(or Heavenly Sword, depending onhow you look at it), Abyss Odyssey holds your attention for hours, days, evenweeks at a time.You feel as if you are at a breaking point, thatyou will fight to the end and help Summer-Rainbottle up all the Warlock's dreams and save theworld. You've come this far. You've fought thishard, played this long. Your hands feel numb,your fingers sore. Suddenly you blink.It is pitch black darkness in the room of yourhouse, and you're staring at the screen, whileyour character Ghost Monk stands in front ofthe shopkeeper at the Abyss entrance, the hubworld before descent. Katrien stands next to Ghost Monk, stationary.You glance to your side and see Summer-Rainsleeping, curled up next to you. Glancing at theclock, it would seem you were playing only fortwo hours when you went in to check on herbefore sundown.You blink uneasily again. Did that much timepass in this world while you were fighting thedemons from the Warlock's dreams in AbyssOdyssey? It felt like hours, days even. So you close Abyss Odyssey and carrySummer-Rain to the bedroom. She stirs at yourtouch, smiling, before holding on to you as youexit the gaming room that she so frequents.""Did we get him? The Warlock..."" She whispers.You kiss her forehead as you pull the sheetsacross both of you. ""Yes Katrien. The Warlockis no more. Chile is safe now, and with that, theworld."" You play along, sweeping her hair backfrom her face as she smiles through tired eyes.""...love you, Ghost Monk."" Summer-Rain chuckles.""Love you too.""You are about to fall asleep when you hear themenu theme playing a room away, the game having booted itself up, trying to escape its eternal prison. The music fills the house, daring you to return to the Abyss, to try to defeat the Warlock himselfonce more.You know what you must do. You must undertakethe odyssey once again, once more.ABYSS ODYSSEY.It'll mess you up good. "

												Ridiculously pretty! It is a very strange platform/fighting game. Not the weirdest thing ACE TEAM has done so far, I think that would be zeno clash or rock of ages.It plays very strangely, more like Smash Brothers than anything else.Extemely weird, but enjoyable!			"

												Due to how short this game is and how there is not much replay value because once you beat it with two different characters there is just no drive for me to even keep playing. I can't recommend it unless you can get it on sale cheap enough like I did. It was $5 in the 2015 summer sale and I had like $1.25 in my wallet so I got it dirt cheap. Don't pay over $7.50 (50% off) for it because it is only about 3-4 hours long. The problem with buying it cheap is that after the summer sale it will probably never go on sale again less than $7.50, which even seeing that price is rare. The other problem is that once you beat it, there is not very much replay value. I had the game on my steam and isthereanydeal.com watch lists for several months before it finally went cheap enough. I already knew it was a short game but I thought it might have some replay value. It does a little, but not as much as I was hoping.At any rate, it is a very enjoyable game for one or two playthroughs, provided you are willing to adapt to its purposely sluggish controls and incredibly cheap enemy combo attacks, even when you are helpless on the ground. When you figure out what moves to spam on what characters to spam combos and knockdowns, do not hesitate to be as cheap as humanly possible to enemies because that is how they are to you. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about the sluggish controls and how long it takes you to turn around. While not being able to turn around instantly can sometimes lead to you taking a cheap hit, it is easily overcome-able once you get used to the fighting system. The controls for the monk are noticeably more sluggish than the girl's because he has bigger slower attacks with a 2h sword. The girl is fast and can get in and pull off moves quickly enough to wreck groups of enemies. Sometimes enemies can ground combo you several times, making it super cheap, and sometimes the cheap hits can get you in trouble before you can get to the last boss, but overall it was not much of a problem for me. My first time to the boss he crushed me mercilessly because he has some of the most annoying, cheap, unpredictable attacks I've ever seen any enemy have. All bosses in this game do, and some of the enemies as well. The second time I played through the game and got to him I beat him by working him over as much as I could with the girl's spinning attack, working the cheap move option in my favor as much as I possibly could, because if I didn't, he sure would've.For the first 3 hours the game seemed really hard and a bunch of times I was getting pretty frustrated, but always having fun. When I got the combat down pretty good, hours 3-4 were much easier and I found the game to be considerably much easier than I had first thought.The graphics are good but the game really shines with its awesome art style, mainly in the design of the characters and enemies. The music and sound effects are done nicely as well. Everything flows really smooth too. Once I got the hang of combat I was using the way the character animations flow to my advantage to look for tells when I could hit and when I should block. Which like I said means jack sh-t though on bosses because they are extraordinarily cheap and unpredictable.It is too bad it is so short, but that is the fate of most indie games. For what it is worth, catch it on sale for no more than 50% its normal price. The short time you do have with it will be fun, and you might even want to play through it again as a different character. The sluggish combat and cheap enemy attacks, and your own ability to spam cheap hits, makes the game pretty much a one way street. A better more well thought out fighting system may have helped this game to a 7, maybe even 8, out of ten.Length 5/10Art/Sound/Music 8/10Animations 10/10Gameplay 7/10Replay value 3/10Hot chicks with big knockers 10/10Overall 6.5/10			"

												Combat mechanics are just plain bad. Nothing challenging about them, you're just constantly fighting the jank instead of intuitively moving your character.Multiple hitbox issues. Hitting through enemies. Weird invincibility state behaviours. For a game all about the combat, it's extremely lack luster, and full of weird glitches.Everything about this game is janky. Menu's are atrocious to use, basic game mechanics aren't even explained. It's like you're playing an aplha demo at a showcase.Story has the depth of a back of the box summary.Art is nice though.For a genre so full of competition, there's better ways to spend your time. "

The controls were awful and we ended up killing each other mother than the enemies. Its clearly not optimised for ""friendly fire"" despite what its saying. Overall its slow and unresponsive.Sometimes controls got stuck (i was using PS4 controller), sometimes the other played couldn't revive at altars, sometimes the heroes didn't swap or didn't revive at all, or got stuck.The music is good but otherwise its a complete disaster.

												I am enjoying this game.  Pro:Interesting story, different from almost any other game.  Worth playing for this by itself.There tend to be significant frames dedicated to being open to an attack before and especially after a move.  This rewards a more thoughtful, methodical approach to your attack, as opposed to button mashing.  Beautiful art in the backgrounds and the characters.Procedurally generated maps: no two games are the sameVersus and co-op modes available (havent tried them yet, but they look fun).Good tutorial/prologue.Con:Only seems to be about a dozen different types of enemies.I've only played it for a little while, but it seems somewhat easy.  I got to the (first?) boss in one sitting.  More to come after I play it longer.			"

												Very interesting game. A mix of dungeon crawling, rogue-like, RPG and fighting game. Throw in some south-american mythology and you got Abyss Odessy. A lot of people have been complaining about the control of this game: this game is NOT a simple platformer, it has a Street Figher-like fighting system, which means a combination of commands at differing times is necessary to land combos; this is not like DMC where you hit 3 buttons and make a combo. For this, a controller is a MUST for this game. If you don't have a controller, don't get this game (or get a controller. Lots of games are better with a controller anyways). If you see a review complaining about the controls, ignore it. Now, the game does have some issues, mostly in the tutorial aspect. It has a tutorial, but for things like the menu and the shop, not for some of the important concepts like Cancel Points, capturing creatures and transforming into said creatures. However, I still recommend it.			"

												The intention is good, but the delivery is fresh(take it away)I like what this game is trying to do. It's hardcore during the gameplay and it doesn't leave you with too many choices. for example, you can only carry and equip 2 weapons at a time so as you move on, you should only carry what you wish to equip for your ring slot and same for anything else. This also mean that you have to take your time to think what you will chose to take out for the right situation and what you will leave behind for good. Not only that, everything is expensive so the economy is perfect. It's hard enough to get your health and mana back which is cool. The death penalties will leave on on the edge of your seat the whole time, especially if you play on hard.Now, again, good intention, very bad delivery. The gameplay is trying to Emulate Super Smash bros's combat style. I'm a big fan of this game, but in what AO fails is at the responsiveness of the game. The game itself is clunky as hell by nature; the game is unpolished. I feel like they rushed for the release button instead of making sure that everything was right before launching the game.There's combos, but they're not good looking at all. The abilities are boring, nothing special to see here.Now, the worst part of the game is when you die.So you start a new game or you come-back home from work just to play Abyss(A(0) waste of time btw). From the 3 heroes aivalable, you pick your favorite one or you resume your game with one of them. As you go on and as you try your best to love the game that you just spent 14$ on, you suddenly die.You think dying is what bothers me? Not at all. Becoming a regular soldier is what bothers me. (Wait), i usually play Mount & Blade Napoleonic war so playing as a French solder during the 18 century is really not what bothers me at all.It's the fact that these soldiers they got a boring attack pattern, a boring gun, a boring whirlwind attack and a boring everything else. I have to put up with this soldier until i die. Having some random soldiers that can help you is cool, but that's about it.The whole time that i'm playing as a soldier, it just feels like the death-blow aspect of the game for me. I just want to click on the Exit button when i become one.Conclusion: It's not only worth a buy because it's too expensive for how poor the game feels like, i don't think this game can appeal to anyone as-well; not the hardcore gamers, not the casual gamers, not even for players with an open mind(and i'm one of them).

Comparing it as a 2d dark soul pushing it a bit to far, it not at that level basicaly because of lack of customisation and characters from the beginning. Basically the game is pure hardcore action rpg with perma death with a few twists, i found myself, like dark souls dying over and over trying to reach the final boss until i unlocked a few new skills losing all my equitment over and over again. BUT i couldnt stop, i played it all night finding out about the deep unexplained mechanics, when i finally defeated the extremly hard final boss. i Cheered...but i had still 8 other character to try and best the abyss with.  8/10 due to the lack of real customisation, personalisation and locking the characters.

**TL;DR= I've played plenty of other indie games that didn't have dedicated servers, but none of the bugs were this annoying.**On paper, Abyss Odyssey is a great side-scrolling, combat-heavy, rogue-like /light RPG in which you do randomized dungeons as 1 of 2 main characters. (plus there are a bunch of enemies you can turn into -if you find or buy the items that let you do so.)The problem is the execution in the online-play. There are latency BUGS, oh sweet pete, the bugs. There's the 'stuck-in-falling-animation'glitch (which comes with a free 'mid-air-platforms-are-now-invisible' bug), the 'not-pulling-myself-up-onto-that-ledge-when-I'm-right-there' bug, and on rare occasion, the 'keep-spawning-1-or-2-platforms-ABOVE-where-you-just-dropped' thing.It's a shame because I was really enjoying this game -on Co-op, at least- but unfortunately the connection seems to be the most problematic.* (the 1st & 3rd bugs mentioned are latency-related.) I can understand latency issues (aka. 'lag') but I've never had bugs this game-breaking in any other games I've played before, latency-related or not.The ledge-detection/ Platforming is honestly the most annoying part, though, as it seems to be inconsistent, especially depending on which character you have at the time (and there are a lot).In the end, this game is definitely worth it on sale for $3 or less. It's unique characters & unique ability to (sometimes) be able to transform into another bizarro character just makes this game an appealing co-op game. ...but just know what you're getting yourself into.----------------------------*full disclosure: I was playing on high-speed Wi-Fi, and the game likely uses Peer2Peer servers. I only had the glitches when I joined my friend's game. WHEN I hosted, I didn't have any issues except for the jumping one; (but AS I SAID ABOVE, the falling glitch is pretty game-breaking (when you're in someone else's game), and the game should be coded better than this. I've played plenty of other indie games that didn't have dedicated servers, but none of the bugs were this annoying.)As of writing, my specs: GTX 760, 8 GB RAM, 3.3 GHtz AMD FX6100.			"

												I reviewed the comments and tried to do my research on this game. However, it does not life up to its hype, in my opinion. I purchased the 2-pack to play with my boyfriend. I had difficulties starting the game (Windows 8 urg) and had to hunt down forums to figure out how to get the game to start without it telling me that the desktop screen was locked. This was a resolution problem, that the game couldn't auto configure. Finally, my boyfriend and I got the game to run, now we'd like to try out the multiplayer. The game mechanics and the camera were so frustrating and unintuitive it resulted in mutual frustration ( and I feel ripped off even paying $14 for this game) we had a hard time jumping and getting used to the keyboard and other bindings. Then our characters would be half in objects or bugged in a wall. The camera was jumping between the both of us, which made it difficult to get a sense of where we were. I really wanted to like this game, it looked devil may cry -esque, nice artwork and overall positive reviews. I was extremely disappointed and I feel ripped off and would like a refund, which I doubt is going to happen. Buyer beware!			"

Combat system seems like it could have been fun, but the enemies were both difficult to fight well (I found myself having difficultly killing anything without losing health) and not incredibly satisfying. The rogue-like nature of progression also got to me, but that's more of a preference thing.Was a little fun to experiment with, but quickly lost interest when I realized I'd seen almost everything there is to see in the game within the first hour.

												It's a shame that the really very bad parts of the game make it impossible for me to recommend the game. Visually it is fantastic, but game design wise the stupid decisions haunt the experience. The game mechanics of the fighting are poorly introduced, the pacing of more difficult encounters feels random.I get it that this is supposed to be a hard game and this was clear to me when I bought it. But when a game has a steep learning curve, then a really annoyingly punishing system like the one in place is inexcusable:You'll die (quite often in my case, because it was really hard for me to adapt to the unusually sluggish controls) and instead of respawning, you get replace by a soldier with even worse agility and abilities. This guy then needs to find a sparse statue to revive you (never found one) or if he dies as well, you'll start at the village and the descent begins again. I'm voting this down because it is not only not a good game, but it is also saddening me how much potential has been wasted by ACE team once more. I struggeled through zeno clash for many hours, even though I hated the game play. But I loved the fresh fantastic world so much that I endured it's flaws. I was prepared to do this again, but this time I won't. Hire a Game Designer and some QA next time!  "

												I liked the art style and general game design. what little I saw of the plot looked interesting. It looked like it would have been a great game. However, the combat controls are unresponsive, which is a major sin in this type of game. Also, double jumping into new areas of the map was a chore. I often needed to try at least 10 times to find the right spot to get up a tall rock. This should have been a simple mechanic to do. The 'extra chance' mechanic of the soldier picking up from where you died was a good idea, but his double jump is even worse. Sorry, the developers really need to make the combat smoother and sort out the double jumps for navigating the terrain.			"

												I would really love to recommend this game, but I cannot. Aesthetically it is superb, the artwork is mesmerizing and the music is great. However the movement in this game is incredibly rigid and delayed. In addition to bad movement Online co-op is filled with flaws. When I play with my friend, everything below his character's waist is always phased into the floor, only showing half of their body; on his screen my character constantly faces the opposite direction that I am running in, but you can get past these imperfections. What really breaks the game is when you're playing and you get knocked down and your character just will not get back up. We've had to close and re-open the game time and time again in order to move on. Or We've had to kill each other (yes, there is optional friendly fire), so the other can proceed whenever this happens.			"

												Just finished the single player campaign and really enjoyed it. It plays a lot like Rogue Legacy, though far more forgiving, and the controls are actually more akin to the Smash Bros. franchise. It's the type of side scrolling rogue like that will demand strategy rather than brute force, but within minutes you will be blocking, triangle jumping, and back-air-attacking your way to victory! Worth noting that the sound track and visuals are top notch as well. I haven't played co op, versus mode, or the unlockable characters, but I felt like just the single player mode, though short, is worth the price of admission on its own. Very solid game, I recommend it.			"

												I don't mean to knock this game, but this is obviously a blatant rip off the more recent Super Smash Brothers title.  The movement, combat moves, the dodge rolls and shielding (even reflecting projectiles with perfect shield timing).  The game does very little to innovate in this regard, and if anything falls short of the slick feather touch needed to perform some of the most delicate maneuvers in previous Smash Brothers titles.  Characters and their movements comes across as bulky and unwieldy at times.For me, an experienced Smash Brothers player, The whole experience is reminiscent of Adventure mode from Brawl thus far, although it adds a deal more options, customization, and items of an action RPG type.  However, the style is basically a very monolithic set of platforms and randomly spawning AI enemies.  Once you die, you are replaced by weaker character who is supposed to find a shrine to revive you, although thus far I have found no way to locate these other than by pure memory or chance.The story is very poor so far, almost nonexistent.  Brawl Adventure mode accomplished a better story with its universal zero dialogue, than this game does with it's castlevania/fire emblem type conversations.The best thing the game has going for it is the art style, which is an obvious tribute to Art Nouveau posters from the 1890s.  It is also good for all the reasons super smash brothers is good, but it in no way exceeds SSB in any way except the customization and items your characters has access to.Granted, I've only put in 2 hours, so I will update this if it changes after more play.

Possibly also addictive. Admittedly, it is short game (2-4 hours I'd say, depending on luck and mostly your skill) but if you finish it and do not have the urge to ""go again"", I think there might be something wrong with you and you may want to consider seeing a doctor.

												This game is absolutely stunning looking. But that is really the only thing it has going for it to be quiet honest.The fighting is complete garbage. There's no real combos because your moves hit them away from you. To actually get combos you have to juggle the poor enemy against a wall or use your super. All the reviews that are comparing it to smash bros are somewhat correct but mostly assanine and not really helpful. Lke in smash bros, if you hold up and press attack, you will do an attack that is known as an up tilt, and this applies to all the directions, like in smash bros. The same rule follows aerials but they don't really lead to combos that often either. That is literally the only thing this game has in common with smash bros. So do not think you will be getting a cool game where you can combo people. There's a super move you get to use when your mana becomes completely full that can get you a pretty decent combo relative to the rest of the game though. By that I mean around 6 hits, which doesn't even kill an enemy. Useful.Edit: There's fast falling like in smash bros as well. There's also grabbing and rolling out of shielding, but that's kind of standard for these types of games.You get three specials as well, and they are pretty easy to spam and honestly make quick work of the enemies usually. There's no real reason to use the regular attacks after you get them unlocked. Hell the first girl gets a fireball which is mediocre but then she gets a counter, which you can just stand still and spam then you get a pokey attack that seems to put the enemy in enough hitstun to follow up with another pokey attack.There's random items throughout the map, which is randomly generated every time you die and go down there. There's weapons which can range from being incompatable with your character to being able to catch them on fire or freeze them. There's other passive armor type things and potions, antidotes and mana things you can pick up. Not much to say about that. Then there's these other items that you can activate that will let you completely transform into one of the enemy units. I have no clue if these are helpful in any parts but so far I find my character to be more comfortable to use.Now, you're probably wondering why I bothered typing out most of that? It's because the tutorial does absolutely nothing to help you other than your movements and give you your first special ability. That's it.I wouldn't recommend this game at $15. I wouldn't at $10. I might say it's acceptable at $5, which is what I think I picked it up for during the Autumn sale. If there's anything I was vague about that would help your decision on bothering with this game, ask me. Or honestly, just pass.			"

Summary (TL;DR)The art-style for this game is beautfiul (excluding the tropish design of the female characters) and the soundtrack is amazing, but the controls are far too clunky for me to outright recommend this game, considering that it's practically a brawler.  Pick it up if it's on offer - otherwise move along.PlotSet in 19th-century Chile, an enormous pit has opened up in three locations - spewing forth creatures birthed from the nightmares of an all-powerful sleeping warlock.  You, the player, must choose between the fencer Katrien, a Warrior-Monk, and the nymph-like Pincoya to enter the pit; kill its denizens, and put an end to the Warlock's nightmare.GameplayThis is, at its core, a rogue-lite brawler with frantic combo-based combat.  Killing enemies yields experience that increases your maximum health and unlocks new combos, and various collectables add to the gold in your coinpurse, which can be spent on items that make your journey down to the bottom of the abyss easier.  These items are lost when you die, but your experience and gold are kept for the next run.This is where my big beef with the game appears - input controls for a brawler need to be responsive and predictable, and these are neither.  Some attacks don't register, even when your character isn't in the process or performing an action, and changing the orientation of the character cannot be done in an attack - only by stopping all other actions, changing direction, and then continuing.  It is worth noting that I am playing mouse + keyboard, and this may not be an issue on controller, but it renders advance play almost impossible.  What would be ideal would be if the attack direction was tied to the position of the cursor, instead of the mouse only being used for its click functionality.In fact, even in menus the mouse is a hinderance - obviously designed for controller navigation, using the mouse doesn't always change the 'selected' item; causing you to purchase the last thing you selected with your keyboard, rather than the item you just clicked on.Art StyleAside from its gameplay flaws, the art-style for this game is absolutely beautiful, with an obvious art-nouveau influence.  The designs of the enemies and bosses are quite beautiful, and you get a good idea of what each enemy's abilities will be based on theri appearance - obviously a great feature.What is less great, however, is the design of two female playable characters.  The initial character 'Katrien', while draped in silks and largely unarmoured, is less offensive - the latter 'Pincoya' is just flat out absurd.  Katrien can almost be excused in her design based on the idea that she is an agile fencer; romanticised (as is the style of art-nouveau) but capable.  Pincoya is a waif-like nymph, entirely naked but for her pale-blue body-paint - WHO WIELDS  AN ENORMOUS HALBERD TWICE THE SIZE OF HER - a design choice obviously made purely to give her a pole around which to dance.  Being a fan of polearms, this would have been my preferred character to play as, but this design just ruined it for me.SoundtrackI have nothing but great things to say about the sound-track.  The atmosphere that it creates is incredible. 10/10.-----------------------------------------------------------If, after reading this, you still want to go for it - then do.  These are my gripes.  The game has obviously had a lot of attention put into it, but I can't help but conclude that it is, regardlesss, fundamentally flawed and, as such, is not worth more than a few quid on sale.			"

												A divisive game and it makes sense. The controls are fine with a controller (why fight controllers on PC for games it makes sense? Honestly...) But there is a hitch with the mechanics of the game, which some perceive as unresponsive controls. The mechanics are slow, plodding and clumsy. This isn't a 2D Devil May Cry game and it's not even a Shinobi or Ninja Gaiden game. It's even more slow. Slow to the point that it should be tactical but it isn't even that. Enemies remain unresponsive for most of the battles. So, your inclination is to just spam attack them and if you do they'll invariably hit you with their own clumsy attack which staggers you and slows everything down immensely. Because there's no obvious skillset or pattern to enemies this can make the game rather random and frustrating. I can see the appeal to such mechanics if you have the patience for them but I just don't think it's very fun in the end just like hacking and slashing can be very boring. Beautiful art design and music is wasted on a clumsy combat system that never really justifies itself.It's a shame but there is a chance you'll like it.			"

												This game had everything there concept wise to be a terrific experience. I thought it was awesome that you could play as Monsters if you had the item, that's something that gets a + in my book.The wife and I tried to co-op. With Friendly Fire on, the way the game is intended to be played, the game is impossible. The way you have to play in order to fight enemies, you will do one of two things:One player will stand to the side and do nothing, sometimes lobbing a ranged attack to maybe get a hit on an enemy that's not blocking.One player will inevitably damage the other, sometimes locking the other player into a combo. So we turn the co-op off and it's a fun time right? Well, yes, until one of us dies. then you get to play as a blue soldier. The blue soldier cannot jump as high as ANY of the playable characters. This causes MASSIVE problems, with one player having to stop and wait for the other player to manage to out♥♥♥♥♥♥the bad controls on top of having a gimped platforming character. Who's idea was this? This ruined the experience so much that I'm going to just refund the game and get Castle Crashers or something. At least that game works properly. Fun game by yourself probably. Heavy emphasis on probably.			"

												Being a fan of Ace Team's previous games (The Zeno Clash series especially), I was really looking forward to playing this! Even more after seeing the character design, it looked awesome!Unfortunately, while I enjoyed a some of my time with the game, it simply fails as a whole. It has several things that could have been really interesting, separately, but they just don't fit, and the whole design falls apart.The game is supposed to be a fighting and roguelite hybrid. And one of the coolest aspect was how the game ""evolves"" as people beat the final Boss. This turned out to be an artificial evolution: basically just a series of updates with different moves for the Bosses, more bosses, modes, etc. Sure, it's a cool idea to keep updating a game, but I was expecting something more substancial that would make people want to go back to the game.If you're experienced in fighting games, you may have an easier time with this title. If not, prepare for a loooot of frustration. The game simply throws you into the Abyss, with a 1minute tutorial on your first minute of playtime. Good luck interiorizing anything worthwhile without context... Anyway, the game is extremely reliant on mechanics like move cancelling and timed blocked which are never taught in any way. If you already know about it, you may be able to use it. Otherwise, the controls will simply feel really sluggish and unresponsive. When you start a move, you'll have to wait for the animation to completely finish. Unless, you spend upgrade points to get cancellation points... Something that isn't wel explained either.Regardless, after spending a bunch of hours trying to learn the mechanics, I felt pretty satisfied with the combat, in general. However...The roguelite elements are really bad. Like... the elements just don't connect properly.So, you have the main character, but you can capture an enemy to switch with. When your main character dies, you'll have a weaker soldier to play with. If you can reach an altar, your main character respawns. This, in theory, would be a reliable way of having a second chance. Great!But, there's a huge issue with it... While you run through the Abyss, you find shopkeeper and items (Weapons and Equipment) that are really useful. But, when you die, you lose most of it. As the soldier, you can pick a couple up, but the rest are lost. The choice of the ones destroyed is also random, making it really frustrating to lose an item you wanted to keep. On shops, you can also buy ""camp tokens"", which you can use in altars as a checkpoint. Once again, sounds great. But you lose ALL of your items when you respawn. The result is: hey, I'm farther into the dungeon, cool. However, I have absolutely no equipment, so I might as well just kill myself, since all progress is basically lost.You see this works? This completely defeats the point of these cool little mechanics, since they're all useless. Ok, let's assume you want to finish the game without items. Sure. That's where the fighting problems come in.On normal mode, the game is fairly easy. I beat it on my third try. And I've beaten it like... 8 times, or something? Sure, I still died several times, but it wasn't very interesting, with as many victories in such a short time.So I switched to nightmare mode. ♥♥♥♥ing hell... this is the most frustating experience I've had with a game, lately. It's not very different than the normal mode, except that every group of enemies is bigger. Bosses now have an elite ally. You'll be faced with groups of 5+ enemies... It's a mess.In a fighting game, full of stun times after hits, you'll just be juggled by most bosses and even groups of enemies. As soon as you stand up, you'll be hit by another enemy. Then there are projectiles flying in your direction... it's a mess. If you're experienced in fighting games, you may have a chance. Otherwise, you'll have to waste hours and hours to learn how to cope with it. And it's simply not fun. It feels unfair to have such a number of enemies on you. And then, if you die,  the ""second chances"" are completely useless.This was a huge disappointment, and it's a shame. The game has lots of different character to learn, and the game could have been really good. Unfortunately, the rogue-lite elements simply don't work, and the game isn't balanced. No good tutorialization, the story seems really interesting, but ends up unexplored, ... Oh well.Maybe I was expecting too much out of it, but frustration put me off. If the respawn/checkpoint system was reworked, I think the game would have benefited a lot. As it is... not so much. I hope their next game is more balanced, because the talent is clearly there!			"

												Are you one of the many players looking for a good rogue-like game on Steam? Do you enjoy fighting games such as SF, MK, KOF, or MvC? Then look no further than Abyss Odyssey, I recently picked up this game, installed and lost myself in it for the next 3 hours. It's similar in goal to Castlevania(not LoS, more like HoD), plays like a fighting game(dash attacks, dodging, special moves, juggles, etc.), and kicks the crap out of you like Dark Souls. You can play as one of the three characters(I only have two of the three so I can make no comments on the third character), Katrien, the fencer style character, the Ghost Monk, the big sword waving, fireball-tossing, robed badass, and a third character who appears to use a spear/polearm. Your main goal is to work your way down to the Warlock and defeat him, picking up power ups, weapons, and levels along the way. You can pick up special summons which can be activated by pressing down on the d-pad(Also, definitely should play this with some type of controller), which will turn you into a monster, whether it be a skeleton soldier, a sea witch, or a legless bird masked weirdo. This summon allows you to have essentially two characters, but if you die as your main character(Katrien, Ghost Monk, other lady) you lose the summon and become a soldier. If you die as your summon you become your main character. As the soldier you are slower, a bit weaker, and don't have access to the same amount of mobility or damage as your main character. However, if you make it to an altar or defeat one of the mini-bosses as the soldier you can revive as your main character(missing most of your HP). Overall, I would definitelly recommend picking up this game if you're looking for a challenging and fun beat 'em up rogue-like. Definitely worth it to buy on sale.			"

Nice art, but that's about it. Terrible controls. Terrible gameplay. Is there a story? If there is, it's terrible too.			"

												This game feels a lot like Super Smash Brothers Brawl's Subspace Emissary. They controls are very similar to Smash, and the platforming feels spot on.  Multiplayer is a pain do to poor chat options, either always on voice, or nothing. The fact that the game has friendly fire is also a pain, and turning it off stops you from posting to leaderboards and the like. Skeleton Warrior is best soul.			"

												Are you one of the many players looking for a good rogue-like game on Steam? Do you enjoy fighting games such as SF, MK, KOF, or MvC? Then look no further than Abyss Odyssey, I recently picked up this game, installed and lost myself in it for the next 3 hours. It's similar in goal to Castlevania(not LoS, more like HoD), plays like a fighting game(dash attacks, dodging, special moves, juggles, etc.), and kicks the crap out of you like Dark Souls. You can play as one of the three characters(I only have two of the three so I can make no comments on the third character), Katrien, the fencer style character, the Ghost Monk, the big sword waving, fireball-tossing, robed badass, and a third character who appears to use a spear/polearm. Your main goal is to work your way down to the Warlock and defeat him, picking up power ups, weapons, and levels along the way. You can pick up special summons which can be activated by pressing down on the d-pad(Also, definitely should play this with some type of controller), which will turn you into a monster, whether it be a skeleton soldier, a sea witch, or a legless bird masked weirdo. This summon allows you to have essentially two characters, but if you die as your main character(Katrien, Ghost Monk, other lady) you lose the summon and become a soldier. If you die as your summon you become your main character. As the soldier you are slower, a bit weaker, and don't have access to the same amount of mobility or damage as your main character. However, if you make it to an altar or defeat one of the mini-bosses as the soldier you can revive as your main character(missing most of your HP). Overall, I would definitelly recommend picking up this game if you're looking for a challenging and fun beat 'em up rogue-like. Definitely worth it to buy on sale.			"

												I was expecting something like the good 2D castlevainia games. I thought at first in the tutorial that it would be a more in depth combat system... You can aim your melee attacks but the controls never seem to get more comfortable. Then whatever character you choose to play as, when you die you have to play as this stupid soilder guy with a rifle and bayonette that has the worst gameplay i've ever experienced. If you want something like castlevania get Valdis Story or if you want comedic mexican castlevania get Guacamelee. Pass on this			"

												I want to recommend this game, i really do. its visually nice (though still somewhat simple) and the gameplay is addictive enough.But its still another roguelike-lite that fails to grasp how many things can ruin these types of games.Enemies that completely ignore the players hits at times - check (Enemies will sometimes hit you in the middle of you throwing them, which they arent meant to do)Enemies with spammy and ridiculously oversized hitboxes that extend well beyond their model on both sides - check (this works sometimes with the player as well. But seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those spear birds.)A block mechanic that works 100% for the AI and quite frequently is completely ignored when the player character uses it - check (Parrying is ♥♥♥♥ing broken too, half the time)Enemies which can skip entire animations to hit you in the middle of your dodge - Check (why this function even exists is beyond me, its more of a sidestep then anything useful)Mediocre controls which while passable enough, really show their issues whenever platforming comes into play - check.Its literally a collection of every single good and bad thing that a Roguelike can do, tbh. It looks nice, plays nice enough, and has decent longevity.... and then it falls flat.If roguelikes are your thing, and youve grown tired of Binding of Isaac, go ahead and try this. If youre looking for a good roguelike to play, look elsewhere. Im honestly lucky i got this from Humble Bundle or id ask for a refund...			"

												Could have been neat. Became very UGH!Ok so it feels like a pretty sweet side-scrolling RPG. You jump around, you stab things, and it feels like it should except for the fact the levels all look the same when you're in the same theme.So my first big gripe is the loss of items. You farm up enough for that sweet sword! Great! Just don't ever die because you lose it for good and have to buy a new one. I assume this becomes less of an issue as you level up but it's incredibly annoying to find a couple of good items and a new weapon and POOF. You lose. That's the first.The second and worst part of this game is the multiplayer option. The game feels ok when you're alone but woe to those who have a friend or anyone else join in. The camera suddenly zooms out and shoots back and forth between close up and far away depending on how far you two are because the game insists both of you are on the screen at the same time. This means you both better go down the same branches and paths or else one of you will be mostly out of the camera and it doesn't really seem to have a preference. Even worse in the multiplayer is TEAM HITTING! You're using swords in a small area fighting swathes of enemies. Yes if your sword hits them or they hit you, somebody is going flying or getting stunned. I played with one guy who had a sword with a freezing attribute. He accidentally hit me, froze me in mid air, and then I got pummeled by an enemy. Why the heck would you make a game about meelee fighting hit your teammate?! You don't hit the NPC soldiers that come to assist you so why couldn't you make it so we couldn't hit each other?! It begs for trolls or at the very least your friends stand back and don't do anything while you try to take on the enemies you cornered.So yeah. I played this for a little while to see if I could enjoy it. I was digging it for a bit until I lost my items and somebody joined my game to demonstrate the absolutely inane system they had set up for playing with others. "

												Abyss odyssey has a compelling story and an interesting world with good music and appealing set pieces. The problem with the game is the combat system. The combat system is extremely clunky and the animations are lack luster. Your character is extremely slow and most of your attacks are weak and innefective. As you get surrounded by 3 or more enemies you quickly realize that your character just doesn't have the tools to deal with it. If you are a fan of fighting games I do not recommend this title as it is a jarring experience to have such little control of your character.			"

												This game has very impressive art style and aesthetics in general, it looks very unique and interesting. But it's the only good thing about this game. First of all, it's PC game which doesn't fully support mouse, you can use it in combat, but, for some reason, you can't use shop interface without keyboard, like for real? Of course, it's not the game breaking, but, if you want your game to be successful on PC, you should at least fully support mouse and keyboard. It feels like a lot of modern developers thinks that navigating with arrows/wasd and enter is good enough. No, it's not. Let me use my mouse for things it's designed for.Second, combat feels clunky and unresponsive. Sometimes AI instantly reacts to your movements and it's kinda stupid. You'll often find yourself in situation when your character is facing wrong direction and it's very irritating. Enemies have too much HP, unless you find or buy powerful weapon.Third, this game is trying to combine platform brawler with roguelite and it fails miserably. This game is bad brawler because combat is boring and unresponsive. There is some replay value in this game, but exploring, again, is really boring. You find little to no loot, and even if you do, it's probably not for your character. Whenever you level up your character, you feel that it doesn't really mean much.Fourth, enemies doesn't tied to specific locations (aka bioms), you can find any mob at any level. I felt like I wasn't progressing anywhere because nothing really changes besides background.I feel really bad for artists who worked on this game. I think that this game would be more intersting even if it was ""Yet Another Action Rogulite"".			"

												Maybe I'm just sick of this whole roguelike craze, but this game is not at all interesting to me. I bought it because it was on sale and because the visuals are incredible. But the combat is dull and annoying, and the character advancement aspect is weak. Worst of all, the mouse-and-keyboard controls are TERRIBLE. Yes, you can reconfigure some buttons, but you can't do anything about the way menus work, and it's just so frustrating trying to do simple things like look at inventory items and adjust your skills. If not for this last bit, I might have been willing to endure some of the tedium of the game just to see more of the gorgeous artwork. But as it is, it's just too much of a bother. This is definitely the last ACE game I will ever purchase, and even the mighty ATLUS has lost some credibility as a publisher in my eyes for letting this garbage go to market.			"

												The graphics are standard 2D style, but the art style is beautiful; it sets the mood and the atmosphere is perfectly portrayed through the art. The backgrounds on each level are gorgeous, even though most of them look dark and deathy (is that a word ?). Speaking of the levels; they are all procedural generated; no playthrough will ever be the same which adds tons of replay ability to this type of game. There are three stages of difficulty to each level, Easy, Normal and Hard. You are able to tell which difficulty each stage is by using the map system in the game which easily shows you a path you take, and maybe if you want to readjust your course to skip a few hard stages, you can.I can easily recommend Abyss Odyssey; I will certainly be keeping it installed on my PC for the odd jump in every now and again. Rogue-like fans will love it.  "

												Visual style can't carry a game, and that's about the only appealing aspect to Abyss Odyssey.The game's main mode plays like the tacked on side-scrolling campaign in an old Tekken game. The abyss is short, and while the rooms comprising it are randomized (since you're expected to traverse it multiple times), it's always a bland and forgettable experience.I paid $4.78 for this and consider it not worth that price, for single-player alone. If you enjoy the combat enough to take it online, I'm sure there's more value in it.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Abyss Odyssey is a game developed by one of my favourite game developers, ACE Team, the same people behind Rock of Ages and the Zeno Clash series and published by ATLUSThe game is a rogue lite 2.5D platformer game where you enter an area with a certain difficulty, fight enemies, find the exit and continue to the next arena. The game is not easy and can be unforgiving at some pointsThe graphics and art style as most of ACE Team's games are wild and vibrant and the enemies and locations are taken from Spanish folkloreThe game is really good, however, the combat system can be quiet annoying at some points and the game can get repetitive after a while, but, Abyss Odyssey is a fun game to play in short bursts RECOMMENDED :)  "

The difficulty curve is insane and urging co-op friendly fire seems like a♥♥♥♥♥♥move. It says that's what the game is balanced for - but I don't even see the balance in the game at all. I wanted to like this game - I get what they were going for with the Super Smash Combat (which i should love) and the dungeon delving - but when I can't even consistently jump in the direction I want to - it's just not worth it.

												I gotta say, I genuinly enjoyed this game! The fighting mechanics are relatively simple, but have their complexities at times! It's alot like smash brawl fighting sometimes, and I love that!The art style, the colors, the voice acting and such are all really well done. It's a simple rougue-like dungeon crawler, and it's really fun I think. This game doesn't deserve all these negative reviews I think, it's just fine in its own right. I love the ACE team's work, so it's easier for me to jump on board with them, but I think anyone could enjoy this with a bit of time!Thanks team ACE, and the person who gifted this to me. Cheers!

												First off, its an Atlus game. I'm a sucker for Atlus games. Hell I've got the special edition Persona 3DS XL sitting next to me as I write this.Second, the music and art style are gorgeous. The combat can be a bit clunky at times, but I manage okay. I do find myself playing just to find out who this 'Warlock' is and why he's creating so many monsters from his dreams.Still, its worth a play if you like a good beat-em-up dungeon crawler. I've played better, but this one is by no means bad. Worth playing in between games and a good title for fellow Atlus fanboys and fangirls.			"

												This game is difficult for all the wrong reasons. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, and you have a very limited selection of moves. That alone would be reason to avoid this game. To make matters worse, however, all the enemies you face have uncanny response time to your input, and you can do nothing but watch helplessly as they outmaneuver and counter your incredibly limited moveset constantly. Each level you enter has a randomized difficulty, but even at the easiest difficulty, enemies have far too much health. I want to stress this game is not ""dark souls hard"", where it's difficult but still feasible with the potential to be satisfying. This is broken-game hard, where half the time you spend in it you'll be wondering if your controller/keyboard is broken.			"

												Honestly, I love this game's art style and music. However, given it is an action-platformer, I cannot overlook the fact that the combat system in it's current form is rather awkward for the player; it gives a feeling of helplessness as your character madly swings away, gets parried then juggled for half of your health bar by a single enemy.While input delay is always in games to some extent, the contrast between your character's actions and those of the AI controlled enemies is vast and makes the game artificially more difficult. The main complaint I would have regarding this is the blocking. If you could block as quickly as the enemies are capable of, the whole dynamic would change. However, there are many animation frames that your character is simply locked into, leaving them open to attack by enemies who take ruthless advantage. To some extent, this can be mitigated by investing stat points as you level into the animation cancel skill, which allows you to chain attacks; this is where the game became the most satisfying for me as I finally felt like I was playing a more normal fighting game.I would really like to recommend this game to others, however the visual and aural setting is not quite enough to overcome the drawbacks of the combat system for me. I would point out the caveat that, yes, it becomes more interesting as you unlock more skills, but even then it tends to devolve into spamming the same skill chain and taking advantage of weaknesses in the AI's otherwise incredibly timed blocks.

												This is what I call an ""anti-coop"" game, while being co-op. Me and my girlfriend were playing toghether, unfortunately she died more than me, but you can't resurrect your partner more than once per ""zone"". Not to mention, not all zones have actually the respawn altar.The game stop teaching you anything after the first 2-3 buttons (for example, why a soldier spawn when I die?), which can be read in the ""how to play"" section of the main menu.The combat feel unpolished, but that may be subjective so I won't complain about this.

												I wanted to like Abyss Odyssey.  The combination of fighting games and roguelike elements has been under-represented since the PS1 era. (Hi, Tobal 2's Quest mode.)  Controls that draw from Smash Bros should have meant a maneuverable adventure game, something that should have had little difficulty surpassing Brawl's underwhelming Subspace Emissary mode.Unfortunately, that is not the game that ACE Team delivered.  I've waited quite a while to see if the game would change before posting my review, but I haven't seen evidence that my opinion will change.Combat simply feels off, as if it is sluggish or clunky.  Jumping feels floaty and forced.  Aerial moves do not mesh well with jumping.  While the control scheme in its most basic form is designed around the control scheme of Smash Bros, the actual mechanics and maneuverability (and lack thereof) are not.  The game relies on a cancel point system for combos, where you can cancel only if you have a 'cancel orb' available.  Cancel orbs are so important and integral to combat that you should spend your first levels unlocking them instead of upgrading moves, which begs the question of why they weren't unlocked from the start.  People will point to YouTube videos of various combos as examples of how amazing the combo system is, but those combos are almost always impractical within the single-player game itself.'Replay' consists in no small part of an unlock system that is designed to be a grind-driven time sink.  You cannot just encounter an enemy and defeat it to 'capture' it.  You have to have a full magic bar, and land a killing blow with a special capture move (that drains the bar regardless of success).  If it ended there, it might be acceptable, but the game goes further.  You have to be at a minimum level to capture an enemy, and the required level is heavily artificially inflated compared to the difficulty of the opponent.  The only solution is to grind your level through repeated plays of the same character.  It doesn't  matter that you can beat every enemy in the game when in your low teens for level.  The game will simply not let you capture various enemies until you are level 30, 40 or even 60, even if you have been beating that enemy without issue from the time that your level was a single digit value.As for level design, Abyss Odyssey unfortunately functions as an example of the shortcomings of relying on procedural generation.  The component parts that the system has to rely upon simply aren't interesting, nor are the final results.All in all, to some degree I feel a bit sorry for ACE Team.  They obviously tried, but their ambitions may simply have been beyond their abilities and business realities.  (A budget title with fighting game movesets and animations for all player characters and enemies?)Do I recommend the game? At full price, I find that I cannot.  However, if you do find the concept interesting, and find others say enough positive things, then perhaps consider buying it when it is at a good sale price.  At worst, you might find a disappointing title.  At best, you might find it a hidden gem that you will continue to play.  I, unfortunately, fell into the former category.  Others have obviously fallen into the latter.			"

												I found this game to be a lot of fun.  It has an interesting atmosphere, with visuals and soundtrack to go with it, and is a fairly action packed, if straightfoward, platformer.  All the usual tropes are present and well implemented, along with some interesting little quirks.  The combat system, at least on normal mode, probably isn't as deep or challenging as it likes to pretend, but is still entertaining enough (the controls, though, can be a little spongey, but not enough to spoil the experience).  I have had few deaths so far that didn't feel like they were actually my fault: frustration levels remained pretty low throughout.This is a good-looking and interesting take on a familiar premise with some nice little touches that make stand out just enough.  I recommend it "

												Great mix of gameplay styles. Interesting design and art choices, a usual kudos to Ace team. Great potential with a nice community-listening and actually responding and friendly devs.It may seem short but it has a great replayability and surely a big future updates plan.Even when you have only three main char choices you can equip them with different skills and upgrades, so you would rarely see an exact copy of yourself when you play co-op.Co-op's friendly fire feels weird at first in this kind of game, but later you start to understand that it only makes the game more interesting strategically and teamwork-wise. If you start mashing and do the combat-mayhem in co-op you will most probably lose. They actually also included an option for disabled friendly-fire too now.You can also capture ANY of your enemies (with time and levelling, not everything anytime) and play as them, which is actually a pretty fun concept and it works out nice. So if it doesn't seem so from the start you still have variety and replayability in this game and it only promises more.Thank you Team Ace. A nice mix of a side-scroller action fighting rpg. Old-school-like gameplay revived with new ideas.p.s. it still could use some work with some bugs, mostly regarding co-op and saving, but I'm in no doubt it will be fixed soon.			"

												I personally have a love/boredem relationship for rogue-likes. I really love the concepts and with some games the artstyle and settings. But I tend to only play them for 30-60minutes before I get bored.Abyss Odyssey has been an exception for me. The 'Beat-Em Up' style combat is extremely engaging and you learn quickly that not all fights can be button bashed and require some timing. On top of that the different ranges of the special moves mixed with unique fighting styles of each playable character keeps you wanting to progress.Artstyle is a hard one to critique when it purely comes down to personal tastes. For me the fact it was a game made by ACE Team, I know I'd love their approach to creating a unique setting. Theres just an amazing blend of Anime/Mange, Greek & South American (especially with the Chilean setting) styles. Combined that with a soundtrack that feels almost fitting in a Studio Ghibli film and you've got a truely memorable universe.The mechanic in which your character can capture a soul of an NPC allowing you to not only have a second health pool, but to bring the unique special attacks of each one (each NPS has several standard fighting moves that vary with each enemy type and 3+ unique special attacks which vary on the type or rank of the NPC). Also the transformation into the soul is quick, so for example - you can play as the undead who can projectile vomit a stream of poison (with a knock back) then switch to your main character for some longer ranger hits.My only real critique of this game is its length. It is a short game and runs can take about 30 minutes and don't have as much of a unique run expierence as say Binding of Isaac. But each time your character levels up becoming stronger. Weapons and items don't carry over which means which does mix it up each time, as well as serval unqiue 'special rooms' and mini-bosses.Theres definately room to expand the game which I hope ACE Team utilise (and not restricted by its multi-platform release) but for the content and the quality of the game, it is most definately worth the price as it stands.*controller recommended*			"

												First of all, we can say the game brings a new artwork, unique and beautiful. The gameplay is weird first, the combos will be hard to make untill the player gets used to the fight sistem, but its well made and realy enjoyable wen you learn some tricks. The multiplayer is realy good too, you can make it harder with friendly fire ON and activating the nightmare dificculty to add more chalange ( adds all boss / mini-boss a little help with +1 mini-boss and monsters will be more agressive, nothing related with + HP or +DMG to them, wich is a realy good, just more agression and +1 mini-boss on bosses/mini-bosses ). The music is too realy enjoyable and fresh, some times the game wont play it, but when it does its amazing and fits realy well into the game. The acting voices are too realy amazing, personaly i think the Monk voice is the best.The game inst realy long, untill the player get used to the game, it will be easy to finish it, at least on normal mode. But its not a ''finish the game and its done'' tipe, wen you finish it, you have a new task, the task of capturing all the souls of the monsters you fight, to unlock them to use on PVP (local only untill now 22/07/14) and on training mode, and not just regular monsters, all mini-boss and the last boss itself can be captured, but you need some player LVLs to take them (some 25 , some 45, some 60), all monsters have theyr on move-set and spechials to be discovered and its realy fun to descover new combos with them. Also, all souls captured can be found at the church stage, being sold there, so you can always get them to play withaut needing to capture it again.And, wen the community kills the final boss, it will add to a count, shown at the beggining of the game as the ''broken mask'' on the book, and when the community has killed the boss X times, new game content will be released, so you can say its a game that, with time, will keep growing even more.  It seems too that online PVP will be added, and wen it does will be tons of fun to play. Also, the staff of the game is realy friendly to the community, with theyr questions and suggestions on steam foruns, so if you have any trouble with the game or something, they will help you.sorry for any wrong words. :)			"

												Like other Atlus games, Abyss Oddyssey is challenging and beautiful.  Enemies are idiosyncratic and colorful.It's very easy to pick up as there is only 1 attack button and 1 special attack button. Add a direction to the attack to change the type of attack.  However as you progress you'll find the challenge isn't always the enemies themselves, but rather the ever changing Abyss.Is it better to spend your gold on the one camp token you can afford so you can respawn here when you die, or should you buy the accessory that will increase your XP that will make subsequent adventures easier?

												This game is an interesting beast. It gets credit for attempting a few interesting things with its combat system and for its networked multiplayer, which is enjoyable enough. Likewise, the overall atmosphere and dungeon experience feel polished in a number of ways. However, ultimately the clumsiness of its controls makes combat feel awkward and unsatisfying, and it motivates the player to find a 'cheesy' simple attack pattern that defeats most  threats rather than attempting to really react and respond in the way that the fighting-game-inspired mechanics would suggest was the goal.

												Awkward combat mixed with frustrating enemy AI makes this game a negative experience for me. It doesn't help that the game design is based on grinding to progress through the Abyss. The difficulty of the game fluctuates randomly and if you land on hard in the next room, you are dead. It's another case of pretty assets being ruined by awful game design.			"

Personally, I really enjoyed the game, mainly because I'm a sucker for metroidvania style games. Pros: -The game has a nice ambientation, the character portraits and the artistic view in general is GORGEUS, some amazing talent right there.-Acquiring new characters and using them in the 4-player battle mode is really cool and can get addicting.

												let me start off by saying i'm glad i had the opportunity to play this game, it looks very pretty, and the controls are tight. however, i'm not a big fan of procedurally generated games, i like my maps scripted with puzzles that make me explore. so that's a strike against it, imo. the combat tried to be liquid smooth, there are a lot of options available to you in a fight, but it felt awkward. between a dedicated block button (one of the big reasons i preferred street fighter 2 over mortal kombat back in the 90's), the pause after every third swing, slow hit recovery and turn around time leaves you vulnerable for what seems like an eternity, it all makes for a very clunky experience. also, in my half hour of play, enemies fairly frequently get stuck against the ""cloud of war"" that sometimes appears during a fight, temporarily limiting exploration, unable to move or attack. there are at least three playable characters in the game, but i only played through as the one before losing my patience with the game and exiting. there's some sort of second life, where if you die you can take over as a nameless soldier and continue on your quest and regain use of the main character if you get back to a checkpoint? the explanation wasn't very clear. but what i do know is that if you're playing as the nameless soldier, you're not going to survive to get back to a checkpoint, because you're about as tough as wet toilet paper. also, i only found one checkpoint the entire time, and needed some item i hadn't found yet to activate it.  balls.this is a pretty nice looking 2D sidescrolling metroidvania type game, and i probably would have liked it alot more if it had either a scripted map, or better combat.

												I really like art nouveau aestetics of this game, unfortunatelly I can't honestly recomend it. While I like the game's aestetics its gamepley is rather boring. Maybe it would change a bit if I would play a bit longer and if maybe eventually level designs and encounters would become more interesting, but it isn't only problem. Moving in this game is really awkward. It isn't as fluent as for example in similarly named Abe's Odyssey. In fact I had more problems with properly executing double jump and reaching certain areas then with fighting enemies. To make things worse the game is bugged. I ended my adventure with this game when I was unable to close tips pop up bacause the game wasn't responding to ""B"" key. Exactly this same happened to my friend on his PC. The fact that we both found this bug after few minutes of experiencing this game, as well as fact that such basic bug wasn't corrected after about a year that passed since release of the game, doesn't looks promising.

												I hate writing negative reviews, so I’ll try to keep this as nice as possible. I tried really hard to like this game, but there are some major issues.The main issue I have are the controls, i should be able to hold left/right and attack and have the character still move slightly in that direction in order to keep up with the enemy being knocked back, instead u end up hitting an enemy 1-2 times then stopping attacking and leaving ur self vulnerable while u move a step forward again to attack. This is horrible, it is simply inexcusable in any action game that u can’t move and attack at the same time.Next is the ranged combat, the inability to aim the ranged skills in any direction is absurd when u add in the fact u give us flying enemies... The art is nice, the dialogue is great and the sound is phenomenal. I like the simple storyline but the combat is the bulk of the game and u guys really screwed it up. "

												I badly want to play this game to completion but cannot get myself to do it for a few reasons: One: It's ♥♥♥♥ing difficult on just the normal difficulty... I cannot imagine the impossibility of completing it on the nightmare difficulty without dedicating hours to becoming skilled with the controls and the game mechanics; and I usually will just hop right into a game on one of the harder difficulties in seek of a challenge - I like challenge. What I don't like is seen in reason numero...Two: THE GAME IS NOT COMPLETE. I enjoy the artistry, the music and the overall idea but besides the difficulty in itself the game has some faults that make it even harder. Such as the fact that gold might as well be useless since you cannot keep your weapons or inventory items after you die. This isn't all that bad though the fact alone will cause some apprehension while playing, especially since the controls are a bit difficult to get used to and in a lot of instances, players will find themselves faced against a multitude of highly-coordinated enemies who will need to be struck many-a-time before they die. This is enough of a challenge alone but if you're killed, you lose all of your items and you need to start from the beginning unless you buy a checkpoint coin...which inevitably ♥♥♥♥s you over as you start in the middle of the map with your default weapons. Three: Once your main character dies, you're given an alternative soldier character with much less ability to defend himself than your main. This is fine as it encourages a player to revive their main. A HUGE issue is that the soldier cannot always reach the resurrection shrine in order to do so since he can only jump like two feet in the air and in a lot of cases cannot even get around the map himself which, in turn, forces a player to just let him die so that they can respawn with their main... with, do I dare say it again...the default weapons. Overall I like the concept of the game but I think, like how any great story needs a proofread, this game should've been looked over a few times for any inconsistencies before it was released. I'm thankful I only bought it for a dollar.			"

												This game has some serious technical issues.I tried to play it, and thru the tutorial, it already had issues with freezes and a sluggish frame rate. The launcher said 32 bits and DirectX 9, while I usually play games on DX 11. I don't think it's an issue with the GPU, apparently it's reloading textures and animations all the time. E.g. if I perform a move, say left block, and then don't use it for 10-20 seconds, the next time I try to use it, the game freezes and then shows the animation at a fast pace. Also, if I pause and resume, the textures go to low resolution and then go back to high resolution... Not sure if this is a feature, it looks more like a bug.Can't recommend it, I wasn't able to even play it.			"

												This one's a difficult one for me as to whether I'd recommend it or not.It's a Metroidvania style game with a complex combat system full of melee strikes, special attacks, a grab, blocking, counters, move cancels and combos. You know the saying 'easy to learn, hard to master'? Well, the combat is this game isn't easy to learn. It's almost as if you're trying to play the more recent Street Fighter games in a platformer on the highest difficulty possible.There's three main characters and each has a soldier that jumps in when they die, basically like a second life. If you can get to an altar the main character resurrects and you continue on with them. The soldiers have similar combat styles as their corresponding main character but have different melee and special moves. Then you can absorb the soul of nearly any enemy in the game, even the bosses apparently, and fight as them. Each of them also has their own melee and special moves.Enemies seem to be reasonably varied, though three specific ones will be seen often the entire way through the game. As I said above, they all have their own attacks which they all like to use to stunlock and air juggle you until you die.So, can I recommend this? I'm not sure. If you like Metroidvania style games and can deal with the complexities of the combat here, then yes. If not you may want to give this one a pass. Based upon my own experience and feelings, I have to lean slightly more towards the 'no' side.			"

												inb4 git gud!!!inb4 you left the game running!!!I got all of the achievements except the online one cause it's dead.I seriously just can't recommend this game at all. The more you play the more you realize where it's faults and how garbage the combat system is.  Besides, it's so STILL filled with bugs and glitches. The jumping is so screwed up here, you're going to go nuts how many times you try to double jump your way up platforms while facing backwards thanks to the awesome controls. And if you use one of the crappy soldiers, you might even get stuck and will have to quit the game!The first few runs where run until around the 3rd hour playing I already defeated the warlock. Talk about a bummer. The magic was gone, but still I decided to go through and level my Katrien to level 70 and get more souls and whatnot. I got sick of the game by the 20th hour because even though it's random generated you still play the same thing over and over infinite repeat ad nausem. If at least the music was excellent but it's just good.After everything, I decided to play local co-op. It was waaaaaay more fun than single player. Except:-Sometime when we killed the warlock the 2nd player morphed into the character I was using for some reason, loosing all the equipment.-Even if I left a token somewhere the 2nd player always looses their equipment yet again.-You would hit 2 or more enemies with the special and sometimes none of the souls would come out.-How there's always weapons for the 3rd character but none for the ones we were using and crappy ones at that.-The camera would go to extreme ends if we were apart enough so we couldn't even see what happened on screen.-The ? levels are impossible and so forthSo the game is too easy in the normal difficulty. Want to try nightmare mode? HA!Expect to be combo'd to death while fighting 5 CPU opponents at once. Sure you can turn off friendly fire, but the developers made it not count if you kill the main boss. How can this type of game be played with friendly fire on?? It goes absolutely to the contrary of how the game was made to be. Maybe you think the CPU has friendly fire then? Noooooooooooooooo they will gang up on you till you die especially if you're playing through nightmare mode alone.I hope the developers next time release a guide or a manual so some poor soul doesn't have to go through this.As you can see I tried to play the game to it's fullest. I wanted it to give it a good review and recommend it but in the end, it felt like I wasted my time.			"

												Pros:- Beautiful looking backgrounds, character design and monsters- Randomized levels- Great musicCons:- Clunky controls- Characters movments are awkward and leave lots of vunerable openings to get hit- Enemies have a lot of invincibility frames - Roguelike aspects that usually make games enjoyable but hurt this one- On Day 1, you CANNOT customize your gamepad buttons.Overall the game looks great and sounds great.  And paying only $9.99 didn't make it a bad deal.  The problem really arises with the controls and how the characters fight, as they are clunky and rather slow.  And many times I found myself at the end of an animation getting hit.  While I imagine this is what the designers were going for, it's not something I enjoy dealing with.When you die, you take over as a human who for the most part is weaker than your main character.  The novelty of this wore off pretty quick.  So in a way, this game is very much a rogue-like.  I admit I wasn't expecting this, and usually playing a rogue-like is pretty enjoyable but in this game it took away enjoyment from the experience.  And why is it that they didn't give you the ability to customize the buttons on the controller???  Overall it isn't a bad game and will be hit among those who like rogue-likes.  But in my overall opinion, I wouldn't recommend this game to people unless you were getting it really cheap in a bundle or you love rogue-likes and super smash brothers controls.And it looks like they did give you the ability to change your key bindings on controllers and gamepads.  So I thank them for taking care of that in a week 1 patch.			"

The game feels new every time with the level generation, and it the levels actually feel fun, which is always nice. The bosses are somewhat difficult at times, but overall, its really fair. The only thing bad was patched. Also, online multiplayer and arena modes are in so that is a plus.A really good game.			"

												Great idea, poor realisation - a rogue-like mixed with a brawler, sounds good, doesn't it? Well it does, until you actually get to play this game. The big part of great brawling mechanics is having tight and responsive controls, great animations and overall satisfying feel of combat. This game has only one thing going for it - good animations, everything else is quite lackluster, the controls feel unresponsive and way too sluggish. Probably they were going for a tactical feel of combat, where you have to time everything right and avoid button-mashing, but it really doesn't work out. When you face 1 or 2 enemies at the same time the combat is bearable at best, but anything above that is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and it gets really frustrating really fast. That's already enough to NOT recommend it, because combat was clearly the main focus of this game, and they failed to deliver, but there are some more things that keep me from recommending it:Shallow level tiles - levels look bland and very repetitive, the level design overall is poor as wellDeath mechanic - when you die you get to play as a support character, which is even more clumsy and awkard to control and you're basically stuck with it until you die for realPlay long enough, you can overpower anything - I mentioned how the combat in this game is bad, well... It's doesn't actually matter, if you play long enough - you can just accumulate enough levels and gold to power through most of the levels, which makes it more of a grind3D on 2D planes looks bad - maybe it's just me, but i don't really like the look of 3D models on plain backgroundsNow there are some good things going for this game: interestying art style, theme, good character design, interesting enemies, enemy capture mechanic is fun to play with.So, overall, the awkward feel of the combat is enough alone to not recommend it, I did not enjoy my time with this game.

												I've played it alone and with a friend, and I've enjoyed the game so far. It reminds me of the Adventure mode from Smash Bros, but randomly generated every time. It's random in the sense that the map layout changes, and the level setup changes. You will encounter a lot of the same enemies throughout the game, but there is a decent amount of them to make it not feel too repetitive. You will also experience a specific level type multiple times in a playthrough (as in you will probably do an ice level a few times).The combat is also in the style of Smash Bros, but has less moves. Since I'm a big Smash Bros fan, this actually made the controls feel a bit clunky because I would expect to do a certain move, but instead did nothing. It's not really a bad thing, just confusing at first. I feel like there could be more moves and combos though. It's not the best combat in the world, but it's completely fine after playing with it for a little while.One of my biggest complaints is friendly fire. There is no option to turn this off, and it makes co-op very difficult. My friend killed me almost the same amount of times as the enemies, and it wasn't on purpose. Since you share a screen in a small area, it's too hard to fight a group of enemies with a friend and not hurt them as well. There needs to be an option to disable friendly fire.A lot of items are crazy expensive at the vendors, so you will have to save up your gold. You can also find items from chests, which has been the easier thing to do so far. I feel like saving up gold is a challenge, and it's very possible that it could go to waste if you buy an item and die early on. Health orbs from enemies barely give you HP, and I think they could use a bit of a boost. If you are a fan of rogue-like games, you should get this game. It is easily worth the price. I hope they continue to update the game with more content and maybe more combat mechanics. You should grab a friend to play with too, even though they might end up killing you on accident.			"

												I really wanted to like this game because the music, graphics and characters are very well done.  Perhaps it's not the kind of game I thought it was, but the lack of checkpoints or saves, plus the fact that I loose all the the weapons, rings, etc when I die or in between play sessions is a deal breaker for me.  The special attacks do carry over though, if that's some consolation.  This is one of those games that is very short and you just try to play through in one sitting.I can overlook all this and blame myself for not reading more about it before buying.  But on top of this, the combat is very clunky.  I spend most of the game attacking in the wrong direction, just because it's so slow to turn the character around.  Once I start an attack, I have to wait until the animation is done before I can turn.  Meanwhile the enemies are all around me.  Jumping in unprecise too.  So overall I wouldn't recommend it.  Sorry...  a waste of potential.			"

Beat the game in roughly 2 hours. I was around level 14 or so. I manage to get a decent ice rapier and an ice bracelet that amplified the element, so beating the game wasn't too difficult. That was my 3rd or 4th run ever.Overall its nice. Can't wait to see what the community features are gonna be.(haven't tried multiplayer yet.)			"

												I was kind of excited about this game and it turned out well, but honestly was disappointing in many ways as well. Before you read further, let me sum it up with a I give it a 6/10... So not a standing ovation, but not terrible either. The 2D art used in the game is wonderful and the characters they create are interesting and varied in this world that had so much potential. I honestly enjoy the 3 playable characters and their assortment of foes especially the devil. However, the game needs serious work; it does not feel like a fleshed out game at all. The maps are relatively stale (usually about 3-4 backdrops) and somewhat small, the creatures you fight are not varied as well and while some are well designed and are great to play as, most are not. In fact, if you can capture the spirit of the bird with the spear just right click and kill most AI in the game without challenge. The bird as well as the skeleton with the sword and the uppercut special are OP and kind of the only useful enemy spirits. As for the actual characters, the main fencer woman is nice but clunky to control till you get her specials. The hooded monk is nice but I haven't played him out yet. The female water god is OP with her axe, but her jelly fish special is completely worthless (you'll find out and quickly trade it out for melee specials). The weapons you find for the characters are horribly mundane and not varied. Most of the time you will not find a better weapon for your character and the levels on the weapons go up to about 3 (when your character can exceed lvl 30+). The game also has kind of low replay value. If they add to this game, flesh out the world, spruce of the character textures and add more variety, this game will be great, but as it stands, its a nice shade of mediocre.			"

												Here's the good and bad on this game. In short - it's fun and worth a buy. Though this game is not without problems. Mostly, you have to use analog to play, which should be fine for those transitioning from SSB. But if you play other fighters it may feel weird. Slow animations means there's a ""clunky"" feel. Music is excellent. The system is surprisingly deep for something that's pretty much relegated to two attack buttons. The game is short, and at the moment it's fairly easy. Boss encounters can all be ""cheesed"" - making most of those fights devoid of skill of you so choose. Hopefully there's a difficulty patch to come later on which will add real difficulties not just ""area"" difficulties which you can't really directly control besides selecting other areas to visit. It also seems to me that some balancing may need to take place on the characters you pick up as items as some are clearly better than others, while the grappler character (the one who spits poison) is pretty garbage overall. He has slow pokes and as such they're low priority since they have such long recovery. Most of his special moves are inefficient as well. There's two who I've seen who are stand out, as in far far superior to the rest that I've tried.It took me about 4 hours to beat the game, mostly because I was trying to unlock the final character. In the end I beat it with the default character but made it to the boss once with the cloaked spirit sword guy. Overall, once you get the hang of some of the advanced types of attacks and combos, the game becomes more fun than it already is, however its length is somewhat of a dissapointment, seeing as there's not much of a reason to replay once you've unlocked all of the main characters. Completionists can unlock the supporting summon cast, but these seem to be fairly random, and many can be purchased with gold in game. I have yet to try Co-op but I've read that friendly fire is an issue for some. I'll leave that TBD though. The devs plan on adding in online for the versus mode which may come in a later patch, but for now Versus sounds like a great idea but is something I won't get to play.Overall - somewhat of an expensive game ($15) for the amount of game time you may be likely to sink into this, but if you're a diehard SSB fan, or fighting game and roguelike fan, you'd probably deem the purchase worthwhile.

												Fantastic game, and beautiful in art and sound to top it off. Feels like a rogue-lite beat-em-up featuring fighting game elements. The flow of combat in this game takes some getting used to, and will almost definitely feel sluggish and unresponsive at first. However, I noticed that this feeling disappeared after spending around two hours in the game. The different playable characters all feel unique with different play styles. The game does come off as a little on the easy side, but the procedural generation of the dungeon combined with the ~37 different possible transformations/characters increase the replayability. To top it off, the developers have stated that additional content (enemies, transformations) will become available as players, globally, defeat the final boss. I utilize a controller for playing this game, and would definitely suggest one to any potential players. I cannot speak to the effectiveness and responsiveness of keyboard and mouse control, as I have not tried that control scheme.			"

												Edit: I understand some of the mechanics betterTLDR: This is a fun infinite death labyrinth with metroidvania sensibilities and an interesting asthetic. But it won't let you go to the toilet.Abyss Odyssey is going to be fun for people who enjoy the IDL genre as well as platformers. It's very solidly built and looks beautiful. It plays well on the 360 gamepad and while I've seen people complain about the controls, the fact is that they're pretty tight. They're finicky because animations need to finish before the next input UNLESS you have a move cancel available to you. This is part of the core mechanic of the game, it might feel like input lag or sloppy controls at times but if you understand cancels then it isn't an issue. It might get you killed but it's not the fault of poor design. I've not used the KB nor other gamepads, so your mileage may vary with your choice of input.The ability to customise your character is great. You choose the moves you can do and how you will power them up at specific points, but respeccing is free so don't worry about doing it wrong. Each of the main characters has their own movesets for normal attacks and the customisable special attacks and feel very different to each other (well the first two characters do. The third remains unlocked....).Biggest cons: -The game needs more explanation. You use your special attacks to build mana. When your mana is full you can perform a spirit bomb that makes enemies drop their soul if you kill with it. You can then use your soul to transform into the monster which, and this is the important part, has it's own separate health bar. This is never really explained. Except by me, right now. This is not the only mystery of gameplay mechanics. I am going to discover them though.-No save system. The runs are long and I'd like to come back to them. Autosaves at checkpoints would be a brilliant addition.-No pause in single player. With no save you'd expect maybe you can pause. This is not the case. Both the character menu and the game menu allow time to continue in game. SOMETIMES I'M GOING TO NEED PEE URGENTLY.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is a fighting game dropped into a rogue like dungeon crawler.  With that in mind, this review will concetrate on comparing Abyss Odyssey to other games in the fighting genre.Although unique in many ways, the basic fighting system takes a lot from the Street Fighter series.  Athough there are no command inputs, like quarter circles on the joystick, the movement feels a lot like Super Street Fighter.  The combat system is not build around flashy air combos and button smashing; instead it focuses on simple strikes, a few special moves and tight hit boxes where timing is everything.  Along with this familiar focus on timing, the developers also were wise enough to borrow some of the more familiar ways players take advantage of timing in Street Fighter.  Knockdowns, cancels, blocking, keep-away techniques like uppercuts and projectiles (think Ryu/Ken), wall juggling, as well as super moves that stop the animation for a moment were all welcomed discoveries for me.  Fighting games are of a special genre where dexterity and muscle memory actually matter, and when one is disguised as a rogue like adventure game or platformer like Abyss Odyssey might be, it can easily be unfairly compared to the wrong games.  As a fighting game, this gets a solid A-.  It's not fantastic, but it is rather good.  The turn-around animation is a bit slow and too long horizontally for some characters which make it frustrating to face the enemy in narrow places.  There also seems to be a lot of ways to break your block, which makes blocking less useful than it should be.  The AI is very smart and ramps up in difficulty nicely - although I do wish I could change the general game difficulty through the UI.  Nitpicks aside, this is the best $15 I've spent in a while - and I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet.  It’s beautiful, the rouge/dungeon crawling is light and fun, and it even has community based goals that will unlock more content.  If you like fighting games, this one is solid and unique enough not to pass up.  If you are not a fan of the genre however, the learning curve might be a bit too steep, but it also might be one of the more fun fighting games to learn on given it has so much more content  to enjoy.

If you die, you lose everything, and if you don't die then you just keep going until something kills you.  No 'real' leveling up because you can't save anything, or build your character up.

												Cons :1. The turning(left or right) of the character is pretty slow, which affect pretty much when you're in combat. 2. When your main character died, you have to play as the soldier to continue fighting through the stage and trying to revive your main character at the altar. This is when the problem occurs, the movement and fighting animation of the soldier especially katrien's soldier is quite glitchy. The swinging of the sword sometimes or mostly doesn't damaged the enemies, especially when you're overlapping with your enemy (even a little of overlapping).These are the problems that frustrated me so much when playing this game, but if you don't care about these problems, then go ahead and buy it :). It is fun and enjoyable!!Hope this comment help you :)			"

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. "

												Oddworld: Abyss Odyssey is a great game.You play as Abe, a mudokon working in a food factory which suddenly wants to make his people into food.The gameplay is fun, though the platforming can be tricky, but what really sets the game apart is the need to save your people like some kind of fish jesus, and the fascinating factory setting.It's a little dated but still very much worth playing.

												Beautiful game with a great soundtrack. I had a lot of fun playing it. You go into the abyss from one of the 3 entry points and you try to reach the bottom where the Warlock is. There are bosses and different character to capture. As far as i know you can play as any character of the game given the fact you have the lvl to capture them. Its a good game it gonna give you a couple of hours of fun you can play coop too which is great. You can go for the nightmare mode once the game is too easy and try a new challenge. You can try versus too but not a lot of people play these days...			"

												I, like most of the negative reviewers, had a problem with the control's.  They are just too damn clunky.  Fighting is more frustrating than fun.  The one good thing about this rogue-LITE, are the graphics.  The game looks very differant than most 2D brawlers.  This still can't save the game from terrible gamepad control's.  I beat the game in about 3 hours.  For 15 bucks that doesn't seem like it's worth the money.  Well you say, go level the other 2 characters and you'll artificially inflate the game time.  Yes this is true.  But when the combat is so frustrating for some characters, such as the monk, then I just cant endure it.  I just want to rage every time I play the monk becasue his attacks are so slow and his specials require space.I must be terrible at the game because the biggest combo I can muster is 4 hits.    There are just too many monsters on screen and too much going on for me to think effectively.  The monsters give you plenty of time on the easy levels to think out a strategy.  But most of the time it's just button mashing your specials.  There is definately some skill involved.  So if you're bad at fighting games, then avoid Abyss Odyssey.As a game by itself. It isn't bad.  It is just VERY short. I honestly wish I could refund but as I said it took me 3 hours to beat the first time.			"

												I first played this game in a multiplayer build at EVO 2014. It looked great, the controls and everything about it was interesting. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this game"", but I after I bought it, I felt somewhat ripped off. This is because when I bought the game, I went straight to multiplayer to go practice as the character I played at in EVO. Turns out you have to play the single player to unlock EVERYTHING for the multiplayer; The main characters, side-characters, even movesets. The moveset is customizable and that's cool & all, but I had anticipated to just dowload and play with some friends to show them the game. I had hoped that I would have played the exact same multiplayer build I played before, but I have to now put hours into the singleplayer game just to get the roster and all of their moves for the multiplayer. I honestly don't want to do that if I already got a taste of a awesome multiplayer build back in EVO. I don't know if they changed that or not, but that's just my exprience with the game. Get it if you want, but you'll have to put in a lot of time to get an actual good taste of the competitiveness in the game.			"

												Doesn't tell you much about the game when you just start it.Controls are terrible (at least for keyboard, this game seems to be designed for controllers).If you change your keyboard controls, the game does not tell you what they are and expects you to remember them. I ended up in a small pit with a chest and it took me 10 minutes trying to jump over a ledge to get back to the rest of the dungeon.The game is decent, but there's so many difficulties to overcome for those who are not already ""used to"" the game. Annoyances like these really stop me from enjoying this game, so I can't recommend it...			"

												With platform fighters being so ubiquitous and essentially the same game, what sets a really good one apart from the rest is the story and art of the game.  While I have barely scratched the surface of Abyss Odyssey, it is easy to see within the first few minutes that this is one of the really good ones.  If you're looking for a more tactical title, this isn't Mark of the Ninja.  What it is, however, is a beautifullly stylized, side-scrolling platformer/beat-em-up.  I have only a few complaints.  First and foremost, in order to do what the game tells you to do, for instance, block, you have to go back to the default bindings menu.  This is a minor quibble as, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  Second, the levelling up and upgrades are inexplicably unexplained.  You're simply told to assign skill point to a picture.  I've not played a lot, so I'm still scratching my head as to what the skill points actually do or how to use the skills axquired since none of this is explained at all, even though you get your first upgrade within five minutes of starting (no tutorial exists either).  Lastly, the game was clearly designed to be played with a controller to the point where using the keyboard feels unnaturally clunky.  No biggie there if you have a controller, but I don't, and I wish games designed to be played with a controller would advertise that fact through strong developer suggestions.  As I now have quite a few games designed in this fashion, acquiring said controller is an inevitability and I will update this review if anything changes after that.  Otherwise, this is a solid thumbs up with a few minor issues, easily worth the <$10 I spent during the sale.			"

												Complete and utter garbage in every aspect.Let's start with simple things: moving. Moving around in this game is awful. It's like you're holding your character on a leash and pulling her around the screen. She will often refuse to turn around, pushing her back against a ledge instead of grabbing it, or swinging her rapier on the opposite direction that you meant her too. Jumping is a pain: you have a double jump but you have to hold the button as long as possible before hitting it a second time in order to reach the maximum height; even a couple frames less than that will make you miss most jumps. You do have a high jump, the command for which is down+jump, which is the same command you can use to jump down passable ledges. Have fun with that.All enemies are the same: hp sponges that spend all their time turtling.They read your inputs and react with frame-perfect precision to what you're doing.Despite all that, the game still manages to be extremely simple and boring, since your grab attack never fails and is the only reliable way to damage enemies, bosses included.Controls are redundant. You can attack in every direction with the right stick, or by hitting X and a direction on the left stick. This means that each character has four different attacks (neutral, forward, up, down), all of which are barely different and only serve to make you whiff most attacks.You can dodge by holding block and tapping a direction, or by tapping the bumpers. Most enemies recover from whiffed attacks before you recover from your roll, though, especially considering that hitting the attack button after a roll results in YET ANOTHER pointless, slow attack that will whiff whenever it comes out and you don't expect it.You can grab enemies by pushing B or by pushing X while blocking. Yes, you will whiff a grab when attempting a counter attack after blocking.Despite all that redundancy, special moves are confined to Y + direction in much the same way as Smash Bros games. You have a stick, two bumpers, a trigger and a face button with redundant functions, and yet your most useful and customizable attacks require an awkward button combination to pull off. Control customization options are no help in this regard.The roguelike elements are garbage, too. I was always finding the same crap over and over again - weapons meant for other characters I hadn't unlocked, merchants selling useless crap at ridiculous prices, and skill tree altars that grant you the marvelous ability to manage your damn skills.All these things mixed together form an extremely luck-based experience: you have to hope that the AI will decide to not dodge your attack. You have to hope that you will find a weapon you can actually use. You have to hope you will find respawn tokens so you don't have to start from the beginning when you die.A grueling slog that I wouldn't wish on my middle school bullies.			"

												TL;DRGraphics are reasonably nice, but the controls aren't much to write home about except in an angry letter. Lack of real teaching tools for a new player makes it difficult to get into without having to memorize the keyboard shortcuts from the beginning instead of gradual learning.Maybe me playing this game with a less than ideal computer was a mistake and somewhat lessens the truthfullness of my review, but no matter. I simply didn't find the game enjoyable.I understand the game is inherently angled to people who like challenge, who want to be thrust into something and learn to conquer it themselves. But the fact I had to keep breaking flow in order to work out what ♥♥♥♥ing button did what (by going to the control menu) just sorta pisses me off. A game of this nature relies on flow, and if I can't keep that flow going because I don't know how the play the game, you're maybe doing it not too great for some of us.And the sheer speed the enemies move (coupled with low framerate from aformentioned♥♥♥♥♥♥computer) made it impossible for the game to feel natural. Something about clicking being the method of attack threw me off as well. Hearing my mouse rapidly click clack away as I tried to hit a skeleton just wasn't doing it for me.The graphics look reasonably nice though. Perhaps the game is more enjoyable with a controller and a good pc. Perhaps pigs fly. Perhaps the fact I played for 8 minutes cheapens the opinion of the review. I don't care, didn't enjoy, would rather go play Symphony of the Night on an emulator.			"

												If you are looking for a great action side-scrolling platform game remembering Castlevania, with a well developed combat system, very precise controls, great soundtracks, stunning visuals, some brilliant level up mechanics and RE4 merchant... DON'T EVEN THINK TO LOOK TO THIS GAME!Abyss Odyssey have a good proposal and all, but stop there. The gameplay in general is ""strange"" and clunky; the graphics aren't much agreeable, movements (Walk, jump and attack) are... argh... and the music don't carry the feeling of what is happening.If even with all this you want to try, then go ahead. It can be a good game with lots of patience to face frustrating situations without motive (And don't forget the castlevania ""similarities"" and RE4 merchant).4,5/10 (Graphics: 5/10; Sound: 6/10; Gameplay: 4/10; Fun: 3/10)			"

You have a stick, two bumpers, a trigger and a face button with redundant functions, and yet your most useful and customizable attacks require an awkward button combination to pull off. Control customization options are no help in this regard.The roguelike elements are garbage, too. I was always finding the same crap over and over again - weapons meant for other characters I hadn't unlocked, merchants selling useless crap at ridiculous prices, and skill tree altars that grant you the marvelous ability to manage your damn skills.All these things mixed together form an extremely luck-based experience: you have to hope that the AI will decide to not dodge your attack. You have to hope that you will find a weapon you can actually use. You have to hope you will find respawn tokens so you don't have to start from the beginning when you die.A grueling slog that I wouldn't wish on my middle school bullies.			"

												With platform fighters being so ubiquitous and essentially the same game, what sets a really good one apart from the rest is the story and art of the game.  While I have barely scratched the surface of Abyss Odyssey, it is easy to see within the first few minutes that this is one of the really good ones.  If you're looking for a more tactical title, this isn't Mark of the Ninja.  What it is, however, is a beautifullly stylized, side-scrolling platformer/beat-em-up.  I have only a few complaints.  First and foremost, in order to do what the game tells you to do, for instance, block, you have to go back to the default bindings menu.  This is a minor quibble as, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  Second, the levelling up and upgrades are inexplicably unexplained.  You're simply told to assign skill point to a picture.  I've not played a lot, so I'm still scratching my head as to what the skill points actually do or how to use the skills axquired since none of this is explained at all, even though you get your first upgrade within five minutes of starting (no tutorial exists either).  Lastly, the game was clearly designed to be played with a controller to the point where using the keyboard feels unnaturally clunky.  No biggie there if you have a controller, but I don't, and I wish games designed to be played with a controller would advertise that fact through strong developer suggestions.  As I now have quite a few games designed in this fashion, acquiring said controller is an inevitability and I will update this review if anything changes after that.  Otherwise, this is a solid thumbs up with a few minor issues, easily worth the <$10 I spent during the sale.			"

												Game is good, the combat isn't too hard if you play for a while. However, there are bugs like frozen enemies and combat boundaries do no trigger. The Jump actions are terribly bugged, sometime you just cant jump over the ledge at all. Especially late game when they raise the height of the ledges to almost the maximum limit.			"

												TL;DRGraphics are reasonably nice, but the controls aren't much to write home about except in an angry letter. Lack of real teaching tools for a new player makes it difficult to get into without having to memorize the keyboard shortcuts from the beginning instead of gradual learning.Maybe me playing this game with a less than ideal computer was a mistake and somewhat lessens the truthfullness of my review, but no matter. I simply didn't find the game enjoyable.I understand the game is inherently angled to people who like challenge, who want to be thrust into something and learn to conquer it themselves. But the fact I had to keep breaking flow in order to work out what ♥♥♥♥ing button did what (by going to the control menu) just sorta pisses me off. A game of this nature relies on flow, and if I can't keep that flow going because I don't know how the play the game, you're maybe doing it not too great for some of us.And the sheer speed the enemies move (coupled with low framerate from aformentioned♥♥♥♥♥♥computer) made it impossible for the game to feel natural. Something about clicking being the method of attack threw me off as well. Hearing my mouse rapidly click clack away as I tried to hit a skeleton just wasn't doing it for me.The graphics look reasonably nice though. Perhaps the game is more enjoyable with a controller and a good pc. Perhaps pigs fly. Perhaps the fact I played for 8 minutes cheapens the opinion of the review. I don't care, didn't enjoy, would rather go play Symphony of the Night on an emulator.			"

												If you are looking for a great action side-scrolling platform game remembering Castlevania, with a well developed combat system, very precise controls, great soundtracks, stunning visuals, some brilliant level up mechanics and RE4 merchant... DON'T EVEN THINK TO LOOK TO THIS GAME!Abyss Odyssey have a good proposal and all, but stop there. The gameplay in general is ""strange"" and clunky; the graphics aren't much agreeable, movements (Walk, jump and attack) are... argh... and the music don't carry the feeling of what is happening.If even with all this you want to try, then go ahead. It can be a good game with lots of patience to face frustrating situations without motive (And don't forget the castlevania ""similarities"" and RE4 merchant).4,5/10 (Graphics: 5/10; Sound: 6/10; Gameplay: 4/10; Fun: 3/10)			"

												This game is a living peice of crap, .7/10, waste of money.Graphics are kind of good, but it needs more work like the blurriness of the controls on the menus and the need to turn your brightness down 75% AND turn off motion blurs.This game could be good, but needs more work on the animation, the lagging, the camera speed, the control amount, and the beginning of the game(like the ""starting level"".) I saw ""double jump"" and i saw a small hole in the wall, so what do you do? You use your dinky little sword thing to demolish the BRICK WALL.Needs an elipse warning, my eyes still hurt for more than an hour after playing my session of 15 minutes(I NEVER need the warning because I am okay with seeing that kind of stuff.) This is the worst game I could think for paying for. I got it for FREE and it wasn't worth it.			"

												Castlevania + Soul Caliber = Abyss Odyssey. (I've never been much good at the second.)I finished it, but I didn't like it.I expect fans of fighting games like soul caliber and street fighter will enjoy the mechanics of this game, it's a richer single player experience than just fighting a tournament bracket. For more casual players who think the game looks good (it does) and might have an interesting story, be warned, it's incredibly frustrating. The fighting system is complex, and you don't get much help from the game. Reading the guides on steam will save some angry deaths.FYI:Abyss Odyssey plays like a classic Arcade game, you have to beat the game in one go, no continues. There are ways to buy  the equivalent of extra lives, but they aren't guaranteed. Your characters level up (which seems to make little difference) and acquire new skills which carry from playthrough-to-playthrough, but these things don't make the difference between dying and surviving. At least it doesn't eat your quarters....			"

Every character has the same and it takes forever to gather the mana needed in order to cast one-During PvE you level up your hero. The problem here is that a levelup only gives very minor improvements to stats and a (pretty useless) skillpoint every now and then-Waiting times to find a PvP match are off limits. Seriously. I just kinda gave up after a while-The inventory system is really bad. You can only store 6 items, can't change their order, delete them or even use them under certain circumstances.As a conclusion I would only recommend this game to the most hardcore Fighting/Platformer fans and/or people with a pretty high frustration tolerance.

												The only positive of this game so far is how good it looks.Literally effortless port from console to PC, they haven't bothered to implement *anything* for PC users. Everything is laid out for an xbox controller and all the buttons on screen are for xbox.Everything is just unfun right now. Enemies wait under you while jumping, have very weird and inhuman ways of fighting you which means you need to cheese it as a soldier most of the time. (The soldier is the back up character which you get when you die, and this WILL happen when you get hit, you often get chained for 100% of your HP)Sluggish, boring combat, never quite sure what the aim is. Rarely do I buy a game where I can say very little positive about it, but this is quite frankly the worst game purchase I ever made, and I never thught I would enjoy Euro Truck Sim 2 more than another game.

Controls are not sluggish, they are cleverly designed to limit you (at the start, things get smoother as you get stronger) to pay attention to your next move, if you push buttons mindlessly you will fail, if you block, dodge, parry, and learn to recognize the opportunity to hit, you will do fine and have fun, thats what video games are about afterall, not about loot, nor vanity items, nor special edition hats, nor anniversary items nor ""founders"" badges, they are about enjoying the process of playing, and that is what Abyss Odyssey is about.

Posted: July 15, 2014
												This is an impression based on one and a half playthroughs of the game. As you can see I only have maybe and hour and a half of playtime so you'll have to take what I say with a grain of salt. If my opinions change in the future, I'll be sure to update this review.Abyss Odyssey is basically a randomly-generated platformer/brawler set in 19th century Chile. The idea is that a warlock has created a large, shifting labyrinth, and as one of three characters (the second two of which must be unlocked) it's your goal to descend the labyrinth and kill the warlock at the bottom to destroy the titular abyss.So, let's start with the good: the game's presentation is by and large pretty wonderful. Beautiful character portraits accompany the sparse dialogue and stage backgrounds drip with color and personality. Enemies and allies share the same, saturated visual style as the backgrounds, and there are some imaginative designs among the rogue's gallery of ghostly soldiers, spiders, bulls, ent-like creatures, and so on. However, though they look good standing still, movement and attacks animate with stiff rigor, creating an effect that's somewhat unpleasant, marring the otherwise remarkable visuals. The music is mostly forgettable. There's a strange mix of atmospheric ambience and jarring, rougly-Genesis-era midi-esque themes that pop up almost randomly; some stages are silent while others are accompanied by energetic themes with little explanation. It's weird and a little rough.Now, the not-quite-as-good: the highly touted fighting system that supports the whole experience. The bottom line is that... it's not particularly deep or well-integrated. ACE have clearly taken inspiration from Smash Bros., featuring a system based around regular attacks (and directional variants, e.g. neutral air, up air, down air, and side air) and directional specials, but heavy input lag and slow, chunky animations make it feel like wading through molasses. Combos are heavily restricted by the fact that attacks and movements can only be cancelled with the use of 'cancel points,' a regenerating resource that allows you to cancel regular attacks into special attacks, dodges, or jumps. You start the game with just one of these, and have at max three. The result of this stingy cancelling policy is that most of the time the only combat options you have available to you are basic two or three hit normal combos or the slow-to-start-up, very vulnerable specials.Furthermore, attack and character hitboxes are poorly defined. It's difficult to explain, but things that feel like they shouldn't connect do and that the should connect don't. Many attacks have hitboxes that last for what seems like ages, resulting in attacks that can't be dodged through and which come out too quickly to be jumped over by your sluggish double jump. The developers seem to have tried to avert this issue by giving you a large amount of health and a reasonable supply of healing potions, but being able to tank a lot of damage isn't satisfying in the way that being able to dodge a lot of damage is.The need for large health pools is further highlighted by the ability to 'capture' enemies and play as them. All enemies work on the same basic tenets as player characters, in that they have a small pool of normal attacks and three directional special attacks. Captured enemies have their own pool of health, essentially serving as extra lives for your main character. While it's a neat idea, and it certainly highlights the complex enemy design, a large chunk of the enemies are simply trash to play as compared to the main characters. Capturing the regular ghostly soldiers that populate most floors of the dungeon reveals that, surprise, playing them feels like playing a weak grunt in a beat-em-up, because that's exactly what you're doing.Of course, that just makes it more necessary to capture the few enemies that are somewhat useful, but the capture ability, like all other movements and attacks, is clunky and difficult to rely on. Even after capturing a decent enemy, it's hard to shake the feeling that they're anything more than a meatshield for your main character.Attack diversity is poor and combo potential is fairly limited. The combo videos shown by Atlus prior to release seem to promise at least some degree of complexity, but combos like those shown would only be possible under very specific conditions. Most of the time you'll be up against three or four enemies in small, cramped environments littered with evironmental hazards that render movement and combo potential very difficult. In these situations, the most effective strategy usually ends up being mashing your basic normal chains until everything is dead, since the aformentioned cancel points are never plentiful enough to afford more interesting tactics.Having said all this, I don't feel like the game is bad. It's hugely clunky and clashing gameplay elements discourage interesting play, but the mostly-wonderful presentation at least makes it an interesting trip. I'm also willing to believe that perhaps the combat system will become more interesting with continued use, given that many other beat-em-ups, like Guardian Heroes or Code of Princess, took some time to grow on me. Based on these middling first impressions though, I'm inclined to say it's only worth it if you're very curious about a couple of the novel ideas. Otherwise, I'd be much quicker to recommend Double Dragon Neon (which is also slow, but is very technical and rewarding), or Fairy Bloom Freesia (which also adopts a Smash-Bros-esque fighting system, but is much faster and smoother to play).

												This game is balanced and coded so poorly. The fan base will kiss up to the developers and the both will completely disregard anything negative said about this game.The A.I. (NPCs) all will input read. This means that if you press Dodge, the A.I. will know what action you pressed immediately and react to the best possible outcome. This is all based on how far you are into the game however, as the farther down you go into the game the more reactive the A.I. will become. Sometimes to the point where you can't even land an attack because it will always be blocked or perfect blocked.Next, the game has the audicity to sent multiple enemies at you per fight, all of which have no collision (IE. They can stand in you and inside their allies). All of which input read. Then, the enemies also can not friendly-fire themselves, meaning they can all form a wall and corner you and continusely attack and combo you. They will not interrupt each other, and they are near infallible. Sometimes you get knocked into antoher enemy which will immediately grab you, then thrown into another. They are so pin-point and exact that is just becomes blatantly obvious how broken the A.I. is.Want to bring a friend? Well, that's going to be make things harder as unless you enable friendly-fire (They say the game is balanced around it) you won't be allowed to post to the leaderboards. You can friendly-fire and interrupt each other, but the enemies on the other hand can not. You also share drops, meaning a partner can take everything leaving you with nothing.The coding in this game is also very, very bad. Bad network coding leads to a lot of lag even between people that are within the same time-zone and country, leading to some really annoying mishaps. Such as teleporting, falling through objects, and desynchronization. It's just overall poorly done.I highly recommend not buy this game. It's fun for a while, but the clear problems and lack of interest of changing it because the fan-base kisses up to the developers just leads to countless frustration.			"

												It's an alright game. The controls are fine for me and if you don't like them you can always customize them to your liking. However, I found myself trying to attack things while I was facing the wrong way a lot lol. Also, I wish you could shield up while you are moving. I was getting wrecked by everything I came in contact with too. Maybe I am just underpowered at the moment, or it was the fact I was playing solo. I wasn't enjoying it as much solo, maybe I'll have to go back to it when I get a friend to play with.			"

												Another game, another first try!The video is available here:


YouTube™ Video: First Try:Abyss Odyssey 

			Views: 41		

			Abyss Odyssey is developed by ACE Studio. Get it on steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/255070/ Full written review also available at: http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttimedia/recommended/255070/		

So, a metroidvanian rougelike it is! Abyss Odyssey looked promising, the majority of the reviews are positive and after beating the abyss once and making the video, I have to say that I wholeheartedly agree.First off, the options menu is good. 3 seperate sliders for music, voice and soundeffects enhance the audio experience greatly. The graphical options are a bit limited, but well enough for this type of game. Before venturing into the abyss, the game gives you a tutorial in which the default controls are shown. In case you forget what button to push, the controls can be looked at or, if you play with the keyboard, rebound even while you are venturing towards the warlock.  As we venture down the abyss the game shows itself in a really nice artstyle. The background looks nice, though there are only a few times in which you can't distinguish background from foreground. Speaking of art, the sounddesign in this is game is top notch, which may be a reason, why you can buy the soundtrack seperately.(not that you start thinking that the game is bad...)Through the nice looking areas we go, as we are attacked by some monsters. First off, the game sure isn't shy about its variety on enemies, which you can all unlock as playable characters in training and versus mode as well. The combat itself is in my opinion the weakest point in the game. The animations feel sluggish and unresponsive, which is a shame because apart from that the combat system is quite nicely built, especially when interacting with the environment. Not only in the combat also during small plattforming sections the handling feels weird, but that might just be me. Due to the fact that you start off the story mode with one character and one starting zone, the replayability of the game is definitely there, especially when you want to unlock all characters. Another collectable are pages for the warlock's book(actual name not coming into my mind), which you can read, if you so desire. And again we are at the point of the tl:dr/tl:dw! Is it worth it? If you can forgive the game for giving you a bad feeling about the handling in terms of combat and plattforming, I'd say it's worth picking up for full price. When the game goes on sale(which it is until 7pm CEST, 16th of July), I wouldn't even hesitate buying it. And even if the handling feels weird and you can't be asked dealing with that, you can still buy the soundtrack, if you are into it.			"

												So I buy the game because it lists Co-op. I can get over the beautiful and clunky animations, as the enemies seem to suffer the same handicaps. Then I find out that you don't get true co-op because if you turn off friendly fire it acts like you've turned on cheat mode and disables story progression. Ever since Contra on the grand old NES has Friendly Fire been an accepted loss with co-op modes...because while the story plays out in a 2D side scroller, we know the world itself is actually 3D. So with the loss of a standard of co-op gaming goes my recommendation.			"

												I love this game. I can't believe I didnt buy this game earlier. It has a fantastic artstyle - unsurprising considering it's ACE team (Zeno Clash had such a cool art direction.)Love how the game plays, it's one of the cooler brawler / rogue light games i've seen. Many people claim that the combat is ""off"" or clumsy and well..At first I agreed - and it's mostly due to the fact that you can't cancel out of attacks and if you start a basic attack you are rooted until the animation is up. (You can, however cancel normal attacks for special attacks)This is less of a problem once you start to use your attacks more carefully and less spammy (as it often is at the start)The game is rather short though, I havent beaten it but i'm very close, most people are able to beat this title in 4 hours or less, even 2. But it has, since it's a rogue light a lot of replay value. The characters are really cool too - I just wish it had more of a story than it has, since the voice acting is prettty much okay and the story is pretty interesting.All in all I recommend it to any brawler/roguelight fans :)			"

												It's not often I rate games down but I can't help but address this one. Not because it's bad per se but because it has so much potential to be great.PROS:- Fantastic Soundtrack. I only wish you didn't have to own the game to buy it first. I'd pay the price of the game for the soundtrack alone. I will look around to see if I can find it elsewhere, though.- Unique Artstyle. While I admit I'm not a big fan of the character or creature models art style, it is still different. So, I give it credit there for not looking like everything else out there.- Interesting story from the little bit I've seen. I'd like to see the rest but since I won't be finishing the game that's not going to happen.- Great presentation. The menus and interface are all very well designed and put together. Everything flows pretty well as it should in any dungeon crawler like this.CONS:- Art Style. This one is strictly opinion but even though the art style is different than most, it's still pretty ugly in terms of the characters and even the environments at times.- Combat: One thing that's extremely vital in a game like this is good fliud combat. It's just not here. Don't get me wrong. You can have a decent game with stiff controls but considering most of your characters aren't exactly ""power"" characters, you might expect them to be a little more limber and agile. The animations are nothing to boast about and considering this is a core game mechanic, it's a big hit to the games playability.- FRAME RATE: Considering my machine is powerful enough to run Bioshick Infinite, Arkham Asylum, Portal 2 and Crysis 2 flawlessly on MAX SETTINGS, I would have expected this game to run the same. The game seems to jump slightly at times and there seems to be slowdown occuring almost consistently. I don't know what's going on but it's almost like someone didn't optimize this game to run very well.This could really be a masterpiece almost but it just falls short.I'd recommend Outland, Dust: An Elysian Tale or Valdis Story instead.

												Wait what?! Ok, so lets just be straight forward. I haven't played long, but the fighting was terrible. It didn't feel good. Then I went from an area that wasy eas to hard, and then back to an easy one. How does that work? The hard area wasn't really that hard. The worst part was I kept getting to these places that wanted me to configure my skills, but I have no clue what I was supposed to do. This game is not very intuitive, or very interesting. The story from the very little I got to play was pretty obtuse.			"

												Wait what?! Ok, so lets just be straight forward. I haven't played long, but the fighting was terrible. It didn't feel good. Then I went from an area that wasy eas to hard, and then back to an easy one. How does that work? The hard area wasn't really that hard. The worst part was I kept getting to these places that wanted me to configure my skills, but I have no clue what I was supposed to do. This game is not very intuitive, or very interesting. The story from the very little I got to play was pretty obtuse.			"

												THIS IS A FIRST IMPRESSIONSI can't reccomend this to most people, only those who really like Castlevania style games and even then pick it up on sale.Pros:-Good soundtrack-Pretty Visuals-combat more complex than most metroidvania style games-likable character designsCons-Very forgettable level design (levels are randomly generated apparently but that doesn't do much to make them interesting)-Clunky and slugish feeling fighting mechanics-forgettable level design-forgettable main character-either incomplete or just lazy combat implementation (feels like a gimped Smash Bros.)-Lack of options in VS mode-Laughably unbalancedMain GameAbyss Oddessy seems to take inspiration from Castlevania and it does a decent job of feeling and looking like a Castlevania but thats about where the similarities end. The levels are really kind of generic. I will attempt to explain how so bear with me. The first level is a subterranean cave, you drop from above into a small area with fallthrough platforms and then you enter the cave area. There is a room to the left with enemies or a chest or both and then a path to the right to the rest of the level and sometimes its mixed up vise versa and the rest of the level there might be enemies and small rooms etc with chests and a save altar or whatever.The next level is really similar to the last but with a different layout. Different platforms, bottomless holes (by the way every level seems to at least have one bottomless hole signified by some kind of black smoke at the opening of it adding to the sort of cookie cutter feel of the levels) and moving platforms, and then some kind of open space where you stop to fight enemies since the game locks you in with black mist that are really just invidible walls. You go through a gauntlet of these levels and either make it to the end or die and when you die your forced to play as a soldier unless you saved at an altar unless you die again and then respawn or restart as the main character. The requirement to save at the altar costs you a pretty penny of the in-game currency you find. The levels are randomly generated apparently but it certainly doesn't make them interesting.At one point another entrance opens to ""the abyss"" and this next entrance is more or less very similar to the cave level I mentioned before except with foliage in the background and caterpillars as small enemies rather than spiders in the cave. The layout seems the same as progressing from one level to the next takes you to another similar looking jungle level with a different layout. From what I'm seeing this is what the rest of the game will be like. Otherwise I will update this review if anything changes but the first two levels seem similar.I'm a little disappointed with the way the levels seem to be considering the prologue or tutorial level had much more varied level building and varied assets (in one section you are in a burning house.) I hope this changes but so far it seems like this game's gimmick which is disappointing because some kind of Castlevania castle with intelligent design would have been better. Right now it just feels like when building these levels someone had a list of level elements or rooms to insert along the way and just checked off each one in a different order.Story/Character BuildingI don't feel much for the story yet but from what I do see I don't really care about the main character. There's no reason to care, she's cold and emotionless and is a silent warrior which I don't find very interesting. This character does talk but with very little emotion.Multiplayer/Fighting Engine and Mechanics One of the features of this game is the fighting mechanics and how similar it is to smash brothers but does it live up and do much in the way of being a brawler? I play a lot of smash brothers so I might be biased. The Abyss Rising has things in common with smash brothers but it falls short because of several glaring issues. 1) There is a HP system instead of a percentage system like Smash Brother's health system. As such there are no ring outs and knockback doesn't change with damage taken. Certain characters really benefit from this kind of setup and this segways into the next point.2) Balance. I have only unlocked a handful of characters to play as so far but some really seem to outclass the others. The big Ice king seems like one of the very best characters at the moment from what I played. He has very long range with his sword and doesn't seem to have enough endlag or startup lag to have some kind of drawback. If he attacks and you are approaching with an attack he will probably win that exchange. I would say you should probably camp him with projectiles until you can find an opening but then he will just use his own. His projectile is a large horse that runs across the screen and is taller than most characters so you either block it and allow your opponent to move in or you jump over it. Rolling doesn't seem like an option becase of the horse's size you will probably still get his by the butt end of the attack after your roll animation is finished. General Gripes with how the game worksOther gripes I couldn't really categorize. The main character and I'm sure others, has a back air (jump with your back facing the opponent and press the attack button) that is different from the rest of their ariels. In smash these kinds of moves work because of what I pointed out in the first point. An attack like this in Smash Brothers would probably be a powerful finishing move with high knockback that would knock your opponent closer to the edge of the screen or off the stage when your opponent is at low health. In this game its just an average one hit move that makes you vulnerable with your back facing the opponent when you land. There is no kind of dash and not only does that limit your mobility but it limits approach options as well because an attack out of dash would help characters who feel sluggish and have a hard time approaching the opponent. Grabs automatically send your opponent up right after grabbing unless you press to a direction instantly but at least this seems to allow for combos. For whatever reason attacks you do by pressing a direction and the attack button are binded to the right analog stick. Pressing left, up, or down will bring out an attack corresponding to attack+direction. This also kind of puzzles me. I guess its nice but in this game its very unnecesary. In smash you get a different attack by tilting the analog stick to a direction (halfway or not touching the edge of where the analog touches) and pressing the attack button and this is different from the attack you would get by quickly smashing the analog stick in a direction and pressing the attack button which is called a smash attack and is usually your best kill option. The right analog in smash basically gives you easier access to moves that would knock your opponent off-stage. In this game the same option just seems unnecesary because no matter how you move the analog stick down and press attack you will get the same attack each time.So far it seems in versus mode there is no option to not choose a support character (which is mostly made up of regular enemies you fight) so after you lose with your main characters you are forced to play your support character. An option to cut that out and play only as the main characters or even the option to play of of the support characters (since some seem pretty fleshed out) alone would have been nice. Instead either suicide your main character to play one of the side characters or declare the match over once your main character dies.Yes, you can actually play as the bull in the screenshots and he really sucks. This game has a good number of support characters that make you wonder why the studio wasted their time making them playable.			"

												This game man... This game.Abyss Odyssey is a 2-Dimensional dungeon crawler/rougelike. It looks good(Both in trailer and graphics) but is horrible to play. Just as a note i played with a keyboard not a controller.First lets talk about the UI. It is the thing that killed this game the most for me. It SUCKS. To figure out most buttons I had to go to the controls menu. The UI its just looks... bad. Its mostly just brown-ish yellow-ish paper. Which I get it is in the 1890's but.. still. It looks bad.Gameplay its self is not only annoying but un-intuitive. You have (in the beggining) a grand total of 4 moves. 2 of which are DEFENSIVE. I get you 'build it up as you go along' but seriously? 2 fighting moves? SERIOUSLY? Another thing is you start of as a character that can only use one-handed weapons, and I personally came across 4 really cool looking weapons that I COULDN'T PICK UP.Graphics and sound is good. Not the best, but it doesn't put your eyes and ears in agony. Its actually quite nice.Now time to grade!UI: 3/10Gameplay: 4.25/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7.4/10OVERALL: 4.3/10 and therefor a Thumbs DOWN.			"

												Haven't been able to tolerate more than 5 minutes of that game, might go back later...Superb example of what not to do in the first instant of a video game. Beautiful characters looking totally  lame and impotent!  Let's start with basic combat ommisions, can't turn around in combat, attack are planted stiff on spot, can't interrupt attack, even with blocking. Can't interrupt hits received.Then I activate good old couch coop! Be advised : FRIENDLY FIRE IS FULL ON! So your only coop strategy is to take enemies in a sandwich. Both character are also visually identical so it's part of the puzzle. And the enemies fight beautifully, to our demise. In five minutes I've beend introduced to at least 5 - 6 different enemy types that I couldn't humanely decode. You'll face butt kicking traps with infinite health for tutorials, they even have to play a silhouette of the character mimicking the solution and even then I'll tell you, you have to dodge in the air. And watch out for the swinging axe's return XD hilarious!Was just the first minutes, I'll go back into it because I think it's a great learning experience. But after those first few fighting humiliations and confusing level design, we put down the controller just disgusted and wanting to do something better with our time. It might as well be an awesome game like I've been taught by Dark souls or Divinity, tho I doubt it, we'll see...			"

												I thought at first that i was bad at the game and needed to get used to the controls. Problem is, its not just the controls. This game is very porrly made, it has a horrible AI which will outnumber and♥♥♥♥♥♥your bumhole, and very sloppy controls even for controller. On top of that not only when you die the first time you get a character with a completely different moveset and you lose everything if that character dies, exept for money. Every item you bought (which have insanely high prices for this kind of game) is lost if your second character dies. Its like this game WANTS a bad review. So, lets post the - and + of this game.+ .) 1.) Multi-player (which is very much needed for casual players)      2.) Interesting Lore.      3.) PvP.      4.) NPC allies (sometimes)- .)   1.) bad voice acting for most NPC's.        2.) Lose every iten you bought after 2 deaths.         3.) Terrible AI.        4.) enemies usually out number you.       5.) bad community (people that dont know the game's controls and people that attack you when you want to co-op)So, all in all, i didn't get very far through the game so i can't tell you all the Negatives and Plus'sBut, in my time playing these types of games, i've never seen such a poorly made game in my life.If this game compelles you, go ahead buy it or try it out in the next three days as it is F2P till then But, do not be dissapointed when you see sloppy controls, terrible AI etc.			"

Posted: July 16, 2014
												This game is unfinished. It's from indie dev ACE but publisher ATLUS who brings Persona, Fire Emblem, and Shin Megami, so is it really indie? Indie seems tacked on meant to excuse the shoddy game. DESIGN:The nobody policeman pop in if your main character dies and they're the most memorable imagery in the game. They don't even get names but their art is all that stands out. The character art is alright but it's filler image that goes in and out just as quick. It might be more interesting if the level design were better but everything is drab and blends in except the policemen. I feel like I was half asleep while playing the game because it was so hard to pick out any details. The treasure boxes, the platforms, even the characters meld together so it's difficult to know what's background and what's interactable. The jumps are (intentionally?) leaden so while you have a double jump, it rarely does much good. Trying to platform onto some of the moving ledges makes me more frustrated than Guacamelee's time warp/wall jump BS, and yet the punishment is 200 off your health. Three or four misses take half your health while enemies drop little orbs that replenish only 50. The actual fighting is boring and basically button-mashing, except you have to use the sticks so it's just stick wobbling. If there's a strategy, it's not apparent. There's something to be said for a game that doesn't hold your hand in today's world of hour long tutorials and mobile games, but Abyss Odyssey teaches you--slowly--how to attack, jump, run, and dodge. Each of these are simple button presses that have to be figured out prior to the game prompt. However, nothing else is explained. Are there elemental weaknesses? There are apparently counters. The nuances are left mysteries. I wouldn't be surprised if major mechanics went unnoticed for a month in this game.  Sometimes health bars pop up above the enemies, but only as flashes that show you enemies still have health. How much? It goes by too quickly to tell. If you poison an enemy, a green number appears and counts down. What's this for? Possibly a timer till the enemy is hurt again or until the poison is gone. It doesn't count down in a timely manner though. Each numeric drop takes anywhere from 0.2 seconds to 5.0 seconds. It touts procedurally generated terrain as a plus, but it becomes forgettable because there's no human touch to it. It's a winding path of dead-ends and sudden fights where you're fenced in until....something happens. It's a mystery as to what. Sometimes one of the three enemies will die and the fences will drop and sometimes you have to kill all of them. Sometimes after a bit of fighting, the walls fall prematurely. It makes sure that none of the playthroughs are the same, and each delve into the depths takes only an hour if you don't die, but they're all such a blur of boring that it doesn't matter that they're different. There are three characters, but the two I have play identically. They have different weapons and as Katrien, I often find Ghost Monk's weapons or Pincoya's, which can't be picked up even for gold. If I find Katrien's weapon, then it's worse generally. Same goes for while playing as Ghost Monk. CONTROLS:I tried my Xbox One controller to start as it's run every other game I've played. The controllers were sluggish and sometimes Katrien wouldn't attack or dodge or whatever. After 20 minutes of that torture, I tried my 360 controller and it worked better but still the X button wouldn't attack reliably. I had to go to the Right Stick to attack anything, which seems to be the intended button, but all the special attacks and jump buttons are mapped to the A, B, and Y so why would I need to switch from stick to button for combos? The Y specials aren't reliable either. To attack, you press up or forward or down and Y, but trying to get the correct one to trigger is about 33% reliable.  There are all these attacks mapped to too few keys and other buttons left unused. It's bearable, but not at all intuitive. Maybe the keyboard is easier to use. STORY:I don't know. You're a dream of the warlock fighting the warlock and if you die, you're reborn with your money and level but not your weapon or items. Maybe it's a Chilean legend as most characters have hispanic names and some have hispanic accents. It often feels like a Japanese name where everyone is named Suzuka or Takashi and the story is just going by without significance or weight for Westerners. There's not much there anyway. Little bits of dialogue. The Warlock and Katrien apparently used to do it in their marital bed, but now she's trying to stop him. After beating it once with Katrien, you unlock a Ghost Monk who uses a different weapon. He's death or something. It doesn't make sense.			"

												This game has some serious, SERIOUS flaws.Ok, lets start with movement and combat. the levels were designed with the highest movement characters in mind, not the lowest. So trying to catch jumps and move with a lesser charcter is infuriating with this game. Some characters just outright don't grab ledges and i find that mechanic frustrating EVERYONE OR NO ONE! The combat goes from too easy to way too difficult and swings wildy back and forth in each zone. Doesn't really have a good flow and feel to it.Item balance is also a serious issue with the camp tokens costing way too much for what they are.I love the artwork and the story but this is going to be a challenge and a half to get anywhere close to beating.With some tweaks this could have been an amazing title, but they didn't so it's not.

												I saw the E3 bit for this game and had high hopes.  However, I'd advise against buying it.  It's completely broken.  The movement, combat, most everything is broken.  I'd like to post something along the lines of ""in spite of these difficuties"" but the gameplay is terrible.  They force you along you a main storyline to begin which is fine to learn your basics, but after floor 1 the kid gloves come off and you realize that they weren't making this for the players.  It changes quickly from an experience that you think might be reminicent of a castlevania to wondering why there are no hit boxes for your enemies or yourself.  My genuine complaint is about the mechanics.  It seems like the designers wanted a beautiful game that could do a lot, but got kind of bored half way through the process.  If they patch the hell out of it I'll be stoked, but as it stands it's not worth a couple bucks much less the $14.99 they're asking.  If you're looking for something to dissapoint you go hit up walmart and get some Nancy Drew game compilation for two thirds of the price instead.			"

Half the time, the hit detection is off and you just swing wildly without hitting the enemies. Pretty bland -  a better alternative is Fairy Bloom Freesia or Dust: An Elysian Tail.			"

												no no no. just no. its nice to look at the soundtrack is amazing the story is decent at best and its co op, BUT the controls all of em  its so bad jumping has a long delay in a platformer, my characters hair keeps glitching thru her body, and there are only 3 character in general (at least there is multiple characters for the co op ) no if you start the game you : cannot play a match just whith friends, cannot turn off the voice chat, and worst of all you cant change your character my friend and  i were the same character, the only thing telling us apart was our weapon i had a flaming sword and he didnt, now is a good time to talk about the combat. its boring, and its dumb, i got promised a action adventure fast-paced rouge like game and i got slow game play. (atleast theres diffrent weapons) all of them are swords, fire sword water sword dark sword you name it and its there. i got a really awesome fire sword only to see a water sword and got happy only to relize that i couldint pick it up. the controls suck bad lets talk about them again, f speaks to people instead of e, why? because e rolls (do a barrel roll) NOT NOW JOEL that comes at the end, why not r, r isnt used for anything, and i have to mention in this sidescroller, w doesnt jump space does, yeah thats fine if it were a shooter but this is not.  3/10 dont buy this game if your life depends on it                                                                                                                                                                             barrel roll barrel roll do a barrel barrel roll

Posted: July 16, 2014
												tl;dr: The combat is laudable but still unsatisfying. The feel is off and there's little room to demonstrate superior skill against the enemies because they are all playable characters and thus can do anything you can. The dungeon and story are charmless. Interesting game, worth a taste, not a classic.I dream of battling huge steroided up jerks. The huge guy lets out a roar before his swing, I dodge, counter attack, he flashes before I finish my combo, I dodge out of it just in time to avoid a fearsome counter-attack. Really, give me an attack button and a satisfying dodge roll and I am a happy camper in most games.Actually, scratch that, turns out I need a bit more than just Attack and Dodge. Odyssey has both in spades and it is not quite enough for me.Odyssey is a side-scrolling brawler roguelike-ish game with a random dungeon and permadeath and all the usual fixin's as well as persistent XP growth and move collection and what-not, the usual sort of thing you expect of the recent indie action roguelike trend. The combat is somewhere south of Smash Bros and east of Bloodrayne Betrayal (Only not nearly as awful.) Your moveset is limited, attack+direction, special+direction, but there is some combo potential here, though a lot of the fighting feels a little stiff and wooden. Watching enemies get up is a Chilean passtime, it seems; you'll do a lot of that. You have a limited number of dodge cancels before they have to recharge (See Valdis Story only less cool.) and can become pretty much any enemy in the game.Yep, every single enemy is a playable character, and that actually feeds into a problem I have with the game.Back to my example at the start, I am reading the boss's attack patterns and reacting. I'm rewarded for learning the system and striking at the right time. The enemies in Odyssey, however, are really all just variations of your character with generally less openly useful moves. They block, dodge (Especially your projectiles), and can attack without warm-up most of the time. This means that you just have to take a lot of unavoidable damage each encounter just because there is no safe way through. Fighting your equals creates a cute dance, but it feels a lot more like battling Street Fighter AI rather than facing down Vergil.But then there's a reason you're taking all that damage. Between your main character, his/her backup soldier, and the enemy you can morph into, you have three whole life bars. Match this up with persistent leveling and you can more or less kiss balancing goodbye. This will sound like heresy but I cleared the dungeon on my second try. For my reward, I unlocked the second town to start from, though I still have two characters to unlock as well as a third town. I only ever faced one midboss (Though he was absolutely no deviation from the standard enemies in combat style. Even the warlock himself felt like I was back to jump-kicking Akuma over and over.)I'll definitely go back to the game, but in the end I will likely forget it sooner rather than later.This Warlock has some really boring dreams, to boot. Everything is muted, murky colors and all the enemies are just kinda ugly dull pitiable mutants.Also, I have paid minimal attention to the story, and in return it has demanded precious little of my attention. I applaud the minimalist approach, though the huge dreary ugly world down here and all the story hints suggests we're going to be asked to pity that so tragic warlock because it's so dramatic to not have a villain (Really, having a proper villain seems like it would be the most shocking thing some games can do these days, but I digress. That's not Odyssey's problem...). Which actually brings me to a point I don't like about the story: You play as one of the few figments of the warlock's dreams that is not a slavering demon trying to kill everyone. You are not shocked by anything you see because you're a part of it. You can't die either, so you just keep coming back and trying again.But the soldiers in the game are human beings just trying to fight the monsters of the abyss, protect their families, and when you fall, despite your immortality, they still will swoop in to do their damndest to save you. Hell, in my last clear, the soldier was the one who defeated the warlock (Only to poof out and be replaced by my character for the ending cutscene. What a snub!).So you are playing an blob of memories with neither a personality nor a stake in this conflict and the people relegated to the sidelines are genuine heroes with personalities and fears who are to the last man engaging in wholly noble and heroic acts of holding the line against hordes of ugly monsters, all afraid, but all driven by duty. Someone at some point thought that it was better to tell the story of the Warlock's childhood trauma or whatever instead of the story of these gents. Good job on that.If the story is somehow more interesting than NOW ON A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF ALL MY WARLOCKS, I welcome hints or even, properly marked, spoilers in the comments if you feel the need to convince me reading rather than playing the game is worthwhile.

												I will continue to add and change this review as I play the game more. 5/10Abyss Odyssey promises to be so much, and yet delivers so little... I wondered at first why this game was offering a pre-purchase discount, for over 2 weeks before it's launch, well now I know why... The game promised to have an in depth, well thought combat system, but immediately, it is very stale, boring, and simple. I bought the lie that this was a side-scroller ""castlevania-eqsue"" game with a unique ""fighting style"" combat system, and I was very disappointed. The worst is how an enemy who falls down is immune to all damage... You spend more time waiting for enemies to get their $%@ off the ground than you do actually fighting.This game is fun to look at, decently entertaining to run around in and meet the characters, but it is just simply not what the devs promised it to be. Now that the truth is out, I will say that this game IS very pretty. The artwork is awesome whenever you speak with a character. The art style is unique and obviously latin-inspired (of course). If for no other reason, buying this game simply to meet the characters and look at the artwork would make it feel semi-worth. Pros:Beautiful artworkDecent Vocal ActingFun to get a new weaponVarious and diverse enemiesFun to look atCons:TERRIBLE combat systemUnintuitive abilitiesNo inventory system (cannot keep/sell old weapons/items)Forced to watch enemies flail on the ground My Inital reactions:*Have to pay in game gold to save the game and set checkpoints... *Enviroments are a bit stale, but still pretty detailed*Artwork is gorgeous in the chat scenes*Character feels a bit wonky when moving/jumping, but especially when landing, it's very odd...*Initial combat system is pretty to look at, but feels completely unintutitive, I sincerely hope this changes as the game goes on, because right now, the combat system feels terrible*It's not a big deal, however, I feel people should know you have to unlock the other characters to play as them. I wanted to jump right into the shadow monk (or whomever) however I cannot until I play more. Just a heads up.*Game just came out, so it's not 100% surprising, however, I've only played for 30 minutes so far, and have ran into 2 glitches already. 1 made the prologue impassible, had to restart, 2 game froze on screen switch*If an enemy falls on the ground, you cannot hurt them, or do anything to them... You have to wait for them to get back up... This feels odd and makes every single fight boring... You can't do much but hit twice, watch them fall, and just wait.... You may jugle enemies in the air, but the system isn't constructed well enough for that to work out in a dependable way...			"

												I got this game free, and yet I still feel ripped off. The gameplay is slow, awkward, and clunky. The character controls don’t feel precise, and the UI is lacking any kind of useful information. The story is very boring each level is just your progression to the bottom of the abyss, and it provided little motivation to continue through as I didn’t feel connected to any of the characters. The levels are procedurally generated, but this didn’t help the repetitiveness at all, because every time you die the game resets you back to the beginning. The clunky combat, forgettable story, and grindy levels make this feel more like a chore than a game.			"

												Levels are boring. They are all square block mazes. And they're not even hard mazes (logically). Sometimes the game screws you over and you cannot reach a certain point because it's too high (even with crouch-jump when possible).Often the sluggish controls prevent you from moving in the direction you want to go or from grabbing onto a ledge or from landing on a platform.Combat is sluggish and cancel points don't renew over time. There is no telegraphing of enemy moves either.You best option is to discover bad patterns in the enemy's AI such as dodging right into a low sword attack after you fire a projectile into them. Often you can face away and just do a crouching attack which just kinda rolls back and hits them.Basically the combat is not fun. It's too sluggish to control, and you resort to exploits which is not fun either.To sum up, control is not fun (moving and attacking), exploration is not fun, there is no action, it's just not a deep or fun game.Also, when you defeat a shopkeeper he does not drop the loot he was carrying.Why is there an option to attack him when it's a waste of time?

In terms of gameplay, you'll spam 2 moves over and over because the rest of them are pathetically weak, leave you vulnerable for entirely too many frames, or just simply aren't viable. Save your money and buy a pizza. You'll be happier.			"

												So what happens when you take Castlevania Symphony of the Night... or more accurately Castlevania Aria / Dawn of Sorrow and combine it with Dark Souls clunk? Well let me answer that for you... You get a game about travelling in to a procedurally generated abyss delving deeper and deeper to kill some demon warlock Freddy Kruger guy, who's nightmares are your reality. In fact, you're not even real because he dreamt you up... except you want to kill him... that's what kind of game you get... yeah.So this game tries way too hard to be epic and it just fails on just about every front. The art style is the only thing this game has going for it and it's just a shame it was wasted on such a giant turd like Abyss Odyssey. It's as if all the production value went in to the art style and none of it in to the game development, plot or music because it was all forgettable.It's nothing new you haven't already seen, the point being is a lot of the game play mechanics are drab, boring and redundant... let me explain:It's a rouge like game, where no dungeon you enter is ever the same twice... except that's kind of a lie because every area is almost exactly identical to the last, aside from some buzz saws and flowers trying to kill you.You basically travel down a linear path and encounter a branching point here and there. These branching paths quickly lead to a dead end with a treasure chest or check point of some kind. Usually when there's nothing there I do what any veteran Casltevania player would do and smack the wall. 20% of the time there's a hidden area with a shop keeper or paltry weapon hiding behind it... No meat though, I probably would of enjoyed a nice Castlevania roast beef here and there but no... it's usually just some crap.Another thing about this game is how lazy the direction is... I mean, procedurally generated dungeons for a game with this kind of art style? With all the effort put in to the art direction you figured they would of came up with some cool level designs and boss design concepts and made an actual game... you know, one where the developers have to always be one step ahead of themselves so players can't sequence break the game... either way it's wasted potential.The game itself gets dull and tired way too quickly. It has unlockable characters and starting points but you need to rely heavily on luck... Okay basically everything resides on your luck, as well as time put in to the game.I beat the game once, unlocked some floaty chick with a spear who has a jelly fish for a companion (Yeah is this making you cringe yet? I was rolling my eyes the entire time... what pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is this any way?) There's also a heavy weapon user who looks a lot like Tyrael from the Diablo franchise (because THAT was purely a coincidence) and he's randomly unlocked by beating random bosses you encounter... random, random, random ....so have fun with randomly doing that.Another thing that bothered me was the limited inventory space ... of 4 whole spaces. Enjoy managing poison antidotes, mana potions, health potions and check point tokens when you can basically only carry 1 of each item. The number one biggest waste of resources though that made up most of the game's mechanics, or should I say gimmick, was the ENTIRE enemy capture system... I mean WTF is the point of all this? All the enemies I caught were even clunkier and weaker than my main character.... none of them had any really cool abilites and were all difficult to control... It's as if the developers were saying: ""Hey switch to this centaur thing if you want to die... like right now... yeah there ya go, you're dead now, hope that helped.""I never understood why the game forced you in to sequences where you had to play as random enemies either, other than to basically get their spirit afterwards... as some kind of reward? Great, thanks for THAT. Most of the time I had something better to do, like NOT playing as a worthless enemy character.Either way the game's plot and premise is a cryptic mess, just like Dark Souls, so I guess they got the worst possible aspects of that series right... Clunky gameplay, in order to artificially increase the difficulty of the game; and a cryptic plot so it confuses the player in to thinking their mind has been ""blown'.... except... no it hasn't, this game is just stupid and you're trying too hard to make sense of all of it...It's a 5 out of 10 at best... it tries, it fails... go play Castlevania SotN... It's just a better game as well as the godfather of the genre... When are developers going to learn you can't reinvent perfection?			"

												The only way I can describe this game is abysmal.You don't get anything for playing: the progression system is shallow to the point that you wouldn't notice it if it weren't there.Which wouldn't be so bad, but the game itself doesn't offer any real depth.  Sure, it offers that you can play as the enemies, but you only ever get a short series of attacks that are easily interrupted, as all enemies operate on the same mechanics as the player, which leads to many dodges and lots of blocking, resulting in combat ultimately just slowing down gameplay, as you have to get past combat instead of participate in it.Everything only made worse by mediocre controls.I'm at a loss to how a publisher backed this title.

												Abyss Odyssey, a beat 'em up with randomly generated levels in the style of Metroidvanias, is not perfect in its current state, but provides a very good fighting engine, variety of enemies, wonderfully realized presentation, and straight up addicting gameplay. In addition, the game is still under active development, and is seeing improvements to the fighting and movement engine as we speak.My biggest problem as of right now is how easy the game can be. If you're a fan of fighting games, I'll tell you right now, go straight to Nightmare difficutly.			"

												Smash Bros. Melee had a baby. A weird tentacle baby who plays with monsters from Chiloé mythology. She's a descending roguelike who falls into an ever-changing abyss. More importantly, this is definitely Smash Bros. Melee's kid. She plays just like her daddy.Fighting game aficionados might complain that Abyss Odyssey doesn't go a ton deeper beyond combos and cancels. Roguelike fanatics may lament that Abyss Odyssey is too forgiving with runs average over half an hour (and lack any mid-progress save). But Abyss Odyssey isn't a Smash-like and it isn't a roguelike. It's something else: a tentacle baby.If you had a baby born with tentacles — and you were a good parent — you'd love her and make her feel at home. You would learn the best practices in tentacle care, and taunt gaping onlookers when they stare. Abyss Odyssey is that tentacle baby, and I hope you love her at least half as much as I do.8.5/10For more: http://plus10damage.com/blog/2014/8/13/smash-bros-tentacle-baby-abyss-odyssey-review "

												A strong recommendation.It's a game with platforming and rouge-like elements, but it is a 2d brawler at the core:Every combat is engaging and even regular monsters can cause a lot of pain if you're not paying attention.The AI is also surprisingly good - enemies will jump over your fireballs, block your attack, dodge-roll through them and throw you from time to time if you are blocking too long.If you have interest in beat em ups - get this one, it's different and fun.

												I've seen a lot of negative feedback about the controls in this game.  True, there was a moment or two in the beginning where I almost swung my controller at my monitor like a chromed up War Boy with a mace.  But a few things happened that allowed me to beat the game after a few hours of play.  1) I somehow stumbled upon the monk character.  Everything is better once you get that cloaked, knee-padded savior.  I also liked Pincoya (the other unlockable character) and her spear.  2) I read up a bit about the game and learned about Cancel points.  Invest your level up points in those before anything else. 3) It turns out that button mashing is still relevant in fighting (style) games.  But to be fair, it's mostly parry mashing in this game.  You still need to learn the controls.10/10 would roll the controller against their forehead if it meant beating a horde of enemies.			"

												Argghhh.... That game... it's great and annoying at the same time. The thing about ACE team (the creators of the game), is that they make games with HUGEEEEE potential, yet they fall when it comes to gameplay and basic things. theoretically, their are games are AMAZING, but when it comes to the actual gameplay, you realize that they had a great plan that has gone to waste (same with Zeno Clash sadly).Abyss Odyssey is an awesome challenging game, that falls down when it comes to the combat and momvment. the combat is really repetive and boring, as you spam pretty much everything, while trying to doge and avoid pretty much everything.On the other hand, the art style, the music and the voice acting (yeah, thats right, unlike the voice acting in Zeno Clash - the voice acting in Abyss Odyssey is actually pretty good!) are all awesome, it's just that the combat is really frustrating.Well, the bottom line is - a great game, with huge potential (just as Zeno Clash has huge potential), but somthing went horribly worng along the way. meh, such a shame.

												Im 42 years old. This game is the first platform game I have had fun with since Metroid.The fighting is the same as the old karate Champ on the Commodore 64. Button plus a direction is a fight move. No stupid buton combos, just plain and simple fighting. Push a direstion and hit the attack button to preform the various moces.Trine comes to mind as far as the artwork.... Not as nice as Trine's artwork, but it makes up for it, with its own style and character.  It is sort of Drab, dark, and grey... They really should have boosted the saturation a little bit i a few key areas.Anyway, this is a 10/10 from me.			"

It lacks a bit of variety and the pacing throws you off the deep end and expects you to get good.The game very much expects you to master cancels and doesn't really teach you how.Having said that, the controls are very responsive and appropriately punishing. The combat has weight to it, and that crazy lunge will either be the coup de grace or your ultimate undoing.I'd love to see these devs come back and ditch the rogue-like for a fleshed out game with pacing.

												A clunky fighter rogue-lite hybrid that, while decently fun despite he game handling like all your controller inputs were first translated by a monkey and then handed off the game developers who then decide whether or not your button press occurred or not, pretends to have much more depth on offer than it actually possesses. Collecting enemy souls isn't really that big of an appeal, they handle differently but each enemy type has one or two combos or moves that are just much better than the others and I find it difficult to want to invest time into learning how to handle this game knowing that my reward for high skill play is more monsters to learn. Since the only thing you keep are levels and levels don't offer a significant enough increase from level to level the game feels the same the first time you beat and every time after that. You'll be strategically choosing monster souls based on what is and isn't good or what you do and don't know how to play which doesn't really encourage learning new ones even if the game throws a bonus stage with a random monster at you after every boss (actually this can be more annoying than exciting, having to learn a whole new moveset to fight a mob or two is actually pretty frustrating even if there isn't an actual penalty for losing.)I want to like this game but the RPG and rogue-lite elements are limited, monster collecting doesn't appeal to me as it only serves to add a flimsy excuse to learn more about a game whose versus lobbies are deader than the extinct species list, and the storyline is only a bit interesting (less so when you realize you don't have any actual influence on it and reading about it doesn't actually give you any real benefit beyond a decently arranged story.) It's a decent game but it can only ever be decent when it is so riddled with flaws and the fact that the main menu contains an advertisement is just icing on the cake.I can't recommend this purchase, I like it but it isn't where it would have to be for me to say you should pick this one up. If you really want to learn a clunky fighting game system so you can fight the same 12-15 enemies over and over then go right ahead but I'm not going to be the guy encouraging you to do it.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is a platform based fighting game with a bit of story, a randomized map, and a whole lot of crazy. A major facet of the game is that death is not the end; not necessarily even in each playthough. When the main character, one of either Katrien, a dead dude with hands but no body, or a sea goddess, dies, they are simply replaced by a soldier (still playable, of course) who can revive the main at certain alters. Only when the soldier dies must you restart. However, death only costs you your progress down and your current one items. Level, exp, and gold are kept.    This game has a special mechanic that adds one more layer in. The main can use a special skill and rip the soul from an enemy, gaining the ability to transform into any enemy, including all bosses. Dying as a monster turns you back to the main, adding another layer of life. Which you will need because the monsters are brutally unmercifully good at beating you to a pulp. The AI is intelligent and each monster knows its strengths. If a monster is fast but weak and you shield, it'll wait for a hard hitter to show up and they will tag-team you to death.    The story (for characters, primarily. There isnt much of a plot.) and art of the game are amazing. The story is that a powerful warlock is in a asleep in a coma or something, and his nightmares are materializing in the real world. As one of his dreams, you are trying to stop him. Characters and monster are primarily from old Chilean myth and folklore and also a considerable amount from the Christian bible, plus many from various other worldwide myths, all with the wonderful wackiness of ACE. Plus there is also a crossover character from Zeno Clash now.Pros:Great visuals, music and designs.Every character/enemy is playable.Either way:Difficulty. The game is brutal. There is no easy mode or tutorial. Only hard or harder. I like that, but not everyone does.Enemies are really smart and know you, so you have to know and exploit them. Finding ways to successfully spam attacks is generally rewarded with not dying. You can do it, but so can the enemies, so it could go either way.Animation cancelling is a major mechanic. This means that learning combos through hard trial and error is the best way and messing one up can mean a lost battle due to long animations. The mechanic is really cool though, so again, either way.Cons:Controls can be a tad floaty, but its not that bad.Soldiers cannot jump as high as other characters, and I am bad at getting places with them. This is far more fruatrating than it sounds.Verdict:Excellent game. I really enjoy(ed) it. If you've never played a fighting game, or don't like them, or you're really bad, then this isn't the game for you. However, it is excellent for those who are willing to climb its learning curve.Notes: This is my first review. My apologies if I've messed absolutely everything up and offended everyone in the general vicinity. Also, my playtime is very inaccurate. I've played it offline most of the time. Supposedly the multiplayer is good, but I haven't bothered with it yet.			"

												Short version:Pros:+satisfying combat+beautiful visuals+rogue-lite gameplay with some persistent progression+procedurally generated levels+unique fighting style for each playable unit+worthy of multiple playthroughs +coopCons:-simple goal with little story-fairly easy if you're good at this kind of side scrolling action-controls are somewhat clunky at times-a single play through is relatively short. game designed to be replayed (this can be a pro for some people i guess, since each play through does feel quite unique due to the randomly generated levels)-no online versus modeThis game's controls feel a little bit clunky, but I don't think that takes away from the gaming experience too much. Once you get used to the controls, the combat system feels quite satisfying. It has enough depth and encourages varying moves. You can perform special cancel to chain up combo, throw enemies who keep on guarding, do a 360 degree attack against those who get behind you etc. Overall, the fighting mechanism actually feels quite like something you'd expect in a fighting game.Each hero and other unit that you get to control has a unique move set. While some are arguably better than others (when playing as enemy units), They're still all interesting and fun to play as.Coop is also fun. I always embrace games that include the coop feature. If you have a friend who to play with you, definitely check this out.Gameplay wise, this game has a lot of rogue-lite elements. Levels are procedurally generated, and they offer a unique experience for every playthrough. Everytime you die, you'd have to restart from the beginning. The entire dungeon has to be cleared in one go and there is no in-dungeon saving. Also, if you die, all the items you're carrying are also gone. However, you do get to keep your levels, gold, and unlocked abilities, so there is a persistent progression. Because of the randomly generated levels and the uniqueness of each character, this game is certainly worthy of multiple playthroughs.The visuals are beautiful. Backgrounds have an unusal amount of details for any randomly generated level.However, there isn't a lot of story. the majority of the gameplay centers on combat and platforming with some exploration for hidden rooms and loot. A single playthrough is also relatively short, which is something i don't mind since i can replay it multiple times and still get a different experience in each playthrough. However, if you don't like replaying, then this might something you'd have to think about.The game has a local versus mode, but puzzlingly it doesn't have online versus (but it does have online coop).Overall, the game is fun, especially if you have a friend to play it with. Even if not, it is still worth getting for the single player expereince because of the randomly generated levels, which add a lot of replay value. "

												+ visually striking, beutiful art style, and great animations.+ soundtrack, fits the feeling of the game well.+ combat, its deep for a 2D platformer.+ rouge-like elements, when u die it is not a game over, u respawn back at the begining with starter items and all the gold u had at the time of death, and the other charecters react to that as it fits the story.  use the gold u collected before dying to get better gear to help u progress, buy tokens to set respawn points deeper in the dungeon, or save up to get better gear the next time u die.+ interesting setting (I have not completed the story due to the game being hard as nails for me, but i did get to the lowest part of the dungeon and have played enough to comperhend most elements of the game)~ the dungeon areas r randomized every time u die and respawn at the begining, i find that fun as it adds variety to the game, but some may find it annoying as the area diffeculties r also randomized.~ diffeculty, u cant control it, each area in the dungeon has a diffeculty setting that is randomized unpon death regardless of how deep is that area.- skills and leveling up, adding points to a certain skill doesn't seem to have much of an effect on the skill, and leveling up doesn't feel like it affects u that much.  and the fact that u can only have 3 skills upgraded and leaveing the other 2 without the effect of the upgrads can be annoying to some.- learning curve, the game poorly explains all its mechanics early on, especially the combat combos and leveling up.- length, the dungeon can be done in a very short amount of time if u have the personal skills and/or powerfull enough equipment, its the rouge-like nature of the game that add gameplay length.

												I'd only be able to recommend this game if you got it on sale, or via humble bundle like i did.Controls for the KB/Mouse SUCK. I had no choice but to use a controller.

But the controls will kill it for you, I almost guarantee it. I also guess this is one of those games that constantly makes you start over since I have yet to be able to save and each time I've started a game, played some, i've had to quit bc of RL issues but no save, even when I find a ""token"".3/10			"

												This game is great. At first it can seem pretty difficult, but it's a game that requires some level of mastery. The way the combat system works is very similar to Super Smash Bros. There are shields, rolls, grabs, air dodges, directional attacks and aerial directional attacks. It handles differently though. It might take some time to get used to it even if you are familiar with Smash Bros. The campaign mode is like a randomly generated metroidvania with varying paths, monsters and bosses. There are multiple playable characters with all different skills, weapons, and movesets. You can even capture and switch between playing as your current character and a monster. The only negative things I can say about this game is 1) grabbing ledges is awful. You have to be really specific about how you approach the ledge. In some situations this can cost you a lot of health. 2) Sometimes you can get overwhelmed and wrecked by a group of enemies and/or stage hazards. They'll combo you to death if they attack you at the same time and get the first hit off. 3) Unavoidable hazards. There are some hazards that seemed too long to jump over. At least I couldn't make it with a double jump and dash/airdodge. I had to jump in and get poisoned. That's all the issues worth mentioning though. It's really good overall.			"

												I love this game. I got it this weekend and already put in 11 hours. The combat is fairly important to master as you can die from a wrong move. I beat the main boss the first time by comboing them to death. I had tried a few other times but we kept getting destoyed. The online play is still glitchy and needs work. If I DC'ed from a game and came back, sometimes I would lag through the platform and wouldn't be able to jump on the moving platforms. I loved the hidden shops and finding awesome stuff. You can even kill the shop keepers for extra xp but be prepaired for them to fight back. The third character you play is a nude spirit. I personally don't think she is that revealing but that is why the ""partially nude"" rating.			"

												Short version:Pros:+satisfying combat+beautiful visuals+rogue-lite gameplay with some persistent progression+procedurally generated levels+unique fighting style for each playable unit+worthy of multiple playthroughs +coopCons:-simple goal with little story-fairly easy if you're good at this kind of side scrolling action-controls are somewhat clunky at times-a single play through is relatively short. game designed to be replayed (this can be a pro for some people i guess, since each play through does feel quite unique due to the randomly generated levels)-no online versus modeThis game's controls feel a little bit clunky, but I don't think that takes away from the gaming experience too much. Once you get used to the controls, the combat system feels quite satisfying. It has enough depth and encourages varying moves. You can perform special cancel to chain up combo, throw enemies who keep on guarding, do a 360 degree attack against those who get behind you etc. Overall, the fighting mechanism actually feels quite like something you'd expect in a fighting game.Each hero and other unit that you get to control has a unique move set. While some are arguably better than others (when playing as enemy units), They're still all interesting and fun to play as.Coop is also fun. I always embrace games that include the coop feature. If you have a friend who to play with you, definitely check this out.Gameplay wise, this game has a lot of rogue-lite elements. Levels are procedurally generated, and they offer a unique experience for every playthrough. Everytime you die, you'd have to restart from the beginning. The entire dungeon has to be cleared in one go and there is no in-dungeon saving. Also, if you die, all the items you're carrying are also gone. However, you do get to keep your levels, gold, and unlocked abilities, so there is a persistent progression. Because of the randomly generated levels and the uniqueness of each character, this game is certainly worthy of multiple playthroughs.The visuals are beautiful. Backgrounds have an unusal amount of details for any randomly generated level.However, there isn't a lot of story. the majority of the gameplay centers on combat and platforming with some exploration for hidden rooms and loot. A single playthrough is also relatively short, which is something i don't mind since i can replay it multiple times and still get a different experience in each playthrough. However, if you don't like replaying, then this might something you'd have to think about.The game has a local versus mode, but puzzlingly it doesn't have online versus (but it does have online coop).Overall, the game is fun, especially if you have a friend to play it with. Even if not, it is still worth getting for the single player expereince because of the randomly generated levels, which add a lot of replay value. "

												I got Abyss as part of a humble bundle, but I got the bundle, in part, because I wanted a good game to play with my steam controller.  I am not very familiar with dungeon, rogue-like or brawler type games.  But I really like this game.  I haven’t quite beaten it but i’ve faced off with the final boss 3 times now.  ProsGood visual style, excellent art.  Another game proving that video games are a legitimate media-art form.  Controls seem fluid, easy to use.Interesting setting and story.The game is really unique and interestingThe three paths system of difficulty seems like a great system.ConsI don’t like that I lose my items when I die.  I know this is “rogue-like” but I wish there was a little more character progression.I wish the texture res was higher, OR that there was better texture filtering.  My characters have jaggies around them.Your incentivised to play as your backup garud character when you enter the final chamber as your main character will then be resurrected with full health.  There seem to be 3 different weapon classes and as such I cannot pick up weapons that are hard-won 2/3rds of the time. "

												Yeah, this hit all the right buttons for me.Abyss Odyssey is a beat 'em up game with fighting game mechanics and loot grabbing - it has platform levels that change every playthrough, loaded with traps and secret rooms.Bad- controls are wonky. it's set up to attack left and you have to face right again and then press right to go in that direction. Some of the characters are limited because they are too big for an area or, in the case of the first soldier, cannot climb walls at certain heights. It's pretty flawed in these specific control problems. Most people cannot overlook this (thus the mixed Steam reviews) and I don't blame them.Good - but what shines in this game is the art, animation and design. The whole drips with polish and satisfying visuals in the art style of Art Nouveau masters like Mucha. The characters are strange and interesting with amazing movesets and fantastic animations - some of the pick-up enemies are more fun to play than the three main characters!

												Nice blend of roguelike, platformer and beatemup genres. You are able to capture defeated enemies' souls and play as those creatures yourself switching between them and your main char on the go giving you immense tactical possibilities.  Yes, ALL of the enemies in the game have a full arsenal of standard, forward, high, low, jump etc attacks in both fast+weak and slow+strong variations. Dashes, grabs, rolls, blinks, magic projectiles, spinning AOE and vomiting poison make combat both varied and challenging. Unfortunately, all this gorgeousness comes at a price: instead of Metroidvania-styled gameplay Abyss Odyssey is way too much linear and kinda lacks other content. The whole game is just a succession of randomly-generated beutiful 'biome' arenas that consist of a single vertically-oriented long corridor with a few dead end branches that have loot in them. More often than not when you reach a predetermined point in the arena enemies just spawn offscreen and you are locked in a small 1-2 screen sized battleground until you defeat them or die trying sorta JRPG-style. Apart from that and a handful of NPCs that train you or sell you stuff there is nothing to interact with. Don't get me wrong, Streets of Rage+Megaman roguelike is a welcome thing, but i'd prefer a +5-10$ in a price tag and a bit more content to deepen gameplay a bit (DLC maybe?).As for drawbacks, kb+mouse controls were a bit clunky, but now devs seem to have fixed everything and I was able to beat the game fwo times out of three tries while I haven't been able to beat it even once before due to unresponsive controls so I got rekt in harder levels because of slow character response. Also devs got a tiny bit lazy and out of a few dozens of enemy types (ALL PLAYABLE!) a couple are just a reskinned or posessed versions of your own characters, doubling as minibosses every now and then, but there is a good variation of unique bosses too though so it's not that bad.All in all a nice game i'd recommend.

												TLDR: Very short game (4hrs or less) with great astetics and premise but an end result that is not worth the price. Consider only  if it is on sale by 75% or more, you like linear dungeon crawlers and  ONLY  if you own a controller. Otherwise stay clear.Full review:First of all, no, this is not a non recommendation due to the controls as it seems to be the case for a lot of other Steam reviews for this game. I actually found the controls to be pretty good and easy to learn ON A CONTROLLER (do NOT play this game otherwise, it IS a nightmare to play using the keyboard).Gameplay is pretty interesting, mainly thanks to the movement and attack controls which make even the very first enemies you encounter a decent challenge. However it can also get a bit too repetitive when most of the enemies follow a very similar pattern and you can even do the same tactics to defeat them, even to the point where you can stun-lock them on endless grab-throw moves (""final boss"" included).I really love the asthetics and theme of this game, the artwork and spine-chill lovely music really gave me the good old Castlevania vibes. Even the voice acting feels like top quality with its few dialogues (that guitar playing skelleton chilling = GG). The big negative point why I cant really recommend this game, is the fact it is very, VERY short. Barely 4 hours in, as a below average skill player and I already cleared the 3 entrances to the Abyss, unlocked the 3 playable characters and gathered pretty much all of the ""journal pages"". There is nothing left to do other than probably try get a couple achievements if I was ever interested on those.Another letdown is that while the game presents you with what could be a very complex and interesting developing story about the origin of the abyss and of the characters you play as, it ends up being mostly told on the previously mentioned journal texts you can find after killing enemies and from what little dialogue there is each time you reach the Warlock. You kill the final boss and what do you get?  a pretty background and a ""Yay, you did it! But guess what? the Warlock is still alive! Play again!"" kind of message.  Nothing more, regardless of how many times you do it.If you see this game super cheap (75% discount or so), you feel like playing a very linear dungeon crawler and you own a controller, I'd say go for it and give it a try not expecting much, I had fun playing it but its flaws really outweight the good stuff unfortunately and at this price, there are a lot of far better games out there.

												Genre: Fighting-RougelikeOverall rating: 86%Gameplay: 17/20Sound/Music: 9/10Graphics: 4/5 - Art design: 5/5Controls: 3/5Replay value: 5/5Gameplay; It's a fighting/platformer game with rouge-like elements. Combat works just like in a fighting game, every character/enemy has a proper move set, but instead of just a one screen arena, you have to fight through a randomized dungeon with multiple floors and paths. The game has around 40 characters, three of them are main characters with the ability to capture enemy souls. This is one of the key features of the game, because once you capture a soul you can use that enemy/boss in the game. There are some ballance issues with this though, some are near worthless some are op and this can impact versus mode. However it's not just a regular figthing game with platforming. The game has co-op and an inventory system, your main charactes can level up and gain skill points to strengthen moves they have found.Sound/Music; Music is excellent, sometimes reminds me of Castlevania, it creates a good atmosphere for the levels and characters. But it doesn't have any ""God tier"" songs that I would put on my mp3 player so it's ""just"" a 9 out of 10.Graphics; Nothing extraordinary here, good dungeon prop variety and nice backgrounds makes the dungeons look good.But that's it, doesn't look bad or particularly good, it serves it's purpose.Art desing; Absolutely fantastic and very creative. The characters are very well designed, they are intersting, beautiful, creepy, terrifying. Things that look like a nightmare or a dream. (the game takes place in a nightmare) Levels are beautiful, and sometimes weird dream like. The menu is super cool.Controls; Oh my GOD the controls they seem bad, and they kinda are. But they aren't that bad once you figured out,  that you can actually climb over the ledges by pushing jump right next to them!!  You can also walljump which is completely useless and annoying. Blocking and dodging can get awkward too sometimes. Also might need X360ce for your controller to function.Replay value; Randomly generated dungeons with loot and secrets, every enemy has like a dozen moves not just 2 or 3 and you can play as enemies and bosses. With random encounters to keep things interesting. (some of them are pretty creative) It also has versus mode and co-op.			"

												Cool game. Super hard on nightmare mode. I think they should mention more about it being roguelike and dying being part of the game(meaning you gain gold and level skills as you progress and put more time into it regardless of being alive). Pretty graphics. The controls are hard at the beginning and a bit counter intuitive but they make since once you get around that.			"

												It's worth the asking price. Rewarding enough for you to feel satisfied when you beat it, and fun enough to keep you playing despite the clumsy, unresponsive and annoying combat system. The story is just enough to explain (superficially) who you are, where you are, why you are there and what you are supposed to do, but still interesting. Haven't played co-op so I can't say anything about it. A good platformer that could have been nearly perfect if the combat system had been more polished and didn't feel like something from an artificially difficult game from the 80's.			"

Like all platformers, use a controller for this one.The art and music are both superb.Add in random generated worlds, loss of equipment on death, and you've got a game kind of like Rogue Legacy, where you lose a lot on death but keep some progress (in this, you keep experience).Co-op can be hard if you can't get over the friendly fire. Time your blocks, get out of each other's way, and it shouldn't be an issue.If you like roguelikes and difficulty, this is for you.			"

												I reviewed this game for DieHard GameFAN. This is the short attention span summary of my review: Abyss Odyssey combines a myriad of genres to provide a unique experience that might not be to everyone’s taste. The platforming is wonky, the combat takes some adjusting, and the game is ruthless in its challenge. Enemies will react to your every move and pay you back in kind, plus the randomness of the dungeon layouts can work both for or against you and involve a lot of luck. Still, if you’re a fan of all of the genres represented here and can handle the steep difficulty, you’ll likely have a good time. Especially if you have a friend available to play along with you.

												DO NOT buy this game, especially for $15.00.  If you get it free, I would still recommend you don't waste your time like I did.  I got it in a bundle and still regret losing an hour and a half of my time.I loaded up with a friend and jumped right into co-op play, here is the bad:- You start with two characters.  The girl is okay the guy is an obnoxious character to play as.- The game doesn't really tell you anything or explain any of the game mechanics to you.- I am not really into the story of games, but if I was, this game has nothing of interest to offer.- You go down into the Abyss and as you go down you get gold and buy things from the shops on each floor.  Problem is you don't gain gold at a comparable rate to the item price in shops.  Considering you don't get to keep the items when you die, the system that is in place is atrocious at best.- Speaking of this, in co-op you don't share loot which makes gold gain even harder.- During the course of play, they have some weapons laying around for free on the map.  Most of the time it says ""not usable by the character you are playing"".  So, not very helpful.- When you play co-op, you have to be on the same screen at all times, so if I drop down a level, I can't see my character.  The camera follows the host.- Jumping in the game is bad.- The combat is extremely clunky, even with a controller.  For the most part, it feels like your just mashing buttons when fighting.- The AI is ridiculous at times.  It's like they anticipate everything you are doing.  I'll throw fireballs at enemies who are fighting my partner and they somehow dodge behind my partner at the last second every time and the fireball hits him.  They feel like they are teleporting all over the screen sometimes.  Sometimes they'll just hold the block button for what seems like forever.- Speaking of enemies, they have way too much health for just being common enemies.  I don't want to play a game where every enemy feels like an HP sponge.  If your fighting more than 3 at once, good luck not getting stun locked for half your health or more.- When we loaded up, my friend wanted to turn off friendly fire.  The game said something about not being able to access all areas if you turn it off, so we left it on.  Talk about a terrible experience.  With the combination of having to be on the same small screen, the terrible jumping, the clunky controls and the enemy AI being obnoxious, good luck not hitting your co-op partner for at least a third of their health in each fight.Here is the good:- The graphics.- The music.tl;dr If all you like in a game is graphics and music, get this game when it's in a bundle for a $1.00.  If you want to have fun, there are 100's of cheaper games that are far less frustrating.			"

												Great concept, but too many things holding it back. Abyss Odyssey has many things going for it: interesting story, nice graphics, an encapsulating theme. Unfortunately, it just doesn't feel right when you play it.Tutorial: the tutorial is very sparse. Sure it shows you what it wants you to do, but doesn't tell you the right inputs to do them, or the intricacies, like the difference between double jumping when facing a wall vs not facing the wall, or even wall slides. They don't teach you what number button quaffs what potion.Controls: The default controls are garbage, and should be reconfigured. Further, the tutorial doesn't really help you choose what suitable inputs should be. Ultimately, this leads to a lot of frustration for a player who want to just pick up and play. Combat: Combat feels a little clunky. It's slowed down in the interest of making combos, but it feels unresponsive at times. The AI doesn't have large enough tells. You would expect that weak enemies would have obvious precursors to their attacks, as would strong enemies' strong attacks, but many of the attack animations appear quickly and often seem uninterruptable. Lack of instruction is a problem here a well: There isn't any instruction as to how to combo. New players are left frustrated as the AI pile on multi hit attacks, while they are stuck with a basic 2 hit combo. Nothing tells players that the timing of the block matters in terms of breaking combos and counter-attacking. I disliked being constrained into artificial combat areas to fight particular non-boss enemies. It seemed unnecessary, particularly when they were already using a key system as a gateway. Also, being limited to fighting 1-3 enemies at a time was disappointing. I never felt overwhelmed by enemies, though at the beginning I did feel overpowered by them. Also, the enemies would often just stand still, waiting for your attacks! I felt as if I went to the bathroom and came back, the enemies would still be there waiting for me to make a move. Death Mechanic: Personally I liked the death mechanic of having a second chance, with a weaker character until you could find a revive spot. Environments: The levels are procedurally generated. Overall they felt luxurious, but sparse to me. I feel like there was a lot of wasted real estate, which could have been filled with smaller enemies. Unfortunately, the game seemed to want to focus on fighting one or two enemies at a time. The relatively linear exploration was somewhat disappointing to me as well. Inventory: You are allowed 1 weapon, 1 of each type of accessory, 1 soul transformation. If you want something else in a slot, you have to throw your current item away, and can't even sell it to a merchant. Very arcade video gamey, but not something I desire for a regular game. Would much rather have had a configurable inventory so I could switch swords. Plot: The fight seemed inconsequential after your first death. You die, you get reincarnated. Simple. What were the soldiers fighting for? Why didn't they just stay home and avoid the abyss, only guarding the exits? Were the monster's stealing children,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥women, setting fires? Nah, the soldiers just wanted to commit suicide by jumping into an abyss to fight said monsters. A lot of wasted potential here. Overall, this is a game with a lot of potential if you can get into it. However, it's lack of instruction, odd difficulty curve, slower combat system, and lack of drive will make it meh to most players.			"

												TLDR: Very short game (4hrs or less) with great astetics and premise but an end result that is not worth the price. Consider only  if it is on sale by 75% or more, you like linear dungeon crawlers and  ONLY  if you own a controller. Otherwise stay clear.Full review:First of all, no, this is not a non recommendation due to the controls as it seems to be the case for a lot of other Steam reviews for this game. I actually found the controls to be pretty good and easy to learn ON A CONTROLLER (do NOT play this game otherwise, it IS a nightmare to play using the keyboard).Gameplay is pretty interesting, mainly thanks to the movement and attack controls which make even the very first enemies you encounter a decent challenge. However it can also get a bit too repetitive when most of the enemies follow a very similar pattern and you can even do the same tactics to defeat them, even to the point where you can stun-lock them on endless grab-throw moves (""final boss"" included).I really love the asthetics and theme of this game, the artwork and spine-chill lovely music really gave me the good old Castlevania vibes. Even the voice acting feels like top quality with its few dialogues (that guitar playing skelleton chilling = GG). The big negative point why I cant really recommend this game, is the fact it is very, VERY short. Barely 4 hours in, as a below average skill player and I already cleared the 3 entrances to the Abyss, unlocked the 3 playable characters and gathered pretty much all of the ""journal pages"". There is nothing left to do other than probably try get a couple achievements if I was ever interested on those.Another letdown is that while the game presents you with what could be a very complex and interesting developing story about the origin of the abyss and of the characters you play as, it ends up being mostly told on the previously mentioned journal texts you can find after killing enemies and from what little dialogue there is each time you reach the Warlock. You kill the final boss and what do you get?  a pretty background and a ""Yay, you did it! But guess what? the Warlock is still alive! Play again!"" kind of message.  Nothing more, regardless of how many times you do it.If you see this game super cheap (75% discount or so), you feel like playing a very linear dungeon crawler and you own a controller, I'd say go for it and give it a try not expecting much, I had fun playing it but its flaws really outweight the good stuff unfortunately and at this price, there are a lot of far better games out there.

												Yeah, this hit all the right buttons for me.Abyss Odyssey is a beat 'em up game with fighting game mechanics and loot grabbing - it has platform levels that change every playthrough, loaded with traps and secret rooms.Bad- controls are wonky. it's set up to attack left and you have to face right again and then press right to go in that direction. Some of the characters are limited because they are too big for an area or, in the case of the first soldier, cannot climb walls at certain heights. It's pretty flawed in these specific control problems. Most people cannot overlook this (thus the mixed Steam reviews) and I don't blame them.Good - but what shines in this game is the art, animation and design. The whole drips with polish and satisfying visuals in the art style of Art Nouveau masters like Mucha. The characters are strange and interesting with amazing movesets and fantastic animations - some of the pick-up enemies are more fun to play than the three main characters! The story is facinating Chilean myth with a bizarre twist that makes the mood eerie and one of a kind.Basically, if the controls were patched, this would be one of my favorite games, no doubt about it.

												Nice blend of roguelike, platformer and beatemup genres. You are able to capture defeated enemies' souls and play as those creatures yourself switching between them and your main char on the go giving you immense tactical possibilities.  Yes, ALL of the enemies in the game have a full arsenal of standard, forward, high, low, jump etc attacks in both fast+weak and slow+strong variations. Dashes, grabs, rolls, blinks, magic projectiles, spinning AOE and vomiting poison make combat both varied and challenging. Unfortunately, all this gorgeousness comes at a price: instead of Metroidvania-styled gameplay Abyss Odyssey is way too much linear and kinda lacks other content. The whole game is just a succession of randomly-generated beutiful 'biome' arenas that consist of a single vertically-oriented long corridor with a few dead end branches that have loot in them. More often than not when you reach a predetermined point in the arena enemies just spawn offscreen and you are locked in a small 1-2 screen sized battleground until you defeat them or die trying sorta JRPG-style. Apart from that and a handful of NPCs that train you or sell you stuff there is nothing to interact with. Don't get me wrong, Streets of Rage+Megaman roguelike is a welcome thing, but i'd prefer a +5-10$ in a price tag and a bit more content to deepen gameplay a bit (DLC maybe?).As for drawbacks, kb+mouse controls were a bit clunky, but now devs seem to have fixed everything and I was able to beat the game fwo times out of three tries while I haven't been able to beat it even once before due to unresponsive controls so I got rekt in harder levels because of slow character response. Also devs got a tiny bit lazy and out of a few dozens of enemy types (ALL PLAYABLE!) a couple are just a reskinned or posessed versions of your own characters, doubling as minibosses every now and then, but there is a good variation of unique bosses too though so it's not that bad.All in all a nice game i'd recommend.

												Extremely fun co-op gameplay and if you play with someone else on the default setting it can prove to be quite challenging. Friendly fire is a feature of the game, and being a side scroller beat-em-up means that combos are pivotal to clearing harder content. That being said, being juggled in your friend's combo while you can't do anything but watch and die means that you're not actually playing the game and since the encounter screen is quite limited this happens more often than you'd think.I'd say overall that it's a fun experience and definitely worth playing. There's full controller support so playing from your bed on a lazy day is definitely an option. For the price (especially during a steam sale), you get the most bang for your buck.			"

												What do you say about this game? I could tell you that the art style is gorgeous, evoking equal parts the saturated fantastical gloss of Trine and dreamworld fantasy with beautiful, clean Art Noveau.I could tell you that, mechanically, it's Smash Bros. meets a Roguelite.I could also tell you that there are technical flaws which harm the game in many ways, that the game is mostly balanced for playing alone and thus making the co-op modes nearly superfluous, not even counting the great technical flaws in the online co-op.In the end I will say that it is possible to get used to the technical flaws and that there is a great charm in playing what is essentially Smash Bros. with a stamina-based cancelling mechanic in a simple, Roguelite map with fantastic art and presentation. It starts out hard, but gets easier as you get used to the mechanics. If it still doesn't feel quite there, try disabling the V-sync in the options; for some reason, this helps the responsiveness even with a gamepad.			"

												I love metroidvania games and I rarely write reviews, but I think this game has the potential to be a great game with only a few tweaks, so here I go...Although I really enjoyed several elements of the actual game (gorgeous visuals, music, level design, enemies and heroes characters and that low price is surreal for such an ambitious project), there are currently three BIG design ideas that I really hate:-Friendly Fire, I won't even argue much here as this is really obvious and already posted by several other reviewers - if you want to make co-op thoughtful in your game keep the ""colision"" part, but get rid of the damage! Just one additional note, friendly fire in fast paced platformers specially this one with a 2D fighting games combat system vibe simply don’t work well. It works much more towards increasing frustration, avoidance and restrict experimentation than adding excitement or tactical / strategic elements gameplay-wise.-Clunky controls, the controls schema is ok, but far from perfect. I'm using a X360 joystick and it would be great if the controls were as responsive as in some other recent 2D platformers like ""Dust: An Elysian Tail"", ""Shank 2"", ""Valdis Story"" etc or even real fighting games like ""SFIV"", ""KoF 13"" (slower) or ""UMvC"", BlazBlue"" (faster) - specially the movement aspect: to block, parry, turn and recover.-No way to ""save"" between levels (there is a temporary way, an expensive and painful one, which means if you don't have the proper item, are far away in the Abyss and dies or don't have the time to finish the game, it's basically: gameover). FIX: just add automatic checkpoints in the current altars. For those of you that think this is a “casual gamer” request, let me elaborate: If you are not a bon vivant teenager and don’t have the spare time to play beginning to end every time you start the game (around 1h15) you will never enjoy this game as it already happened to me twice since launch when I got only about 20 minutes to play per session in my scarce free time. Checkpoints are needed to fix a design flaw that forces players to “play to the end at once or never play it”. PS: I hope you guys realize a checkpoint to save progress is a completely different thing than a free Healing Altar!I always try to respect and understand designer decisions (they are there for a reason), so for the first two points and to please everybody, simply adding a ""Turn On/Off"" option would solve it. Or even a difficult setting: Option1 (checkpoint to save + disable friendly fire) and Option2 (save costs items/gold + enable friendly fire).I believe this game has the potential to became one of the best 2D platformer games of all time, otherwise I promisse you I would never write a review this long, so hopefuly the devs will check the player's reviews and work on patches and enhancements. Until there, I found it hard to keep playing and/or recommend.EDIT:To end the silly “casual” versus “hardcore” arguing here, let me be very direct: AO is a really easy-to-beat game once you get the basics and have the mandatory free time (just learn to properly parry and level up your char to unlock the 3 cancels: done). If you believe my negative review points to help enhance the overall game experience is a simply “nerf the game’s difficult!” you are insanely mistaken.  If you want to play a hard game and not make a fool of yourself here, go play Dwarf Fortress (PC) or Battletoads (NES) – both great games btw.EDIT2:Kudos to developers! Only two days after release and patch 1.01 is already out fixing a major complain in the game (Toggle Friendly Fire On/Off is now possible), increasing some control responsiveness issues and more!EDIT3:After reinstalling the game and checking over the last updates I've changed my status review to a ""recommended"" game. Gameplay and other balances greatly improved in the last update! Kudos to developers!Best regards,			"

												ACE Team are keen on creating memorable, talked-about games, and their latest creation, Abyss Odyssey, will do just that. In a blend of Metroidvania-esque levels, rogue-like gameplay and setup, and Chilean-inspired themes, settings, and design Abyss Odyssey will test your patience. But like the Souls franchise, you will keep coming back for more and more punishment. Why? Because you will never let a game get the better of you, and as a gamer, you have to see those credits roll. Okay, perhaps Abyss Odyssey isn’t that hardcore, but you get the idea. ACE Team has recaptured an idea that has worked for 20+ years with series like Mega Man, Castlevania, and Metroid. And while it’s not a complete overhaul of the genre, it’s a step in the right direction for the side-scrolling dungeon crawler genre.Everyone’s game will start the same: you’ll control Katrien, whose Rapier will allow you to make considerable progress through the procedurally generated dungeons on your way to tackle the Warlock in the Abyss. I say considerable due to the fact that it’s unlikely you’ll make it too far before Katrien is defeated and you must then, as a weak soldier, return to a nearby resurrection altar and return her to life, or start over from the beginning. Not all is lost if you die though, as your solider ‘spirit’ (so to speak) isn’t completely useless, but he’s a much weaker competitor than you yourself. Katrien (and your soldier companion) has a bevy of attacks and special moves to accompany you in your journey ranging from arching swipes, to fireballs, and sliding attacks. Utilized in conjunction with one another makes her a satisfying warrior, but the no-so-tight controls and platforming leads level exploration a lot to be desired.Platforming games have been around for decades, and they aren’t going anywhere, and when I get my hands on one, I’m personally spoiled by them. Having played every Mario game to death, Nintendo has perfected platforming; and with 2D Castlevania and Metroid games helping cement how graceful platformers can be, playing a game that’s a step back is really frustrating. Abyss Odyssey’s isn’t the worst of the genre, but it’s not up there with the best either. Most of the time, you can double jump then dash over crevices, but occasionally you come upon the dreaded ‘ledge’ wherein it’s 90% impossible to overcome unless you’re facing the right direction. Turning to get in the right direction is a bit of a delay, this making even the simplest of things, such as turning your character(s), rather cumbersome. Yes, this sounds almost elementary, but when you’re trying to hurriedly get somewhere and you’re halted in climbing due to such a minor inconvenience, it’s immensely frustrating. Again, it’s not ‘bad’, but it’s unsatisfying when it happens more often than it should.Another issue with Abyss Odyssey is its lack of real direction in terms of explaining what you can and cannot do. For example, when your mana meter builds, you’re able to unleash an attack that not only deals damage, but allows you to capture the soul of your foe. You’re then able to freely switch between the soul of your newly acquired demon, each with their own set of attacks and moves, to help in the journey. Unfortunately, none if this is really implied or explained. ACE Team has created a world I want to explore, but provides no understanding of the rules or regulations. As far as plot goes (another lacking feature as far as its delivery) comes in the form of pages of the Warlock’s journal that randomly drop from vanquished adversaries. The twenty page journal tells you everything about the Warlock’s beginning, middle, and end, but not much else aside from small bits about the creatures in the Abyss. I’m all for subtlety and minimalism, but at some point explanation and direction is needed, and Abyss Odyssey loses on that front.What’s found in Abyss Odyssey is a solid exploratory platformer with minor aggravations, but with rich design marred by poor direction and exposition. You will spend hours upon hours collecting enemies, hunting through the various dungeons, and defeating the famed Warlock; and then come back for more. With multiple playable characters, each with their own distinctive characteristics and attacks, there’s enough content to provide second and third playthroughs. And while we were unable to test this while playing pre-embargo, ACE Team promises a ton of continuous changes and additions to the game as more and more people complete the task of defeating the Warlock. Abyss Odyssey holds a world of fun in itself. In the end though, it’s just a shame that what’s here, although it isn’t genre-changing, isn’t enough to pull it from the depths of a dozen of other lookalikes. There’s a bevy of treasures to discover in the great below, however, so don’t pass up the chance to explore it. When Abyss Odyssey stares in to you, smirk and say ‘let’s go’!(Review via Front Towards Gamer: http://ftg.operationsupplydrop.org/2015/02/09/hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth-1-review-pc/) "

												I've played this game for a few hours during the free weekend and it's pretty addictive, mainly because of its rogue-like elements, leveling up your character and diving further and further into the abyss.Pros:+ I really like the art style. Characters are unique and pretty weird. Great atmosphere in every level; it feels a bit like Trine.+ You can morph into the enemies you've slain! That's really cool.+ The RPG elements are pretty well done, although I'm not too sure about the skill points. As in every good rogue-like dying really matters and resources are limited.Cons:- Abyss Odyssey feels like a mixture of Rogue Legacy and Super Smash Brothers, but the controls are clunkier than both of those games (and that's not really a good thing). - It's hard to time attacks, especially since most enemies instantly block. But maybe I'm just a noob at this game.- Unsure about the replay value. There are quite a few unlockable characters, but I doubt the game is entertaining enough to do multiple runs.I wouldn't pay the full price, but I recommend picking up this game on sale (currently 3 euros). I still want to try out local coop.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is an awesome fighting game with some cool rogue-lite elements. There are lots of unlockable characters and every game is a random dungeon. You could say that the game gets repetetive, because it consists of smashing hordes of enemies on your way to the boss fight, but personally I love this game because it consists of smashing hordes of enemies on your way to the boss fight.As far as the fighting mechanics go, it's a lot like smash bros.  There are no easy combos.  At first a 4 hit combo seems impossible, then you will find a youtube video of an insane 10 hit combo.  This game is sort of an anti-button mashing game.  If you mash, you will be sent to bed without supper.  In my opinion, this makes the game terribly fun to play, as it's all about exploiting the range and timing of attacks.You can play as any enemy in the game, including the bosses, so there's lots of play time.  I've been playing for about 26 hours and I am still missing about 7 enemies or so.The art style speaks for itself, as everything is beautiful and weird.  this game is about to go on super monster sale soon, and it would behoove you to buy it.  It is an awesome fighting game, but you have to play by its rules.  Check out some of the combo exhibition videos on youtube.			"

												Argghhh.... That game... it's great and annoying at the same time. The thing about ACE team (the creators of the game), is that they make games with HUGEEEEE potential, yet they fall when it comes to gameplay and basic things. theoretically, their are games are AMAZING, but when it comes to the actual gameplay, you realize that they had a great plan that has gone to waste (same with Zeno Clash sadly).Abyss Odyssey is an awesome challenging game, that falls down when it comes to the combat and momvment. the combat is really repetive and boring, as you spam pretty much everything, while trying to doge and avoid pretty much everything.On the other hand, the art style, the music and the voice acting (yeah, thats right, unlike the voice acting in Zeno Clash - the voice acting in Abyss Odyssey is actually pretty good!) are all awesome, it's just that the combat is really frustrating.Well, the bottom line is - a great game, with huge potential (just as Zeno Clash has huge potential), but somthing went horribly worng along the way. meh, such a shame.

												Okay this game has a good arkwork and animations and characters, it looks really nice and the randomness helps, the problem is the controls but most know this already, i don't think the controls are impossible but it does take a bit of time to move around.			"

												I like this game. Good game mechanics.ChallangingCould be longer rather then some AAA games. but it's up to you if you like to replay it. Not many creatures but all playable.Whithout gamepad it's hard to play.It's very annoing to see sometimes equipment disapear when you close the program and then reopen it.  I hope devs gonna  fix this bug... (and plz refil life bar after warlock, the leaving creature is a jerk) "

												I like try&die but this. Art and sound are great tho.You are as gracefull as a potatoe threw into the air while every other ennemy is two times faster than you.I may have liked this game if I played it before Rogue leguacy/Castle crashers/Smash licenceBeeing handicaped naturrally against foes without capacity to overcome it exept huge HP pool isn't fair difficulty.Loosing all of your items on a run for the sake of respawn isn't fair difficulty.Having to rely on RNG to get a decent weapon for decent damage output and success a run isn't fair difficulty.The whole art direction makes me to keep playing, the unfair challenge too, but the gameplay really threw me off.Maybe in coop.TL;DR : If you liked playing Dark souls in heavy armor you'll love this game.

												(I played on a controller, so I can't vouch for how the game plays with keyboard.)Abyss Odyssey has some pretty clever ideas and is a pretty fun 2D brawler after some adjustment. Most of the problems I have with it are related to the co-op. First, the netcode is just bad. When you're not the host be prepared for assets to not load in properly or at all, rubberbanding, and occassional gamebreaking desyncs (for instance my coop partner once just had a black screen and couldn't move, while on my screen they were standing in midair between platforms).  Second friendly fire being the default in co-op, just do yourselves a favor if you play this game co-op and don't turn friendly fire on. The menu argues the game is ""balanced"" for it, but the game is really plenty punishing without your partner stabbing you in the back, and sitting in your side of the arena waiting for an enemy to break off from your partner so you can safely attack them is pretty lame. Additionally, the enemies don't have friendly fire and can freely stack up and overwhelm you, and more of them spawn in the cooperative mode.There are also a lot of cheap shots in this game. You'll drop into a pit and a waiting enemy will attack you before you can even see what's happening, or you'll hit a trap. Enemies will spawn right on top of you immediately whipping out punishment. It's not terrible when you're prepared for it, but still bleh.As a single player game it's pretty well balanced and fun. I really enjoy the simple ""smash bros"" emulating controls, although the game does lack the polish and nuance of smash I still respect that direction. The art is pretty great, although attack animations are sometimes a bit wonky. Ultimately, if 2D Brawlers aren't your standard fare there are better ones to try first, but if it's a favored genre then Abyss Odyssey is certainly worth a look.			"

												I picked Abyss Odyssey up on a whim as something to do with the wife and considering that I've enjoyed the hell out of ACE's other titles I wasn't too worried about this one. So long as you go into it with the expectation of dying often you'll have a hell of a good time working your way through the depths and ultimately fighting the Warlock. The best modern examples I can use to describe this title is it's Dragon's Crown slammed together with Trine and topped off with your standard Rogue-lite affair (Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, etc...). The mashup works surprisingly well with general RPG character progression (stats and skills) complimenting the randomized loot and progress resets.[PROS] Visually the game is fantastic and at times a little unsettling in a good kind of way. The audio is pretty well done, nothing incredible but it does its job and didn't irritate me after extended periods of play. The actual dungeon crawling is a blast and the monster transformation gimmick is pretty great once you figure it out. Local co-op is a huge bonus and the game is generally even more fun when sitting on the couch alongside someone else with controllers in hand. [CONS] The game doesn't do the best job introducing itself to players and it took me multiple hours to really get the hang of combat and progression. Fights can at times feel a little unfair depending on how quickly you pick up on the invincibility frames of your skills and the AI tendencies of your opponents. A few of the environmental hazards don't telegraph very well which can make certain sections a little frustrating, in particular the ""Thwomp"" like enemies you'll encounter further down the tower. I experienced a couple of bugs, some less impactful (wrong VO playing) and others more so (unable to move left/right). None of the bugs aside from the movement one really broke the game and even then I made it my mission to try and traverse the level using nothing but dodges (which I succeeded at).If you're like me and you love Rogue-likes and Metroidvanias I think you'll really enjoy Abyss Odyssey and its unique blend of the two. That being said, this game isn't for everyone and some of the problems I had with the game warrant a knock on the score.7.5/10Note: I did not try out the Versus game mode nor did I play co-op with friendly fire turned on. This review is based on some solo play but mostly couch co-op.			"

												One of the most ""arty"" games in Steam. It is stylish, it is deep, it is replayable and overall is fun.While I would like to have a slowly slower pace and a slighly deeper combat system the game is amazing as it is. I just don't get why this game has almost 1/3 of negative reviews. The only downside I think of is that it could be more optimised, performance-wise. But it is a minor thing that I can cope with by lowering the resolution a little.Not a masterpiece, but better than good for sure. "

												This game is actually quite good. I'm impressed with how many techniques they were able to take from fighting games, and the execution of them inside a platformer Roguelike is doubly impressive. The game is set up similar to a roguelike dungeon crawl-- go in, fight your way to the bottom, fighting a few bosses along the way, and defeating a final boss. But what makes it so good is the depth of the mechanics, and how they work together-- You may choose from three basic characters, yet there are many more available. To get them, you have to defeat them with a super and then you can pick up their soul-- and thus, you are now playing as a fully featured character whenever you want to transform. While you can only carry one soul at a time, it gives a much deeper mechanic to the game: Should you opt for a monster early on to help you along, or save the super to get one you really want later? It takes quite some time to fill up the mana meter, so the choice is important, as it gives you a whole life bar to survive longer. Each enemy plays completely differently, but gives a great deal depth as a result.One thing that should be mentioned is that the game might feel somewhat slow and a bit clunky at first. I feel this is actually a good thing, though, as it leaves the player able to improve and attack much faster than is initially able, giving a real sense of progression in an intuitive way. This ties into progressing: If you're not good enough to defeat the enemies, you won't reach the end.Speaking of the enemies, they are NPC opponents, which inevitably means they're 'not perfect'. That is to say, they're sometimes too perfect and too good at reading what you're going to do. I'd love to see more work made to improve on enemy AI as the game's life progresses, but this is my only real gripe, and it's not even a big one. The enemies are certainly able to be defeated, it's more of a survival gauntlet than anything, but sometimes they adjust their behaviours a little too fast when you input something.All in all, an extremely enjoyable game, which I hope will have a fruitful life and a large community. The quality is astounding for the price of the game; puts many AAA games to shame.			"

												Pros:-Beautiful art-Awesome soundtrack-Great concept-Interesting storyCons:-Awkward combat and movement mechanics (very still movement, blocking, dodging, and countering is often pointless)-Restrictive offensive and defensive capabilities-Some important items are lost on first death (You die, but have a chance to revive your character before losing the run)-90% of equipment you find wont be useable (and even if it is, the effect boosting rings are useless 70% of the time)-Mostly about grinding experience until you have enough HP to do anything-Monster difficulty scaling is very steep-The best way to combat enemies is to abuse their AI, spam ranged attack while hiding behind a soldier, or memorize the perfect position to hit enemies into the air against a wall so you can juggle them until they die			"

												Quite Fun But Very Challenging!Just tried this game out on a whim and it is actually quite fun.  Surprisingly it is a 2d random map sidescroller that plays quite a bit like super smash brothers!  As a fighting game fan I actually notice quite a few things you normally don't need to worry about in games EXCEPT for a fighting game (Armor, cancelling, frames etc.)  I have logged 9 hours so far but am still really liking it.  Something kind of trippy about venturing into the encarnation of a mad warlock's dreams and the whole game feels surreal.  I would recommend it but be patient.  The game is quite difficult and takes some studying to be effective.  Even once you get it you will still have some hard times decending into the depths.			"

												This game isn't perfect, but it's one I've really come to enjoy. I'd definitely recommend playing this with a controller. My main complaint (which seems to be *the* complaint in general) is that the controls are a bit awkward. The combat took a little getting used to, but I got there in the end. Using the practice arena or the area before you select your entrance for the abyss helped me out. For some reason jumping is also oddly difficult, and looking at other reviews I'm glad to know it's not just me.The replay value isn't the best (yet for some reason I personally find myself coming back to play more). Definitely give each character a shot though - I've found that I've enjoyed playing as Monk and Pincoya more than I've enjoyed playing as Katrien. Experiment with your special attacks and see what fits your personal style the best. It makes a massive difference.The art in this game is truly amazing. My love for Art Nouveau became helplessly solid after playing this game! The music isn't bad, but sometimes I'm just not in the mood for it and I turn it down and play whatever else I want instead. The game alt+tabs with no worries, but the pause menu doesn't seem to be a pause in the expected sense, but when it pauses you can still take damage when you're in the middle of a fight. There are clever and interesting references to various mythology and other games throughout the game, and I didn't pick them all up straight away. It was nice to realise them later.I paid full price for this game and I don't feel ripped off. However, I know not everyone else feels the same way. I recommend the game, though. Ultimately it's a fun and beautiful game that I fell and love with and I keep coming back to, despite some of its flaws.			"

												First things first, this game is beautifully crafted. It is certainly one of the most visually appealing games I have played. I am typically not a fan of this style of metroidvania inspired game. Primarily because I am simply not very good at them and they become frustrating rather than fun fairly quickly. With this game I find that the story and visual appeal continue to draw me in. Even though I am not very good at the game, I continue to come back to it because I am curious to see what will happen next and what new environments will be revealed as I slowly progress into the abyss. I highly recommend this game. For those who like me, are not very adept at platforming hack and slash games a patient approach is well rewarded. For fans of metroid and castlevania, you do not want to miss this game. It is a stunning and amazingly deep experience.			"

												So there are some really mixed reviews here. I'm not going to say vague things like the controls are ""heavy"", tell you what art style it is, or load my review up with quotes. No offense to anyone.This game is awesome. Let me express some things.-First, the combat system is actually very good. AI is well done and while exploits exist the oppostion isn't given crazy stupid powerful moves to compensate for lack of design. As well, if you think anything is overpowered guess what? You get to use a dream catcher and become one.-If you want to button mash use the ghost monk, it has very straightforward arcing attacks and the bouncing ball of flame can hit stuff you didn't even know it was going to hit. Not that you can't get skilled with the ghost monk. If you want to play quick and use reflexes play as katrien. If you want a mind puzzle that pays off use pincoya.-Use the surroundings to fight, it's one of the best things you can use to fight. If you have a guard helping try to flank your opponents.-Keep your enemies back by striking. You can hit one, dodge across the room, and hit another. Then jump dodge back to the first. One of the really cool things about this game is both you and the enemy get to hit on your way up from the floor and can dodge straight through some attacks. One great thing to do with a bit of practice is to use a ranged attack to get your opponent to dodge straight into your weapon. When they end their dodge you have a free shot for a follow up combo.- When you get to the fountain room you can get all the gold, take your time killing all the lame monsters for xp, and pick up a couple health potions, then exit the game and come back and do it again. Multiple times! Which is great to do if you don't like dying. But honestly, get ready to die. This game let's you keep everything but your gear. And rewards you after you die usually. You get new characters and all. Don't take it too personally, you literally only start back at the top and lose gear. Which you will regain from another waltz below.-Gear - Buy what you need. But everything has it's place. High damage output can be the difference between trying real hard to keep your health up and just walking through enemies. But I probably wouldn't buy high damage gear until I'm looking to get real low in the abyss. Accept that you'll die and have fun. One of the coolest things about this game is that you won't retain or have access to the same gear. You'll pick up a couple gear pieces most likely and buy a couple others. You might find some gear that you buy anytime you can find it. You might change your combat style because certain items are just too hard to get a hold of. You might end up like me forced to play something unusual and end up loving it.-If you are low on health, not a ton of awesome gear and an altar nearby... die. Let the guard hoof it back to the alter and reward you with full health. What a champ. And on that note. Dodge/attack is one of the best things a guard can do in combat.-Wear out your dreamcatcher first. After the monster you are turned into dies you come back as you. You can also change out of monster form to pick up health globes. And mana globes collected automatically go to your characters mana bar.-Use camp tokens in the earlier levels. Especially before the fountain room. It let's you stock up on things and gives you plenty chances to run into merchants that can sell you things for your big fight at the bottom.-Don't expect Nightmare mode to be beatable. It's supposed to be stupid hard. Laugh when you die. You're playing nightmare mode, you probably aren't that sane to begin with.If you do all these things you will likely enjoy the game much, much more... the game you probably spent like <$10 dollars on. It's not hard to live up to $10.			"

												Roguelikes as a genre tend to sacrifice graphics for a plethora of monsters, skills and trinkets to pick up, and in turn, this game being so pretty means the experience is streamlined a bit; you don't get a thousand little items to throw around or weapons to experiment with, but it's still good at it does.That said, and I know games like this aren't really about fairness, but when you can randomly get the ever-loving♥♥♥♥♥♥beat out of you by a giant chain-juggling lion monster before you even start the dungeon proper, it kinda puts a damper on the fun.

												Abyss Odyssey is procedurally generated, side scrolling Beat 'em up. The player is tasked with venturing deep into the procedurally generated abyss with the goal of killing a warlock. In order to accomplish their goal, the player must learn the secrets of the abyss through trial and error. failure is common.Throughout the abyss, the player will battle a multitude of dangerous creatures through melee combat. This combat feels sluggish and stiff initially. Later on however, it becomes much more enjoyable as the player masters the combat system and unlocks more moves. As a result Abyss Odyssey runs the risk of turning new players away before it gets interesting. Players who persevere are rewarded as they learn how best to combo moves and abilities together effectively, yet even in it's later stages, it lacks some of the polish found in other side scrolling Beat 'em ups. I found that using a controller helped a bit with some of the combat's issues, as the game was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind. Altogether the combat is decent, but not great. Little things like not being able to change directions in the middle of a combo and poor aerial combat drag the experience down. Where Abyss Odyssey's combat makes up for it's lack of polish is in variety. The number of playable characters is surprisingly impressive, and while many are not as developed as others, they still help change up the combat occasionally.I was also pleasantly surprised by Abyss Odyssey's procedurally generated level design. While nothing groundbreaking, the levels it generates feel well constructed and reasonably different. While they still lack the same tightly focused nature of many hand-made levels, they serve as a good backdrop for the game's combat, even mixing in a bit of light platforming to break things up. Throughout these levels Abyss Odyssey offers the player many opportunities to make risk reward based choices which leverage immediate reward against the risk of long term peril. While a nice system, I rarely found any situations where the risks outweighed the benefits, effectively undermining the tension these systems could have created if they were more effectively balanced.Abyss Odyssey's most notable feature is its art and music. The environments on display are beautiful to look at and manage to help disguise the procedural generation. Character designs are especially good. Each one is reasonably interesting to look at. As a result, I always enjoyed seeing what creature I would stumble upon next. Abyss Odyssey's soundtrack is also fairly good, and manages to capture the mood of the game just right. I especially liked the eerie guitar pieces, which add to the unique atmosphere.Despite it's numerous flaws, I still believe I can give Abyss Odyssey a cautious recommendation. Anyone interested in a procedurally generated Beat 'em up will likely be satisfied, so long as they can overlook some frustrating design elements.			"

												I don't know for sure, but so far this game is challenging and the combat DOES make sense if you actually bother to learn it. I enjoy the fighting. It can feel clunky if you're expecting a game where you can spam the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your abilities. It's not one of those games. Like all platformers, use a controller for this one.The art and music are both superb.Add in random generated worlds, loss of equipment on death, and you've got a game kind of like Rogue Legacy, where you lose a lot on death but keep some progress (in this, you keep experience).Co-op can be hard if you can't get over the friendly fire. Time your blocks, get out of each other's way, and it shouldn't be an issue.If you like roguelikes and difficulty, this is for you.			"

												Do not buy this game, when playing co-op you can damage the other player and there is no setting to turn that off, the game is extremely close quaters so it dosnt give you a chance to not hit the other player. The story line does not make any sense, when you first hop into the game it just throws you into the world not giving any explanation. I bought this game through a humble bundle for .99c and i dont even think its worth that much honestly this game is complete sh*t.			"

												It's a bit harder of a game. Like a rogue like, lets you save level but not items. Makes for some good difficulty but not impossible. If you like Dark Souls you might like it. I got it cheap off the Humble Bundle, I would rate it a 10-15$ worth game.			"

												It's worth the asking price. Rewarding enough for you to feel satisfied when you beat it, and fun enough to keep you playing despite the clumsy, unresponsive and annoying combat system. The story is just enough to explain (superficially) who you are, where you are, why you are there and what you are supposed to do, but still interesting. Haven't played co-op so I can't say anything about it. A good platformer that could have been nearly perfect if the combat system had been more polished and didn't feel like something from an artificially difficult game from the 80's.			"

												Interesting idea of a game and the combat reminds me of the sword-wielding characters from the Super Smash Bros. Series, but clunkier. It feels like there is a lag behind every action and not enough attack patterns to utilize. Personally I like smooth mechanics and a good story and while I did not get too far into the story it looked okay, but the combat really pushed me away from this game.TLDR: Story mode from Smash Bros. Brawl with worse combat.			"

												A strong recommendation.It's a game with platforming and rouge-like elements, but it is a 2d brawler at the core:Every combat is engaging and even regular monsters can cause a lot of pain if you're not paying attention.The AI is also surprisingly good - enemies will jump over your fireballs, block your attack, dodge-roll through them and throw you from time to time if you are blocking too long.If you have interest in beat em ups - get this one, it's different and fun.

												One of the best looking rogue-likes of this year. You can turn into monsters you fight by finishing them off with special moves, all with different movesets and physics properties. It's something that you kind of come back once in a while, to get immensed in the atmosphere, and try out new monsters. Lots of loot to get and buy, great replayability value. The dev teams update monster types frequently too, making every travel down the abyss fresh and interesting.			"

												The idea of the game is realy good, the game itself is beautiful but..this is one of the most irresponsive game i never played in my life. This is just frustating and this is the best comment i've read here :As much as I wanted this game to work, it simply does not. The idea is solid, but the controls just don't respond in real-time combat. The monsters defend against your tactics quickly, but your ability to react is lost in a highly-limited, unresponsive combat UI. The game looks like it would be so fun, if only you could hit back; just getting your character to face the right direction is a chore. You can execute combos all day in the training dojo (against a motionless combat dummy), but none of those moves will work once the UI tries to interact with the AI.			"

												I reviewed this game for DieHard GameFAN. This is the short attention span summary of my review: Abyss Odyssey combines a myriad of genres to provide a unique experience that might not be to everyone’s taste. The platforming is wonky, the combat takes some adjusting, and the game is ruthless in its challenge. Enemies will react to your every move and pay you back in kind, plus the randomness of the dungeon layouts can work both for or against you and involve a lot of luck. Still, if you’re a fan of all of the genres represented here and can handle the steep difficulty, you’ll likely have a good time. Especially if you have a friend available to play along with you.

												I can't recomend this game to anyone. The visuals are extremely dark, the controls feel unresponsive and clunky, moving isn't natural (more often than not i found myself walking backwards and having to completely halt all movement flick the stick then start walking forward) and worst of all, the person who bought me the game got to try the tutorial, I didn't even get the chance to try it. The art of the game is painfully bland and dark as well and since you start out with only one character in the story it gets very confusing when two people use the same character as the color pallette is a very tiny shade darker to tell the players apart instead of simple color coded arrows.Combat is frustrating solo as you'll find youself repeatedly knocked down by enemies as they just chunk your hp but when you can manage a single combo on them it feels like you're hitting them with a pillow. I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone. It fails as a brawler, fails as a platformer and fails as a roguelike. The game feels as if it is still in alpha.  So unless you're wanting to play a bad game for some sort of joke or online review stay awy from it. I got it as a gift and I want to give them their money back.			"

												Abyss Odyssey is a beautiful game with a nice gameplay and combat mechanics. It focus on the Hero/Soldier duality, when the Hero dies then a Soldier comes to continue it's progress. You have a chance to revive the Hero at an Altar if you make it that far. The Soldiers are weaker but still capable on their own and provide an interesting gameplay ideia: you're forced to do with the Soldiers what you could not do with the Hero.The art style is incredible, all characters including enemies are very well design and the environments fit well within the game. The combat is varied and allows you to choose between 3 Heros + 3 Soldiers + about 20 different monsters you can summon once in a while. Each one has its own style and unique special abilities.The game is a bit difficult, to get to the final boss you have to pass through many levels with different difficulties and if both your Hero and Soldier dies you're back to square one. There are checkpoints along the way to save progress but these require tokens which are quite expensive. Any attempt to defeat the final boss is an expedition that requires preparation and nerves of steel.Pros:- Amazing art style- 3 heros to choose + a bunch of other playable characters- Good combat - Random generated levels improve replayability- Made by the Zeno-Clash boys, guaranteed seal of AwesomenessCons:- Controls are a bit slugish- Better to play with Xbox controller- Being bum-rushed to death happens from time to time- Random generated levels end up being repetitive- Difficulty			"

												My first review, so don't judge me.This is a tough game, not for the light of heart.I noticed a few people complaining about keyboard controls in the reviews, so let me clarify here and now.The keyboard controls are only slightly awkward for the first 15 minutes, then you get used to it. Additionally, I had no problem with the default layout(just throwing it out there that I mean the default setup was slightly awkward)As for the music, It is by no means the best, but it is pretty good for a game of its calibre.In general, so far it seems like a game I would recommend to most people(not the die-hard call of duty with controller only kind of people).P.S. As for the dissonant soundtrack I saw one review complain about, the change is gradual and reflects your proximity to the violinist.			"

												Smash bros with the asthetics of soul calibur via trine and, obviously, zeno clash. And there's roguelike and RPG elements because of the mandatory mechanics act of 2011.It's somewhat odd and doesn't go very far to explain its systems e.g. the back up characters and the capturing of enemies, (somewhat essential to have enough health to beat the bosses if you're inept at blocking like myself). The platforming is extremely forgiving once you master the double-jump, although later traps are sometimes borderline unavoidable. Leaping about is fairly secondary to the face-punching and AI-torturing.A controller is essential, in my opinion, especially for ranged attacks. I'm yet to play the co-op, but I expect it to be fairly cluster-funky.			"

												Reasons why i bought this game:1) Fun gameplay;2) Great fights / enemies;3) Beautiful visuals;4) Amazing soundtrack.Reasons why i stopped playing it (i think it could be improved without much trouble):1) Saving its quite difficult. You can get (find and buy) one or two saves if you are lucky, but sometimes you get none, in the entire game.Even if you get to save, it expires afer you use. So when you don't have anymore saves, and you die, game over, you have to start from the beggining of the game;2) When you die, you lose all your equipment, so if you bought a sweet 15k sword, you won't have it anymore after respawn;3) Playing coop is hard (messed up) because friendly fire can't be turned off.

												An interesting idea, but the controls are painfully awkward, and combat is incredibly stiff.  You move incredibly slowly and your attacks don't combo very well, which throws any sense of flow out the window.  The controls are especially annoying when it comes to platforming, because the game can be very picky about getting on platforms and climbing ledges, so getting around is quite annoying, even out of combat.The graphics are quite nice at least.  They remind me of Path of Exile, with a similar gritty style, and it works quite well.  It would take a lot more than that to save the game though.Overall, there were a few good ideas buried under technical incompetence.			"

It is a bit short, and after you reach a certain point it looses a bit of its replayability, but it hooks you in with a strange and flavorful atmosphere.

												DO NOT buy this game, especially for $15.00.  If you get it free, I would still recommend you don't waste your time like I did.  I got it in a bundle and still regret losing an hour and a half of my time.I loaded up with a friend and jumped right into co-op play, here is the bad:- You start with two characters.  The girl is okay the guy is an obnoxious character to play as.- The game doesn't really tell you anything or explain any of the game mechanics to you.- I am not really into the story of games, but if I was, this game has nothing of interest to offer.- You go down into the Abyss and as you go down you get gold and buy things from the shops on each floor.  Problem is you don't gain gold at a comparable rate to the item price in shops.  Considering you don't get to keep the items when you die, the system that is in place is atrocious at best.- Speaking of this, in co-op you don't share loot which makes gold gain even harder.- During the course of play, they have some weapons laying around for free on the map.  Most of the time it says ""not usable by the character you are playing"".  So, not very helpful.- When you play co-op, you have to be on the same screen at all times, so if I drop down a level, I can't see my character.  The camera follows the host.- Jumping in the game is bad.- The combat is extremely clunky, even with a controller.  For the most part, it feels like your just mashing buttons when fighting.- The AI is ridiculous at times.  It's like they anticipate everything you are doing.  I'll throw fireballs at enemies who are fighting my partner and they somehow dodge behind my partner at the last second every time and the fireball hits him.  They feel like they are teleporting all over the screen sometimes.  Sometimes they'll just hold the block button for what seems like forever.- Speaking of enemies, they have way too much health for just being common enemies.  I don't want to play a game where every enemy feels like an HP sponge.  If your fighting more than 3 at once, good luck not getting stun locked for half your health or more.- When we loaded up, my friend wanted to turn off friendly fire.  The game said something about not being able to access all areas if you turn it off, so we left it on.  Talk about a terrible experience.  With the combination of having to be on the same small screen, the terrible jumping, the clunky controls and the enemy AI being obnoxious, good luck not hitting your co-op partner for at least a third of their health in each fight.Here is the good:- The graphics.- The music.tl;dr If all you like in a game is graphics and music, get this game when it's in a bundle for a $1.00.  If you want to have fun, there are 100's of cheaper games that are far less frustrating.			"

												One of the most ""arty"" games in Steam. It is stylish, it is deep, it is replayable and overall is fun.While I would like to have a slowly slower pace and a slighly deeper combat system the game is amazing as it is. I just don't get why this game has almost 1/3 of negative reviews. The only downside I think of is that it could be more optimised, performance-wise. But it is a minor thing that I can cope with by lowering the resolution a little.Not a masterpiece, but better than good for sure. "

												Third review after patch 1.10My rating: 84/100I am glad to rewrite this review and finally give this game what it deserves. I do not know, what happened, but certainly, it all got better.Combat changed to challenging feature. System became innovative, creatures are skilled and force you to vary your attacks, so forget, you will beat a game with a single one combo. Some moves are illogical, but these are just simple details.Finally, save system works. You do not have to be afraid, that turning off the game will erase your progress. So, camp tokens are back in the game, it is worthy to buy one, because dying without them means you have to start from the beginning, which is the purpose of this feature.There are three locations to start, also with three characters to pick. Sabre wielded Katrien, using magic and fast attacks, more heavily equipped Ghost Monk, who takes the form of the souls caught within the Abyss, fighting mainly with double-handed sword. Last is Pincoya, fairy-like woman equipped with polearm. Each of the characters has a different approach to the game, another point, what assures that game will remain enjoyable and playable.Art is fantastic, chilean environment, their army from the nineteenth century, all depicted in Mucha's painting style.Soundtrack is also catchy, I may finally say, that this game is worthy of every cent spent. I am looking forward to another adventure searching for the route in the warlock's dream.You can find here some real and mythological beings, surely, changed as mighty mind twistes the world around. Just to mention Paganini, Verbum Dei and wise man, that gives wisdom for gold.Thank you, ACE team, for bringing this game to us and hearing us out. It was longer, than I desired, but in the end, I am satisfied. Recommended.			"

												Going to be pretty brief on this review, so it'll be in sections.Artwise: Abyss Odyssey is... well. Lovely to look at. I don't think anyone expected anything else. Though rather then the Fantasy-Punk vibe of Zeno Clash it is instead something of an Art Nouveau fever dream. Its distinctly late 19th century Chilean, and honestly that makes it feel almost as unique as ZenoClash. Simply because of the lack of well, games with that vibe.The Fighting: It is not bad. It is also not that great. It reminds me heavily of the old Squeenix brawlers like The Bouncer or Ergheiz (especially the adventure mode) The primary point that needs to be understood is you absolutely must cancel animations in a careful pattern to actually make combos.  There are moves with a certain number of hits, but chaining together moves and quickly dispatching enemies, or preventing yourself from being torn apart requires a different skillset then most fighting games do. It's kind of like Orb Walking in a MOBA. I enjoy it greatly, but I think it should be called a 'side-scrolling combo-brawler' over a 'fighting game'. The only flaw I see is it takes some getting used to to figure out how not to get stuck in animations, and some things feel unresponsive. (Turning isn't as bad as people say it is, but it COULD use some work. I imagine it'll be tweaked in the future.  I also have a feelong allot of the extremely negative reviews are from earlier builds as right now, it's quick.)The story: Small, compact, folklore rich and not particularly invasive. Its not some mesmerising story with a gripping narrative, but its a functional fairy-tale that conveys a rich and enthralling world. It takes multiple trips into the abyss to actually tell its tale.The Monster-Capture-thing: Gonna be honest, I am sad. SAD I SAY. I reeeaaaaally am a sucker for cute monsters, and would love to just be able to choose them at the start of the game after catching them. However, despite people's reviews, they're more then a damage sponge (an alternate pool of hitpoints, really) While they can serve that purpose, they've got interesting movesets with specific advantages. Some of these can be used to cheaply deal with certain enemies. (The mimic can absolutely trash a few for instance) While others are more all around useful and versatile or even allow better terrain navigation. (Pudutaur is incredibly mobile and has fantastic range on her melee)Finally. Pudu-Taur. Seriously. Pudutaur. That enough should sell the game. Don't know what a pudu is? Look it up. Pudutaur.Pudutaur.			"

												As the title says, this game is quite the odyssey. It's easy to get lost into this Chilean fantasy. The artwork is drop dead gorgeous, The game plays as a platformer beat 'em up with RPG and roguelike elements. The combat is pretty satisfying, featuring parries, dodge rolls, direction-based attacks and special abilities as well, though the controls aren't as tight as I would want them to be and enemies essentially reading your inputs in order to punish every mistake you make can get quite frustrating. The level design is randomly generated, and pickups are randomly placed as well which leads to a lot of replay value.Despite it's shortcomings, Abyss Odyssey is a very enjoyable game and definitely worth your time and money.

												First things first, this game is beautifully crafted. It is certainly one of the most visually appealing games I have played. I am typically not a fan of this style of metroidvania inspired game. Primarily because I am simply not very good at them and they become frustrating rather than fun fairly quickly. With this game I find that the story and visual appeal continue to draw me in. Even though I am not very good at the game, I continue to come back to it because I am curious to see what will happen next and what new environments will be revealed as I slowly progress into the abyss. I highly recommend this game. For those who like me, are not very adept at platforming hack and slash games a patient approach is well rewarded. For fans of metroid and castlevania, you do not want to miss this game. It is a stunning and amazingly deep experience.			"

I don't recommend this game for you.. this game needs some skills, juggling and timing. Similar feels on a fighting game when timing is everything to connect combos. But if you're into fighting games like smash bros.. this game is definitely a MUST!			"

												Reasons why i bought this game:1) Fun gameplay;2) Great fights / enemies;3) Beautiful visuals;4) Amazing soundtrack.Reasons why i stopped playing it (i think it could be improved without much trouble):1) Saving its quite difficult. You can get (find and buy) one or two saves if you are lucky, but sometimes you get none, in the entire game.Even if you get to save, it expires afer you use. So when you don't have anymore saves, and you die, game over, you have to start from the beggining of the game;2) When you die, you lose all your equipment, so if you bought a sweet 15k sword, you won't have it anymore after respawn;3) Playing coop is hard (messed up) because friendly fire can't be turned off.

												An interesting idea, but the controls are painfully awkward, and combat is incredibly stiff.  You move incredibly slowly and your attacks don't combo very well, which throws any sense of flow out the window.  The controls are especially annoying when it comes to platforming, because the game can be very picky about getting on platforms and climbing ledges, so getting around is quite annoying, even out of combat.The graphics are quite nice at least.  They remind me of Path of Exile, with a similar gritty style, and it works quite well.  It would take a lot more than that to save the game though.Overall, there were a few good ideas buried under technical incompetence.			"

												Yeah, this hit all the right buttons for me.Abyss Odyssey is a beat 'em up game with fighting game mechanics and loot grabbing - it has platform levels that change every playthrough, loaded with traps and secret rooms.Bad- controls are wonky. it's set up to attack left and you have to face right again and then press right to go in that direction. Some of the characters are limited because they are too big for an area or, in the case of the first soldier, cannot climb walls at certain heights. It's pretty flawed in these specific control problems. Most people cannot overlook this (thus the mixed Steam reviews) and I don't blame them.Good - but what shines in this game is the art, animation and design. The whole drips with polish and satisfying visuals in the art style of Art Nouveau masters like Mucha. The characters are strange and interesting with amazing movesets and fantastic animations - some of the pick-up enemies are more fun to play than the three main characters! The story is facinating Chilean myth with a bizarre twist that makes the mood eerie and one of a kind.Basically, if the controls were patched, this would be one of my favorite games, no doubt about it.

												I got Abyss as part of a humble bundle, but I got the bundle, in part, because I wanted a good game to play with my steam controller.  I am not very familiar with dungeon, rogue-like or brawler type games.  But I really like this game.  I haven’t quite beaten it but i’ve faced off with the final boss 3 times now.  ProsGood visual style, excellent art.  Another game proving that video games are a legitimate media-art form.  Controls seem fluid, easy to use.Interesting setting and story.The game is really unique and interestingThe three paths system of difficulty seems like a great system.ConsI don’t like that I lose my items when I die.  I know this is “rogue-like” but I wish there was a little more character progression.I wish the texture res was higher, OR that there was better texture filtering.  My characters have jaggies around them.Your incentivised to play as your backup garud character when you enter the final chamber as your main character will then be resurrected with full health.  There seem to be 3 different weapon classes and as such I cannot pick up weapons that are hard-won 2/3rds of the time. "

												Nice blend of roguelike, platformer and beatemup genres. You are able to capture defeated enemies' souls and play as those creatures yourself switching between them and your main char on the go giving you immense tactical possibilities.  Yes, ALL of the enemies in the game have a full arsenal of standard, forward, high, low, jump etc attacks in both fast+weak and slow+strong variations. Dashes, grabs, rolls, blinks, magic projectiles, spinning AOE and vomiting poison make combat both varied and challenging. Unfortunately, all this gorgeousness comes at a price: instead of Metroidvania-styled gameplay Abyss Odyssey is way too much linear and kinda lacks other content. The whole game is just a succession of randomly-generated beutiful 'biome' arenas that consist of a single vertically-oriented long corridor with a few dead end branches that have loot in them. More often than not when you reach a predetermined point in the arena enemies just spawn offscreen and you are locked in a small 1-2 screen sized battleground until you defeat them or die trying sorta JRPG-style. Apart from that and a handful of NPCs that train you or sell you stuff there is nothing to interact with. Don't get me wrong, Streets of Rage+Megaman roguelike is a welcome thing, but i'd prefer a +5-10$ in a price tag and a bit more content to deepen gameplay a bit (DLC maybe?).As for drawbacks, kb+mouse controls were a bit clunky, but now devs seem to have fixed everything and I was able to beat the game fwo times out of three tries while I haven't been able to beat it even once before due to unresponsive controls so I got rekt in harder levels because of slow character response. Also devs got a tiny bit lazy and out of a few dozens of enemy types (ALL PLAYABLE!) a couple are just a reskinned or posessed versions of your own characters, doubling as minibosses every now and then, but there is a good variation of unique bosses too though so it's not that bad.All in all a nice game i'd recommend.

												TLDR: Very short game (4hrs or less) with great astetics and premise but an end result that is not worth the price. Consider only  if it is on sale by 75% or more, you like linear dungeon crawlers and  ONLY  if you own a controller. Otherwise stay clear.Full review:First of all, no, this is not a non recommendation due to the controls as it seems to be the case for a lot of other Steam reviews for this game. I actually found the controls to be pretty good and easy to learn ON A CONTROLLER (do NOT play this game otherwise, it IS a nightmare to play using the keyboard).Gameplay is pretty interesting, mainly thanks to the movement and attack controls which make even the very first enemies you encounter a decent challenge. However it can also get a bit too repetitive when most of the enemies follow a very similar pattern and you can even do the same tactics to defeat them, even to the point where you can stun-lock them on endless grab-throw moves (""final boss"" included).I really love the asthetics and theme of this game, the artwork and spine-chill lovely music really gave me the good old Castlevania vibes. Even the voice acting feels like top quality with its few dialogues (that guitar playing skelleton chilling = GG). The big negative point why I cant really recommend this game, is the fact it is very, VERY short. Barely 4 hours in, as a below average skill player and I already cleared the 3 entrances to the Abyss, unlocked the 3 playable characters and gathered pretty much all of the ""journal pages"". There is nothing left to do other than probably try get a couple achievements if I was ever interested on those.Another letdown is that while the game presents you with what could be a very complex and interesting developing story about the origin of the abyss and of the characters you play as, it ends up being mostly told on the previously mentioned journal texts you can find after killing enemies and from what little dialogue there is each time you reach the Warlock. You kill the final boss and what do you get?  a pretty background and a ""Yay, you did it! But guess what? the Warlock is still alive! Play again!"" kind of message.  Nothing more, regardless of how many times you do it.If you see this game super cheap (75% discount or so), you feel like playing a very linear dungeon crawler and you own a controller, I'd say go for it and give it a try not expecting much, I had fun playing it but its flaws really outweight the good stuff unfortunately and at this price, there are a lot of far better games out there.

I play on windows 8 and there is certainly some problems with the fluidity on my machine and 1024x768 screen though this last time I tried it seemed a bit better I don't know why. I think it's certainly a good game otherwise but can't appreciate it. Maybe I'm not good with PC to know how to adjust the settings. I also probably need help of other players to get how to play it better.			"

Someone please tell me how a Alienware 14 with updated everything, unessasary programs closed and every thing possible turned off to up my fps. Wanna know what fps I have.......5-7 fps at all times. If someone can explain this too me I will change my review, but as of now I don't even want to talk about this game.			"

												I really loved the idea of having a 2d rogue-like beat'em up, but the game *feels* really sluggish: the animation is really fluid, but hitframes are very hard to manage and turning is just weird (and slow), it feels like fighting in water or underwater even. On the other hand the art style is nice, the art nouveau stills are beautiful - but as a dungeon crawler beat'em up this is a no-no, at least for me.			"

												I dislike this game very much.  The controls are very slow and unresponsive resulting in 6 hit combo's MAX (common is 2 hit combo).  Once you get hit by an opponent there is very slim chance for recovery.  If this game was more responsive I would enjoy it much more.  Also there isn't any real intro to the story line, or any real guide for the best way to make it through the game.   It feels like the designers were more into the look of the game rather then the feel of the game.  Do not waste your money on this game, as it is not worth it!			"

												Why hello there friend. Say, do you enjoy ATLUS games? Do you enjoy roguelikes? Well how about fighting games, surely you enjoy those. If the answer to any or all of these questions was a resounding yes then I have some great news for you! Abyss Odyssey is a game which manages to combine all of those things into one complete package - and then some!This game has beautiful visuals, strong atmosphere and easy to get into yet hard to master gameplay. The combat has more in common with a fighting game than a simple side scrolling action RPG, there are several quick button combos and cancels that can be performed across each character giving all of the heroes (of which there are 3) a unique feel. The core game mechanic is that of the roguelike, you will enter into the randomly generated abyss and proceed up ways and down ways and sideways and the like, each section offering new peril and new reward. If you enjoy games that have a dark yet almost serene atmosphere about them I would say this is definitely one to pick up, the game does a great job with its varying environment types within the abyss and the subtle musical accompaniments contribute to that package.Like most roguelikes you can expect there to be a bit of a difficulty curve, items and levels will always be lost on death but your wealth will remain with you to make your next decent a bit easier. If you are on the fence about this one but you enjoy any of the things I mentioned above I would say go ahead and pick it up, it's worth it!			"

												It feels like a clone of the Smash Brothers Subspace Emissary campaign, which is a good thing.  I think people go in expecting a SOTN feel, but are disappointed when the characters aren't as fast and light as Alucard is.You gotta keep on your toes, or even random enemies will wreck you.One of my favorite things about this game is when you die, you're replaced by a human soldier who's weaker than your main character, but if you make it to a shrine you'll get your main back.The art is also awesome; it's a dark style that's not afraid to use color!

												Cool game. Super hard on nightmare mode. I think they should mention more about it being roguelike and dying being part of the game(meaning you gain gold and level skills as you progress and put more time into it regardless of being alive). Pretty graphics. The controls are hard at the beginning and a bit counter intuitive but they make since once you get around that.			"

												I'm gonna sit on the fence for this game. It has fairly good graphics, but the responsiveness of the character is a little questionable, as double jumps sometimes just does not work properly.It is still worth a few hours of fun, as you explore a rogue-like game with really fancy graphics.Note that progress will seem really slow and you die a lot.I wish there is more detais on how much progress I made each time I travelled down the abyss....  frequently, I am left frustrated, cos my last trip down the abyss felt like a total waste of my time.

												(I played on a controller, so I can't vouch for how the game plays with keyboard.)Abyss Odyssey has some pretty clever ideas and is a pretty fun 2D brawler after some adjustment. Most of the problems I have with it are related to the co-op. First, the netcode is just bad. When you're not the host be prepared for assets to not load in properly or at all, rubberbanding, and occassional gamebreaking desyncs (for instance my coop partner once just had a black screen and couldn't move, while on my screen they were standing in midair between platforms).  Second friendly fire being the default in co-op, just do yourselves a favor if you play this game co-op and don't turn friendly fire on. The menu argues the game is ""balanced"" for it, but the game is really plenty punishing without your partner stabbing you in the back, and sitting in your side of the arena waiting for an enemy to break off from your partner so you can safely attack them is pretty lame. Additionally, the enemies don't have friendly fire and can freely stack up and overwhelm you, and more of them spawn in the cooperative mode.There are also a lot of cheap shots in this game. You'll drop into a pit and a waiting enemy will attack you before you can even see what's happening, or you'll hit a trap. Enemies will spawn right on top of you immediately whipping out punishment. It's not terrible when you're prepared for it, but still bleh.As a single player game it's pretty well balanced and fun. I really enjoy the simple ""smash bros"" emulating controls, although the game does lack the polish and nuance of smash I still respect that direction. The art is pretty great, although attack animations are sometimes a bit wonky. Ultimately, if 2D Brawlers aren't your standard fare there are better ones to try first, but if it's a favored genre then Abyss Odyssey is certainly worth a look.			"

												Would like to preface this by saying I could see this being enjoyable for people into this kind of game but it just wasn't for me.Pros:I really enjoy the art style of this game.Atmosphere is nice as well the rooms can change pretty drastically.Interesting set up with dungeon rooms varying in difficulty, it lets you take a quick way down through alot of hard rooms or plan a longer way that may hit easy/medium rooms more often.The soul collection for an extra life and skill set is a neat mechanic.Cons:Repeatative in every way, aside from collecting souls there are only 3 characters and the soldiers you become when you die. The game is basically running the same yet different (Randomly rearranged) dungeon over and over.The leveling is pointless really, it's simply a gate on which souls you can capture.Really doesn't feel like there's much of an end goal to it, since winning just lets you start again and dying starts you again. I haven't managed to win yet but I'd assume you'd get to keep your weapons in that case. Losing your weapons on death makes sense for some difficulty but also ruins any feeling of progression you achieved.Ranged attacks are almost useless since the AI is godly at dodging them, they can be used to bait them in but rarely for damage, in my noob opinion.Ultimately I bought the game for it's style which I still enjoy but the game just isn't enjoyable enough for me to play that much. But if you're curious I'd suggest watching some gameplay videos to see how it looks to you.			"

												It has a cool Artstyle and can be fun at start but it gets boring very fast.Sure you can do nice combos with a bit of practice, but why if you can beat the game simply buttonmashing ?There are about 4 different kind of stages and maybe a dozen different enemys. After you beat the game (took me about 4 hours) the only thing you can do is unlock new charakters and try to beat the final boss again...Sorry not enough variety for me			"

												What do you say about this game? I could tell you that the art style is gorgeous, evoking equal parts the saturated fantastical gloss of Trine and dreamworld fantasy with beautiful, clean Art Noveau.I could tell you that, mechanically, it's Smash Bros. meets a Roguelite.I could also tell you that there are technical flaws which harm the game in many ways, that the game is mostly balanced for playing alone and thus making the co-op modes nearly superfluous, not even counting the great technical flaws in the online co-op.In the end I will say that it is possible to get used to the technical flaws and that there is a great charm in playing what is essentially Smash Bros. with a stamina-based cancelling mechanic in a simple, Roguelite map with fantastic art and presentation. It starts out hard, but gets easier as you get used to the mechanics. If it still doesn't feel quite there, try disabling the V-sync in the options; for some reason, this helps the responsiveness even with a gamepad.			"

												An interesting idea, but the controls are painfully awkward, and combat is incredibly stiff.  You move incredibly slowly and your attacks don't combo very well, which throws any sense of flow out the window.  The controls are especially annoying when it comes to platforming, because the game can be very picky about getting on platforms and climbing ledges, so getting around is quite annoying, even out of combat.The graphics are quite nice at least.  They remind me of Path of Exile, with a similar gritty style, and it works quite well.  It would take a lot more than that to save the game though.Overall, there were a few good ideas buried under technical incompetence.			"

												Smash Bros meets dungeon roguelike.Tho not exactly.  Abyss Odyssey brings a very dark but vague experience.  There's not much in the way of story or background, and it's a pretty straightforward dungeon crawl.The game is also incredibly challenging.  If you are frustrated easily or can't stand games you can't beat, this is not for you.  Multiplayer coop introduces friendly fire (which can be turned off at a consequence to progression), meaning you have to fight smart with your teammates instead of just hack and slash every damn thing like it was Diablo 3.I'd recommend this game to anyone who has a good solid team of friends who aren't discouraged easily.

												Jogo bem legal, gostei bastante. Apesar de parecer um jogo de plataforma comum, ele oferece mais coisas do que aparenta. Os combates são um pouco chatos pra pegar a manha mas depois que vc aprende, o jogo fica bem divertido. Vc deve aprender os padrões de golpe do inimigo pra então planejar o seu ataque e acredito que esse seja o principal motivo de tanta gente não ter curtido muito o jogo. Não adianta vc ficar apertando freneticamente o botão do controle esperando atingir o inimigo o máximo de vezes possível. Se vc jogar assim, não vai conseguir chegar muito longe e vai acabar se frustrando. O combate é o que na minha opinião tornou esse jogo bem divertido. Não chega a ser aquela coisa apelona do dark souls hehe, mas bem de leve lembra um pouco, pelo fato de vc ter que calcular os movimentos dos inimigos e quando vc deve o atacar.As fases são geradas aleatoriamente, por isso cada vez que vc morre, volta ao começo. O objetivo do jogo é passar pelas diversas cavernas até chegar no chefão final. Quando o personagem morre, vc mantém o progresso dele e também o dinheiro coletado. Nessa estrutura das cavernas, existem 3 níveis, fácil, médio e difícil. O padrão de dificuldade também é aleatório, vc pode tanto ir por uma trilha só com cavernas de dificuldade fácil ou logo de cara ter que passar por uma com a dificuldade difícil.No começo é meio difícil pq como as fases e dificuldades são geradas aleatoriamente, vc já de cara pode ter que enfrentar 2 fases da maior dificuldade, e nisso vc vai penar pra passar por que seu personagem está ainda fraco. Mas ao longo do jogo e à medida que o personagem subir de nível e ganha novas habilidades, juntamente com o fato de que vc provavelmente irá controlar melhor o personagem por ir pegando a manha dos combates, o jogo fica bem mais tranquilo. Quando eu cheguei mais ou menos no nível 10, já consegui chegar na penúltima caverna antes do chefão final sem morrer nenhuma vez.A trilha sonora do jogo é bem legal, casou bem com a atmosfera das fases. Os gráficos são ok, nada muito extraordinário mas também longe de serem ruins. O ponto forte é pra paisagem das fases, que são bem desenhadas e o design dos inimigos, que é bem psicodélico. Eles até me lembraram os inimigos do jogo Zeno Clash, que foi feito por essa mesma produtora.O único ponto fraco do jogo é o controle, que poderia ser mais preciso. As vezes os comandos não saem e isso frustra um pouco, mas nada que chegue a tirar a diversão do jogo. No mais, eu recomendaria esse jogo pra quem gosta desse estilo em plataforma e também goste de jogos mais difíceis e desafiadores. Se vc procura um jogo desse estilo porém que seja mais casual e mais simples, eu recomendaria procurar outras opções. Acho que esse jogo é meio 8 ou 80, ou vc vai gostar muito ou de cara já vai odiar e deixar ele de lado.			"

												Just got this game...And because of the mixed reviews, I'd thought I would leave this review in favor of the developers.At first, it looked a ""little dark"" but the art was amazing and what really turned me on to it was it's ""Inception-like"" concept of going deeper and deeper into someone's dreams.So--the plot begins when a giant hole in the ground opens up to reveal a deep cave termed ""the abyss,"" someplace in Chile. This ""abyss"" releases these imaginary monsters that the soldiers (or the people for that matter) can't handle or hope to fight against.This is where you, the player, comes in, as the hero Katrien, an unexplainably attractive swordswoman with a strong will, long red-hair (maybe that explains it) and a mission to stop this horrifying but random event from continuing.The intriguing part of this plot is the fact that every being ascending from the abyss, the main character Katrien, as well as the abyss itself are all just products of the dreams, thoughts, and memories of a supposed ""sleeping warlock"" who lies underground, at the bottom of the abyss. And this is where the plot itself runs hand-in-hand with the rogue-like gameplay of this title.Because everything is IMAGINERY -- When your character dies (and the soldier that tries to revive your character), you just spawn back to the beginning to try again and again--retaining only your level and gold with each playthrough. On top of that, things that don't exist pop up and beat you in ways that don't quite make sense sometimes (either that or it can be credited to a lack of skill either way--it sucks dying).Because everything is a DREAM -- The dungeons are procedurally generated--which translates to the abyss appearing differently each time you venture into it. Furthermore, it's not just the scenery that changes, but the pathways that you take, as well as the difficulty of each section of the dungeon changes as well--just like a dream would. It's also good to note that the variations of the abyss don't always appear to be inside of a cave--this makes for some pretty interesting visuals during each trek.The combat system is NOT a ""clone"" of Super Smash Bros. (despite some negatively making a comparison of the two games) but being a Super Smash Bros. fan myself--I could definitely see how the developers were influenced and inspired by the title's combat. The characters controls are similar which makes for simple but strategic battles. One thing that you'll notice when first starting is that the controls seem extremely stiff--but after playing and getting the hang of it--you'll soon realize that they're not REALLY stiff but that they are actually extremely tight.Now, there are a couple of things I don't want to leave without mentioning--One--is the fact that Katrien isn't the only playable character in the game. There are 2 other main characters that are unlockable in the game--The Ghost Monk (which you will probably unlock first) and Pincoya. On top of that, when your character's mana bar fills up, you're able to (sort of) ""capture"" pretty much anything you face in the abyss so that you can become whatever it is you want (insert pause). And of course, I can't forget to mention the weak and clunky soldier guy that you have to control after dying with your main character--it sucks but really it's just best to think of him as a ""place-holder to a second chance shot at going further."" On top of that--I want to mention the artstyle of the game. This game is beautiful. It's like turning a museum into your playground and because of this artstyle--I can't help but say that this game is like staring at your most horrid nightmares and falling in love with them all at the same time. And no matter what, every time you head into the abyss for another playthrough, there's always this sense of adventure that takes hold because the game is so well designed in the way of making you, as the player, feel as if you really don't know what to expect once you're in there.This game is unique and honestly, my playthrough(s) of this game has really brought me back to the time I first played the Vanillaware title ""Muramasa"" on the Wii and that's a REALLY good thing.I wanna see more games like this.- Last BeNeVoLeNcE			"

												Everything in this game is nice but the ♥♥♥♥ing GAMEPLAY IS SSOOOO BBAADD you can't attack correcly and each fight you will lose the half of you life because the computer know badass move but you have dumb move with no combo and can't place an attack correctly. Seriously AVOID this game only because of the gameplay. (In the video the game look so nice but when you play it OMG....)Graphic and Art 8/10Gameplay 1/10Sound 7/10Voice Acting 9/10Soundtrack 5/10Overall 4/10			"

												Abyss Odyssey has a unique and fascinating aesthetic that pulls from art nouveau, symphonic metal, and Chilean folk tales.  I absolutely love it!  The gameplay is somewhere in between super smash brothers and rogue legacy, and that is meant as the highest compliment.  Deep, 2-button combat is used to fight through randomized dungeons.  It completely baffles me why steam says this game has mixed reviews, it is a real gem!			"

												Pros:-Beautiful art-Awesome soundtrack-Great concept-Interesting storyCons:-Awkward combat and movement mechanics (very still movement, blocking, dodging, and countering is often pointless)-Restrictive offensive and defensive capabilities-Some important items are lost on first death (You die, but have a chance to revive your character before losing the run)-90% of equipment you find wont be useable (and even if it is, the effect boosting rings are useless 70% of the time)-Mostly about grinding experience until you have enough HP to do anything-Monster difficulty scaling is very steep-The best way to combat enemies is to abuse their AI, spam ranged attack while hiding behind a soldier, or memorize the perfect position to hit enemies into the air against a wall so you can juggle them until they die			"

												Quite Fun But Very Challenging!Just tried this game out on a whim and it is actually quite fun.  Surprisingly it is a 2d random map sidescroller that plays quite a bit like super smash brothers!  As a fighting game fan I actually notice quite a few things you normally don't need to worry about in games EXCEPT for a fighting game (Armor, cancelling, frames etc.)  I have logged 9 hours so far but am still really liking it.  Something kind of trippy about venturing into the encarnation of a mad warlock's dreams and the whole game feels surreal.  I would recommend it but be patient.  The game is quite difficult and takes some studying to be effective.  Even once you get it you will still have some hard times decending into the depths.			"

												All in all, I would recomend to play this game, but only during free to play occasion, or if you're able to buy it with a great discount.Pros: great graphical design of all the stuff that is not actual gameplay: dialogues, character selection screen, stuff like that. It is designed after art-deco style, which was very popular in Europe in the beginnig of XX century, that kind of graphics is great, as for me =)Cons: enemies are pretty much the same, except for bosses;- difficulty is very different on bosses and during all other time;- game sometimes crashes, and continuing works... pretty strange, e. g. I was unable to finish prologue, since I started it, then left, and when I continued game, I was already past that part;- controls are a bit clumsy (or is it a feature, don't know), playing with keyboard is pretty hard;- and the game is pretty demanding on your hardware, it's slow, although not that beautiful to justify that kind of slowness.A game for very limited time to enjoy, I would say.

I love the music, I love the concept.But the controls are just... they're so off and difficult to use it's almost unplayable for me. Just oodles of frustration to do basic things like a little bit of platforming up and down or actually aiming yourself at an enemy to make your attacks.I really want to but I just can't, not until the controls are tightened up a bit, made a little less awkward and more responsive.

People are always complaining about controls and the character feeling too heavy but honestly, it gives me a challenge and i am always one of those people who will try and try till get to the end :Dhopefully some people agree. its quite strange that i like this too, i dont really enjoy games that are side-scrolling like rayman origins but this one has abit of everything! story,  graphics, voice acting... i love it			"

												Just throwing this into the arena:Pros:+Graphics+Music+StyleCons:-Controls--You fall like a rock from the peak of your jump, no hang time--The fighting game comparisons are because you can't turn around in the air when double-jumping--Almost entirely useless wall sliding mechanic--Painfully overcomplicated control scheme.-Flimsy attack animations that looks like you're waving a feather-Everything is awkwardly and stiffly animated-The guitar skeleton playing a tune that hurts your ears when on top of the good normal background musicThe game explains minimal information even in the how-to-play menu and feels like there's more to it that isn't worth look for with how weird the controls are.Almost a good game, but it needs an huge overhaul.

												Im 42 years old. This game is the first platform game I have had fun with since Metroid.The fighting is the same as the old karate Champ on the Commodore 64. Button plus a direction is a fight move. No stupid buton combos, just plain and simple fighting. Push a direstion and hit the attack button to preform the various moces.Trine comes to mind as far as the artwork.... Not as nice as Trine's artwork, but it makes up for it, with its own style and character.  It is sort of Drab, dark, and grey... They really should have boosted the saturation a little bit i a few key areas.Anyway, this is a 10/10 from me.			"

												Argghhh.... That game... it's great and annoying at the same time. The thing about ACE team (the creators of the game), is that they make games with HUGEEEEE potential, yet they fall when it comes to gameplay and basic things. theoretically, their are games are AMAZING, but when it comes to the actual gameplay, you realize that they had a great plan that has gone to waste (same with Zeno Clash sadly).Abyss Odyssey is an awesome challenging game, that falls down when it comes to the combat and momvment. the combat is really repetive and boring, as you spam pretty much everything, while trying to doge and avoid pretty much everything.On the other hand, the art style, the music and the voice acting (yeah, thats right, unlike the voice acting in Zeno Clash - the voice acting in Abyss Odyssey is actually pretty good!) are all awesome, it's just that the combat is really frustrating.Well, the bottom line is - a great game, with huge potential (just as Zeno Clash has huge potential), but somthing went horribly worng along the way. meh, such a shame.

												What is it? It's exactly as advertised, a metroidvania, rogue-like, beat-em up from the makers of Rock of Ages and Xeno Clash. Story: Some good material but holy ♥♥♥♥ that ending was so it was a ♥♥♥♥ing disgrace of an endingGameplay: Felt alot like smash bros. But you can play as the enemies and unlock them for versus and training by using the hero special or completing the initial challenge of a room marked with a ? on the map.Controls: Being ported from a console, well they work but the initial controls are bad, adjust to your heart's content. Muh Graphix: It's made in Unreal but it's pretty good imoThe Multiplayer: Deader than dead, I'm pretty sure the only life in this game atm is from the free weekend. There is ""local"" play but I think it only applies to the 2nd person inside your houseDuration: It's as long as you want it to be but I'd say for someone of the highest skill ceiling in this game to take around 2-3 hours for one go with no or 1 death(s)OST: It's alright but it's not the selling point of this gameReasons to call it♥♥♥♥♥♥(the negatives): The platforming isn't refined making getting to a point higher than you a bit of finesse.There's some flying ethereal mexican throwing horchata at me rarely.Guillotines are imbaAlt Tabbing doesnt work at all♥♥♥♥ I'm running out of reasonsI rate this game a 7/10A smashfag may enjoy it "

												This is a dungeon crawler grinder and I haven't been so frustrated with a game in a long time. The way the game is, you really need to weigh the importance of your options and decisions. When you die, the game punishes you: you drop all of your items (including your weapon), and have to start over in the dungeon (the abyss), unless you use a camp token, which will allow you to respawn at a marked camp. However, camp tokens are expensive (I think the cheapest is 4,000 or so gold), and all of your items and your weapon will be gone. Which means any gold you spent on those items is wasted. Luckily, you get to keep the gold you earn, so I recommend grinding to level up your character to at least level 35 and to have a good 40,000-50,000 gold.At times, the platforming is atrocious, which I think is more so the fault of the controls. The way the keyboard controls are is annoying. The controls aren't really explained, if not cryptic, I accidentally skipped the prologue and have no way to go back to it unless I restart the entire game (I think). Sometimes the controls get...confused? I'm not sure how to describe it, but I'll try to jump down, but instead jump up. Sometimes double jumping is a chore.I didn't figure out how to Soul Capture (which is holding down your normal attack button and your special attack button at the same time i.e. left and right mouse buttons) until I was level 40 and about 10 hours into the game.Battles can get repetitive and annoying. I think it would be nice to see the level of your enemies, as opposed to having to guess and then get killed and have to start all over. ESPECIALLY when it comes to Soul Capture-you cannot capture the soul of an enemy unless you are of an equal or greater level.The inventory and menus can be annoying to navigate as well.I think what really kept me going was the art. The character models, particularly the enemies, are very nice and modelled very well. The backgrounds and environments were also very well-put together artistically and the art direction in this game is solid. The consistency in the style and tone is quite nice, and the blend of Chilean culture and art nuveau was an interesting but overall good combination.I did have a good laugh though-the mummy enemy design is directly based off a Harry Clarke illustration for the Edgar Allan Poe story, ""Fall of the House of Usher"". The demon Paganini is also based off a real person, Niccolo Paganini, and they were pretty accurate with his physical depiction (MUTTON CHOPS) although I feel the evil bad demon man cliche they have for him makes him an obnoxious character.I think the developers were more focused on the art and story, and the gameplay suffers from it. It's not unplayable, persay, but there are a lot of small annoying issues that test your patience as a player. Overall, I think it's a relatively solid game that just needs more work on the gameplay mechanics, less vagueness on controls and maybe a bit more gameplay variety as well. I think the difficulty also really alientates and limits the games' audience.If you can get past the flaws and issues, it's a nice game. Not amazing, but also not bad.			"

												I'll admit, it takes a long time to get a good grasp on the controls, timing, and even gameplay mechanics, but this game is really fun and worth it. Currently one of my favorite games.If you ever got good at Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, you'll get the hang of this. There are more moves and characters to unlock and you can slightly customize the special moves with higher levels. There are moves you might not realize you can do until you do them on accident.I have a couple of tips: 1) If the enemy blocks a lot, walk up and throw them. It's the B button on a 360 controller. Just get really vicious and relentless. You can even air throw with the monk so that's my favorite. Besides that it looks bad♥♥♥♥♥ Even when you die, you continue and keep what you've unlocked. You have to start back a ways but you can chose different paths to different areas. And fighting your way back is even more fun the next time - especially because you'll have gotten better at the game and have more allies you can control and fight with. Other parts of the world become more easily accessible. It starts getting really fun so why give up? It's very challenging but not frustrating. The computer AI is no chump, and that's a good thing. Sometimes they thrash you and sometimes you thrash them. But you learn and they don't. :p			"

The recursive dream logic sets the stage for a colorful world featuring rogue like mechanics as the player dives down to the source of the nightmares plaguing the world.Combat is regrettably bogged down by the inability to interrupt animations.  This commitment to a risk/reward for combat actions is understandable but it results in inputs being ignored that will ultimately frustrated many players when the game feels unresponsive.			"

												Save your money, don't buy this game.Negatives:-Got this game to play with friends. It is not fun to play with friends. -Upgrades do not carry over, so they are basically a waste of in-game currency.-Only one of you can pick up the items that drop (that includes in-came currency).-Manaless characters can pick up mana balls.-The controls are wonky on keyboard and mouse.Positives:-The character design is pretty.-Graphics are nice to look at.-Soundtrack is pleasant.-Levels were unique.Overall, probably would have been enjoyed it more if I was able to keep the upgrades I purchased between each playthrough.

												It's a beautiful game by all means of the word. The combat is very nice.  You need to be less button smashing in nightmare difficulty as it's really hard and you need good timing to fend off the enemies.Was expecting it to be longer though because as you get used to the combat it becomes easier until you can, eventually,  go at it in one go from surface to the place where the dreamer sleeps.

												This game is a very weird game, and I like it.A very nice game with some RPG elements, I really had fun in my 9 hours of playing this game all though the content of this game wouldn't take you more than 3 hours to see everything (1 or 2 hours for hardcore gamers).This game is creative, something fresh, it has a lot of cool concepts and ideas, for instance, you can almost play as any enemy in this game each with their own unique special moves and character, also it goes for less but harder enemies’ style, and the art style is awesome, the music is nice too.The game has a lot of flaws as well to be honest, for example there is really a considerable lack of content here, and the length of this game is very unsatisfying, the end is unsatisfying and it's too zoomed out, it would look better if the camera was closer.Anyway, the game is worth full price in my opinion, all though it's preferable if you can get some kind of discount on it, I recommend this game, and I give it a solid 7 out of 10 in my book.

												Its definitely worth a try. The combat system leaves a bit to be desired... you can have enemies on either side of you and if you want to switch direction to fight the other enemy you have to stop fighting and turn around which does not happen instantly. For me this is annoying because it removed the feel of fluidity from the fight. Played it with a friend which was fun   for sure... but we both noticed a huge lack of opportunities to regain any health after combat from slain enemies or smashing containers. Also we did not like how you have to PAY for your checkpoints with coins, and not just a few coins either. I've never in my life seen a game that required payment for a much needed checkpoint. Another big annoyance was loosing all your weapons and powerups that you payed a bunch of coins for when you die. After a couple instances of that we just stopped buying anything except for health vials.All b-itching aside this game is very interesting and colorful. The music is very groovy. And there really is a lot of potential here. But that combat system (in my opinion) could use some tweaking. If nothing else being able to change directions while fighting would be a serious improvement.			"

												To start off, this is a good roguelike game. Hard for me to tell whether I will live or die based on the difficulty on the room I enter next, which is the fun. The game keeps you guessing which helps breathe life into the repition of dungeon grinding. The vendors usually have good stuff to buy to help you along, but rarely have I enough to buy any items. The gameplay reminds me of Spelunky, which is good, but has cool medieval vibes I love. Most of the characters are charming or interesting, but not much to them other than that.			"
