Soul Reaver 2""This is the sublime moment of our undoing, Raziel - the ineffable fulcrum upon which swings the entirety of our history. This is where all of Nosgoth is betrayed."" ~KainThis game is the third entry of the Legacy of Kain series. Second, if you don't include Blood Omen 1 as that was made by other people technically, but the rest of the Legacy of Kain series was built right off of that game.  Also, I feel this is quite obvious but will post a warning all the same, this review will most likely spoil the first Soul Reaver game. After all, Soul Reaver 2 picks up literally right where Soul Reaver 1 left off, converting the final dialogue between Raziel and Kain of 1 into 2's CGI prologue scene. Kain escapes Raziel's reach by using the time streaming chamber to escape to a much less desolated version of Nosgoth in the past. But Raziel, still the faithful servant of the being only known as the Elder God who ordered him to assassinate Kain at the very beginning of Soul Reaver 1, follows him into the portal fearlessly armed with the Wraith Blade. And then, he meets Moebius. Moebius is a more than dubious character, one which Raziel is rightly suspicious of. Moebius, similar to Raziel's master, the Elder God, pushes him towards executing Kain.It doesn't take long for Raziel to gain the ire of both of them. As Raziel encounters the Kain that fled from him not too long after meeting Moebius at the Pillars of Nosgoth and does not kill him. Instead, Kain asks him to witness this pivotal moment of Nosgoth's history: the Corruption of the Pillars. After all, they walk in the first Blood Omen's era, about 30 years before Kain is presented with the choice he is given at the end of the first Blood Omen. Either die as the last vampire and thus bring about the extinction of his race, or allow the pillars to begin to collapse entirely, bringing about the apocalyptic version of Nosgoth you travel through in the first Soul Reaver. Kains tell Raziel to unearth his destiny, and then leaves. And thus, in Soul Reaver 2, you are no longer chasing Kain to assassinate him as Moebius and the Elder God seem so determined, but instead, travel through Nosgoth in several different eras, learning more about your past as a human, the Soul Reaver, and your destiny. There's quite a bit of time traveling in store for you, keep in mind this advice: ""History abhors a paradox.""Following in Soul Reaver 1's foosteps, Soul Reaver 2 is another action adventure game. The combat and graphics have obviously been improved quite a bit. However, as I said in my Soul Reaver 1 review, it's important to have reasonable expectations. I had less issues with Soul Reaver 2 than I did with Soul Reaver 1, less flickering textures, I could use a 360 controller without installing a program such as Xpadder or something. Still, even Soul Reaver 2 is still almost like fourteen years old. I did have a few crashes, lessso than Soul Reaver 1, but unlike in Soul Reaver 1, you cannot just save anywhere. So if it does crash before you can save, you probably will have to repeat things you've already done. Also, I cannot verify if it'll work on Windows 8 or anything like that. Personally, I played on Windows 7 and it was fine.The combat has been updated from Soul Reaver 1 and is in general different. In Soul Reaver 1, often, you found yourself doing your damndest to avoid getting hit because that mean you would lose the Wraith Blade, and if that happened, you would have to either throw your enemy into a fire, pool of water, or into the sunlight to kill them because after all, the majority of enemies in the game were vampiric. In Soul Reaver 2, the most common enemy you'll be fighting will be the Sarafan (humans), these weird creatures made of darkness that appear in parts, and hellish demons that will actually follow you into the Spirit Realm if they knock you into that (that's right, they added enemies actually capable of removing the ""no stakes"" element of the Spirit Realm). Additionally, while the Wraith Blade still works the way it did in Soul Reaver 1 for a bit in the beginning of Soul Reaver 2 (you keep the wraith blade until you get hit), not long into the prologue, the rules are changed when the Wraith Blade actually meets the past version of itself, the Soul Reaver. The Wraith Blade actually gains a will of its own. The Wraith Blade had always been a soul consuming spirit bound to Raziel and before then, trapped in the Soul Reaver itself, but now it was fully awake. Basically, what this means is, you won't lose the Wraith Blade anymore if you get hurt, but the more you use it, the more a little a ring will fill around your health. If it becomes full, I believe your health will actually begin to drop, although, I'm not too sure. To be honest, I was always mindful of how much I used the Wraith Blade because of this. Plus, I also just used the other weapons you could get from Sarafan and the sort.The Spirit Realm remains in Soul Reaver 2, and to be honest, while it's still cool in Soul Reaver 2, I preferred the way it looked in Soul Reaver 1. You maintain most of the abilities you gained from killing your vampiric brothers in Soul Reaver 1, such as phasing through barred barriers and certain doors in the Spirit Realm, climbing certain walls in the Material Realm, actually being able to swim without being immediately sent to the Spirit Realm/basically falling apart (you're essentially a walking corpse after all)... and etc. Where as in Soul Reaver 1 your goal was to kill off your vampiric brothers and then kill Kain, in Soul Reaver 2, you'll find your goal is more along the lines of finding elemental forges to imbue the Reaver with various different elements, along the lines of fire, darkness, light, air, and etc. As there are numerous doors that are locked unless you possess a certain element, and most of these places contain knowledge about things you want to know more about. Plus, you're already there, why not explore a less ruined Nosgoth that isn't infested with vampire spiders? Admittedly, I preferred the boss battles to the forges but... the one final ""boss battle"" this game does have is awesome for story reasons.There's less of this in Soul Reaver 2, but as in the first, if you're stuck and it seems there's no way to progress, enter the Spirit Realm. And also, if you find the enemies that will pursue you into the Spirit Realm if they beat you annoying when they start showing up, it seemed to me that they were actually easier to kill in the Spirit Realm. So keep that in mind. Also, another improvement in the transition to Soul Reaver 2. There's still puzzles, but almost zero block puzzles. Hoorah! Although... there is one thing I was sort of bummed out by. Soul Reaver 1 was linear sure, but it didn't feel that way. There were side areas you could explore, you could save anywhere... but SR2, BO2, and Defiance are all on a checkpoint system. They're still good, but the Nosgoth you explore in SR1's probably my personal favorite.As it was with Soul Reaver 1, I definitely recommend this game. The gameplay's certainly improved from Soul Reaver 1, and everything else (the story, the atmosphere, the voice acting, and the music) continue to be excellent. As long as you appreciate old games, yes, absolutely play this game/series. After SR2, only Blood Omen 2 and Defiance remain... and also Nosgoth, I guess. I'd recommend playing Blood Omen 2 between this game and Defiance. Defiance should be the final note you finish playing LoK on, not BO2 for... reasons I'll go into in my inevitable BO2 review.tl;dr: Absolutely. Legacy of Kain, in the words of the Elder God, ""you are worthy.""7.8/10.			"

												Soul Reaver 2 starts up where the last game left off. Raziel has plunged through the Chronoplast time portal in his relentless pursuit of Kain and must unearth the mysteries of Nosgoth's ancient races as he travels unabashedly through eras of both the past and the future. Soul Reaver 2 has more in-depth puzzles and improved weapon enhancements, it also introduces a number of elemental mechanics, as well as an increased number of enemies.As with the original Soul Reaver the bigger focus of this game is the puzzles and these have been much improved and far more challenging. You travel to these various dungeons and you will find far fewer block puzzles and instead a large variety of puzzles that use the differences in landscape between spectral and real realms, reflections, wind, light and elemental reaver attributes. As you progress the game you will receive temporary imbuements to the soul reaver for various elements. These give the reaver various abilities and these are used for the majority of puzzles in the game. The Story is where the game really shines. The story is so complicated and well written that it spans five games. It is hard to explain the story, you just have to play the games to understand it.The voice acting is awesome. It is one of the best you will find in any game out there. The music as well is very good, you will find yourself hearing it in your head long after you played this game.The graphics are great for the time. The graphics now are quite decent, less glitches and more enjoyable lightning sprites. They made Nosgoth's appearance more lively and a better transition effect from Spectral Realm to Material Realm than the first one. Raziel and the other characters were well designed.The unique play mechanics of Soul Reaver 2, as well as its impressive graphics and excellent story, make it easy to recommend to fans of action or adventure games.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I'm not reviewing the game itself, but the version currently on Steam and how it plays. That is, depending on your system, terribly.Lots of people have problems with random freezes during cutscenes, which is a pain since save points are often an hour or so apart and you can't even skip cutscenes you've already seen.The localized versions of this game, while they exist and are generally considered good quality, are simply not available on Steam. This is English only, and worst of all, this game comes from a time when not having any kind of subtitles was acceptable (way to do accessibiility, by the way).I don't care how old this game is. If you are republishing it, you have to do basic support. Why are we still paying for it if not this?Update on this : So it appears the frequent freezes are related to processor affinity in multiple core systems (most modern PCs). There are workarounds, none of which are very convenient for end-users. This could be fixed somewhat easily for everyone if Square Enix had any care. For this reason, and for the non-inclusion of versions other than English, I still don't recommend it.			"

												Soul Reaver 2 is one of the games from my childhood that I remember the most fondly. The dialogue and voice acting made a huge impact on me, even back when I was too young to fully understand any of it. To this day I can recite a lot of it by heart – most notably the ""coin landing on its edge"" scene I'm sure a lot of players will remember.Replaying the game in recent years, I have to admit that the combat has become a bit of an annoyance and I mostly just try to run past everything to get to the next cutscene. But those cutscenes are still as rewarding as they were back in the day, and I have yet to find any game that rivals the Legacy of Kain series in terms of perfectly written and delivered dialogue.

												A very good game with very good puzzles and story. Voice acting is amazing just like in the last game. The game does feel a bit repetative because there is some time travel and you do the same landscapes 3 times over just in different time periods. Got the game on sale for $1.75 which was for sure worth it. P.S. It shows through his features that Raziel has a jaw line under his cloak... even though it clearly shows he does not have any jaw whatsoever in the beginning of the first game.P.P.S. Raziel calling the Elder God a ""Giant Squid"" is one of the funniest moments in gaming... did not see it coming... really did laugh out loud.			"

And Soul Reaver 2 swaps out its predecessors love of block puzzles for light reflection puzzles.The game is solid, if short, but a very worthy entry into the Legacy of Kain series.Knowledge of Soul Reaver 1's plot is basically essential here, as it picks up EXACTLY where the first leaves off.

The game picks up where is left off in the first game, the combat is tighter, story more expensive and immersive, it seems like an improvement in all areas from the first game.and the first game was incredible.well worth a purchase, don't be fooled by it's age, it's much better than most modern games.

												Let me start by saying that all the Kain games are saddly broken and buggy on PC. Rendering all the Steam versions except for Defiance,  unplayable.However there are fixes for this.This last week, trying to get SR2 running again, I poked around some recent forums to find out about dgVoodoo 2.If you ever want to be able to play Soul Reaver 1, 2, and Blood Omen without bugs or crashes. Then you want this link. http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2.htmlThe instructions are easy to fallow, pretty much only requireing you to put files in the game folders, and then using the exe you put in those folders to alter the program, finally alowing the best (at it's time) quality version of a DirectX Emulator, and ridding yourself of most, if not all the bugs that make these games crash. I have finally played all the way through this game, and will be posting the final chapters up on YouTube. Enjoy!			"

												Let's get one thing clear: I recommend the GAME, but not in this form. This version of the game is a direct-to-PC port, and comes with the wide variety of accompanying bugs. The Ethereal Plane and water physics are completely broken, for one, rendering the game very nearly unplayable before you even leave the Cathedral you start the game in. If you want to 100% the game, forget about it. I honestly got frustrated trying to explore the first underwater area you come across at the first save point. I recently reloaded the game after several months, and remembered why I hadn't played for so long. That said, if this game is anything like the first, there will be a point that the game becomes completely unpassable due to some puzzle or another not working the way it should. I personally never got that far. I vaguely remember playing the game start to finish when it was first released back on PS2, and I wasn't nearly as clever as I am now, what with being far younger at the time, so I doubt I had the issues I'm seeing now.TL;DR Get the game for PS2 if you're going to buy it, because console devs have once more dicked the PC port.

												What to say that has not been said already. If this game was a cup, it would be overflowing with epicness.If you never played it before, you are in for a story you will never forget(most likely you wont understand it either if you havent played previous Legacy of Kain games). Naration is just epic, all voice actors(Kain especially) are very gifted voice actors and will make every cutscene feel amazing. Also, story is well written and leaves little to nothing unexplained but rest assured that after finishing LoK series, all shall be revealed. Speaking of gameplay, combat is good, fast and dynamic and fairly challenging at some points. Puzzles are entertaining, and a bit challenging every now and then. Only thing that is worse, in my opinion, compared to previous Soul Reaver game is that there are no things to collect, as health upgrades or glyph magic and that the world feels much smaller than the one in the original Soul ReaverPros:-Epic Story narrated by epic voices-Fast, dynamic combat-Fun puzzles-Detailed world and nice visualsCons:-No ""secret"" collectables-Can crash on PC's with multi core CPU's(avoid by making it run on only 1 core)9/10			"

												This game is fantastic, but this version isn't. First, it's an incredible pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get a controller working, I had to fiddle with JoyToKey for a long time before getting it right. For a game that was originally released on console, this is unacceptable. Second, and most importantly, the game crashes quite frequently, and considering save points are scarce and the (quite long) cut scenes cannot be skipped, this is *incredibly* frustrating. Also, you have to enable vsync on your graphic card because the screen tearing is monstrous. Audio bugs are also occasionally present, though not to the level of the first game.I would only recommend the game if you truly cannot get a hold of the PlayStation 2 version at all. PS2 owners, don't bother with double-dipping for the convenience of Steam or the high res or whatnot, and especially not to support the publishers, because they don't deserve your money for this lame cashgrab.The game itself is quite good, however. Its graphics aged really well and look very good under modern resolutions, the story and voice acting and atmosphere are as compelling as ever, and the level design is spectacular. The camera isn't perfect, it's rather dated, but it helps to bind it on the right analog stick if you can. Combat, similarly to the camera, is both a bit dated yet serviceable enough, and impaling and beheading enemies still feel satisfying. It's too bad this PC port is so shoddy; no effort whatsoever has been made to make it stable and controller-friendly. This game deserves better than a less-than-mediocre port. I bought this in the LoK bundle during a sale at quite a good price, and I still feel ripped off. After a crash happened which made me lose over 90 minutes of progress (including long, unskippable cut scenes) due the scarcity of save points, I simply gave up on this playthrough (since I beat it more than once on PS2 back in the day).

												Its a amazing game but no better then the 1st Soul Reaver. The second was a great step to the new generation of the game systems at the time but it lost a few things from the first. The only power up that you kept from the 1st game was the swim ability and able to go through cage doors or cage walls and the soul reaver thats bound to you for the rest of your life. you have a limited selection of weapons like able to use a a giant butcher knife swords, normal swords, and staffs. The only thing that changes with each weapon is the looks and fighting style, Butcher knife is like a power house weapon that has slashes and slam moves, sword has slash and thrust moves, staff has thrust and beating them with the thing. The executios was changed having a little gore of having a head chopped off. All and all great game with slightly challanging puzzles and bunch of new people to fight as you travle forward andback words through time.			"

												The only reason I'm ""Reccomending"" this, is because the legacy of kain series is my 2nd favorite series in gaming, ever.It's a flawless masterpiece. This and the first game both have kinda clunky combat but besides that , everything else is perfect, ESPECIALLY the story. and the voice acting. OH MAN, THE STORY. I really wish they made a movie or sevral out of the whole lok series, it really deserves one done right.anyways, this steam release I cannot reccomend.This game will only work on windows xp-windows 7.I can't even open the game on my laptop because it's on windows 10.Which is a real shame because this is one of the only story based games I loved playing over and over again.Get this game, if you can manage to fix a fix (which steam SHOULD be providing you considering you're giving money for a 2001 game in 2017 where almost no one has a windows 7 or lower anymore)the quality in graphics is the best on the Pc but if you have a ps2 lying around somewhere, GRAB THIS GAME. it's a masterpiece. I have yet to meet someone that gave this game a chance and disliked it even slightly.			"

												""Here, Raziel. Every-thing is decided here. You cannot comprehend the magnitude, the rapture or the tragedy of this moment. And yet you must; if Nosgoth is to be dragged from the wreckage of it's damnation.""As stated elsewhere in these reviews, Soul Reaver 2 has the quality of story and voice acting that is God-tier.  It's epicness has been unrivavled, in my estimation, since it's inception several years ago. No story in video-games holds such weight that that of the Legacy of Kain series. This, imo, is the pinnacle of the story-telling in this series, from beginning to end. The twists and turns along with revelatory epiphonies that follow Raziel in his quest for the Truth are in no way, in any sense of the imagination, trivial. History and time-travel also make their appearance here in a way that you've likely not fathomed possible, given the ""Back to the Future"" esque sense of time-travel most of modern media is inundated with. History, in particular, is a character in the story that can and will take action in the need to preserve continuity, a stunning inclusion and narrative-defining element. I'll not spoil the details here but the rules this universe are bound by are unique and very concievable, lending credence to the overal arc of this tale. The voice acting is a remarkable feat in this game. Most games have solitary actors being cued up for their lines, leaving much to be desired in the natural ebb and flow of a genuine conversation; often stilted and jarring given that actors simply have to pretend they are talking with someone else when giving their lines. Not here. Every scene of dialogue has actors standing side-by-side in a sound booth, bouncing line after line off one another in such a way you would beleive these characters to be rea not only in their solidity but also in their convictions. Truly an example of a byegone era of voice acting. Unparralleled. A treat to be savored, for sure. If you've never experienced the joy of Soul Reaver, I would implore you to either buy the game and play it (though the combat and platforming are a little dated by todays standards, the puzzles are fun though) or watch the movies of them online, starting with either the first soul reaver or the first legacy of Kain entry. It's hard to wrap your head around at first because there is much context to the story but once you get to this entry you are simply hooked. There's nothing like this entry in all of the video games that I've ever played. Do yourself a favor and sink your teeth into it. You won't be disappointed			"

PROS:+ awesome story+ cool game soundtrack+ great voice acting+ enhanced controls and graphics (compared to SR1)+ two realms - physical and spectral+ puzzlesCONS:- weaker boss fights- simpler gameplay (compared to SR1)- another open ending hinting to LoK: Defiance- can have compatibility problems on some PCsComment:Soul Reaver 2 is a sequel to one of my favourite games of all time so of course I had to play it as well. And overall this is a good game that combines combat and puzzles in the various time periods of Nosgoth. This time around the game is less difficult but still keeps it's challenge. The game keeps the mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm. Although the return to the physical realm is a bit changed. So if you die in the physical world you shift to the spectral one. There is a rather visible lack of good/epic boss fights in this sequel and while it does make sense story-wise I have to say it takes away from the gameplay a bit. The story and narrative, reasons why I love this series, remain superb. The story telling is enhanced by (slightly) better graphics, the writing and voice acting are great as always. I like the soundtrack too. The downsides are that the game is old so graphics and compatibility are really lacking (though it is a lot better than SR1), however it runs fine on my Win7 laptop. The ending is reather open again and that can get annoying in this series, though it does finally finish in LoK: Defiance. I really like the Soul Reaver series and as such I have to recommend this one as well, not just because I like it but also because it is a good game worth trying out.			"

												Firstly i'll say that it is near impossible to enjoy this game if you haven't played the first one (i tried). The story picks up right where the first game ended, so experience the first game before you pick this one up.Soul Reaver 2 plays the same as the first game but focuses far more on story progression than gameplay. The game is incredibly linear compared to the first game. While the first game had a linear story progression, you did have the option to backtrack and use new found powers to uncover secret items. This game has absolutely no secrets to find. You follow the path and stick to it, beating up a few bad guys along the way using a very stale combat system. During the game you collect different elemental powers for your Reaver, but they really only act as keys to access new areas instead of providing different effects in combat. Combat wasn't such a problem in the first game because you spent more time platforming, but Soul Reaver 2 doesn't have a lot of that, just running from Point A to Point B. It's also much shorter than the previous game. But you see this doesn't matter at all if you're playing it for the story. Soul Reaver 2 isn't about reaching your goal, it's much more about the journey and uncovering one plot twist after another. There's no 'huge' climax at the end of the game, i honestly didn't expect it to end where it did. It acts as more of a story stepping stone between Soul Reaver 1 and Defiance.Just like in the first game, and maybe more so, you will be driving yourself to reach the next cutscene so you can anser that fundamental question, 'why?'. The voice acting and soundtrack are just as brilliant as the first game. The environment is much less dark and haunting, in fact at the start of the game there's some quite nice scenery.The puzzles get a bit of an upgrade, moving away from block pushing and turning them into something you would find in a Zelda dungeon, but they're not overly hard to solve.If you're in it for the story then this game won't disappoint, it's the only thing that really makes this games many flaws enjoyable.

												It runs! One of those difficult but great games of the past. The game that would only run on a pentium 3/ or duron 1200 at most, or else have it's graphics inverted. Glad that is solved. This game fully supports a gamepad by the way, despite steam not mentioning it. I use a ps2 controller, that works great.This is one of those legendary Eidos games which you must have played. Or well...it's almost more a movie then actually playing. This game has many puzzles and cutscenes, a great storyline. So if you're into that, give it a try!			"

												This game starts of right after Legacy Of Kain Soul Reaver, where you follow Kain into the time chamber and then find yourself in the Saraphan Stronghold in a time when the phillers still stood up. In this game you will travel through time as Raziel tries to discover his true destiny while Mobious and others tries to convince Raziel that his destiny is to become the savior of Nosgoth by killing Kain. I have to say that this game has got the most interesting story-line I've ever seen in a game. The voice acting is the best and it can not be compaired with any other!			"

Its Soul Reaver lite While not a bad game, its definitely not as good as it's predecessor in a lot of respects.The Good:Superb voice acting, nice story, the puzzles are more complex and involved yet overall pretty good and offer a bit more clues to solve them, which is a marked improvement to the previous game.The Not-so-good:-The combat - In comparison to SR1 it feels distant, with little weight or consequence behind your punches, making it rather unsatisfying. Furthermore, by the endgame, when fighting 4+ opponents, they will ALL attack at the same time, and while realistic and ""challenging"" it really comes out as cheap, specially when some of those enemies would naturally attack each other, but as soon as they detect you, ALL of them go for your♥♥♥♥♥instead. . Your Soul Reaver blade can be used from the start of the game and is a bit OP, that however is countered by a bar which fills the more you use the blade and kill with it, and once filled takes away some of your health, thus forcing you to mix its use with regular weapons, which at least brings some depth to an otherwise humdrum combat system. Speaking of the blade, it can be infused throughout the story with different elements (light, dark, wind & fire) but disappointingly only come into play in puzzles; yet another sign that the combat is undercooked at best.-The overall pacing - This took a big nosedive since it opts for a completely linear style, in stark contrast to the exploration-based, open world the previous game had, sacrificing all exploration and collecting of spells / health runes & magic artifacts. Streamlined, yes, but ends up with a dull, empty-feeling world as a result.-The music - The songs are bland and unmemorable. Again, another point in which Soul Reaver 1 outshines this entry.Verdict: 6/10Mediocre, yet recommendable, however if you're a Legacy of Kain fan, you'll probably enjoy it if only to continue with the damn good storyline of the series, which is, in my opinion, the biggest draw point of this saga.

The 3rd person action adventure in the gothic land of NosgothThe third installment in the LoK franchise. Story begins right where it ended in SR1, in the time streaming device with Kain...Raziel emerges in another century, and begins his journey to uncover his destiny, again. Now, not on a vengeful quest against his former battle-brothers, but on a quest for knowledge, he will face many obstacles. You will open some ancient mysteries, and gain historical insight about the ancient blue-skinned noble vampire race and it's enemies. You will meet some of the guys that you probably already know (if you played the previous installments), like Moebius, Kain, Vorador... and some new. Some discoveries during Raziel's inquiry into his own destiny will be quiet suprising. This game is an amazing experience, from many perspectives. As you can imagine from reading my review, the story is outstanding.What about the rest of the game?Well, it's excellent, tooThe graphics are old and all, but you can ignore it, the desing and art in game is top-level, has a nice gothic feel too it. Overall looks good even today. Kurt Harland did a great job making soundtrack for the sequel, it's admirably written. Sound desing imbues the atmosphere with a gothicness and darkness.The gameplay is similar to the first game, it's a 3rd action adventure with enough of platforming and some nice puzzles. Overall, there's an impovment in most of the areas. Combat mechanics are much more fluid, same goes with probably everything.Recommend playing this game with a gamepad, it's clearly was ment for consoles, so if you have one, don't bother with keyboard (though, it's still playable, but not as enjoyable in my point of view)For all fans of the first game this is a must For those who want to get in to the story of this franchise, this might be your best choice. It's a bit easier than it's predecessor, more fluid and more pleasing to the eye, so yeah, could get you interested easier.Do strongly recommend this gem! "

												For fans of the original, Soul Reaver 2 is a dream come true. This game has probably the best story portions of the whole Legacy of Kain series. It has awesome writing and beautiful voice acting. Aside from it, the presentation is awesome too - the cutscenes are great, the art style and face animations (for it's age of cource). That's the good stuff and that's what makes the game worthy of the purchase. Now on to the bad stuff - the gameplay is linear as hell. There's nothing to explore except the Soul Reaver upgrade forges - but those puzzles are awesome. It's not better game than its predecessor, but built from the ground up with a strong story element, and although extremely linear in places, it's an adventure well worth partaking of.			"

												first off, I don't think haveing no controller support is a worthy of calling a game a bad port. However, this port made playing a game I love an abosulte chore.I've experianced in time playing it3 crashes5 times cutscenes freeze1 time the music just stopNote: I have Windows 7 and have specs good enough for resident evil 5, so it isn't a windows 10 issue and isn't a specs issue.if you're thinking about getting into the series for first time, get a ps2, this version will only frustrate you. and if you already bought the whole series, refund it. it will send steam a message that they can't just slap a bearly passable port on to games they know people love, and expect profit.Update: apparently there is an issue the causes win7 64B to conflict with this game, the soultion to costant crashes (changing the affinty core to 0 cpu) is simple, but still if steam knows that this issue exsits than should state it on the store page or atleast clarify that game works only with 32B. until they state the nesscary settings for win 7 64B before playing the game I will give this port D+.

Doesn't add much new from Soul Reaver but it's still a great game. If you want to know what happened after Soul Reaver get this.

												Soul Reaver 2 captializes everything that made Soul Reaver 1 an enjoyable experience. What's more SR2 expands on the mythos and lore of the LoK universe but only in spoonfuls and when it's necessary.Everything that you remember about Soul Reaver 1 and Soul Reaver 2 (console version) is still here in SR2: memorable characters, landscape, puzzles, lore, etc. I want to say more about these great things. I highly recommend that you get this game and see for yourself.Just to note it controls well. But I highly recommend using a control through Xpadder or something along those lines. "

												The greatness carries over, and where Soul Reaver I would leave absences for expanding upon the same dark narrative... the plot thickens, it twists and turns, and beginning right where the first game ended, we see Raziel follow his course of fate and vengeance, not through Nosgoth, but through time itself. Take again the Soul Reaver, and put those welps and weaklings to pay. Feed on them, grow, as you find the shackles of destiny, and of time itself, clasp about your wrists.This game is gorey, bloody, just as much so as the first. Raziel must sate his dark hunger.UPDATE!!!: You should get an xbox controller, or a programmable mouse / controller to play this game. The default controls are shakey on PC, as this was definitely intended for the Playstation. I would most likely extend this comment to all other Legacy of Kain games.			"

												This review is for young people with Windows 8.1 or other newer systems that may encounter a major freezing error.This review is not for people who gamed through the mid-to-late 90's and have already played this game before.If you have already played this game in its heyday, you are likely doing a run-through as you re-do the legacy of kain series and reminisce about the good old days when you had a million hours to play it.  The bottom line for veteran gamers is that you likely know what you're getting into for round 2: a freeze bug coupled with a horrible checkpoint saving system coupled with no gamepad support.  I mean, the first time I played this it was on PC with keyboard/mouse but this time around I'm really noticing how the autoface and combat system would be better served with a gamepad.I love this series.  I love it.  That's out of the way.  Unfortunately, this is the weakest link in said series.  Blood Omen 2 beats this game in enjoyability.  This game drove me insane.  Imagine spending 35 minutes doing platformer puzzles only for a freeze bug to stop you from saving TEN FEET FROM THE SAVE CHECKPOINT SPOT.  THEN YOU DO THE WHOLE PUZZLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN.  A lot of that.  A lot of jumping over and running past enemies because it just got old and repetitive.  The only driving force was progressing the story, even when it involved walking through the exact same map (oooh but it's in a different time, so it's okay!?) and dealing with the spirit plane and poorly placed planar portals (forgive the alliteration) and running down the same lonnnnnnng hallways because you didn't do something correctly.The problem is that a veteran gamer doesn't give up.  This game should be rated extremely difficult on the basis of computer glitches and frustration, despite how relatively simple it is as a game itself.  If you manage to finish this whole game whilst suffering through compatability issues, I salute you.  This was not easy for me.  By all means continue the legacy of kain, whether you're familiar or a newcomer, but if you are not looking for reminiscence or gamer cred, I recommend looking up a youtube compilation of all the story cutscenes, and moving straight on to either Blood Omen 2 or preferrably Defiance.I didn't recommend the first Soul Reaver on Steam because of a sound error that was easily corrected thanks to the save anywhere feature.  Praying that the game didn't freeze before I reached a save point had me ripping my hair out in Soul Reaver 2.  Play if you have spare time or if you just have to, because we've all been there.  We've all played the worst most frustrating games just out of the completist OCD'ness that accompanies our weird generation.Otherwise, please do not do this to yourself.			"

												The game itself is awesome, played it many times (hard copy), that's why I wanted to get it digital... And can't even go past menu screen. Game crashed to desktop. Tried changing compatibility - was able only to see intro, then crashed. It didn't even play the intro on same settings a second time. Some of you who have win 7 64 bit might just not be able to launch it at all.Edit: Bought LoK on GoG. SR2 works like dream on highest res and Steam version still crashes. Got my point? Shame on you Steam.			"

												Can't recommend this game, The first one was one of the most amazing games on PS1.. But this just does not hold up at all. Unlike the first one there is no bosses in this game, no open world to explore to learn new ablities. No REAL enemies to face. On top of all of this the save points are forever apart.. And that game crashes constantly.. It took me 7 hours to beat this game however because of the crashes and having to do large portions over it took 10 hours. That is 3 hours of replaying the same♥♥♥♥♥♥. I can only recommend you play this if you care about the story.. Other wise good luck getting through it.

												While Soul Reaver is widely regarded as a classic hack and slash game. Soul Reaver 2 has more mixed reception from both critics and fans alike. It's not hard to see why. One of the most replayable elements to the original was it's sidequests. Littered throughout the world were unique power ups that required progressing through the story and getting abilities inorder to unlock. In Soul Reaver 2 there is none of this. You progress through the same overworld continuously, only changing when you switch between time periods. Which really only causes the time of day to shift or snow to appear.As much as I'd like to recommend Soul Reaver 2. It's essentially a stripped down version of the original. It's only worth getting if you really wanna continue from the cliffhanger SR1 left you with.			"

												Soul Reaver 2 is colorful, nice storyline to it. For being an old game, looks really good. No problems with installing, no problems with the game at all. I give a lot of credit to this game, how modern it was at it's time and still remains the same today. Buy it! Download it! Play it! It's worth the $6.99 What do ya got to lose? Classic games can be fun!If I can run this game, full screen, antialiasing on and a resolution for this game @ 1440x900 or higher, you should be able to also. Given what I play on currently.....My specs below might be of some help if you do have problems (which you shouldn't really). I would agree too, this game does play on Windows 7, Windows 8....not sure.OS: Windows Vista Home Basic (32bit)CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 5000+ 2.6 GHz Dual CoreGPU: MSI Nvidia GeForce GT620 2GB GDDR3			"

												First of all, the Steam port of Soul Reaver 2 plays much better than it's predecessor Soul Reaver 1. However, there is still some controller compatibility issues with SR2. The keyboard/ mouse setup wasn't so bad and it's completely playable without a xbox controller. Soul Reaver 2 serves as a more linear sequel that focuses more on continuing SR1's epic story. In other words, you need to play SR1 before you delve into this entry. The only real downside with SR2 compared to the SR1 is that the combat lacks substance whereas in the first you could stagger enemies then impale them in spikes or firepits. I don't recall any of that in SR2. In fact, most of the enemies in SR2 are optional and there are no boss fights like the original.  This can be a disadvantage for some as the original had more Zelda esque ""dungeons"" with bosses and had that metroid atmosphere and powerup vibe going on. SR2 starts off with all the abilities acquired in SR1, but now you upgrade Raziel's Reaver throughout the game by finding different elemental powers for it. These elemental powers such as dark reaver, air reaver , light reaver , and fire reaver are mostly significant for puzzles. The puzzles in SR2 are a improvement over SR1's repetitive block puzzles. In fact, the puzzles and story are further improved in this sequel. Some might not appreciate the linear progression Nosgoth has this time around. However, the world of Nosgoth is lush and gorgeous compared to the dull colored apocalyptic setting SR1 had, which was easy to get lost in. I almost prefer the linear style in SR2 as it feels more fast paced. The game is much shorter than SR1, but SR2 is played mostly for the story. The cutscenes and voice acting are top notch. SR2 feels more casual than it's previous entry, which isn't a bad thing. Nosgoth is so lush and breezy to traverse this time around.PROS:+ Nice Visuals and effects that hold up decently for today+ Wonderful storytelling, music, and voice acting+ Improved puzzles over the original CONS:- Combat doesn't feel as intuitive as the original- No boss battles - A bit on the short side gameplay wise (the story makes up for this) "

												I preferred the first Soul Reaver, that's for sure. And yet, this improved on many things - as I started the game, I was very happy with the upgrades in graphics and animation during cutscenes as well as a definite upgrade in dramatic vampire sass (feat. Raziel vs Kain) Also, I REALLY enjoy this franchise's story, and Soul Reaver 2 does not disappoint in that aspect.Gameplay/combat system was inferior, however. The first SR was great because the ""play"" was unique - the realm switching lore-motivated no-game-overs style and creative use of environment to defeat enemies was the charm of it. Soul Reaver 2 dropped all that. Sure, it still kept the spectral realm but it didn't serve the same purpose anymore. New enemies introduced that follow you into the spectral realm can actually kill you there now - sending you back to your latest checkpoint. This seemed purposeless? It throws you back into the standard way games handle health and trial & error, which felt like a stepback. The spectral realm may just as well have been removed completely. The only thing you do in the spectral realm that you can't do in the material realm is distort the environment to be able to scale certain walls.Fighting anybody in Soul Reaver 2 was also incredible tedious, in my personal opinion.  Sure, these vampire hunters are doing their job splendidly when they gang up on you and poke you repeatedly with long halberds and spears, stunning you and often negating your dodges. While I don't wish for it to be EASIER, I just felt like there was no time during combat to catch a break. I was dodging constantly, and still suffered so many blows that it simply wasn't feasible to use the Reaver against enemies. (This may have been a PC port issue? I can't be sure.)The Reaver is a few-hits-kill weapon in SR2, for a price; if you kill an enemy with it, their soul will instantly be devoured by the Reaver itself - leaving you with no way to replenish your health. On top of that, if you use the Reaver too much, it will start feeding directly on your health.Without the Reaver equipped, the souls of your enemies will stick around for you to devour - however, when faced with multiple enemies, it is difficult to find the time and space to have your meal - if you stop, most likely, another enemy will start pummeling you. And sometimes, that means your meal will escape. (Don't even get me started on the enemies with projectile attacks)So... Tedious.(Side note: I'm neutral about the sountrack for SR1 but the spectral realm music for certain areas in SR2 was Really Annoying and was mostly noise. It didn't help that it was usually failure in combat that sent me back to it )((The portals for materializing back were also waaay more spread out than SR1 so it was a chore to rematerialize))(((The enemies of the spectral realm were just as tedious as the material ones)))In conclusion I have a lot of bones to pick with how SR2 was played - however, the story was great and made me eager still to pick up the next title. I may not completely grasp every detail yet but it does a good job of capturing me and making me curious to read up on the lore, which I usually don't like to do.(And to reiterate, I loved the upgrade in animation even though it's not perfect. Most scenes were actually choreographed properly, instead of just pose-and-talk-with-camera-pans that a lot of games do.)(also don't be fooled by my in-game hours, steam keeps counting while paused, and there was pausing aplenty since save locations are so far apart)			"

												I clicked ""Yes"" on the recommendation because I'm sure it's just as good as the first one, which I used to play over and over again as a young guy; however, it's going to need some tinkering to work on a modern computer with Win7 64bit (what I run) or greater. :-/ Haven't figured out how yet. Beginning cutscene is black, but the audio plays. At the end of the cutscene, nothing.So if you're going to buy this, just be forewarned: this one makes you work for it.			"

												Woof. Okay. I owned Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 on the Playstation and beat it fairly quickly. Having played it three or four times, it dawned on me that I may have finished the game, but not the story. If you're familar with the story, Raziel ends up fighting Kain but letting him escape. Soul Reaver 2 takes place immediately after and introduces Nosgoth with creepy new graphics and polygons and terms like that. GAMEPLAY-You keep all the powers you got from the first game! :D yay-You start out with the Soul Reaver! :D neat-Humans and Vampires get tougher and tougher! :D wow-Weird momentum walking run thing going on? :/ hmm-Freakish camera angles? :/ plech-Bizzare controls? :/ configure keyboard-No more saving whenever you want? :/ sucksSTORY-Cheesy as ever. I love it.-Voice acting? Maybe better than Resident Evil?-Pick a side, it's kind of a ""explore yourself"" story.So I haven't finished it yet, but if you were a fan of the original and are a story driven player, this game is probably for you. Sure it's far from perfect, but it's fun and comes pretty close to the mediocre-ness of its predecessor.			"

												I owned all the Legacy of Kain games back in the day on PlayStation and X-Box. Glad to see them make a return here on Steam. Without a doubt the storytelling in the LEgacy of Kain series is probably the best I've ever seen in a game.- Pros --Unsurpassed Storytelling and Voice Acting-Interesting World Lore-Difficult but interesting puzzles-No hand-holding. Figure it out genius-No lame Twilight vampires- Cons - -PC port is terrible. Wonky controls, annoying camera and weak graphics options-Random crashing-Long periods between save points-No hand holding. Help me, I'm lostAll said, it's an amazing story that knocks most story-based games out of the water, even nearly fifteen years after release. (I'm looking at you BioWare)If you can deal with the wonky and sometimes downright frustrating conrols and the dated graphics, then you should get the Legacy of Kain series. Absolutely. "

												""Kain refused the sacrifice."" The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The bad stuff out of the way first: there's a bigger emphasis on combat. While it can be fun to fight the weaker enemies, the game introduces progressively difficult ones, and the battle system is not as responsive as it could be. As such, you may try to evade an attack only to end up hit, often several times in a row, which is annoying. You can, however, bypass a considerable number of encounters and you can always use the reaver to speed things up (although it starts feeding on your energy if you overuse it).The other thing is that Soul Reaver's design felt more organic whereas the sequel's linearity is not as well disguised.Everything else, though, is much, much better. Better and more varied puzzles (gone are the block puzzles), more dialogue and monologues, more substantial story (still ends on a cliffhanger), better graphics and overall better controls. Kain and Raziel's dynamic is much more interesting and there is significant progress in Raziel's character. The voice-acting is still incredible, the writing is, as before, very compelling and it's a delight hearing the characters interact with each other. You also have access to the full script in-game, if you're interested in that kind of thing (you should be interested in this case).Long story short: this game is baller as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I clicked ""Yes"" on the recommendation because I'm sure it's just as good as the first one, which I used to play over and over again as a young guy; however, it's going to need some tinkering to work on a modern computer with Win7 64bit (what I run) or greater. :-/ Haven't figured out how yet. Beginning cutscene is black, but the audio plays. At the end of the cutscene, nothing.So if you're going to buy this, just be forewarned: this one makes you work for it.			"

												I preferred the first Soul Reaver, that's for sure. And yet, this improved on many things - as I started the game, I was very happy with the upgrades in graphics and animation during cutscenes as well as a definite upgrade in dramatic vampire sass (feat. Raziel vs Kain) Also, I REALLY enjoy this franchise's story, and Soul Reaver 2 does not disappoint in that aspect.Gameplay/combat system was inferior, however. The first SR was great because the ""play"" was unique - the realm switching lore-motivated no-game-overs style and creative use of environment to defeat enemies was the charm of it. Soul Reaver 2 dropped all that. Sure, it still kept the spectral realm but it didn't serve the same purpose anymore. New enemies introduced that follow you into the spectral realm can actually kill you there now - sending you back to your latest checkpoint. This seemed purposeless? It throws you back into the standard way games handle health and trial & error, which felt like a stepback. The spectral realm may just as well have been removed completely. The only thing you do in the spectral realm that you can't do in the material realm is distort the environment to be able to scale certain walls.Fighting anybody in Soul Reaver 2 was also incredible tedious, in my personal opinion.  Sure, these vampire hunters are doing their job splendidly when they gang up on you and poke you repeatedly with long halberds and spears, stunning you and often negating your dodges. While I don't wish for it to be EASIER, I just felt like there was no time during combat to catch a break. I was dodging constantly, and still suffered so many blows that it simply wasn't feasible to use the Reaver against enemies. (This may have been a PC port issue? I can't be sure.)The Reaver is a few-hits-kill weapon in SR2, for a price; if you kill an enemy with it, their soul will instantly be devoured by the Reaver itself - leaving you with no way to replenish your health. On top of that, if you use the Reaver too much, it will start feeding directly on your health.Without the Reaver equipped, the souls of your enemies will stick around for you to devour - however, when faced with multiple enemies, it is difficult to find the time and space to have your meal - if you stop, most likely, another enemy will start pummeling you. And sometimes, that means your meal will escape. (Don't even get me started on the enemies with projectile attacks)So... Tedious.(Side note: I'm neutral about the sountrack for SR1 but the spectral realm music for certain areas in SR2 was Really Annoying and was mostly noise. It didn't help that it was usually failure in combat that sent me back to it )((The portals for materializing back were also waaay more spread out than SR1 so it was a chore to rematerialize))(((The enemies of the spectral realm were just as tedious as the material ones)))In conclusion I have a lot of bones to pick with how SR2 was played - however, the story was great and made me eager still to pick up the next title. I may not completely grasp every detail yet but it does a good job of capturing me and making me curious to read up on the lore, which I usually don't like to do.(And to reiterate, I loved the upgrade in animation even though it's not perfect. Most scenes were actually choreographed properly, instead of just pose-and-talk-with-camera-pans that a lot of games do.)(also don't be fooled by my in-game hours, steam keeps counting while paused, and there was pausing aplenty since save locations are so far apart)			"

												First of all, the Steam port of Soul Reaver 2 plays much better than it's predecessor Soul Reaver 1. However, there is still some controller compatibility issues with SR2. The keyboard/ mouse setup wasn't so bad and it's completely playable without a xbox controller. Soul Reaver 2 serves as a more linear sequel that focuses more on continuing SR1's epic story. In other words, you need to play SR1 before you delve into this entry. The only real downside with SR2 compared to the SR1 is that the combat lacks substance whereas in the first you could stagger enemies then impale them in spikes or firepits. I don't recall any of that in SR2. In fact, most of the enemies in SR2 are optional and there are no boss fights like the original.  This can be a disadvantage for some as the original had more Zelda esque ""dungeons"" with bosses and had that metroid atmosphere and powerup vibe going on. SR2 starts off with all the abilities acquired in SR1, but now you upgrade Raziel's Reaver throughout the game by finding different elemental powers for it. These elemental powers such as dark reaver, air reaver , light reaver , and fire reaver are mostly significant for puzzles. The puzzles in SR2 are a improvement over SR1's repetitive block puzzles. In fact, the puzzles and story are further improved in this sequel. Some might not appreciate the linear progression Nosgoth has this time around. However, the world of Nosgoth is lush and gorgeous compared to the dull colored apocalyptic setting SR1 had, which was easy to get lost in. I almost prefer the linear style in SR2 as it feels more fast paced. The game is much shorter than SR1, but SR2 is played mostly for the story. The cutscenes and voice acting are top notch. SR2 feels more casual than it's previous entry, which isn't a bad thing. Nosgoth is so lush and breezy to traverse this time around.PROS:+ Nice Visuals and effects that hold up decently for today+ Wonderful storytelling, music, and voice acting+ Improved puzzles over the original CONS:- Combat doesn't feel as intuitive as the original- No boss battles - A bit on the short side gameplay wise (the story makes up for this) "

												It is an awesome game on playstation 2. It was one of my favorite games of all time, but this version is full of bugs on windows 10. I'll give some credit to it, as the game was released almost 14 years ago but if you don't like playing with a keyboard and mouse, you will not like this. I tried playing with the playstation 1 controller, and a dualshock 2, but the support for them both are ridiculous. I also tried the 360 controller as a last hope, but nope, not working well. Despite all these controller issues, swithcing between the physical and spiritual realms may take up to 5 minutes, which leads me to alt+F4 the game, and play around with the compatility stuff on windows.. I spent like 3 hours playing the game, and another 4-5 hours to try to make it work...			"

												Woof. Okay. I owned Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 on the Playstation and beat it fairly quickly. Having played it three or four times, it dawned on me that I may have finished the game, but not the story. If you're familar with the story, Raziel ends up fighting Kain but letting him escape. Soul Reaver 2 takes place immediately after and introduces Nosgoth with creepy new graphics and polygons and terms like that. GAMEPLAY-You keep all the powers you got from the first game! :D yay-You start out with the Soul Reaver! :D neat-Humans and Vampires get tougher and tougher! :D wow-Weird momentum walking run thing going on? :/ hmm-Freakish camera angles? :/ plech-Bizzare controls? :/ configure keyboard-No more saving whenever you want? :/ sucksSTORY-Cheesy as ever. I love it.-Voice acting? Maybe better than Resident Evil?-Pick a side, it's kind of a ""explore yourself"" story.So I haven't finished it yet, but if you were a fan of the original and are a story driven player, this game is probably for you. Sure it's far from perfect, but it's fun and comes pretty close to the mediocre-ness of its predecessor.			"

												Soul Reaver 2 is colorful, nice storyline to it. For being an old game, looks really good. No problems with installing, no problems with the game at all. I give a lot of credit to this game, how modern it was at it's time and still remains the same today. Buy it! Download it! Play it! It's worth the $6.99 What do ya got to lose? Classic games can be fun!If I can run this game, full screen, antialiasing on and a resolution for this game @ 1440x900 or higher, you should be able to also. Given what I play on currently.....My specs below might be of some help if you do have problems (which you shouldn't really). I would agree too, this game does play on Windows 7, Windows 8....not sure.OS: Windows Vista Home Basic (32bit)CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 5000+ 2.6 GHz Dual CoreGPU: MSI Nvidia GeForce GT620 2GB GDDR3			"

												Great game and great storytelling. Most of the camera issues that plagued the first game are now gone (see, most of them, not all). Highly reccomended as one of the most well written and convoluted plots in history of gaming. Also, runs in any post cold-war laptop.			"

												My favorite video game series of all time. I played each one of them many times and I'd still play again if they get remastered. I'm so hopeful that Crystal Dynamics would come up with another sequel to complete the story. I recommend it to everyone who likes a Fantastic story telling and twisting plot.			"

												The storyline is what sells this game. Prepare yourself for a pretty epic, if not confusing, storyline. The voice acting is superb.The combat certainly feels dated but it's still pretty cool to attack using the Soul Reaver. Soul Reaver 2 is probably the best game in the series.Action, adventure, puzzles and great storytelling.			"

												""Kain refused the sacrifice."" The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The bad stuff out of the way first: there's a bigger emphasis on combat. While it can be fun to fight the weaker enemies, the game introduces progressively difficult ones, and the battle system is not as responsive as it could be. As such, you may try to evade an attack only to end up hit, often several times in a row, which is annoying. You can, however, bypass a considerable number of encounters and you can always use the reaver to speed things up (although it starts feeding on your energy if you overuse it).The other thing is that Soul Reaver's design felt more organic whereas the sequel's linearity is not as well disguised.Everything else, though, is much, much better. Better and more varied puzzles (gone are the block puzzles), more dialogue and monologues, more substantial story (still ends on a cliffhanger), better graphics and overall better controls. Kain and Raziel's dynamic is much more interesting and there is significant progress in Raziel's character. The voice-acting is still incredible, the writing is, as before, very compelling and it's a delight hearing the characters interact with each other. You also have access to the full script in-game, if you're interested in that kind of thing (you should be interested in this case).Long story short: this game is baller as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												WARNING: game may not be compatible with your pc.It's a good adventure/fighting game with puzzles. Really interesting storyline in the legacy of kain series, fights are ok, it has a really nice gothic theme to it, however please note that the game has compatibility issues. The only way to test it is to download it and try it out - do it at your own risk. For me on my desktop pc, the screen stays blue in-game. On my laptop, the character makes a 10 meter leap whenever he tries to fight an npc -> makes it impossible to play, unfortunately. "
