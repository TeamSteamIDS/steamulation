												""Trauma"" is more a visual art project shaped as a point'n'click adventure than a conventional game. IMHO, a great, quite succesful experiment, with a surprising game mechanic I had never seen before and a dreamy, surrealistic atmosphere.Having said that, the game is quite short, so try to get it at a discount.

												Trauma is a very artsy puzzle-adventure kind of game.Graphics 6 of 10 The graphics consist mainly of photo-shots of urban everyday areas. I’d say they're okayish. For an indie game developer that's ok. Still feels old school.Gameplay 5 of 10 You navigate through the photo-shots and you manipulate various objects with gestures /signs. Think of the swiping movements you do with your fingers on a smartphone...but here you do it with a mouse. Which is in no way intuitive or comfortable. It’s meant to be an adventure game, but it's not very adventurous to me. The areas where you are allowed to do something are sparse. And so you click your way through the artsy still photo-shots...while a tragic little story unfolds. On the plus side the atmosphere is quite nice and feels dreamlike and obscure at times.Sound 6 of 10 The voice of the actress is quite well done. Music is almost nonexistent. Final verdictI would not recommend this game. Although it has its moments and the story is bittersweet, the gameplay just doesn't feel right, the puzzles are way too easy and it's extremely short and can be accomplished in like 45 minutes "

												Photography, movie, poetry (why not?)...Trauma is a very different and interesting game, where you travel through four dreams of a girl in a hospital, after a road accident. You travel by clicks and mouse gestures - like road lights in motion - in still worlds/dreams made of photographs and short cinematics.You're are searching for one of the four ways to leave these dreams, one uncovering part of a cinematic of that girl at the hospital, three more additional ends for each dream, and a collection of polaroid photos, uncovering tips and little insights for the girl's past and thoughts.It is not a great story, but the mood is mysterious and cool.Created on Flash for web, so you can't expect great graphics resolutions and resources, but it still an unique experience.

												Less of a game, more of an interactive story.The gameplay is based on navigating trough a set of dreams and finding a sigil to use in the right area. Each dream contains a single sigil, but can be solved with every one of them leading to different revelations. The game can end via solving all dreams once, but discovering all revelations will unlock a secret ending. Dreams can be solved in a non-sequential manner and although navigation can be confusing at times it also makes it easy to tackle a different dream and come back later on.Overall an enjoyable brief and casual experience, that manages to deliver its message.

												This was a fun little game.  Not very long, not overly complex or maddenly difficult...just a nice little journey though a trauma victim's memories and impressions.  Gameplay is essentially point and click for navigation, and you learn to create these ""symbols"" (performed with mouse-based gestures) that have generic purposes (e.g., directional controls) and in some cases can be used in less-than-obvious (but usually clever) applications.  A modicum of replayability is achieved via multiple solutions/endings to each chapter, and by finding all of the ""polaroids"" thoughout.If you're worried about bang-for-the-buck, then get it on sale like I did.  Take a look at the screenshots to see if you like the photographic art style.  It's certainly not for everybody.  But if you're looking for something simple and explorative, a touch psychological, with some light puzzle elements, then it might be for you.			"

												Well, that's a flash game at steam, very atmospheric, kind of depressing but still interesting to play and explore.+Very nice voice work - I like that girl actor voice, it brings that charm to the game.+A lot of things to explore - multiple endings at each level, a lot of hidden stuff to explore+Unusual game - unusual controls you have to discover, confusing stuff happening around you. Pretty interesting.+Cant say it's too short or too long - 2 hours is enough to complete the whole game unless you stuck with finding last parts, well then google is your friend.-Kinda depressing, well you were informed.-Flash game problems - doesn't support steam cloud - if you delete the game, after some years you will have to unlock everything all over again-No steam cards or achievementsGot this game years ago in some bundle, well its a great buy if this will be put on discount.

												I'll preface by saying yes it is a kind of old school flash based find the thing to click kind of story.  The ambience is a little dark and moody but it is not off puttingly so.  What this honestly reminds me of, more than anything is kind of an old school macintosh hypercard stack. You are bascially presented with 4 dreams, and in each dream there is a main goal (accomplishing the thing that ends the dream), as well as a few little collectable photos and side goals you can do to sort of 'back out' of the dream's current logic.I agree with a number of other reviewers who note its not really that much of a game, and though I am generally a real sucker for 'really well executed story disguising as a game' (see Gone Home and To the Moon).  In this case the story sort of feels disjointed/only partially executed. A number of the pieces are there, but they don't seem to actually gel into a really solid cohesive goal.  Who are you? Why are you in these dreams, what does getting through them really accomplish? I won't spoiler things here but it just seems more like while there may be some answers there, they don't seem to ... matter... much I guess?I'm not saying that there isn't something here that some people may enjoy, but its certainly not something readily accessable to me.(5/10)			"

												Trauma is pretty much a point-and-click kind of game, the cool concept that this game offers is that you move through photos in 4 different scenarios, it's very experimental and it tells the story about a woman who had an accident (car crash).The game is very easy and you can figure everything quickly, but the real beauty is hidden behind the elements of the photos, the 'story' itself.The idea, like I said before, is very cool and I would recommend this game for photography and cinema fans since it explores the meanings behind the composition.

												Interesting concept the way they used actual photographs and had you manipulate angles/shots with directional clicks. Unfortunately, the 'puzzles' were pointless, the story was vague, and I really didn't care about the main character's inability to figure out if she wants to be apathetic or wallow in her misery. I finished the game just to say I had completed it. It's weird, and the main character's voice is irritating.			"

												A creative, inventive, and intelligent experiment ... that ultimately fails.First off, the price tag is cheeky. I'm sure a lot of effort went into making this game, but the same is true for many independent games that are cheap or free. Some humility is in order here.The mix of photography and film is gorgeous and very evocative, though calling it ""real-time 3D technology"" is plain deceptive, because the scenes are all in 2D. The voice acting is good enough, the music forgettable but fitting.Make no mistake, despite the artistic pretense this is intended to be a playable game. As such, it's a bad one: a very hard hidden-object game with ""secrets"" instead of puzzles. The game might take a few hours to complete if you play it without a walkthrough, but those would be frustrating hours for most of us.(Note that I am talking about completing the whole game. You can also breeze through it in 45 minutes without seeing much of the secret content and alternate endings of chapters. When reviews say this game is ""short and easy,"" that's what they mean. The whole game is very hard.)The problem is that the difficulty of finding the collectible objects (photographs) is due entirely to the incredibly obtuse navigation controls: the player is not otherwise presented with challenges requiring creative thought. The perspective is first person, but your normal sense of direction will confuse rather than guide you, because the photographic angles tell you almost nothing about which direction you will be heading or what exits are available. The map you should be building in your head would be a tree-like structure of locations that has almost nothing to do with the physical layout. You'll miss objects not because you are a bad detective, but because you have no idea how to get to where you want to go.Even with a walkthrough I cannot recommend this game. The revealed secrets do not cohere into a meaningful narrative or image: it's just a few fragments from the life, memories, and observations of a young, middle-class, female European university student. Despite the poetic pomp, there's nothing deep about her mutterings. There is potential for a deeper meaning, but it is left undeveloped.I'm happy that developers experiment with video games and try to move beyond our expectations of how they should look and feel. In this case, it didn't work out, and it would be nice if the developers acknowledge this and set a more appropriate price tag.			"

												TRAUMA is very much an arthouse game, and as vague as that is it should tell you right away if you'll have the patience for it. There's no deep gameplay or clear story to be found here, just a lot of clicking and speculation. This is by no means a bad thing, as I will expand upon, but its not going to be for everyone.The title refers to the car accident and subsequent hospitalization of the main character, a terribly disaffected European woman. You'll be playing through her dreams as she lies in her hospital bed, mulling over the choices she's made in life. The game is divided into four dreams, each presented as a series of still photographs. Clicking on hotspots or gesturing with the mouse moves you from one photograph to the next, simulating movement through the celluloid environment. You've probably played something like it on a Flash site, where someone took a bunch of pictures of the alley next to their house and cobbled them into a 10-minute adventure game.TRAUMA is a little more involved than that, thankfully. Each dream has a goal that must be accomplished using a special gesture learned in that dream. These gestures can also be used in other dreams to unlock alternate endings and paths. In addition to the goal and three alternate endings, each dream also contains nine photographs to find within the photographed world. Some of these give additional background on your character's life, some teach new gestures for moving around, and some give clues to the alternate endings. They can be tricky to find due to the wonky angles of some scenes, but getting all the endings for a dream unlocks a ""photo sense"" that gives you vague but useful feedback on how far away a photo is.During your explorations, your character will narrate what you see in her best deadpan Bjork voice. A lot of this is philosophical meandering like wondering if she's every really connected with anyone, but it makes a good backdrop for your actual meandering. The environments are also more than just photo club art projects, with some limited CG added for dreamlike features. Overall it's the atmosphere of TRAUMA that most appeals to me, the combination of quiet, unaffected musing with a journey through familiar scenes made alien by the way they are chopped into stills. The audio does a lot to prop up this feeling, with understated sound effects and a low minimalist soundtrack that's just the right amount of menacing.Despite the appeal, I still have some bones to pick with the design. Like with any photographic adventure game, some of the connections between scenes don't make a whole lot of sense. Some clicks will tilt your head a little, others will send you into the next zip code. The fourth dream in particular has a layout that is sure to aggravate, with multiple transitions that could only be accomplished with teleportation. And don't expect any sort of explicit resolution or pathos to the story, because you're either going to get a total non-ending or a slightly cryptic non-ending, depending on if you find all the photographs.If you've read this far and are still with me, TRAUMA is probably a game that will hold your interest. There's only an hour or so of exploration total, but it nails that dreamworld feel that so many games shoot for and miss. And if you do dive into it, maybe you can extract more from the story than I could. I appreciate unique experiences in games, and while TRAUMA might not be groundbreaking or even deep in its gameplay, there's enough to see and feel to make it a worthwhile experience.			"

												It's an interesting artistic game that finishes quickly but completely. The photos are beautiful, but gameplay is mostly searching for hidden objects and learning all the gesture commands. It's not difficult for the most part, with only a few parts that require complicated navigation. Still, it is satisfying going from not having a clue to completing the basics to figuring out all the puzzles 100%. I'd recommend not using guides, for that reason. I completed in 2 hours, at most there is 3-4 hours of enjoyment here. I just wish that gameplay had more impact on the story and ending.I got the game in a bundle long ago, but the game itself still holds up even being based on Flash. I'd recommend it at 40% off or better if you are into Artistic games, 65% or better if you just want a neat puzzler for a few hours.			"

												The game is about a photographer who had a car accident which put her in a trauma. She is re-evaluating her life by looking back at her past experiences (which has been recorded through photography) and re-examining everything that she has been through, questioning her feelings and decisions and trying to make a more clear vision of what kind of person she is. There are some symbolism here and there but it's mostly understandable. It's probably the most atmospheric game I have ever played. I believe that it only fits mature audience as they can relate to some of the experiences/thoughts the game offers them. Even better; Trauma will fit non gamers who are a little bit philosophical.Personally; I love this game. It's been about 6 months since I played it and it came to my mind when I went to bed yesterday (this is how much it's memorable for me) so I decided to play it a little more today and give it a thumbs up			"

												This ""game"" is more of a concept piece than a fully fledged game. If you have ever used Google Maps street view, you will be in familiar territory. You play a female who has been involved in a car accident. She keeps having four recurring dreams which you can navigate through a set of photos. You must discover the ending for each dream and can alternatively find various polaroids and alternative endindgs scattered throughout. I completed the game in around ninety minutes. It was enjoyable exploring the dreams but the narrative was sparse, the voice acting left a lot to be desired and the game mechanics became repetitive.Because of the price, I would still recommend this game, although don't expect to be blown away or entertained for hours.

With four levels, each with four endings - one official and three alternative - and a set of 'colectables' (read: photos) to find, TRAUMA is short. So what is it about it which makes me come back? Is it the mechanics of actions which you can use to clear the levels? Or is it the story of someone who was caught in a car crash, and how the levels help explore her mind's state as she recovers?

												TRAUMA is an experimental non-game. You're navigating the subconscious of a woman who has been severely injured in an automobile accident. The dreamscape is presented as a storyboard of compelling photography. Imagine MYST with a camera. The game teaches you navigational mouse gestures as you advance through the four non-linear chapters of the story. There are goals and nine Polaroid photographs to collect in each chapter, but no compelling reason to collect them. The goals are a framework that encourages you to explore the landscape of each chapter.TRAUMA is not fun, but it is interesting. If you like experimental gameplay, you may enjoy this. There is a prologue video (the accident); I wish it had an epilogue, as well. A final shot of the patient waking up, or dying, or *something* would be a welcome final chapter. But as I write this, I realize that perhaps that is the point. TRAUMA tells the story of Life, Interrupted.			"

												Trauma is a casual Point-&-Click adventure game but with a slight twist. In the game, you play a young woman exploring her dreams shortly after a car accident that kills her parents and hospitalizes her. The dreams serves as metaphors for her life, exploring her childhood, her time in college, her relationship with her parents, and her feelings on her life. The dreams sequences are made up of real life photographs, which are nothing short of breath taking, arranged in a way to create a sort of segemented 3D environment. While this seems like it would lend itself to some interesting puzzles, it does not. In fact, Trauma lacks puzzles, however, instead favoring a drawing mechanic.There are four drawings in the game (Lift, Catch, Drain, Cut) and each one allows you to interact with cetain objects in each dream to unlocks different endings. The drawing mechanic, however, is not deep, at least not mechanically, and serves more as a tool for exploring the metaphor of a dream.  For instance, there is a dream where you are running along a road and come to a wall. You obviously can't Lift, Catch, or Cut the wall but the wall does have a drain on it, thus allowing you to Drain the wall. However, when you drain the wall and move past it, you find yourself right back where you started with the game zooming out to show the world is a small sphere. Overall, the game is intesting. It's beautiful, does some unusual things and ends up touching upon certain things that most games fail to.			"

												NOTE! My recommendation is relatively neutral skewing towards positive. Please read entire review!Setting aside the personal meaning this game shows within the life I've seen and lived through, the game plays like a standard point and click exploration game similar to Myst. If one is unfamiliar with Myst, the concept is simple screenshot photographs of areas the one clicks certain areas of to view another screenshot from a different vantage point. One can play any of the four sections in any order in any way because they all link together.It's a relatively quick playing game experience with some creative takes on the effects of a traumatized consciousness within a broken mind of dreams. It has multiple ways out of the four scenarios with all of them leaving the gamer slightly beffudled until played through the entire game. Once navigated the portrayal of the psyche comes into focus more clearly. Although it's just a game, it leaves me wondering about the developers and what happened to inspire such a game and this is where the game begins to take on personal meaning within anyone's life through the metaphorical portrayal of the trauma. I don't recommend anyone experience real trauma however it seems to happen in life and this game brings into question many aspects. The views of the external world viewing the traumatized and the internal world viewing external while damaged.Pondering the creative aspect, how do any of us know that we're not all traumatized and we wake from day to day in an everlasting dream state perpetuated by something else? How do we heal ourselves and focus on healing if we're unable to, by either incapacitation or lack of awareness? How do we trust a hospital that says it cares, but spirals people into debt with healthcare frivolties? How do we know if our consciousness is locked in perpetual cycles by damage and how do we find a way to better ourselves, truly, if we're broken? Trauma (both real and this game) makes me ask these questions. The trauma and answers are different to everyone and that shows some versatility from the developers.			"

												Alright I was coaxed by others to play the game and leave a new review. So here is my new review. Basically, you follow the story of a woman who got in a car crash and a battle is going through her dreams to piece the meaning of her life. In order to play the game, you draw symbols to guide you through the areas (Be on the lookout on photos. They'll help you with the controls and symbols.) There are different secrets in the game on each stage as well. However, the story is too vague still and not interesting. Get it if it is 2 dollars or below. Otherwise, not worth the 7 bucks spent.

												This isn't so much a game as it is an interactive story, but what an enthralling story it is. The main protagonist--lets be honest, she is basically the only real character in this story--has just survived a traumatic accident. Now bedridden for an unknown period of time, she finds herself dreaming the same dreams over and over. The hospital psychiatrist gently yet indifferently prods her on as she is tested on her ability to recover, both physically and mentally.""Do you think that I can be back home this month?""""Maybe. It depends on your progress.""""There is an exam in three weeks. I've been preparing for quite some time.""""There will always be another exam. I believe you should focus on your well-being first.""""Am I not doing that?""The game itself focuses on these recurring dreams as you navigate through photographs representing her descriptions as she narrates your actions. I found the dreams to be varied and quite interesting, with plenty to explore and some truly gorgeous shots. Yet even with multiple endings available for each dream, they go by rather quickly. It took me about an hour to beat the game, with only a few alternate endings not found. And yet this doesn't detract my overall opinion of the game. Something about the German narrator (voiced beautifully by Anja Jazeschann) really struck me as detached, hopeless, confused--it really gave me a sense of urgency as I tried to piece together the photographs and search for clues on how to end this infinite loop of depression. If you are curious as to the insight dreams give to outsiders, especially those of a trauma victim, I do not think you will be disappointed with this inexpensive indie gem.			"

As the other reviews are saying it's not really a game..the idea was alright but the way it's been put into the ""game"" isn't what I'd hoped.It's a really hard to describe thing..it's weird and somewhat creepy to look at in my opinion, I dislike the music, it's also..well, weird lol.This game isn't scary in the slightest yet it still creeped me out more than horror games, and not in a good way.

												TL;DR: Interesting concept, but incredibly pretentious and barely a game.TRAUMA's concept is interesting: Exploring surreal dreamscapes, and gradually learning ways to interact with them, allowing you to later go back and experience previous worlds in a different way. Each dream can be ""solved"" in several different ways.Unfortunately, the execution falls well short. The dreams are tiny, static environments, and confusing to navigate. In fact, you can't ""walk"" at all; you have a series of pictures, and you draw glyphs on the screen to move around. This may have been forgivable in the mid-90s, but this game was made in 2011! Every screen can have a half-dozen different exits, depending on how the writer was feeling that day.There are no puzzles to speak of. Each dream is ""won"" by drawing the right glyph in the right spot. You're treated to a small animation, a line or two of voiceover narration, and the next dream is unlocked. If you solve a dream ""incorrectly"" (i. e. by using the right glyph in the right spot, but a different glyph than the one you ""learn"" in the dream)... you're treated to a small animation, a line or two of voiceover narration, and then told to go back and do it correctly. Whee.There's a collection sidequest - pictures hidden in each dream - which is nice if you enjoy pixel hunts. It takes about twice as long as the game itself and adds 5 seconds to the ending cutscene. These 5 seconds tell you exactly nothing new about the protagonist (her every other line is ""everything is still terrible"") and only serve to make the ending slightly more depressing. It took me less than two hours to finish the game, about half of which was pixel hunting.In short: TRAUMA has paper-thin gameplay, the writing is cryptic-for-the-sake-of-being-cryptic and highly pretentious. The dream concept is interesting, and the game has a memorable moment or two, but in the end, it is overwhelmingly flawed. Unless you're extremely desparate for any sort of adventure game at all, no recommendation.			"

												They tried to do something interesting here.  They just didn't quite succeed.     The visual style is definitely interesting...the usage of drawing circles or symbols rather than just the usual pointing-and-clicking...that was kind of interesting.  The attempt to tell a ""psychological"" story of a young woman dealing with her various neuroses or what-have-you whilst recovering from a car accident...hell yeah, that COULD have been interesting.  Except that we ultimately get ♥♥♥♥-all ""insight"" into, well, ANYTHING, really.  She has a couple of kooky dreams and then wakes up...I think that was the plot.  It revealed absolutely nothing to me about, y'know, like, the ""human condition"" and all that kinda deep♥♥♥♥♥♥ yaknowwhati'msayin', yo?  Either that, or I'm just an ignoramus incapable of grasping the nuanced complexities of, er, whatever the game designers were trying to say.  But I HAVE seen Taxi Driver about twenty times and I understood THAT, so...I dunno, maybe you have to be a GIRL.  And a kinda messed-up one at that.  Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm really showing my ignorance now, aren't I?  Maybe this game just wasn't for me.     But at least it was short, so it didn't exactly overstay it's welcome.  In fact, it ended so abruptly and free from revelation, I actually went back to the main menu and made sure I'd finished all four of the ""chapters"" presented...maybe a fifth one had now opened or...nope.  That was it, apparently.  Maybe I just don't understand women.  That must be it.  No wonder I don't have a girlfriend.Verdict: 4.5/10.			"

												This is a really fun and unique indie game.Being someone that enjoys Photography, I really enjoyed this. It’s a kind of point and click game, a woman who is in the hospital narrates her thoughts and you search and explore her dreams looking for answers and picking up little collectables along the way that give you extra little pieces of information about her life.I really like the style of this game, the scenes are made up of photographs that you flick between and it uses a few photography methods which I thought was quite clever. For example it uses low shutter speed methods to show movement in the photos and ghostly figures. (Low shutter speed being where you take the photo but it carries on taking in light through the lens, so if someone were to jump into the photo while it was still taking in light, it would pick up the light reflected off of the person. Hence pictures of “ghosts”) It’s a pretty short game, but I guess it’s only a small indie game so that is to be expected. It’s fun and interesting and really does have a surreal “dream” like feel to it, which I can imagine could be quite hard to portray. The cut scenes also add greatly to that, them being inventive and surreal reflects the mind of the dreamer pretty well. It’s put together well and is worth a try by anyone interested in unique little point and clicks or maybe even just photography.			"

												This game is something very Unique and Executes with a waft of that ""90's PC gaming"" feel. From the Smooth FMV Transitions, Emotive Narraration to the Immersive Gameplay Enviorments, Methotic Imagary, and Pesudo-Philisophical Narrative, ""TRAUMA"" A Enjoyable, but saddly a fleeting Drug. Though this game is great its flaws are small. The mechanic of drawing symbols to direct your self i fun and rewarding to discover the meaning of each symbols, However in my playthrough, I found it difficult draw certain symbols. In Conclusion, ""TRAUM"" is an Enjoyable, however melancholically Short Art House GameI Personally Wish there was some kind of sequel or spiritual sucessor. I would thoroughly enjoy that.			"

												It's an interesting idea, at least.The game looks interesting and the gimic of moving around from photo to photo while using magic symbols to interact with the game's world has some potential. The art and photography is appealing, especially when it suddenly does something weird, like suddenly sucking up a random billboard or shattering a ghost. It's imagery is a strong aspect.It's just that it has no overal point. At best, the game is cryptic. At worst, the game has nothing to say. As a jaunt into someone's dreams and psyche, you'd think you'd come away learning a great deal about that person, right? I couldn't find any value to that assumption. Most of the details given about this woman's identity as a character don't ever appear to connect. She went to Uni, she went to a coffee shop once, she had a teddy bear. Why should I care?It doesn't necessarily connect or amount to any revelation about the character. There's no real coherrence about this towards any real goal. It's just weirdness from beginning to end. I'm sure it's the point; to allow for your own interpretation of what to make of all this but I struggle to find that satisfying. It doesn't seem to justify it's own existance by offering any conclusion to take from the journey made. Perhaps this is meant to be from the point of view of the Doctor tending to this woman? It would explain the tiny amount of information we gleam from her dreams and bits of information from them, only to have the game end abruptly. What drags this still lower in my opinion is how boring the gameplay is.One of the larger flaws is how entertaining the game is. The 'puzzles' are no more advanced than find a thing and perform a special symbol on it to get something to happen. Nothing amounts to anything more than just an alternative ending. That also seems to be weirdness for weirdness' sake. If you learn what does what and what will only work with what, your only challenge is to spot what looks interactive and what isn't. This is not all that hard either. If you can be bothered, you'll breeze through this within an hour and a half. If you like weird things, you won't feel too bad if you get it during a sale. Otherwise, it's not that remarkable. For a flash game this bland, it feels overpriced. Go play one of the weirder looking things on Armour Games. It's free and likely more entertaining than this.

The flat, partially static environments really fits with how this game works, and all the interactive elements do a good enough job to give you the feel of limited control you are likely to have in a dream.There isn't much story on the surface, but it does give the impression of a far deeper subtext and theme once you dig a little deeper.

												Trauma is a game that blurs the line between art and games creating a unique and an enjoyable experience. It certainly proves the endless potential that games can achieve without being games on their own. Unfortunately the game is short and interactivity is sparce, but it's very engaging to see such a unique world being drawn in between every frame you see.

												I wouldn't consider this a ""game"", but an interactive story that you have to find the ending. It gives you a glimpse into another person's dream. These dreams are very symbolic and represent many hardships in life. As a writer I find this very interesting because it is so metaphorical that it is inspiring, many people would find this game ""unfun"" or ""dull"", but I think it is amazing and one of the most thought provoking games on steam. I highly reccomend snatching this title for $1.75 while its on sale (as the usual price is $7).			"

It is mostly composed of real life pictures and you progress by clicking or drawing symbols, which lead you to interact with objects or move around the level. It is very short and you can finish it in about an hour and a half. In Trauma, you are essentially a person who got into a car wreck and is hospitalized, so the levels you explore are dreams you had during that time. You will discover pictures of your life before the accident as well as pictures with clues to different dream endings. It is a fun experience that can easily be recommended as long as you are looking for something creative and enjoy reading the story it offers. Try it, you won't regret it.			"

Actually not a game, it's rather Art. It felt a bit like ""The Path"", another Indie game.The way you play the game is by clicking on spots to move. However there are hidden photos scattered in the levels. Finding them will give more story background. Some objects can be interacted with, doing specific mouse gestures to unlock stuff. Be prepared to do gestures on weird spots too.The story is nice. We follow a woman's life moments that are like snapshots. Her voice is all right too. A lot of metaphors are within the pictures and photographs, and that's the only way to really understand what's going on. It's not always obvious, but the more you play the deeper you will get into her brain and understand.Sometimes there are animations and those are very well made.Also the music was very good too, especially ""Intro"".All in all it is a beautiful game full of details. Nothing has been rushed and everything is finely made.			"

												A very interesting puzzle game with a very interesting concept. But my complaint is more or less the story. Its about a woman and her family (or friends?) who go on a night drive but end up in a car accident. The woman and her friends get hospitalized and as the woman, you wander through her trippy memories trying to solve the puzzles and as you complete the puzzles, you gradually get cutscenes of her recovery in the hospital. But once you reach the end of the game however, you see her discharged from the hospital and return home and close the door. But what bothers me is...What about the other people? What happened to them? Did they die and leave an impact on her? There was not a single mention of what happened to them. Pros:Interesting concept and deep artwork if you think of it that wayGood puzzles that will make you think for quite a while as you attempt to solve themCool intro and nice trippy theme songCons: Story makes no senseThis game has no replay value so once you play it, you'll likely never go back to it.Get this game when it has a cheap discount or watch a walkthrough.

												Trauma is a weird game. There, I said it. I have no idea what the story is behind this game, or even what the meaning is behind the four different levels. I guess it's all about the experience. And the experience is something I haven't seen in a game yet. The game plays like any point-and-click adventure with gestures so that's nothing new, but it works in a Streetview kind of way. It's pretty cool. Along the way you collect optional photos and solve 'puzzles' with gestures. There are also alternative endings to those who want a little more gameplay. In the end it's a simple, but cool, little game. Is it worth the €5 ? No. The price, at this moment, is too steep, so wait until it's about €2,50 or less. That's a fair price for a game with about 1-2 hours of gameplay.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												This is a short game. It doesn't offer much replayability. It isn't the most interactive thing in the world.But you should buy it right this second because it is one of the most refreshing and interesting projects I've ever seen.Sure, it's kind of bare bones, but it's less than $10 and it's visually good looking. You'll get at least an hour or two of good old fashioned puzzilng gameplay. Seriously fantastic. I can't even articulate why, to be honest.10/10, will one day play through again when I forget the plot, just to surprise myself with it once more.			"

												With titles like these I'm reminded of the so-called golden age of FMV gaming, brought on by CD-ROM drives. Horribly clunky, dysfunctional pieces of puppetry and grainy video. Okay, I'm making this all sound awful, aren't I? Well, what I meant to say is that perhaps personal computers are fast enough these days to make those approaches plausible. Maybe we didn't hate those experimental games, but the fact that the technology to run them properly didn't exist? No more macroblocky and grainy 64-colour video and sluggish screen transitions. Trauma is short but lovably dreamlike -- and not at all hindered by the technology onto which it is born, unlike most of its 1990s relatives. Trauma is also bleak.			"

												TRAUMA is seriously cool. The opening cinematic is one of the first in a long time which has actually caught my eye and kept my interest; the subsequent gameplay is equally fascinating if not a bit conceptual.I wouldn’t know where to begin when trying to classify this game. I guess the base is a point and click adventure, but there are heavy influences from those dreadful hidden object games. Your “movement” is accomplished by clicking where you want to look which takes a simulated photograph centered on your cursor and reveals the world only at that point. If that sounds confusing and befuddling I completely understand. It is very hard to find the right way to explain the mechanics and if you try out the game you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about.The story is fairly short but I believe the main point behind the game is to be an art piece of sorts and to present this unique method of player interaction.While  I wouldn’t be surprised if TRAUMA was largely a hit or miss with people, I think I still would recommend it to a friend looking for something interesting to try out one afternoon.

The game was very short, which didn't leave me playing long enough to become absorbed in any storyline or any of the characters.  The graphics weren't great at all, since it reminded of playing old school Myst with a picture to picture movement style.  It's not a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Trauma is more of an interactive story than traditional video game, in terms of gameplay there is very little to it. It starts with FMV sequence which shows main character getting hospitalized after car accident. You have to navigate through four of her dreams which consists of photographs that are stiched into a scene using different angles. Every scene has main and 3 optional endings, and 9 polaroid photographs which serve as collectibles and to tell us more about a character, like as short FMV sequences. Voice acting is decent, but nothing special.Game is very short - you will finish it under an hour, little more if you want to find all collectibles and unlock alternate endings. Taking all into account it was still enjoyable experience, shallow from the gameplay side, much better in the art department.			"

												Prepared to be in for a traumatic experience if you play the game. It's a very depressing game and it puts me off from wanting to play it because of the dreading experience. I'm not sure whether to call it a good game or a bad game, it's a point and click adventure where all the pictures use photographic frames to present the memory of a car crash victim. The voice, the pictures, everything about this game is just depressing. I'd say it's a decent point and click adventure, certainly not impossibly difficult like Myst when it comes down to puzzles. It reminds me of how Spec Ops tried to replicate PTSD, except instead of a war scenario, I'm reminded of FF7's dreadful depressing and dead Cloud.If the price is dropped, then I can recommend it. Not at the current price when the game is also offered free if you do a Google search. You'll have to beat it in one sitting though, which is indeed quite an experience.			"

												Not enough...Trauma is point and click puzzle game developed by Krystian Majewski.Story isn't great. You basically play as a girl who has been in a car accident. She is now in hospital recovering, and has a variety of dreams which hide her past memories. Ending wasn't that great either.Gameplay is weakest element in the box. Basically there are four levels. In each level, there are a variety of puzzles to solve. However, you only need to solve one puzzle in order to move onto the next level. In order to solve puzzles, you need to draw specific symbols on certain items (which will be shown to you early on). In order to move around the area you need to also draw symbols (specifically to turn around) or click on a highlited area with your mouse. There are also hidden photographs which show a bit about the girl's past or other symbols you can draw. You can play each of those levels again to try to find the alternative endings if you want, but after completing the game, I really wasn't compelled enough to go back and replay levels. I completed the game (unlocking one ending each puzzle) within 25 minutes, which I personally felt was quite short. Audio is quite haunting. Not sure if this is a good thing for a puzzle game, but the music sound spooky and gives a somewhat uneasy fealing when solving puzzles. The voice acting doesn't sound that great, but at least the girl's voice further adds to the spooky atmosphere.Graphics is the main highlight here. The images used for puzzle solving are real life photographs. These are show alot of detail and is somewhat attarctive to look at. Unless you really want to look at some pretty pictures and do minimal puzzle solving, I can't recommend this game (especially at full price).			"

												TRAUMA is an interesting little game where you wander around, finding clues, and drawing symbols in attempt to progress the minimal (almost non-existent) story. The whole game, including getting every ending and finding every photo, only lasts around 2 hours. However, the short experience is pretty enjoyable due to it being different from other usual point-and-click games. Therefore, although this game is definitely not worth the full price of $6.99 listed on Steam, it is something that is worth trying out if it can be brought very cheaply (or gotten free).			"

												There is an easy way you can play this game without paying for it; on a windy day at night time take 10 photos from your family's photo album and throw them out the window. While you search for them in the empty streets think about your childhood, your parents, your dreams, the choices you made that led you to where you are now, and ask where is it all going. If you are a young adult still searching for your place in this world, then you probably already had these thoughts and questions, so you already ""played the game"". Don't expect to find any answers to those questions here.STORYTELLING, DESIGN AND GAMEPLAYEven though the idea of exploring these girl's troubling thoughts via her dreams is rather interesting the execution fails in many ways. The story and the girl have no depth. There are no long monologues that would lead you a bit deeper into her past or her mind, all you get is obvious symbolism, and one or two sentences describing the location or the photos she found. You wont get to know this girl, her family or friends, and she seems to be the most average person you can imagine with the most common problems we all have.The maps are made using an old technique where the environment is a slideshow of static photos, and you click on the part of photo to move to that area. There are also some 3D animations at the end of the dreams. The game is released in 2011 and the resolution of the photos is 640x480. There is simply no excuse for such low quality images in 2011. Other than that the locations of the dreams are visually not very interesting, plus they are very small. In the first dream/location you can only look around, you don't even move, and other dreams are just a 50 meter long walk in one direction. You can click through the whole game in 10 minutes.You have 4 dreams/locations and each one has 1 main and 3 alternative endings. You can also collect 9 photos in each dream. The various endings are just some random symbolic 3D animations followed by the girl's short comment. Then you are sent to the main menu, and you need to restart the dream to see what the other endings/animations are about. Constant switching from game to menu just breaks the immersion.You trigger the ending by drawing a certain shape on a certain location... and that is it. It is all made so easy that in the first dream the solution is drawn on your first screen 6 times !!! Solutions for other endings can be found either in the photos or glowing somewhere in the environment, you can't miss it. Other photos either explain the controls to move around or they are some random photo from the girls past. There are only around 10 personal photos in the whole game, but each dream contains the same photos explaining the same controls. That is simply ridiculous, instead of using the photos to tell me more about the girl, they repeat the same control instructions 4 times. It's such a waste.CONCLUSIONThe photos can be tricky to find, and after I finished the game for the first time, I was expecting that finding all the photos and getting all the various endings for each dream will give me a new ""good"" final ending that will give some closure to all this, but it didn't. The new ending video had few different shots, but there was no change overall. The whole game feels like a blend of various missed opportunities that could have led to a very interesting experience.			"

Short:+ A coherent, to some people probably interesting design (I'm somewhat undecided)+ Interesting topic- Very simple - too simple - gameplay (clicking/drawing through warped photos)- Not much to do generally- Topic stays rather superficial, perhaps pretentious- Irritating voice actressLong:I am planning to play it again sometime. My impressions so far aren't the best. It has been a long time since I played it, but I still wish to give my opinion on it.I've tried feeling into it, but it didn't work too well. This game tries to deliver some emotional narration and story, but it didn't strike me. It rather felt pretentious and weakly executed. You are moving through some dreams or memorized pictures of a woman after some car accident while restoring at a hospital. It could have been a dreamy, surreal game but felt too simple: You move through photos of real-life places by clicking around them or (as seen in games like ""Arx Fatalis"", ""The Void"" or ""Black & White"") by drawing symbols on the screen which you first discover in somewhat hidden areas of these photos. The photos were distorted with warped lightnings and all to give them some surreal feeling. However even I as a layman can tell that this is something you can probably easily do with Photoshop, or by making mistakes when taking these photos you would otherwise want to avoid. Then there are a few rather simple CG animations put in these photos. And cutscenes which didn't feel >that< bad but which are real-life footages, more often than not close-ups of a female actor pretending to be unconscious for most of it giving some hints towards the meanings of her dreams as well as her restoration from the accident. I didn't like her voice actress too much. I had some feeling of boredom and apathy listening to her. Perhaps this is how someone in such a situation would sound like, to give some feeling of emptiness and aimlessness, but this is naturally nothing one feels drawn to, and in combination with the rather simple gameplay and general ""sterile"" feeling of this game it somehow added to me feeling the whole of it to be lacking.So, I don't know, the concept sounded interesting, but there really isn't too much to do in this game. Navigating through warped photos isn't exactly something that takes a massive effort game design-wise I guess, and as simple as it sounds so it did feel when I played it. Not exactly bad, but far from being impressive either. I think there could have been a lot more to do with this topic, seeing some woman questioning aspects of her life and identity could carry power and meaning, but it felt rather superficial as this woman was partly dealing with things someone probably could get over very early in one's life like chasing fake dreams of stars or those dictated by leading figures in one's life. This is something I can't sympathize with, as it has some touch of immaturity I cannot really relate to anymore.			"

												A short, dream-like, exploratory game. Things you discover in one dream will become relevent in other dreams, which encourages you to go back and explore. Each dream has one true ending and three alternate endings, along with nine photographs to discover. The dreams are presented as a mix of three-dimensional space and photographs. It's eerie and dreamlike in excellent ways.			"

												Trauma isn’t a game but it is a real piece of art, unlike that trash Graveyard game by Tale of Tales. I highly recommend playing this game in a dark lit room with full screen; guaranteed total immersion. The narration is spot on and hits the proper level of realism that makes the art much more believable. The narration isn’t as good as Bastion but it is easily one of the above average voices in a video game. At its core, this game is a click adventure. You find photos which will help you find the hidden scenarios which will then unlock the level cut scene. That is the entire gist of the game. The worst part is Trauma’s longevity, it lasts for an hour. With so many deep themes to explore, it was really disappointing when the story suddenly ended. Trauma is fairly creative for an indie creation, beautiful and artistic, but not much of a game. Buy at your own risk.			"

												I don't know how this ""game"" has a ""mixed"" reception. It's more of a collection of images than a point-and-click or hidden object game, really. The entire game is presented as a 360 degree panoramic picture and the main objective is discovering all the angles. Think google map's street view. It feels more like someone's phototophy portfolio or a proof of concept, not a finished product. Discovering the angles isn't much about puzzle solving or wits, moreso just finding the right approach to access the area you want. If you appreciate urban photography with an amateur attempt to photoshop a surreal environment, you might find it interesting. But really, even from that approach it's hard to like. I've seen a few comparisons to Dear Esther, a walking simulator that I found to be quite enjoyable. It's nothing like Dear Esther. Dear Esther relied on an attention to detail in a beautifully designed 3D world that you could explore. There is no world to explore in Trauma - just essentially a folder of images from a day's photography of a city. This game cuts corners to deliver plot with stale 2D images as plot device ""collectibles"" in the form of Polaroids. There is nothing to actually interact with or trigger except alternate endings and main endings that abruptly end the level. This is the slideshow version of Dear Esther - something that DOESN'T work. The most redeeming thing about it are the cutscenes which are actually fairly well-done snippets of filmography. For one, it's incredibly short and can be completed in less than an hour. With some games, this is forgivable. But, with ""TRAUMA"" it is not. If a game is short, I expect the experience to be top notch. If a game is bad, I at least expect it to be longer to win me over. The story reads like a psychological thriller. But, it's done in too little time to make it interesting or captivating. The objective is completely pointless, too. Yes, it's a dream so nothing should make sense, but the first chapter's primary objective is to get a rock off of a teddy bear. I was expecting that to trigger some other objective. Nope. Film scene, then end. The controls remind me of a DS game where you draw command with a the stylus (in this case a mouse). For instance, a horseshoe makes you view what's behind you. But most of the time, it's just a quicker way to ""turn around."" It also allows you to interact with the environment to trigger alternate endings - alternate endings that come down to ""I like coffee, but I usually have it during the day. This time, it's at night."" Whoopty do. Half of the time, the recognition is bad and leads to you inputting a completely different command which accidentally triggers a plot ending, the FMV associated with it, and brings you to the main menu. If you want surreal, hop on an art site and save your $7. It's much higher quality and much more interesting. This isn't really a game and is moreso an artsy display of someones photography/graphic design mixed with a short-film that is laid out badly.			"

												Trauma may seem deceptively simple at first: it's a flash game about exploring the dreams of a girl who's been through an accident. It will probably take 30 min to an hour to finish the main path, yet there are hidden secrets and alternate ways to end a dream.Trauma is all about exploration and is very light on the challenge. It plays like an out of body experience. The main puzzle is navigation through a set of mouse gestures. The girl will narrate the dream logic as she recognizes signs from her real past. Each dream has a core dilemma that needs to be solved. The light gameplay is more than compensated by the depth of story ideas. Through each dream, you start knowing more about the protagonist and by the end, symbols start falling into place. The dreams are interconnected; you will find recurring ideas, and some solutions are applicable in more than one situation.Trauma is best played right before bed. It will make you think about the stuff that goes through your head at night.			"

												I like indie games and I'm something of a ""game snob"". I like the obscure and experimental concept games (Dear Esther was gorgeous--and actually had a story) just as well as id's latest shooter. I just finished Trauma and I can safely say ""Stay far away: this game sucks!"" It's a clicky adventure game (which is not my thing anyway), but I think the game's writer went to the JJ Abrams' School where they learned ""There doesn't ever have to be an actual story just so long as the audience 'thinks' there might be by the end of season six. Let's just call it 'letting the audience make up their own minds', ha ha ha, thanks for the ratings.""(I'm not sure if that was a bad review of Trauma or Lost.)The ""interesting"" mechanic the game was supposedly known for was not really that interesting.

												Not really a game per-se.  More like a semi-interactive puzzle game based on angular photographs.  I can't say there was something deep for the player personally as much as an exploration of the feelings and thoughts of the main character in a short story.  The puzzles aren't too difficult and are all based on perspective.  I can't say I got a sense in which each dream's endings were contiguous.  The music was pretty good though.I got in in the Humble Synapse Bundle, but all in all its probably not worth the $7 price tag for a 'game.'  Again, this is really more like a short story than an actual game.			"

												I found this game interesting, but not great. As someone who appreciates exploring locations in Google Streetview, I could appreciate the very similar mechanic in the game. I also found the eerie dream-like elements to be incorporated quite well in these photographically-reconstructed places. However, I felt like the game design made the vignettes feel a bit repetitive, and not very well integrated in one whole.			"

												Only play if you can play for free, and maybe not even then.The best part of the game is the way you look around. It is an interesting way to do stillshot movement, and it felt nice. The difficulty in moving exactly where you want is the primary mode of gameplay, which is alright for a short game. The game did remind me of early computer animation fantasy/sci fi, where random bizarre things would happen with no apparent explanation. For example, a tower suddenly pushing itself out of the ground, or a line of telephone poles would rip themselves out of the ground and fly off into the distance. I guess I miss the strangeness and creativity from those older FMV/CGI adventure games.So the gameplay is mediocre, but the story/reward is where it falls completely flat. The commentary just felt like it was trying to create the atmosphere of being meaningful and poetic, but by someone who was neither. Like it was composed by just writing random answers to an assignment asking for thoughtful one-line commentary on ""the little things in life you'd appreciate if you were dying.""  "

												TRAUMA is not your avarage puzzle game. They have a unique way with pictures and drawing symbols on the screen to do actions. The game is rather short with 4 chapters, each with 4 possible endings: a main ending and 3 alternative endings.  Each chapter you learn about a new symbol to draw. Every ending is achieved by 1 symbol.Story: the game starts with an accident and the main chatacter (you) waking up in the hospital. You will go through dreams/memories (the 4 chapters) and find both endings and pictures that will tell you more about the story. I can higly recommend this game. It is mysterious and a new way of playing. You need to try it out :)			"

You have to explore the emotions, the guilt, and unravel the what and the why of a motorway tragedy.  ""TRAUMA"" is a brilliant flash game created by Krystian Majewski, you can try it out free in a browser, but after you do, you will want to support the developer and buy it anyway. You explore the memories of a person in 4 chapters - the mechanics change slightly in each chapter or segment; and draw you into a well written game engine that seamlessly tells the story. Can you complete this game without dragging any skeletons out of your own closet?4/5			"

The unique photo-like effect of moving around has... well, there's something that catches me.Also, it's worth mentioning that with nothing but a camera and an idea the developers have managed to create an interesting, eerie world.

												Trauma is more of an interactive story than a game. The story involves a woman who has been hospitalized and you travel through her dreams through a series of photographs. Navigating your way through the dreams takes some practice but you learn as you travel through the different dreams and then it becomes easy. The dreams themselves can be trippy and it is cool to see certain interactions with objects. The reason that I cannot recommend Trauma is that there is nothing to drive you to play the game. The story is extremely vague. You don't know exactly why you are traveling through these dreams or what they mean. Almost nothing is revealed about the main character; only vagued ideas about how she is feeling. The game is also very short. Alternate objectives can be completed but with no story to provide a driving force, you don't really want to be a completionist. It's not a bad attempt for an indie project but it just needs a bit more of everything to keep it from falling into obscurity.			"

												This game has very mixed reviews for a reason. From the description I expected it to be a point and click adventure game. In reality it is more like something you would find as an interactive media installation in a gallery for contemporary art. As a matter of fact it's a project created by german design students. The game let's you experience several surreal dream scenes entirely composed of heavily manipulated photographs. In each of this scenes you can find hidden memory fragments and have to solve gesture based puzzle. There a are also some short videos and spoken dialogue (with strong german accent). You can play through the game in less than an hour. So if you are expecting a full-fledged adventure game you will be disappointed (especially for the steep price). Despite all of that I still enjoyed the game and would recommend checking it out. But only if you are really into contemporary multimedia art or can get it for cheap.			"

												This is a game that's purely about exploration, but has nothing worth finding.There are some novel mechanics for navigation and opening (metaphorical) doors, and there are some neat visual things, and there are a couple barely poignant poetic moments. But there's no information, no story, no emotion that gets uncovered that isn't just straight up boring. You'll discover a hidden photo with a memory like ""I remember this one time I when I was stressed out."" The whole game is aggressively devoid of meaning or interest.The whole game is a set of scenes that you discover things in, and there are a couple different things to find in each one that resolve the scene differently. The scenes are set as dreams, so they're a little bit surreal but mostly just boring, and they're narratively unrelated to both eachother and the so-called ""story"" of a woman who was in a car accident.The closest thing to a game mechanic is discovering gestures and using them to unlock new paths. It's pretty insubstantial, but it is actually rather satisfying to revist an area you've already been to and find a new resolution by using a gesture that was central to a different scene you played later. But again, that one neat exploration element is spoiled by the game having nothing to reward you with except the pretentious, poetic, and incoherent musings of a depressed Werner Herzog wannabe.I literally can't remember how this wound up in my Steam library, maybe a Humble Bundle, which is good because I couldn't recommend this game at a price any higher than free. Only try it if you're looking for a textbook example of the kind of pretentious gameplay-lacking indie game that everyone makes fun of.P.S. Steam didn't count the first time I played, so my played time is higher than it says, but it's still very short.			"

Also it does the whole 'dream' thing very well, images in your periphial vision are blurred until you turn directly to them and the music has an otherwordly feeling to it.

												It's probably better to think of Trauma as an interactive story rather than a game. It follows a young woman recovering from an accident and sorting through her memories, feelings, and worries. The player explores an environment made of photographs and draws symbols on the screen to advance the story and find hidden objects. It's pretty simple, but I thought the story was fascinating and the presentation was very new and cool, especially with the effective music and narration.I do want to note that I've played through the entire thing twice (only once through Steam though) and each time I somehow missed the opening cinematic that explains the protagonist's accident. If you miss it too I recommend looking for it in the video gallery as soon as you can since the game is kinda confusing without that context. And if you find all the hidden photographs you get a slightly different ending cinematic. It's a subtle difference but I found it a fascinating addition to the story.Though I liked this game and would recommend it if you want to try something story-based and experimental, it is VERY short and probably best acquired during a sale or Humble Bundle.

												Trauma is a brief flash game (about 45 minutes) that is presented in the same sort of hypercard stack style as Myst, where you navigate the small play-areas (all a series of still photos) as if you were using Google Street view. When you find a way out of the play-area you're in (there are four of them), you get a brief cut-scene of a woman in a hospital.If you're into art-house stuff, you might get something out of it, but it would be hard to justify the full price of this flash game.

												Trauma may seem deceptively simple at first: it's a flash game about exploring the dreams of a girl who's been through an accident. It will probably take 30 min to an hour to finish the main path, yet there are hidden secrets and alternate ways to end a dream.Trauma is all about exploration and is very light on the challenge. It plays like an out of body experience. The main puzzle is navigation through a set of mouse gestures. The girl will narrate the dream logic as she recognizes signs from her real past. Each dream has a core dilemma that needs to be solved. The light gameplay is more than compensated by the depth of story ideas. Through each dream, you start knowing more about the protagonist and by the end, symbols start falling into place. The dreams are interconnected; you will find recurring ideas, and some solutions are applicable in more than one situation.Trauma is best played right before bed. It will make you think about the stuff that goes through your head at night.			"

												TRAUMA is not your avarage puzzle game. They have a unique way with pictures and drawing symbols on the screen to do actions. The game is rather short with 4 chapters, each with 4 possible endings: a main ending and 3 alternative endings.  Each chapter you learn about a new symbol to draw. Every ending is achieved by 1 symbol.Story: the game starts with an accident and the main chatacter (you) waking up in the hospital. You will go through dreams/memories (the 4 chapters) and find both endings and pictures that will tell you more about the story. I can higly recommend this game. It is mysterious and a new way of playing. You need to try it out :)			"

												First of all, let me say that this game (if you can consider it a game) is actually available in at http://www.traumagame.com, for free. Do not consider buying this game unless you want to support the developer.This game is more of an interactive short story which is psychologically deep and to an extent meaningful, but is greatly hampered by terrible pacing. While narrative point-and-click novellas are usually aimed at the emotionally sensitive, this one is too short, consisting of four chapters (with slightly different endings) and very ambiguous storytelling, requiring the player to interpret a possible storyline.Possibly the only commendable aspect of this narrative is the use of Microsoft's Photosynth technology which creates a very dramatic photo-driven movement effect. An enigma of a narrative game, ambiguity to the extreme, with mild potential wasted by its short length. 28/100, F			"

												When I bought this game I was on an adventure game kick and an indie game kick and steam was scrathing that particular itch at the time. The game appeared to be an interesting little indie adventiure game based on running through mazes, collecting clues, solving puzzles, etc. all while telling a rich story, through gameplay and abstract symbolism. It was supposed to ba a tale of a woman who, while in a quasi-concious state, unravels the story of her demise and/or recounts the regrets in her life, ultimately finding a way to acheive some sense of inner peace or resolve some internal conflict; perhaps while having an out of body experience as she dies or edges closer to death. All this seemed interesting to me as an adeventure game player and I was excited to unravel the mysteries of this womans life and what exactly had happened to her. WHAT I GOT, was what appeared to be a slideshow of random industrial and urban set pieces that resembled something you might be shown by a friend who just went on a walk with thier first DSLR camera. The story was so abstracted and boring, and there were no puzzle elements or really any clues to find at all. You can beat the game or more accurately ""complete the interactive experience"" in about 20-45 min by simply moving from frame to frame and clicking on everything. The word game doesnt really apply as there is no challenge or any sense of completeing anything at the end, its more of an activity center for manic depressives. Threre seems to be no resolution of conflict (nor any conflict in general) in the story, and even if there were its conveyed so poorly and in such a boring manner that I couldn't have cared less anyways.   Moreover I feel especially cheated for buying this for about 6-7 $ US expecting to be puzzled and challenged for at least the better part of 7-8 hours, only to then ""finish the experience"" in under 30 min, with no recourse for return or exchange. Do yourself a favor and do not waste any money on this ""interactive experience"", which was clearly designed by people who thought it was so edgy, unique, indie and deep (when it is none of these things) that it could rest on those laurels without anything resembling what would be objectively considered a game. Some might say that Dear Esther could be given the same criticism, however DE is a much richer experience, immerseive in its beautifully exectued graphics and sound desgin which (with a little help from headphones and a dark room) can transport the player into the setting giving them a large sense of immersion. DE is also short hoever, I feel I could explore the island of DE for hours (and have) and there is more value in it to me based on the immersive experience it creates. While DE is not technically a game it IS a well crafted ""interactive experience"" the mystery surrounding the letters and clues you find on the island are abstract and cryptic enough not to spell everything out for you, but are engaging and keep you wanting to search the island in an effort to discover what happend and why its important. Trauma on the other hand fails as an ""interactive experience"" as much as it does as a game. The choice to move from boring still to still and mediocre sound design make the experience wholly non-imersive. The story is also so abstracted, disjointed and boring that by the end you dont care what is going on or why, thus you have no insentive to continue ""coimpleting the experience"". Trauma fails miserably as a game and even more so as an ""interactive experience"", if you are intrigued by Trauma, dont bother and buy Dear Esther instead becuase clearly more love and care went into making it and it is a much richer experience on the whole.

												TRAUMA is one of those games where you can't really call it a ""Game"" since there's no actual gameplay. It's more like an interactive short film about someone's psyche. It reminded me a lot of Dear Esther, which I also recommended. TRAUMA is a point and click game where you discover the meaning of this woman's dreams, and event's in her life that may impact her dream. It does it's job well, as all four locations feel like a lucid dream.Keep in mind this game is definitely not for everyone. It's not a point-and-click adventure game in the since of The Walking Dead or Sam and Max. Most hardcore gamers would probably be turned off at the lack of gameplay and deviation from the norm of most modern games.Even the story itself is pretty vague, most of it is left to the player's interpretation. But it's uniqueness is what I liked about this. If you're looking for something to wrap your brain around, or are just looking for something different I'd say give this one a try.			"

												I find Trauma to be an unusal case even for a point in click adventure. You are taken in by a recognizable yet unfimilar world and its chilling story told through the sobering, reflective monologues of an young woman, recounting her dreams while recovering in hospital. The atmosphere and mood she sets with her contained, pensive descriptions of her surroundings creates a meloncholy feeling reminiscent to many dreams; this unmutable sense of unlimited confinement and  powerlessness. You cannot change the course of an dream, you can only see it through too the end, what that entails.Its a simple yet thought provoking premise and formula, delivered in a subtle, sly manner. But what keeps me from loving Trauma is the insincerity of its creator, becuase lets be honest here. This is essentially a photography student's portfolio, made into a point and click slideshow.			"

												This is a beautiful little art piece.  The scenery really does have the dreamlike quality that the author was attempting to convey.  The game does possess the quality of brevity, but in this case, that's a strength - any more would have been exhausting.The only thing that might have made it better, and this is entirely subjective and debatable, would have been to get further into the mind of the character.  There are a great many subtle queues that enable the player to relate to the character, with the game mechanics being worked into this relationship in an ingenious way.  However, when I had finally found every little thing in the game, I didn't feel particularly close to the character.  Of course, that may have been intentional.The mechanics of the game are very reminiscent of a game called The Void, even down to the look of the symbols as they are drawn, but that's not a bad thing - The Void was a creative masterpiece that way and I love the interface.I highly recommend this.

												A woman is in a car accident.  Join her as she dreams while in the hospital, and search for clues about her past in her subconscious.  This is TRAUMA, a Flash-based game by Krystian Majewski.The woman has four recurring dreams, and you must help her complete each one.  Each dream sequence is depicted as a series of connected photographs that you click through Myst-style.  Manipulate objects and move in the world by drawing symbols, and collect photographs of the woman’s memories.The puzzles are simple, but sometimes finding them is not.  Some of the photographs are hints about how to complete the alternate dream endings in other levels, which is a nice way to encourage you to go back and poke around all of them.  Once you complete every ending in a level, you are given the ability to sense when uncollected photos are close to you, giving you an easier time finding that last hidden nugget of information about this girl.TRAUMA is an interesting game visually, as the photos used feel like a real place, though the lens flares and ‘ghosts’ that inhabit the frames are unsettling.  Just like in a dream, you never really meet anyone else, and you often know what you’re “supposed” to do, though you can end the dream in many ways.There is a camera shutter *click* every time you move throughout the world, which can be a tiny bit irritating as you go about exploring.  The music, though, is quiet and thoughtful, almost more background noise than soundtrack.  It adds a nice layer of sonic calmness to the game.This game took me 90 minutes to complete.  That might be because it isn’t really a game in the traditional sense.  It’s better described as a piece of art.  The woman’s dreams are reflections of her conversations with the doctor.  You’ll understand this woman’s personality and motivations, but the car accident doesn’t define her.  It isn’t even really mentioned after the first cutscene.  No, TRAUMA is all about understanding this girl’s psyche.imageAnd it does a great job of that.  I feel like I know her, even though I only spent an hour and a half with her.  She has hopes and dreams, both old and new, both possible and crushed.  Her mind has regret and stress, but it is also full of wonder, passion, and curiosity.  This is a mature game, not because it has violence or sex.  Instead, the way it deals with emotional themes that are difficult to grasp.  TRAUMA isn’t defined by the tightness of its gameplay, but by the greatness of its content.  If you have a couple hours to spare, poking around this girl’s dreams is a great way to spend it.I just realized I don’t even know her name.			"

												Great game.  You can complete it (everything done) in an hour and a half.  Your character is a girl who has been in a car accident.  You play through her four recurring dreams (point-and-click adventure style), which each tell a little more about who she is as a person.  Very surreal and creepy (since you play within the dreams).  Well worth the time.			"

												If you are one for diversity in new experences of storytelling Trauma is a must play. A simple point and click game with a pivital way of doing so. Although a short game well worth the trip. As for a recomendation, detach yourself from life for a couple of hours, in a relativity dark room; and progress through it in a single playthrough.			"

												Before I start off, I'd just like to point out that I have a thing for artsy games. I know that some people may not like these sort of artsy games, but this is my honest opinion.In TRAUMA, you play as a woman who survives a car crash and is trying to make sense of her dreams as she recovers. These dreams are captured in a series of polaroid photos, which you navigate by clicking on details in the photos or drawing gestures. These gestures are what you use to perform actions - for example, you can catch a ghost by drawing a head shape. There are four endings to each level - one intended, three side endings that use the gestures found in other levels. There are also 10 or so collectable photographs inside each level, providing for deeper insight into the woman's life and a cute little timewaster if you've found all the endings.I strongly reccomend this game. It reminds me a bit of Dear Esther in that both are exploration-based and are both about car accidents. This game is one of those that have deeper meanings to what is presented in each level; I'm discovering more and more interpretations for the respective dreams as I play more. There's also the entire beauty of it all - hundreds of photographs stitched together and edited to form a fluid experiance. Oh, and did I mention all the mind♥♥♥♥ parts of it? Naturally, being set in a dreamscape, this game is bound to have a few (read: many) cutscenes that are going to blow you away with the sheer imaginativeness of it all. It may not for you, but it certainly did for me.It's really evident that Majewski put in a lot of effort into creating the best game he possibly could, and although it is a bit short and lacks achievements/tradingcards, it's an utterly fantastic game that I would say is worthy of your time and money.

												This was very interesting to play, its basically a mix of an interactive slide show of images with a bit of point and click gameplay, but with a interesting art design behind it. They are pretty much real life photos, you can tell just from the screen shots. Its like looking at an abstract gallery of someone else's mind-scape. You bascially play different dreams (about 4) that have different outcomes depending on what you do in the dream. So what I like about it is the interesting style and design it went for, the concept of the game is very cool which is looking into the mind of someone recovering from a horrifc accident as she travels into her own mind as well as her memories. Also the soundtrack is fantasic, whoever made it should be given alot of credit for really creating an intense atmosphere while playing the game, the intro song is really good and the slower melodies really strike a cord in me, I don't know why but the soundtrack is ideal for the overall theme and tone the game wanted you to feel.But is it a fun and interesting game to play? Its a tough call because this is very much an art project kind of game, while I think its good and interesting (I love point and click games after all), I do feel that at some points the message of the game gets lost and the game is very, very short. I would have liked to see this kind of game expanded more. I think its an interesting project, a little pricey, I got this on sale but still a cool concept, I like the idea of traveling into the mind of someone and discovering as the character also discoveres things they didn't realize at first. So if you like that kind of concept and are willing to try something VERY different from the usual point and click, then give this a try.I would give this game a  6.6/10			"

												Not really a game per-se.  More like a semi-interactive puzzle game based on angular photographs.  I can't say there was something deep for the player personally as much as an exploration of the feelings and thoughts of the main character in a short story.  The puzzles aren't too difficult and are all based on perspective.  I can't say I got a sense in which each dream's endings were contiguous.  The music was pretty good though.I got in in the Humble Synapse Bundle, but all in all its probably not worth the $7 price tag for a 'game.'  Again, this is really more like a short story than an actual game.			"

												This is a game that's purely about exploration, but has nothing worth finding.There are some novel mechanics for navigation and opening (metaphorical) doors, and there are some neat visual things, and there are a couple barely poignant poetic moments. But there's no information, no story, no emotion that gets uncovered that isn't just straight up boring. You'll discover a hidden photo with a memory like ""I remember this one time I when I was stressed out."" The whole game is aggressively devoid of meaning or interest.The whole game is a set of scenes that you discover things in, and there are a couple different things to find in each one that resolve the scene differently. The scenes are set as dreams, so they're a little bit surreal but mostly just boring, and they're narratively unrelated to both eachother and the so-called ""story"" of a woman who was in a car accident.The closest thing to a game mechanic is discovering gestures and using them to unlock new paths. It's pretty insubstantial, but it is actually rather satisfying to revist an area you've already been to and find a new resolution by using a gesture that was central to a different scene you played later. But again, that one neat exploration element is spoiled by the game having nothing to reward you with except the pretentious, poetic, and incoherent musings of a depressed Werner Herzog wannabe.I literally can't remember how this wound up in my Steam library, maybe a Humble Bundle, which is good because I couldn't recommend this game at a price any higher than free. Only try it if you're looking for a textbook example of the kind of pretentious gameplay-lacking indie game that everyone makes fun of.P.S. Steam didn't count the first time I played, so my played time is higher than it says, but it's still very short.			"

Also it does the whole 'dream' thing very well, images in your periphial vision are blurred until you turn directly to them and the music has an otherwordly feeling to it. Gamers who like gameplay and skip cutscenes won't like this game, anyone who enjoyed Dear Esther probably will.			"

												This game has very mixed reviews for a reason. From the description I expected it to be a point and click adventure game. In reality it is more like something you would find as an interactive media installation in a gallery for contemporary art. As a matter of fact it's a project created by german design students. The game let's you experience several surreal dream scenes entirely composed of heavily manipulated photographs. In each of this scenes you can find hidden memory fragments and have to solve gesture based puzzle. There a are also some short videos and spoken dialogue (with strong german accent). You can play through the game in less than an hour. So if you are expecting a full-fledged adventure game you will be disappointed (especially for the steep price). Despite all of that I still enjoyed the game and would recommend checking it out. But only if you are really into contemporary multimedia art or can get it for cheap.			"

												It's an art film in videogame form. It's interesting, and worth giving a play through if, like me, you find it in your Steam library and don't remember buying it. I guess I got it in a bundle at some point? It's harder to say if I'd have been happy paying for it, but I don't regret playing it at all.It's pretty simple as a game, mostly about exploring four dream worlds and trying to find photographs dotted about. There are simple puzzles consisting of learning a gesture in each dream, and then using them in the right places in the other dreams. I've hit 100% in about an hour and a half, and it wasn't difficult. I think it's intentionally as unfrustrating as possible, and gives you hints to find the last few hidden endings and photographs. (You do have to actually realise that they're hints though!)So yes, worth playing if you already own it! And probably worth buying if you're into arty things.			"

												Short, artsy puzzle game with a unique premise$7 may be pushing the pice/value ratio, get it on discountThe main characer was in an accident (hence the title ""Trauma""). The locations are still scenes with cutscene animations. The game is told by finding photographs which you try to match with scenes that are visible. There are 4 separate ""adventures"" (chapters?), each with a primary and 3 alternate endings, but the photographs relate to things anong the different chapters. You can complete these in any order, and it helps sometimes to bounce around since you will find hints related to different chapters.You win the game by finding the primary ending in all 4 chapters, and this can be done in less than an hour. The real way to play is to look for all 9 photographs and unlock all alternate endings in all the chapters - this might take 2-3 hours.The setting is present day with surrealist aspects. In addition to cutscene animations, there are short live action videos at the beginning and end of the game, and after you solve each chapter. You navigate between one still scene location and another by either moving to an adjacent location (visible when you mouse to the edge of the location) or you can jump to a limited extent by drawing gestures on the screen. The puzzle part of the game is discovering which gestures work and which locations you need to use them.The music and voice acting is unremarkable, I actually play with the sounds off since I got tired of the ""Doesn't work"" sound when I use a wrong gesture. The display resolution is less than HD, but it didn't really affect anything.To sum up, if you want an artsy experience with intresting visuals for a few hours, then get this game, but at 50% or better discount.
