								An awesome new game that takes an interesting look into something you dont see a lot of games about...dreams. This game will have you stop to look at the beautiful scenery but have you running through some horrors and have you creep and crawl from the nightmares. For an early access game: Dream Delivers! This is definetly gonna be the game I keep my eye on with updates. The graphics and storyline are both fantastic and deliver some top quality gaming for anyone. You'd be a fool not to want to have this game in your Steam library.			"

												August 4 edit: This review applies to the 1.01 release; the 1.1 release may solve some of these problems. When I have a chance to try it I'll update what's merited.I hate to give this game a negative review since i've been waiting patiently for two years to play it fresh. Unfortunately this game cannot really be evaluated on its artistic merit due to numerous technical issues:- Lots of graphical tearing, despite vsync.- Several menu UI problems, many of them painfully obvious, such as inconsistent highlighting of menu options, confused/incorrect localization options, and even disclaimer text on the remapping menu explaining that it doesn't work correctly (!!) - Several in-game control problems, such as apparently incorrectly labelled keybindings. ""F"", for example, pops a console message, rather than the stated function of ""using"" an object. Small things like the loss of the mouse pointer when using the catacomb computer can be worked around or figured out but are still rather rough for a finished product. Maybe this is just me but when I found an item to pick up and put it my inventory, I had no idea how to find it again. Collision boxes are also rather rough-and-ready.- I had problems with the voice-overs. The initial house section seemed to ""speak"" correctly, but in the desert I was unable to hear any speech, although subtitles appeared from time to time. Even the subtitles had misprinted characters (possibly a localization issue? or related to the localization menu confusion?)Other issues are possible since I stopped playing just after the maze/light puzzles; if patches improve the experience I'll be back to finish it off.On the positive side I found it pretty good-looking and it definitely has an interesting concept, one I've long been awaiting. But despite the long lead time in early access, this game is not really ready for a true release, particularly at this price. If you're interested in purchasing, I would wait a for a few patch cycles to address some of these problems.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, I will give a 9 out of 10 for this game.Before telling how good this game is, I need to tell the bugs I found in the game:1, Don't change resolution during the game or you will stuck by lots of ""nothing"".2, While you're listening to a phone call, you can listen to the end and respond to it. Then, you will find yourself unable to move. Best way to do it without missing anything is to listen and respond to that phone call and wake up. Then, go to sleep again and find portal to get to the phone part again. This time you don't listen to the phone call to the end. You need to try to open the door in order to interrupt that phone call. Then, you shall continue to solve the puzzle.(Hint: the locked door is not a bug.)Ok, let's talk about this game.First, the graphic is awesome. I really enjoy lots of scenes especially when I was playing in the garden part. That sunlight effect is great to me.Second, the music is good. I have to say that I felt the music is too ""musical"" as BGM at the beginning. However, after I did some puzzles in the game, I found out that the music in this game are suitable for atmospheres of different parts and they also don't make you feel bored while you're trying solving puzzles.Third, gameplay is mostly about solving puzzles and exploring. Sometimes it's little bit hard to interract with objects since I could hardly see where I was aiming. However, I didn't find it too hard to do most of tasks.At last, I could almost get the plots of this game and see the connection between dreams and reality. It's not hard to figure out what things in dreams represent and basically you could find that out just by following every single hints, dialogs and sentences on the walls.In conclusion, it's a great game full of puzzles and explorations and IT'S STILL IN ALHPA. I would recommend my friends to try this game. It might not be interesting to everyone, but still with little patience, this could be one great experience during this Christmas, enjoying music, solving puzzles, and getting yourself into a  few-hours trip to different dreams full of memories and imagination.

								First of all i need to tell averyone that i bought this game last year with only one place to go and now a days, Dream is one of my favourites games in my Steam Library. I got it with the discount on it, but i can say that if you pay for the original price, you'll be REALLY happy.This game conteins things that i cannot explain, things that fits perfect like the combination of place - music. I'm a music student in the university and i can say that the ""Dream OST"" is SO GOOD that im actually learning it on piano.I feel very comfortable with the game in all the aspects, and i like that thing of making us collect pieces of paper that contains information about the meaning of these objects or things that we all have in our dreams.Â¿What about the nightmares? You'll see how much you can sweat with a good enviroment and the correct sounds in the perfect time.For me, this game it worth what it cost, and i give Dream 4.5 Stars out of 5. Why? Because it's still on Alpha, maybe then i could give this game 5 stars when alpha finishes.Thanks to the Devs for such a good experience :)			"

								A really nice 1st person adventure.As it's in Early Access (version 0.3.3) at the time this recommendation is written, it contains only 1/3 of the dreams you can explore (if I got right what the devs say) - currently some 5-8 hours of gameplay, and the existing locations, narration (story), and puzzles still get updates, but the final release sometime next year shows promise as one of better exploration puzzle adventure games.UPDATE: As of version 0.4.2.1, there's currently around a half of the game done, with Act II present in the game, yet without it's nightmare dream or story and 1 side dream, and according to developers the story of the Act I is being rewritten. The Act II dream and it's single side dream added for now some additional 2 hours of gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR pretty good but also pretty tedious. Not worth 17$.Dream is a very interesting game with a very captivating concept.You play as a man named Howard whose uncle recently passed away and youare a Dreamer. The majority of the game takes place in your (lucid) dreams.These dreams involve exploration and puzzle solving, in a variety of environments.Pros+Graphically most of this game looks ok+Outside environments are beautiful and very nice to look at+Inventory system has a very simplistic design that is easy to use and understand.+Voice acting is very crisp and clean, and nice to listen to.+Music is very well doneCons-Howard's lines are very awkward and some things he says I think shouldn't be said explicitly-Hitboxes on some things are god-awful, especially the rocks in the desert level (some places you need to crouch to get through even if there is a five foot gap)-The ""pop in"" is terrible. The ground literally changes before your eyes-(This is just my opinion) Exploration is very tedious, I found myself using sprint as much as possible (because there is a godamn cooldown for who knows why?) because I found walking just, well slow. However this might be a personal problem especially because I like going superfast in rouglikes such as spelunky.-The four mazes in the desert level are very tedious. Doing the same thing four times in a row is just stupid. Yes the ""perks"" of each maze are all unique but it doesn't change the fact that it's just the same thing over and over.-I really hate this- thepuzzles have all been done before. Correct me if I'm wrong but I didn't find a single innovative puzzle in the entire game.-Player model is clunky and looks pretty bad, and shadows  are animated badly aswell.Though I don't really want to play anymore of this game based on what I've played so far I'm still watching how this early access title will play out. This is their team's first game, so it will be interesting how they will work things out and fix problems. If the cons I listed even are problems, and not just my own displeasure. Anyway try it out, but buy it on sale.			"

I've made little progress and I won't be able to make any more progress unless the developers decide to fix their own game, which it seems like never will.The ideas are fantastic, but the game execution and programming needs to be refurbished.

												This should still be in Early Access. It's a broken and unfinished product. Hopefully they'll fix all the million issues I found playing it for forty minutes.Edit: I should probably point out what issues I'm talking about. Poor voice acting, audio levels all over the place (one second you can't hear what the hell he's saying, the next he's screaming in your ear), animations missing (just look at your shadow while swimming, it's hilarious), nauseating blur effects, EXTREME aliasing, too much dead space with nothing worth looking at. The stills look nice, but as soon as you move in-game you can see the poor production value.I made a video of the game for re:spwnd -

			It's a game... about dreams... I think? After two years, Dream is finally out of Early Access. Unfortunately, it probably should have stayed there. Apologies for the video fidelity.

Early Access Review
								This was written 19/11/2014 during the game's early access.Right now as this game stands, I would have to say avoid it until it's finished. I won't bother writing a full review until I have replayed the game after its release but here is a short breakdown of the notes I took along the way:- Beautiful graphics and scenery, absolutely amazing to be able to explore- Fun little collectables which express dream interpretations of things around you- Have feet, always a bonus- Little questionable but not entirely bad voice acting- Non-linear game but the structure is a little lacking organisation wise (easy to get lost, map is not very intuitive, not really sure what you are supposed to be doing or when you have completed an area and therefore get a little bored of the beautiful surroundings you are in)- Crashed several times- Puzzles can be a tad frustrating and pretty unimaginative, lacking originality- Got stuck on one level, left unable to progress any further because of a bug which hasnât been fixed (Terrace Walkway)Don't get me wrong, a lot of that is negative but I have high hopes for this game when it's fully released. I have the highest of intentions of coming back to it and re-writing this review to say nothing but good things. But that's down to if the dev starts fixing some of these issues. The one that bothers me most being that I can't progress any further. "

												What happened? Seriously, something bad happened to this game between when I last played it in early access and it's release. Previously, the game was beautiful. The ""gameplay"" wasn't to my liking, but I played anyway because the game was just stunning to look at. Now, well...Visual quality has gone way down. LOD pop-in on textures and objects is VERY noticeable. There's very little difference between playing on the video settings maxed out and having them set on the lowest possible settings. Also, no difference in game performance (FPS) between max and min settings. Turning off bloom while looking at an object with bloom results in a bloom ""ghost"" staying on my screen until I changed resolution.Glitches galore! A number of key bindings simply do not work! They have a lengthy writeup in the corner of your bindings menu ""explaining"" what the hell is wrong with it. Dialogue audio played when it felt like it. The subtitles showed that someone was talking, but nothing could be heard. Plant textures in the Guardian Quandry (first place you visit when you dream) were glitched out, as well as the background on the subtitles. See my screenshots for examples. That's as far as I got with the game. I'm sure if I played further, I'll find even more things that were ruined. At least the game was pretty before.			"

Early Access Review
								Dream is a gorgeous exploration game that focusses on a man's dreams and how they describe one's emotional state, thus managing to be both interactive fun and a great way to get to know more about dreams in general. I haven't played much of it yet though. It still runs pretty roughly, even on the lowest settings, and since the game is generally about taking in the beauty of the dreamworld it may still be pretty hard to enjoy it to the fullest. The game is still in pre alpha and I'm one hundred percent sure the devs will do everything they can to both deliver more great content and patches to make the game run a lot smoother, but these are simply minor downsides that can obviously be forgotten and resolved for a pre alpha title.So, would I recommend it in its current state? Yes, I would, for a lower price. I got it for around 5.50â¬ and I don't regret anything. Dream creates a world of its own, with a dreamy world within the world where you dream. Wait... what?			"

												Please THUMB THIS UP for other people to see:I made a FIX for the controls (both keyboard and controller controls are fixed, follow this thread)http://steamcommunity.com/app/229580/discussions/0/458604254455530274/Beware though: the game has some sections where you need to type stuff....so the controller alone is not enough to play the whole game, you will need a keyboard to type stuff into terminals.TECHNICALS: no problems with vsync, no gamebreaking technical problems. The game runs smooth enough but some maps are just heavy for no reason and I get framerate drops even on a GTX 970. Visually the game is nice and has got some style.GAME ITSELF: Seeing that many bad reviews were not recommending the game because of controls problems....well, I got the game anyway because I knew I would have been able to fix controls or graphical issues. I was wrong, even after fixing everything, the game was working fine, started well enough....it definitely had some good moments and exceptional levels and puzzle BUTAND IT IS A BIG BUT(T):the game does not deliver. The story is extremely simple and you can tell the meaning of the story from the first cutscene. The narration REPEATS itself every single time you complete a level, maybe to remember you the story every time from the beginning. Well, if you are like me and didn't forget anything about the story/narration, you will get stuck in front of the screen waiting for it to develop the story (because 90% of it, you already heard).Don't pay more than 3 euros for this. I would recommend it because we don't have many walking simulators, the game was nice enough although surely not a masterpiece, some puzzles were extremely entertaining, some other were making me fall asleep. I have to say though that the developer never bothered replying on the forum, everybody was complaining about the controls, I was just lucky to be able to edit the config files and fix them. The subtitles show grammar, spelling and syntax mistakes. This should not happen, if a developer invested enough time in the game development.P.S. I played basically every other walking simulator out there.....I like the kind of game, I would put a neutral review for this if it were possible. Just be sure not to pay too much for this one, and don't expect a masterpiece. Simply, Ether One or Gone Home or whatever, they are on a total different level in both visual quality, narration and plot. This one still deserves a chance though.			"

												""When Portal meets Inception.""I think this little sentence summerizes the game at all. The Story: As Howard Phillips, you jump into the role of a young man, whose parents want to force him into a lifestyle. He himself wants to become an author, but he keeps staying in the shadow of his uncle. Because of he's not very successfull in his life, he often falls back into his dreams. The mainstory is about his familys past and the last speech he had with his uncle. In the begining you get a short preview of the whole speech. Now it's your turn; discover the dreams of Howard and solve the riddles you get in there, to relive the speech on your own.Since the story is somehow monotone at some points, I can only give 6/10. The Gameplay: Since the story is based on solving riddles, the gameplay is kept pretty simple:Classic WASD-Controlled walkingSome ducking and jumpingInteraction with objects via left-click or a bound keyBut, like in Portal, it is not a negative aspect, because this game is based on solving riddles.While discovering your dreams, you feel a bit like in the movie ""Inception"", because in this movie the also use the so called ""luzid dreaming"", while moving around in the dreams of others.In addition it is a lot of fun, seeing the dream worlds change, the more you solve the riddles.All in all I give an 8/10 for the gameplay. The Graphics: I don't want to do a graphic analysis, because this game doesn't want to impress with awesome 4K-textures or bombastic real-/quicktime-events. But the graphics part is always a part of a complete review.The graphics are very balanced at all. The worlds are 67% made of repeating textures, but these are very detailed. The textures, that are important for the riddles, are very lovely designed. A picture frame, that makes an impression of a glass-made front and a wooden backside, or a clipboard, where even the clip is well textured, are aspects that make a game deserve commendation.All in all, I have to lower one's sight, because of the repeating textures in bigger areas.Therefore, it is still a solid 7/10. Pro & Contra: Pro:Well done merging of Portal and InceptionOne one hand you have relaxing riddles and on the other hand you have very hard onesLovely designed (dream-)worldsVery clear atmospheric difference between the different worlds  Contra:Gamesound is too low even on maximum, as long as the background music is turned onSome small collision-bugsMinimal graphic-bugs in some situations My Result: Based on the numbers, I get a 7/10 for this game. But since it has a lot of little aspects, that are very positive, I incline a bit more to 8 so I want to give 7,5/10. I got a Steamkeyfor review purpose.This review was written as a valuation inside of its own genre.

Early Access Review
								Currently I am experiencing some kind of crash with the latest update so will enlighten on how I felt about the game last I played it (last review is deleted). For a while I loved DREAM and it still is a great game. Good enough that I still recommend it. The premise is a fantastic and unusual one for a video game: Lucid Dreaming. As a result this opens so many doors to how creative and fun the game can be. For its already existing good points, DREAM is filled with quality. The environments are stunningly detailed and beautiful and even more enjoyable to explore given the non-linear design of the game. Puzzles are varied and at times really challenging to accomplish. As you wander in Howard's dreamland your ears are bombarded with some beautiful and appropriate music. Added together, these things highlight significant promise for the developers' ambition. Overall, I commend them for taking a brave turn in development in this unique setting.HOWEVER, there are a few negative points that really need addressing:- I must be honest with the story. It's really not as good as it could have been. Though the premise is fitting enough, as it focuses on a lonely young man whose life seems futile and non-progressive, and depends on the ability to lucid dream in order to find reason to live. And that simplicity is completely OK if it can be executed well. You'd think it could given that it focuses on the psychological/dream world which opens the ability to produce so much depth and surreal interpretation for an otherwise basic plot. Unfortunately it doesn't utilize that potential. I know it's an indie game made by a very small and inexperienced team, but it still would have been nice to have more in the way of mystery and reason that is not all that well-developed. Things might change in the final release once the (various) endings become available but until then, I can't laud the story too much.- Though it is an early access game, the controls are really terrible. It's easy to get stuck in weird places and it makes some of the already challenging puzzles even harder to accomplish. For the setting of an inner subconscious world I would expect one to feel more ""free"" in their experience and gameplay. I would have forgiven the clunky feel if the game still took some advantage of ""freedom"" like adding some flying sections (a large domain of lucid dreaming) instead of constantly walking/running around and doing too many physically basic 'waking life' routines. Additionally, the nightmares are a bit lacking. Though they have good atmosphere and some appropriately bizarre design they just feel more like anxious thoughts than actual *nightmares*. There is no danger to the player and they always take place in the same area which wouldn't be a problem were there more variation in added environmental designs. Given that the nightmares are the major point in the game's storytelling they don't provide nearly as much sense of horror and progression as I would have liked.I applaud the team for tackling a project like this, particularly as their very first! And the game is still worth buying if you wish to support the game and developers. As excited as I am that there's a game that takes on the subject of lucid dreaming with a very ambitious focus, its current form makes it difficult for me to give a high rating for the time being (higher than 7/10). I'm sure my review will change as the game further improves. In fact, I still encourage you to get it if you are interested as it's full of potential! Just for the time being it hasn't quite reached it yet.72/100			"

												I was really excited to play this game - I've had it in my library for a little while and I finally had the time to try playing it recently. Unfortunately I can't even finish the first dream because of either game-breaking bugs or motion sickness..Before I even got into a dream I got stuck in a bug where I couldn't put down a painting. Just restarted the game and moved on. A couple more bugs and the relaxing pace of the game turned into confusion and frustration.Once I did get into the dream I found that the twisting halls of the catacombs and the blurring effects of the dream's desert environment were giving me headaches and making me nausious.On top of that the gameplay and narration is sub-par as well..-The narration is uninspired and sometimes seems hokey the way the protagonist talks to himself-The dream itself seemed really gimmicky - like what people try to tell you dreams are like (with random objects from your real life in random places / for some reason you're alone the whole time [from the dream I experienced]) instead of actually creating a setting that better represents how dream worlds might actually be like..-The puzzles and dream details are arbitrary and solving them makes no real connection to the character's ""journey""-Small details like your bare feet making shoe clicking sounds on sand (and hard surfaces too), and your entire body moving in a mirror's reflection when you simply turn your head are just a few of those minor details that can really throw your opinion about the game - even though those things are none too important in the grand scheme of things. (The shoe sounds with bare feet really struck a nerve with me for some reason though :P)I haven't been able to put more time into this game to experience a nightmare or finish the game - I wish I could at least try. I just can't get past the sickness from playing the game, let alone the bugs that break the game and/or force you to redo tasks you've already done. If I somehow get the courage and maybe take a pill for motion sickness and play the rest of this game I might edit my review, but I doubt it would turn into a recommendation. A disappointment.			"

												A very different kind of game, one that may not be for everyone. Though I enjoy this very much, and it clearly has a lot to tell, especially if you are the kind of person that enjoys atmospheric, beautiful games. You'll be in for a very twisted fun journey with this one.Full release update: Alright, so those who own this game know that it didn't have a good launch. But nowdays, that doesn't surprise me anymore. Inspite of all this, the team is working hard to fix these issues, and until I see them being more sorted out, I'll give this game a full playthrough.

												A game that showed much promise in Early Access, and should still BE in Early Access due to the incredibly buggy state the game is in. This is in no way a ""1.0"" full release, and is more of a beta, as a lot of the bugs could easily have been picked up by some simple play testing done by the developers. Once the game is very thoroughly patched with all of the bugs obliterated would I call this a full release. I will change this review when such patches are made.List of bugs I've found are here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/229580/discussions/1/541907867748380437/ "

Early Access Review
								As a lucid dreamer myself, I had a special interest in this game. I hoped it to be very weird, hard and mentally satisfying. It was those 3 things and ever more! The word mindf*ck is a great one to describe this game : -) in short. Graphics arenât that good, but the gameplay makes up for that ten times over. And as a musician I am also very interested in the sounds and music. The music was great, but it could have been a bit more weird or experimental in my opinion, but still not a bad job! The sounds and FX are great! You really get sucked into it from time to time.The story is also cool, but I wonât spoil anything by telling too much here ; ) If you like puzzles, weirdness and non-traditional gameplay? Buy it! Itâs way worth the money, and since itâs still in development, it will keep surprising you!Have fun! "

								What more to say about worlds constructed out of one's psyche. Beautiful and often times distant worlds emerge from this game, some, beautiful, others frightening. With a soundtrack that is absolutely alluring and visual eye candy with every step, this game is definitely worth the price, and its worth is only growing with time. The puzzles are also engaging as you try to open up new path ways into howards mind, but those don't come easily, and these puzzles will provide a challenge for most. (difficulty of puzzles will vary) All in all it's a pretty good game.			"

												Dream does a great job at capturing the sometimes outright absurdity of dreams. The game appealed to me because I share that interest with the main character. The dreamscapes you explore are all very distinct and filled with moderately challenging puzzles. The nightmares are scary because of their atmosphere, which is enhanced by the music. I did find some creepy things outside of the nightmares as well, which ultimately makes sense because dreams do not adhere to the rules of the waking world. Still, it was very worth to keep playing, because in the end this game is just beautiful. One minor remark: There's some bugs left at the time of writing which interfere with completing all achievements. Hopefully they will get patched out soon. Nothing gamebreaking however. Just a note for the full completionists out there. They can be gotten with savegame tinkering but of course that should not be needed.			"

								I urge you to wait until release, the game is quite short and is fairly limited in it's content. The content that's there, is fairly neat, but Dream feels very incomplete at this stage.I was also put off a little bit by the claimed lucid dreaming theme, which isn't really all that well implemented. Some features of the game, such as the collecting of scraps from a dream interpretation book, make no sense within the context of lucid dreaming.Dream has potential to be something interesting, but I'd suggest you wait until the narrative and structure are more cohesive and filled out.

								Still only in its alpha, this game has amazed me. It is really unique and different and it caught my attention. There are puzzles and horror elements, but I wouldn't call it a horror game - the horror elements mainly occur in the nightmares, which are separate ""missions"", if you will. Other dreams are peaceful and quite beautiful. What I like about the visuals is the weather effects - walking in a snowy terrain for example feels very real and detailed. That being said, the textures of the different objects aren't really high definition, so don't expect it to look like Skyrim.However, it's the mysterious nature of things that really gets to you and makes able to immerse yourself in the world and story.Really looking forward to see how this game goes on as it doesn't have that much content right now (although having played for 4 hours, I still haven't played through all of it yet). Created by an indie games studio consisting of three people, I hope these guys get the support they need to maximise the potential of this game. And that's why I could be bothered to write this detailed a review in the first place.. BUY IT!			"

								I always thought I hated walking sims. I hated the fact that barely anything is happening and felt so bored until I quit. Don't worry because Dream is not that at all. It may be a walking sim buts it's varied. Its not the boring Island of Dear Esther or the slightly more colourful boring island in Proteus. I have always loved the idea of a game built around dreams and this completely delivers. I also loved the narration giving me a real sense of progression and the simple exploration Dream is built around. I don't care if this is in early access, I love this game. "

												I see a lot of mixed reviews for this game, and while I don't normally leave reviews, I felt I would make an exception for this one as it has made its way to the top of my list of favorites. I purchased this game in its very early stages where not much was complete yet what WAS complete managed to make me very interested with finding out what would be added later on. I was very much drawn in by the narration and the plot, but the overall atmosphere is what lured me and made me stay. The music in the game is exceptional and adds to the dream-like ambiance. I'm not hugely fond of puzzle games, but I was determined to finish each one so that I could move on to another dream because I was particularly interested in seeing what was in this dude's head. Not to say there weren't any downsides to the game. Some of the puzzles I'd be stuck on for longer than I would have liked and would get bored with them. It was still, however, a nice relaxing atmosphere (most of the time..not nightmare mode, that scared theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of me) and it wasn't a frustration that would cause me to throw my keyboard at the wall or something. Overall a really great game with great music, atmosphere, and plot with just enough puzzles thrown in to make it somewhat challenging.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a rather interesting game.  You basically play as this guy who sleeps and then has these dreams about things along with possible nightmares as well.  This is not a scary game, although there may or may not be a moment where something is watching you ;) but it's more of a ""deeper meaning"" type of game.   One of the neat aspects of it, is the level of detail in terms of explaining what does it mean when you see certain things in a dream, like what does it mean if you see snow, or a desert, or candle, or even caves.   I have a very very basic knowledge about psychology and I can say that a few of the things used in here describing the meaning of a dream, are accurate, but others, I can't say since I did not go that far into it in college.Overall, this game is really unique and a fun casual game to play.  The developer is still active with the community and has updated it with minor things, and even updates based off the holiday, which is cool.   I think there is still a good amount of work that can be done to add to the game and there were a few minor issues with lag during the part where there is snow.   Also, it can be really easy to get lost and not know what to do next, which is where I am at, and with little wlakthroughs online, it's difficult.   I say get this if you enjoy casual games that have deep meanings behind it and enjoy learning and exploring the science behind what is a Dream.			"

Posted: May 11, 2016
												One of the only games I've gotten via Early Access just because of how interesting it seemed. And of course, it had to let me down.I understand the premise - I mean, come on, the title - the game is meant to be a collection of off-the-wall areas to explore that escape reality due to your character dreaming. However, the developers seemed to take that premise and pretty much stop there. They ran as far as they could with making it generic odd dreams (and nightmares). In each dream, you find these scrolls which attempt to explain certain dream symbols and meanings, but most of the time they are just very generic meanings (and sometimes they talk about multiple meanings) and do not actually attempt to explain anything relative to your character or the game itself. They are literally as if you had just gone searching the web for dream object meanings, which of course vary all over the place and aren't exactly solidified.So there is not really much of a story to the game; not much connects together. It's simply the randomness thrown together. You explore places that are basically just meant to say ""Hey, the character feels lost or bored or confused!"" Nothing is really sensible nor do things link together much. You find a handful of items throughout the dreams but they are entirely useless - you do almost nothing with them. The scrolls are mentioned above. And besides that, you wander around and then solve puzzles.Now, when it comes to those puzzles, they are all also very boring and nothing exactly fun or interesting to work through. For instance, the entire first dream can be completed very quickly if you stumble upon the mazes and just waltz around in them in a bored manner. You get chased after by some weird mist-like manifestions, but all they do is transport you outside of the mazes and have you go back in. So you just keep running around until you trigger a bunch of lights to turn off - and you repeat for 4 mazes. Once done, the dream is technically over and you can leave. For the second dream, the puzzles there are scattered, like the difficult-to-see laser tile puzzle, or the planet puzzle, but still nothing really fun. Essentially, all of the puzzles are very tedious and boring.The dreams themselves are also nothing that special really. Graphics-wise, they definitely look really nice in many places, and at first they seem like something interesting to go through (I mean, I got the game based on the looks and general premise mainly - to expore!), but then you realize that there isn't much to them. Same generic areas but with slightly different objects, mainly used to lay things out like the scrolls. Now, there are side dreams that you can actually go into, but for the most part, these are also lackluster. For instance, the roller coaster dream is literally nothing at all. There's one that is like M.C. Escher with stairs that would've probably been way more interesting if you could have changed the gravity/orientation and walked up stairs in different angles. But instead, you just remain on the floor and tediously search for openings in the walls and climb up the highest stairs possible, ignoring nearly everything else in the rooms.Essentially, most of the dream world is simply boring to go through, even if you try to relax by just wandering. And as said above, while there are some nice graphics in the game, there are also a lot of places where the game simply drops that and turns them into blocky white areas or places that are just bleak, dull, and some single color without actual atmosphere.Relative to the style of the game, there's also the sound and music, which is alright. Some areas do have some nice music that partially plays, but there are also some that have a lot of annoying noise or quietness (which does not really emit any emotion). You also have the character narrating the game, which actually ended up bothering me a lot, and I did not expect that happening at all. He just says completely random things, or will read text that pops up out of nowhere in the dreams, so his talking serves almost no purpose.Then you have what a lot of people seem to complain about: bugs/glitches. The performance of the game definitely isn't the best, as I had a lot of lag when I really shouldn't have. Your motion can sometimes noclip through things, and certain places (e.g., the roller coaster mentioned earlier) bounce through objects in unsensible ways. In terms of actual bugs with the gameplay, I encountered some, but not as many as others. I had the computer in the first dream glitch out and freeze up, and I had certain puzzles not mark themselves as complete despite really being finished. Some other random issues here and there occurred, and sometimes I had to exit and restart, but the game didn't entirely prevent me from continuing like has happened for some others.Even worse, the developers seem to have disappeared and not bothered to do any more work, which many customers are complaining about.All in all, a lot of things just seemed rather clumsy. The developers seriously took advantage of the ""dream"" premise itself - way more than they should have - and used it as a reason to just create a random, jumbled mess. The general idea is for a lot of it to have meaning and distinct symbolism, which they only threw around in pieces to seem like they were doing something. There's some very slight context here, but not developed in any way.A big letdown.			"

												I truly wish I could leave a RECOMMENDED review, but I just canât. Do not buy this game for full price, and only carefully consider it with a big discount.Biggest YEPS:- The graphics and general level design are really pretty to look at and wander through.- Beautiful music, very fitting for the surroundings!- Some puzzles were beautifully designed, making solving them very satisfying.Biggest NOPES:- You have to take it slooowly with this game, because it doesnât allow you to rush through any of it. Want to grab a map? Let me build it up atom by atom. Want to run around the house? A shame, best I can do is this walking-through-a-meter-of-honey pace. You redid a section? Well thatâs lovely, listen to this 5 minute unskippable dialogue again, since you enjoyed it so much the first time. - Quite often tedious puzzles, some of which broken, so a restart of the game was necessary a couple of times in my case.More proâs:- I liked the way we got to learn more and more about the main characters, giving the player little snippets here and there, ending it all with a nice message.- The Nightmare sections do feel very much like a nightmare and are most unsettling.More cons:- Not having any clue on where to go, what to collect and how to solve certain sections.- Dull voice overs and lots of cheap typoâs in the subtitles, or that the things that were said deviated from the subtitles.- The game doesnât tell you any of the buttons. FYI: Shift is sprint in the dreamworld, and mouse scroll is switching between collected items, use them with the key F, and using the alarm clock wakes you up.- Weird character collision. (so I can glitch through the washing machine, but I canât fit through that 4 feet wide gap?)- I wrongfully received the Runner achievement. Perhaps because I explored all of the mazes before I finishing my first one safely.- *Looks at Global Achievements* Only 12.6% finished act one, 4.3% finished act two, 2,5% finished act three and even less people finished the game. That says enough.Again, I really tried to like this game! But just too many things bothered me to make it an enjoyable experience. Finished the game with a 'moderate' ending. All fine by me, I'm not putting in any more hours to find all the collectable stuff; merely finishing it is tedious enough.			"

												Dream is a beautiful and twisted journey through the subconscious. You play Howard, a man with a over active imagination and recurring dreams. You guide Howard as he goes through these dreams and solves puzzles and begins to unravel the mystery of his own mind. What makes Dream so unique is that the narrative and path you take is up to you. There are many paths to choose from and each them weirder then the last. There are many details in the game that make it's story and universe rich. Along the same lines of Gone Home, you can pick up items and learn more about Howard and the houses former tenant. However, this is far from just some simple walking simulator. (even though I don't think that's a bad name/genre) There are several puzzles that keep you involved in the games story and makes you feel like an active participant, even if you don't know necessarily what is going on. Dream is gorgeous in design, music, and sound, it's game that must be experienced to truly understand. The tone of game can shift in seconds, as every dream, can be become a nightmare. This tonal shift keeps you on edge and makes the game feel suspenseful. I feel like I barely scratched the surface of Dream and there is  so much more to see and do in this journey.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

At it's core, it's a really solid game that's held back by it's technical problems. I bought this game shortly after it began Early Access and I've watched the devs add a ton of content, but completely ignore the performance and bugs. It feels like it was way too ambitious of a project for a small Indie team. I hope they've learned from this game and I'll definitely keep an eye on whatever they do next.			"

								Very interesting game in wich you explore Howard's dreams trying to find 'something useful' there all the time. At first i was amazed by the really cool graphics and the scripting which is done good (no strain on your machine , thus you could play it with lesser pontent PCs). I had fun exploring and sightseeing , but i began to wonder , hey this is supposed to be a puzzle game too ,   and was starting to doubt my purchase (actualy time of purchase , because i knew it's gonna get better and only alpha now) , but then when the smoke part comes it all gets a purpose and its very chalenging and enternaining further on , i wont spoil anything new for you , just buy it , it deserves it. But i suggest getting it at 33/50/% sale going on , because whilst it is entertaining and cool from various aspects , it is still in alpha and you would feel even better that you did not spend 10 euros and only 5/7.5 euros for it.Anyway , when it will be full release if they do it properly as they are planing to , this will be worth in my opinion 20-25 euros.

												It really saddens me a lot to write a negative review about this game, mainly because Dream looked and sounded promissing, but specifically because the game was gifted to me as a birthday present from my girlfriend. I really tried to play and of course like it, but right from the start numerous bugs tempered the delight (almost no tutorials, vsync needs to be driver forced, often no animations on shadows, controller support is broken, numerous crashes, various glitching... and so on). Everything that actually worked still felt clumsily integrated or programmed. So I waited. For Patches. For David BowieÂ´s return from Mars. For CthulhuÂ´s awakening. For anything to happen at all. But nothing happened. I started to write about the bugs and problems in the steam forums, but the developers wouldÂ´nt care. I even wrote a private message on a well known social network, but never got a reply. My latest try to play the game was today, but after encountering an aggressive bug that is known since 2013 (I couldnÂ´t exit the computer in Act 1)  I just felt the need to wipe this off my harddrive. I will of course update this review if the stars are right (and I were actually able to play this without all the hassle).			"

												Dream is a surreal atmospheric journey through a man's mind, as he lucid dreams and his waking hours and sleep blurs the line of reality. The game features some pretty good aesthetics, as the environmental design and lighting is really quite superb. There's not a whole lot of mechanics though there seem to be a few puzzle segments to keep the player interested. The game has a lot going for it, great visual design, an interesting theme, and what seems to be a fair amount of content, but it does suffer from a few technical hitches. Stuttering frames, object collision that traps the player from proceeding, and a variety of audio and option menu bugs to name a few. It's also possible to see through some walls if you get too close, which is of course a huge no no.

												I know i shouldn't judge a game before finishing it, but this game made me want to stop playing it after a very short time and that's enough to not recommend it.I love experimental titles, specially if dealing with subconcious, dreams, surreal landscapes and stuff like that. but this game, despite the nice trailer, falls short of all the important things.This game is unfocused, and hasn't got any sense of direction.You end up navigating vast maps which don't feature any noteworthy visual elements, trying to go into the right direction but failing most of the time; i found myself going around in the same area for half an hour without finding the right path to follow, and that was just annoying.The other problem with the title is that, unlike other games which only focus on the environments and the player's sensations, this game tries to implement some sort of ""logical gameplay"", making the whole experience insanely frustrating, making you say ""What....still not finished?"" many times...way too many to have a good time.The real issue with this game, though, is that it simply misses the mark.The current market is filled with ""dreamy"" experimental titles which actually stimulate thought and communicate with the player's sub-conscious.Journey, Neassance, Rememored, Flower, Nevermind, The Beginner's Guide are succesful example of that approach done right, while DREAM just feels like a newcomer with no skills trying to fit into a market it doesn't know well; instead it tries to lure the masses in with the overused stereotype of the ""Introvert guy with social anxiety who battles with his self-esteem"", without making it interesting.For something that really speaks to the sub-conscious in an engaging way i'd strongly recommend ""The Beginner's Guide"" (From the author of ""The Stanley Parable"").Last downside of DREAM is the fact it's unpolished. You occasionally glitch out, the ambient occlusion is too strong (making the visuals worse) and some effects and animations are missing.This game was a real let-down. If you like good games belonging to this ""genre"" you can check the titles i've mentioned above.			"

								Dream is a wonderful game and has been very enjoyable for me to play. It may still be in Early Access, but it has a lot of potential. I did run into some minor problems with walking through doors and stairs, as well as the puzzle mechanics in one section of the game, but nothing to ruin playability. I love the puzzles, they're clever but simple enough to figure out, and especially in the Nightmare sequences they work very well. The graphics are stunning and the variety of places to explore trange from immensly beautiful to a little bit creepy; overall, the environment is excellent. My favorite thing about Dream is it's soundtrack - it's whimsical and at times a little melancholy, but fits with the theme of the game very well. I cannot wait for the full game to be released!			"

								As beautiful and atmospheric as it may be, Dream is not a very good game. It tries desperately hard to be deep and metaphorical, but, like many other forms of the artistic medium of this type, it comes across as self-indulgent and pretentious. The metaphor(s) of each dreams is far too blatantly obvious, and the real life stages are too few and far between. The narrative of the protagonist is also unrealistic and occasionally laughable. I do recognize that this game is in alpha stage, and the developers recognize that its flawed. They're going to have to do a lot of work to make this good, however.			"

								Now that the game is only ten days away from its release I feel like I have to post a review just to communicate one vital piece of information that the developer of Dream fails to communicate to present and future customers:This game is listed as having ""VR Support"" - it does have the corresponding entry in the feature list.However this game only supports the Oculus Rift DK1. The official position of the developer is, that they will implement support for newer VR headmounted displays as soon as the engine they are using gets updated ... and that's the problem: This game was made in UDK. Epic, the developer of UDK, clearly stated that UDK won't get any updates EVER again. The developer of Dream knows this and is thus, by not removing the ""VR Support"" entry from the feature list, deliberately deceptive.The only positive thing that 'can' be said in this regard is, that the thread where I wrote about this problem months ago was not deleted or locked and I wasn't banned from the forums. So in some minimal regard they are better than some other developers of UDK games, who formerly planned to implement VR support, still want to use it as a selling point and actively suppress any statement of the impossibility of such VR support ever being implemented on their forums.For me however the fact that the VR support tag remains combined with the genre of this game (releasing a 1st person exploration game in this day and age means, that VR support is practically mendatory) is enough to not recommend Dream, as much as I'd like to give it a positive rating, since it 'seems' to be a nice game. I however cannot bring myself to play such a game on a normal monitor anymore.			"

								This is a really great game with all around great graphics and really nice experience. If you have a oculus rift this is something you must check out. Even at the current state of the game and the rift support it is still very playable and extremely enjoyable to experience. This game is well worth 15$ if not more and the rift really pushes the experience over the top!

Dream is the greatest game I own, I don't play it allot but when I actually do play it I enjoy every second of it. The game is so relaxing and it's like you're actually there inside the game. The voice on the narrator is also really relaxing and so smooth. I really look forward to the next update and I give this game a 9/10 which should give you an imagination of how good it will be when the game is completely ready. "

								An absolutely BEAUTIFUL game that puts you into one of coolest puzzle games ever made, anything is possible in a dream and the developers show this full on. Can't wait till it goes into its next stage and more dreams are unlocked and a few of the nagging glitches are fixed that people are experiencing even though I didn't seem to run into any. I give this game a 50/10 even in its Alpha stage it is absolutly an amazing beautiful game in a special type a puzzle game you don't see much of. Continue the great work!			"

												Dream is just that, a dream. It's a very deep and immersive experience. I had a blast with this game and enjoyed every bit of it.My complaint is that the game doesn't feel finished. I can't quite put my finger on it but something just feels empty, of course it's a game about being in your Dreams so I can't really complain about it feeling empty. There are not a whole lot of bugs that I have experience personally but keep an eye on the Steam announcements.			"

												Bought this when it was still on Early Access, but launched after the game was finally released and patched from bugs. The best thing in this game - MUSIC. Sad to say, Dream was a big dissapointment for me. Explorating the dreams and finding hidden paper notes with real meanings of them was quite exciting, but after a while I found myself annoyed and tired of walking and solving weird puzzles...not because puzzles here are too hard for me, they just lack of something that would made me stay with this game for longer. Maybe I will comeback to this later and change my opinion, for now it's just a annoying exploration game. And I really like exploration/adventure games.			"

												This is my favourite genre. Talos Principle, Mind: Path to Thalamus, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Naissancee, etc. But I couldn't get into this one. Just couldn't. When you look at pretty much any random bit of this game (mind you, I have only seen less than half of it, I guess), it looks brilliant, but when you actually play it, there seems to be no point in all this... For example, I somehow managed to ""beat"" the first ""dream"" without understanding how or why I did it. Maybe I went in the opposite direction that the game wanted me to go, who knows... But afterwards there were some brilliant, if completely unrelated, rock hard bits of puzzling. Followed by a brilliant level (yeah, the one with ""impossible"" layout), that, however, was again totally out of context, followed by a streak of difficult puzzles hidden in some multi-store maize. Why??? Such potential, such design, all wasted by terrible scripting. One can only speculate what this game could have been land it in the hands of a normal, professional studio and not a single, if hyper tallented, individual.			"

Dream  is probably my favorite game on steam, and here's whyDream is what most people call a puzzle based "" Walking  Simulator "" , similiar to titles like Mind: Path to Thalamus, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter & etc.But first let me tell you my story with this game, you can jump this and go straight to the ratings below if you want.At the second i saw the trailer i bought the game on its  very first versions of early access,  because hironically i felt really connected to the history and the main character, but wathever that's another story. It was still  a small game trying to make itself work. .The game processing was rough and slow,  really slow  . Along the way some people close to the devs passed out and the game entered a long hiatus of no updates & etc, that may have caused some people to hate on the game and probably send some negative reviews so ignore most of those please.Anyways gladly, the devs came back after a while and they focused 100% on the game, i've never seen a team so focused on update a single game like the devs of Dream, and oh god, it payed off every second. From someone who watched this game grow from just an interesting concept/game to a masterpiece, i highly suggest you buying it. And for the devs,  thank you so much for making this game.   tl;dr/mandatory ratings Graphics : 9, gosh this game almost beat Mind : Path to Thalamus, i was starstruck from the beggining to the end, its a very charming game and it feels smooth af. Some people had some problems with framerate but they fixed it already.Gameplay : 10  Well, its solid and the puzzles are simple,  not repetitive  and most of the times but it can be hell.  (Yes graveyard puzzle, i'm lookin @ u rn).   Well its a puzzle game so i guess i couldnt expect less. Also i was happy to notice that the devs added a sprint key, it makes the game so less frustrating when you have to walk gigantic mazes. (graveyard i'm still looking at u)Audio : 9I wanted to talk about this in particular because i dont know how 3 people in a small indie studio could make such a pleasant soundtrack/voice acting? Howard is quiet most of the time but the dialogue of the game itself is so well made, and there wasnt a single soundtrack i didnt fell in love with.  Right out of the start the jukebox music touched my heart so bad.  The only problem is that there's a puzzle that you cant really hear much of what Howard is saying and you have to really focus, if it wasnt because of that, the audio would get a 10/10 rateOverall : 10 The game is just another really good/hidden gem game, but to be able to see this game grow and to see the devs try everyday to make it work and improve it made this one of my favorite games on steam. And devs, again,  Thank you so much for making this game.  "

Early Access Review
								I picked this game up during the winter sale, it looked amazing and others were saying good things about it.  The game is still in early access, so things I mention here may not be true in the future.From the get-go, the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing.  I am big on music in games and the soundtrack blew me away when you enter your first dream, it is absolutely beautiful.  The graphics aren't top notch but they still look amazing, I find myself wandering around through the different dream sequences just taking in the design.Now as far as playing the game, basically you are exploring different dream sequences and solving puzzles within them.  The puzzles so far are really good, they may seem ambiguous at first but they are easy enough to understand once you start doing them (Sometimes listening to the main character speak will give a hint to the puzzle).  They still take some time to complete though, but I'd discourage using guides to solve the puzzles, it feels really good to solve one on your own :D.Given that the game is still in early access, there are some thing that I feel could be improved upon.  Although I discourage a guide for solving the puzzles, it almost seems necessary to use one to find your way to the next one.  Figuring out where to go is a nuisance, it's cool running around and taking in the scenery but it gets real boring after a while and you just want to move on with the game.  ""Moving on"" with the game though isn't always clear though, what I mean is, for example, there was one point where I finished a puzzle, then it just brought me back into the bedroom, it was as if I completed the puzzle but nothing happened!  No indication that anything had changed, no indication of where to go next, nothing.  Figuring out where to go would probably be a lot better if the opening the map wasn't such a chore (It's almost as annoying as Zelda's Adventure for the CDI, if you watch AVGN you know what I mean), a simple hotkey that pops open the map would be much better rather than going through your inventory...at least if there is a simple way to open the map I haven't figured it out yet, adding to the game's ambiguity right now.There were two bugs I encountered in this game, one was during a puzzle my character got stuck and I wasn't able to move, causing me to have to ""wake up"" in the menu and have to start the puzzle over again.  Another was when I had moved through a portal into a dream sequence, the game crashed.  I didn't lose much progress though.Even though there are a couple bugs and the game is pretty ambiguous, I would still highly recommend it to everyone, it is a great game with huge potential and I know it will only get better.  For all I know the ambiguity is intended, after all, how many dreams have you had that weren't ambiguous?			"

								I liked parts of this game but I felt like it was missing something. I can't exactly put my finger on it. Maybe it's the puzzles which can be kind of ""ehh"" at times. Or it might be the fact I wasn't really sure what to do. I felt like I was just wandering around and would end up at a dead end or back where I started. Of course the game isn't done, so they could fill in the empty space which this game has a lot of.Some levels are cool like when it suddenly turns into a horror game and you're put into this creepy enviorment inside your house, but then there's levels like the huge buisness building with the pipes all around where there's just nothing to do but walk around and find the end. It is possible it was a bug and I wasn't supposed to be there.Overall the game has potential to be really good. The developers just need to kind of smooth out the edges in terms of fun or interesting gameplay. I haven't been able to beat the game because of a game breaking bug where I'm trapped, so this review isn't from the most experienced person.			"

												'Dream' tries to tackle a very ambitious project of exploring the dreams of a struggled (young?) man. He loves to dream and reflect about them, and a big part of the game results in wandering/exploring three dream hubs, each with their own themes and challenges. The more you explore, the more you'll get to know about the character...While I really do like this concept, I didn't really like the game that much. For starters, I didn't really like the character in general. He sounds too old (for being a young character), he's bland and overall pretty boring. As for the dream hubs, they might be big, but they are sooo boring and have little actual content. The 6 side dreams are a hit or miss as well (which are smaller levels within the dreams).Each hub comes with a mandatory (or a series of) puzzles, some of these were just horrible and tedious (just look up the conveyor belt puzzle if you don't believe me).And don't get me started on the bugs and glitches. Thankfully I didn't encounter gamebreaking bugs, but I did have some serious problems with the key bindings. For some reason (I use an AZERTY keyboard), 'Q' wouldn't work as a primary key for strafing to the left (after a lot of trial and error, it did work as a secondary keybinding).In conclusion: It's a nice concept, just poorly executed, the music is very good, and is probably the only thing the devs did right... speaking of the devs, after a couple of patches, they were just gone...

												As a whole this game is boring, frustrating, and ill put together. It has some good puzzles sprinkled in sparingly, some good writing, and some beautiful scenery but the actual game play and graphical issues get in the way.I'm a completionist and I've finally given up on it. Even with three ""endings"" it has no replay value. You know what the endings are going to be way in advance, there is a bunch of dialog that is repeated several times throughout cutscenes that you can't skip and during those ""cutscenes"" you are staring at white cubes which seems backwards to me when the game has such pretty graphics.Speaking of the graphics.. the locations are beautiful but your character is tacky and glitchy which is really jarring. There are also times when I've clipped through enviroments.And the most annoying thing for me is the whole game is basically a series of shallow mazes. Besides the running tunnel maze there is the maze of the maps themselves. and two bonus areas which are entirely mazes. They aren't difficult, just time consuming and if you have to walk through the areas multiple times, its highly annoying. There is a run function but with so many close walls and objects to bumb into its not really any good. The nightmares always clearly coreograph where you are suppose to go, you might as well be watching a cutscene. I wish the nightmare senerios were played up better. The location for them is small and limiting and there are few extra spooky things to go find for yourself. I will say they were adaquetly creepy exept for the last nightmare... which wouldn't let your run and wasn't scary at all. Just slow and agrivating.And my last note. Why can't you access and read the bible verses you've already collected? They are one of the more intesting bits in the game and you can't reread them. Also if you are collecting them its hard to recount which ones you've already gotten when consulting guides... bleh.I'm done with this game now, and I'm done with my ranting. Hopefully the next game will be improved upon. If you are thinking of buying, your better off watching a playthrough... unless you really want to do the handful of puzzles, in which case make sure you get it on sale.			"

												Dream is about a man who has taken over his late Uncle's house and starts to have dreams that lead to puzzles and mazes. With each puzzle/maze solved you learn more about the main character and his past history with his uncle. While it is a walking simulator it also has more substinance than just visual effects. Similar to Gone Home, but with more puzzles, it captures a story of struggles and life in general. Some of the puzzles themselves were difficult, and there was an underlying question if I was dreaming at times or not. I didn't unlock every single acheivement as I got lost, as I believe there was more than multiple outcomes. I unlocked the ""good"" outcome, so I guess that worked out for me. In time I would love to play it again and see what other outcomes are available. I loved the gameplay, puzzles, and storyline.			"

								Dream is a first-person exploration game that is in it's very, VERY early Alpha stages and as such it is hardly playable. Since the story of Dream is still a work in progress, I'll overlook it and describe the aspects of the game that I was capable of gathering in my sporadic attempts to play the game for more than a 10 minute period.Dream has extraordinary graphics complements of Unreal 3, which makes Dream just wonderful to look at and is complemented by an absolutely breath taking soundtrack. Because of this; Dream is very appealing to the visual and auditory senses and creates such an attractive potential for a spectacular experience. From what I could gather in the tragically short amount of time the games current build was willing to yield to me, you explore the dreams of the protagonist which begin in a central hub of his inner mind, travelling to different dreams through gateways which always crashes for me whenever I attempted to enter. Aside from the crashes, Dream also needs work in multiple other areas as well. The afformentioned hub is difficult to navigate on account of it's monotonous white colors and lack of shading, being just short of a solid white screen. The main menu also lacks control binding, which is relatively minor in an exploration game like Dream but is just something I personally prefer to glimpse at and tweak with prior to playing. So while Dream has such amazing potential, it's current Alpha build isn't exactly in a very fit state to be sold and I'm honestly curious as to why the developers released it as it is (I am very skeptical of the applications for Steam's Early Access program).If you're interested in picking up Dream, I suggest you simply keep it on your watchlist until it is complete.

								This game is a pretty awesome First Person Puzzler, every puzzle is different, although many involve switching switches, and rewards exploration, each dream is completely different and beautiful.  It's also pretty stable for an alpha. My only complaints are audio related, (the player character's monologue is quiet and slightly mumbled, I don't know if it is planned to be remastered or rerecorded), I totally recommend it though.

								Quite a pleasure to play; mostly relaxing, occasionally creepy and always puzzling. Being so alone in the game it is a bit unnerving at times but still a game anyone can play with very little to offend. A lot of thought was put into the gameplay, lighting and puzzles. I find the music perfectly complimenting to the varying environments and non repetitive it really enhances the experience. If you are an active or highly imaginative dreamer.. this game is worth chekcing out.			"

												The idea behind this game seemed interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes of trying to play it, it doesn't seem very well executed, and the technical glitches (specifically with controls, keyboard or gamepad) were really off-putting. I probably won't be coming back to this for a while.			"

								I appreciate this game for what it is. It seems a but buggy and poorly optimized though. I have a pretty good PC rig and despite turning on AA etc. I still get horrible screen tears throughout this game, especially while awake. OK, as for the game itself - it is very unique, has interesting puzzles and despite being poorly optimized some of the areas can be breathtaking! I got the game on sale for around 3 bucks but if you like exploring, solving small puzzles and interesting environments - you may like dream. I can highly recommend it, on a good sale (less then 10 bucks) but I can not (despite the love someone is obviously putting into this game) recommend it at full price, at this point in time but they update constantly and may very well be worth the full price once finished. I was really impressed (and confused) by the Escher-esque level.			"

								I really enjoyed this game. It doesn't have an interesting story or gameplay, but damn, it's atmospheric! The graphics are not good, nothing special, but sooo beautiful and the music is just brilliant, I really love it. It's always fitting, producing an extremely good atmosphere in combination with the graphics and just general design. I made probably about 30 screenshots while playing and every single one of them could absolutely be used as Background picture, because it's just beautiful. The only thing I think should be improved, is that it's sometimes really unclear what you have to do. I like if I have to find out things myself, but there should be some small guidance by the game in certain situations in my opinion, because there were moments while playing where I just ran around the world for at least half an hour and didn't get what I had to do at all. Anyway: If you like quiet, atmospheric games, this is definitely one for you!			"

												First and foremost, I didn't like this game upon purchasing way back when, almost half a year ago. The mechanics got some taking used to, the puzzles were sometimes difficult, almost unfair. So I stopped playing. Flash forward to several months later, when the creators of the game made leaps and bounds towards one of the best games I've ever played. The voice acting is more fluid, I know the characters better because of the little conversations in between and during dreams. As a young adult who will inherit property someday, I'd never thought a game could put my hesitance and challenges into words like this game does. The music is wonderful, creative and sometimes a little bittersweet. I've never enjoyed a soundtrack more. The graphics are beautiful, so much in fact that I sometimes play just to take a peek at the rolling desert sand. The storyline makes this game a gem in a plethora of crappy indie games. The humor is kind, in fact, the entire game is kind. You never feel rushed unless playing a nightmare, and even then you're free to explore as much as you want. The only thing that needs a little improving are the puzzles. They can be frustrating and almost nonsensical sometimes, but otherwise, 8.5/10			"

												This post is on behalf of Thorin from  Feed Me PixelsOverall, I feel that this game is average when considering its indie roots. If this game went on sale, I would probably pick up a copy and play through it once, especially if I had an oculus rift, or was wondering, âWhat should I do with my life?â. While it does have some issues with the mechanics, this game does a great job of making you feel emotions and immersing you into a great world.Check out the full review here: http://feedmepixels.com/dream-review/ "

								Do NOT buy this game at least until it is finished.  I encountered a bug even before I began a new game.  The entire first level is walking around 3 different mazes accomplishing the same task, if that's your idea of fun, try Talos Principle. After that, you're back at the house and then trapped in a living room with an answering machine. BUG HERE, if you touch anything with an audiosource, the answering machine stops playing and your stuck. yay.Developers: If you're going to sell a game that's in Beta, be kind enough to playtest and get all the bugs out of the early release version, while you work on the REAL game.I'm out 16$ for a game I played 10 minutes before I gave up.

												Definitely one of the most aesthetically pleasing game you will find on the Steam marketplace, from its beautiful soundtrack to completely stunning atmosphere, Dream provides a euphoric feel that you will definitely not find from any other game. My personal favorite part of this game is, of course, the soundtrack, Norman Legies does such a wonderful job with the music in this game (using even Spirited Away for inspiration!) that it really puts Dream to a whole new level.The game runs superb (besides few FPS drops in the Guardian Quandary) and looks extremely gorgeous even on low settings. If you do not have the highest end computer do not turn away to such a wonderful game, give it a shot because it works fine on my crappy laptop! (And if not you can always refund :D) It is definitely worth it the price, considering how much work the devs have put into it. As for the gameplay it is very puzzle orientated, but I do not believe that the puzzles are too difficult and many of the harder ones have guides so it's not too tough to progress. If you love challenging yourself while appreciating beautiful landscape around you, then this is the game for you.As for the issues with the game itself, I too have grown quite tiresome of them, the game indeed did run better during early access, but hey its Hypersloth's FIRST game, heck look at DayZ Standalone the game barely runs and no one complains about it. The devs have answered many questions concerning issues and in just one day have fixed MANY of the problems. However I do wish the developers were more active in responding, I've sent many emails for help and even made 3 different posts in discussions for help with no response. I understand they can be busy, but it gets annoying to see other problems being addressed and the ones I have not. But overall this game is a must try and I recommend it to anyone with a curious mind!			"

								At first, I wasn't too sure whether to spend my money on something else since it was an alpha and the first game of the studio who made this game, but the overall look got me over. I must say I was impressed by the graphic quality and storyline in which this was delivered. The soundscapes are extremely well made, not too loud and very immersing. It also brings a reflexion to the player, in which you superpose yourself into the main character, which makes it a psychologically changing game. If you'd were to consider that game, don't hesitate! 10/10			"

								I bought this game in the Halloween of 2013, during Early Acess period. Oct. 31 is my bday, and buying this during the sale was a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ good decision. First of all, i congratulate the developers. They launched the game a few days ago, after some years of developing, and they did a fantastic job. They listened to the community and didnt abandon the game, fixing bugs and hearing suggestions, unlike many other Early Acess developers did in their projects. Dream is a game unlike any other. You can relate to other games, of course, like Gone Home or Dear Esther, but Dream has that factor that makes the game rather unique. I dont know if its the atmosphere, the story or even the soundtrack, this game nails it. The puzzles can be quite hard without a guide, which can be frustrating but rewarding. There are lots of things you can explore in the game, if you enjoy exploring, you will love this game. I wont spoil the story, but i can guarantee its nice. The graphics are excellent.I really enjoyed playing Dream during Early Acess, and now that the game is officialy launched, im ready to play all over again and enjoy this beautiful experience.			"

								I totally loved this game.  Seriously, it is everything I love in the casual, exploratory genre.  Beautiful graphics, puzzles to solve that are not super hard, but also not obvious. The music is decent and relaxing.  Nightmare music is creepy in a Stephen King way, but even the nightmares can not be classified as 'horror'.  Not at all. Each Act (there are currently 3) is filled with puzzles, hidden surprises that take you to another side dream or two and I even enjoyed the story line and narrative even though its not finished.  There are a few minor technical glitches, but just do a search in discussion forum on Steam and you'll find out what you need to know. Congratulations to the Devs and I'm looking forward to the next update! :)			"

												The burning question I was left with after my time with Dream was: so what? You travel through three thematically unconnected areas, each of which eventually lead back to a 'nightmare' version of the house you begin in. After each 'nightmare' - featuring such startlingly original imagery as creepy dolls and threatening messages appearing in blood on the walls - is completed you hear an additional portion of the conversation at the start of the game. Along the way you can visit brief diversions known as 'side dreams', which again bear no thematic relevance to anything, and which occasionally 'reward' you with an inventory item, none of which do anything of note. 90% of the time your inventory is completely extraneous, as puzzles are solved using the environment exclusively.What is the point of all this? What does a desert, a bizarre business's HQ, a holiday resort, a theme park, or any of the other crap you encounter have to do the protagonist's desire to become a writer? Why do I need to turn off lights in a maze, sort out vacationers' meal orders or connect a bunch of lasers to progress in the game? This is not symbolic of anything. It's not deep and meaningful, no matter how many vacuous Cliffs Notes about dream symbology the devs want to cram in. These are just arbitrary roadblocks between the player, and hearing the remainder of a none-too-interesting conversation.I kept waiting for the denouement that would tie it all together, but it never arrived. This game would have been better served by completely foregoing its sorry excuse for a narrative and just providing each section without any context beyond that of being a puzzle game. The title would still be resoundingly mediocre, but at least it wouldn't be pretentious to boot.			"

								I haven't even finished this game, nor feel close to it and I am utterly amazed at the artistry and depth this free-roam dreamy adventure, and how it dazzles and emerges the mind into the first person perspective. Even not finished entirely as a greenlight game, this feels like a masterpiece with only a few small aesthetics to iron out that are easily forgettable while passing through each elaborately clean and well themed environment.Truly a place of dreams. And if you happen to be fortunate enough to own a Oculus, this is definitely one of the titles worthwhile to sail under the flagship of virtual reality gaming infancy, exceptionally so for the price.If you don't care much for puzzles and want straight action, this game, however, is not for you, but I recommend giving it a try sometime on a insomnia-driven night.

								This is feedback for the developers.The level with the mazes needs work. It's just not engaging to solve a puzzle by running through lights in a maze. It'd be forgiveable if it was just once but we have to do it four times. It's not a good enough concept to deserve that much time and attention. It's as if the devs fell too deeply in love with their maze idea and nobody had the guts to tell them it's not that great.Here's some constructive feedback:1: Get rid of 3 of the maze stages. I know that's a lot of hard work down the drain, but please just do it. Allowing players to skip it with a penalty isn't a good enough reason for the devs to bypass a conceptual flaw.2: Fix the glitch in the surveillance stage where activating the door while the guy on the phone is still talking cuts off his speech.3: Remove the screen bounce entirely. It's more distracting than immersive.4: Make the sprint button more reliable. Using sprint was a gamble as to whether or not it would work.5: Pie in the sky: start the experience with a mystery. It can be as simple as one still image at the beginning showing a hint about what's going to happen. Bait us. Give us something to discover throughout the course of the game. This kind of thing will help us muster through the slower parts and mitigate a lot of dullness.			"

								**Before anything i recomend you have good or great computer to run this game**Wow, what a game. The scenery can change at the snap of a finger. And its absolutely beautiful, any and every scenery is like something out of a book. I find myself in odd situations that take my brain to figure them out. A true puzzle game. It requires patience, observation and a sense of adventure. Its not anything that can be done in a night. I have a couple of hours on this game already and ive but scratched the surface of whats to come. I cant help but the feeling of going down a ladder through the labyrinth that is within man. 9/10. Only reason its a 9/10 is a dont see myself playing it after im done. But hey, that'll take a while.			"

								I just didn't get this game. I gave it an hour and tried to get in to the concept and feeling and story of the game, but it was just too bizarre for me. As another reviewer says, which I feel myself, I feel the game is attempting to be deeper than it is. That, and I don't have a huge love for open exploration games. Games similar to this would be Gone Home and Dear Esther. However, this is of course an early access review. As it stands, I can't recommend the game as I sadly didn't really get in to it, but when the game is released I will absolutely retry it from the beginning and amend my review where appropriate. I have voted ""Yes"" because I don't believe it deserves a ""No"". Again, I'll review on release.Nilesy			"

												Dream is an abstract, puzzle-driven game that takes you through various beautiful environments. You take on the role of Howard Phillips (haha, get it?) Your uncle (a successful writer) has just died and bequethed his estate to you. You soon find that nights spent there lead to strange, surreal dreamscapes. Each dream presents a variety of challenging puzzles you must complete to develop your sense of self-worth, while nightmare scenarios serve to haunt you with your own insecurities. The graphics and soundtrack are lovely, the voice-acting is pretty good, the puzzles sufficiently engaging and the whole experience wraps up nicely into a fun game.			"

								I think it's a great game, the shapes of objects aren't too great, but it's all fixed by the AMAZING light and shading. the world is so vivid and nice. I can wander around for hours in this place. the fps might be a bit low on lower end pc's but that should not stop you from buying it, it will be patched. also the voice of the main character is so calm and easy to listen to. This might not be a game for everyone, but if you liked the trailers you will love it!			"

Only buy this game if you like Exploration and environmental puzzles. However, I would love to see a connection between Howard and his dreams and some kind of related story. 3.5/5			"

												This game genuinely makes me feel ill. I think it is probably the way the screen sways that makes me feel sick; even when you are standing still the screen sways slightly (this is most noticeable when interacting with small objects) which causes various objects to flicker at the edges as they get redrawn. The other factor is that may be contributing is the excessive use of blurring, objects a moderate distance away are blurry and the game uses even more blur and distortion at points of the game e.g. at level transitions. Whatever the cause it is really difficult to look favourably on a game that I can only play for short periods of time without risking losing my lunch.The game is mostly a wandering about then solving very arbitrary feeling puzzles. After completing a level you are rewarded by being made to listen to the protagonist emotionlessly moan about his first world problems for a bit. The game is relatively short with only three core levels which felt uninspired. I've said this before about Dreamkiller when you set you game in a dream you have a wonderful opportunity to design levels that break the normal rules of reality but the game failed to take advantage of that with the exception of the side dream based on Escher's Relativity, that was excellent.It is difficult to say how much my opinion of the underlying game was coloured by how ill it made me feel but I don't think I could recommend this game even without the nausea.

												Well I was looking forward to trying this out but when the controlls only partially work I just give up. On keyboard I can't jump or sprint. On controller I can only interact with lights and dorrs with interact button and I also can't sprint. I've tried using the Steam controller too and was not able to achieve anything better. Buttons also won't rebind.From the sounds of it everything screwed up after the last fix. There hasn't been any response from the devs either on the diiscussions thread. Until I see an update that fixes these issues I can't recommend this game. If things get fixed I will update this review.Update to review:Well thanks to rogermorse I was able to have working controls. It's still a knock on the game though as the developer should be doing this not the community. After getting working controls I had the game lock up on my about 4 times. I gave up that night and tried again next day. I played around for about an hour and just can't find any enjoyment in this game. I have no clue what to do. I wandered around his dream where I found another door to continous hallways which wasn't fun. I finally found another door which brought me back to where I originally was in the dream. After that I'm done.Seemed like it could have been a cool game but with the issues I've had and not having to much fun with it after I got controls I can't change to a recommendation.			"

												This one came out as a gorgeous, engaging and fun explorer with some big annoyances, but overall worth experiencing. I'm not sure where I picked Dream up, but the narrative and dialogue hooked me right away, and the simple gameplay and gorgeous world were enough to keep me there and the weird and interesting rewards for exploring brought it up a level. Unfortunately it also frustrated the hell out of me and felt rushed and incomplete at stages, especially because of some jarring technical problems which are actively difficult to avoid in certain areas. Fortunately due to the non-linear nature of Dream and because of the casual gameplay, these problems are only as apparent as the sections they're found in, and can be mostly ignored if so desired.HighlightsDream differs from most games in it's genre by not sticking to a linear path, and instead offering the player the ability to approach whatever they like after the initial segment. This gives a casual hands-off approach to exploration and puzzles that means revisiting the game lowers any frustrations it has, and keeps it pleasant. It's also a very good looking title, and the tone, atmosphere and theme for each section and subsection is done well. The clever writing help out too and all combine fairly well.The puzzles are a mixed bag of really quite fun to bloody laborious and frustrating, but overall they're mostly engaging and with a fair pay off which again is helped by the clever writing and steady narration.Mistakes & AnnoyancesWhile there are some very minor issues I found with annoying level design or small graphical problems, they're all negligible and don't take away from the game at all and the only issue with Dream from a gameplay standpoint was that it was often far too ambiguous, vague or lacking in showing the player how to progress and I found myself looking up a guide or walk through rather than being able to deduce from my surroundings or steps so far how to accomplish something. I understand that the nature of the game is meant to be soft and ambiguous to fit in with the dreamlike nature, but when that makes it harder rather than easier for the player to establish a foothold on the games good points, it's simply bad design.The main complaint however, is the technical problems, and it's a shame that it's such a meaty complaint that harms the game overall.The one I had most troubles with, and probably the biggest complaint from the community involves a particular level where interacting with movement control hubs is either slow and misaligned or simply flat out broken. The cursor routinely disappears when interacting with computer terminals and causes issues. Oculus Rift support is all but an afterthought, and is currently completely broken. I ran into one instance where I jumped out of an elevator and found a secret hidden floor that I thought was a really cool setup for a level; instead after falling down a tunnel for 5 minutes I realized it was a level design glitch and I wasn't even supposed to be there, and there are countless other bugs and problems others have had I haven't approached.There have been consistent updates from the developers addressing technical problems with Patch 1.1 in particular addressing keybindings, collision, menu items and more. It's just a shame there are still so many issues and that the time needed to polish and patch this game was never given throughout development.RecommendationsAt Â£12.99/15.99â¬/$16.99, Dream is probably fairly priced, but given the availability of alternatives and titles of the same ilk, it's not great value for money if you're weighing your options. Both NaissanceE and The Stanley Parable, for comparison, more linear but slightly similar titles with equally attractive visuals and more polish, and I'd argue much more engaging overall, are around 25% cheaper and so probably better purchases when choice matters.The soundtrack is worth pointing out as being good, but like the game, it's quite mellow and ambient, and justifying half the cost of the game again isn't realistic. If on sale, it may be better value for money.* There's a great explanation and commentary on the soundtrack by the creator here on Dreams' website which is worth a read for the music fans[dreamthegame.co.uk]* The original pre-Kickstarter thread with the concept of Dream from the devs is still up on reddit hereUnedited review notes 09/09/2015 for Dream:

+Blurring of reality and dreams is nice and soft
+Great looking worlds and environments
+More content than you realize, nightmares & side dreams etc
-Too predictable and not confusing enough after a level or two
-Tech: Monitor cursor annoyingly hard to find/disappears. Huge frustrating tech issues on Act 3 Ultinsula resort
-Inconsistent difficulty
-Act 3 ultinsula is a f***ing chore, looks great but just frustrating

One of which I have found completely stops me from progressing further in the game in Act 3.I actually like this game (to an extent for the time being), but I wouldn't suggest buying this right now. I sincerely hope as many of the reported bugs as possible have been tended to, then I just might change this review.			"

								I went in to this game a little iffy. I bought it because it looked visually satisfying and its actually quiet stunning. I did a little let's play on Youtube and I plan to do more becuase (though it being alpha) it actually plays quiet well. The story immeadeatly drops you in but it works really well. At times your exploring doing simple puzzels and entering Dream state then next thing you know, your running for your life! I recomend this game to people who enjoy a story but not really to anybody who likes fast pace games. It's a little slow and could get confusing but for a alpha, it runs well. Alpha review: 8.5/10 I do expect that to higher on final games release.Cheers to the developers.			"

												Almost every other review is complaining about bugs, but I have a different problem: Howard. Every single word he utters is maddeningly pathetic. He's excruciatingly lame; a space where a personality should be. I eventually started to hope that the nightmares would consume him, because at least that would make him sort of interesting.So... why am I recommending this game? Because, amazingly, if you're able to look past a few bugs, a clunky interface, and the fact you're playing as Howard, then there's actually a genuinely interesting experience to be had here. The world design is seriously beautiful, and the puzzles are - for the most part - very well designed (if a bit on the easy side). Most importantly, the developers have done a fantastic job of translating dream experiences into meaningful gameplay mechanics and level design. Everything feels *almost* coherent, but constantly falling apart. Meaning always seems to be scattered around, just within your reach, but you can never quite grasp it. Symbols and items repeat themselves throughout each dream and nightmare in a semi-ordered yet mostly disjointed fashion. All of this is very well done, and generally leads to a great gaming approximation of dreaming.So yeah, despite its obvious flaws, it's a beautiful and unique experience which I'd heartily recommend... if you can forget you're playing as Howard.

												Dream is quite the interesting game. At its core, it's supposed to be a first-person interactive story adventure game, much like Gone Home or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. If you go into experiencing Dream with that mindset, you'd expect it to have a captivating story and memorable characters. Unfortunately, Dream falls flat in that category with a story that's pretty unfulfilling and the main character, Howard, won't ever really grab your attention.Now if you can look past the subpar story, then Dream is a pretty neat experience. Like others have said, it has absolutely stunning environments and its soundtrack fits the game perfectly. The puzzles range from easy to perplexing (I'm looking at you conveyor belt!), but they're all satisfying when you finally complete them. Yes, some of them might be familiar if you're a fan of puzzle games, but they fit in with the game and is a nice way of adding gameplay to the exploration.It's just a shame really that you don't learn more about Howard, or want to care about him at all throughout the game. Anything to stir emotion is better than none - but you'll walk away forgetting who Howard was or what role he even played in the game. I'd prefer if the game made me hate him or love him, but it made me feel apathetic towards him.The game is non-linear and has multiple endings, and I recommend not rushing through it because the ""default"" ending is pretty bland. Take your time and explore everything that HyperSloth built out in the game and it's a pretty enjoyable experience, albeit not very memorable.You can read my full review on Dream at: http://www.fullcleared.com/2015/08/17/dream-pc-game-review-wild-imagination/ "

								I have to say this is a very interesting and a rather interesting concept focusing on lucid dreaming. The visuals are suitably pleasing and there isn't much of a story the individual dreams make up the 'missions' each taking place in a completly different section with interesting puzzles to solve, the soundtrack is also nice and relaxing as well but for every dream there is a nightmare but while there aren't actualy nightmares  there are sections which can be startling or downright creepy which gives a nice contrast to the surrealism of the nice dreams. On the whole I like this game a lot, it's fun, interesting and has some nice puzzles to it and I do heartily recomend it for the spectical alone.Check out my youtube channel for a playthrough and other videos

								Almost could have been something!Its different but I can't recommend.Its concepts are okay and even though the light quests etc get really monotonous, it the overall game design that kills it, in my view.Its dark, as in can't see a bloody thing. AND you wnader aimlessly around clicking everything until the locks turn white.There's no real direction given, and because of that you will find frustrations set in before anything else. Screaming at your monitor saying""What the F&%^ am I meant to be doing?""Even just a little guidance would have at least made it playable.Then I sort of got all the rooms open and wandered aimless around the house, again not knowing what is going on. Is this the end of the game or what?I go back to sleep to see if that does anything and after wandering around the area I already have been, I am back at the house, required to do the last 2 or three puzzle things AGAIN! What the F...?That is the point I give up.I went onling to try and find a walkthough or something and coincidently, the one I watched basically gave up at the same point. Maybe that's as far that is done so far?If not, then if anyone has a clue as what happens after you open the double locked door and jump down the trapdoor in the floor, it MAY offer a liitle more closure,  Until then I can not recommend, but would not say its total bad. It's mediocre, at best at the moment.If any devs are interested, maybe allow a little bit better brightness in the house, and maybe drop some suttle clues so you don't end up walking around aimlessly until boredom takes over.

								Dream is what happens when you have a designer creating a game who understands nothing of the topic they are trying to build an experience within and even less understanding of how to make a game which provokes any kind of enjoyment or emotion from the player. It is clearly aiming to be some kind of exploration into the psyche of the main character, called Howard, by trying to be something thought-provoking and intellectual. But it fails miserably to accomplish even that one simple task for two reasons.Firstly, there is lack of creativity here that is so pronounced that even the designer felt that they needed to label significant things and explain them. Floating text frequently appears at key points-of-interest within the environments to explain what this thing you are looking at represents. There is also scraps of paper, supposedly from a Dream Dictionary, which you can find in places if you explore. What this reminds me of is when someone tells you a joke that is so lame that they have to explain it to you afterwards.Secondly is the complete lack of anything enjoyable to do in the dreams, since most tasks are simply mundane puzzles which are only difficult due to how long they take as a result of setbacks from mistakes. You won't have any 'eureka' moments here since the solution to the puzzles are obvious. The Dreams aren't visually interesting either causing you to not really want to bother exploring and at other times they clearly aren't intended for exploration anyway. I'm not joking here, but there is a dream where you go onto a very slow roller-coaster ride around a smoky-grey room and do nothing for a good 5 minutes. Another is when you walk around an empty office building just looking for how to get out unless you happen to notice a pc you can access using passwords written on a clipboard from the ground-floor. This gives you some puzzles and rewards you with access to a ""Nightmare"" that is so unimpressive that I actually felt cheated out of the time I spent solving the puzzles.If Dream is trying to convey that Howard is depressed, bored with life and has no sense of direction or purpose then it accomplishes this goal with huge success... because the game itself is also boring, lacking direction and creativity.

								I have not played this game for terribly long but every time I do I am always awe-struck with how beautiful it is. It feels truly wonderous to wander around, and deviate from where you intended to go, to see what hides beyond the next corner.I have not yet encountered any nightmarish aspects, which makes me a tad bit worried, becaus I'm pretty sure I'll be properly terrified when I do. Regardless, it's a very neat little gem, and I'm looking forward to seeing it completed.			"

								Great Early-Access game! I've yet to try it with the Oculus, but even without it, the game is great.If you're fond of exploration games that always seem like theres a little more to be discovered, I recommend supporting Dream. and buying it now....The game does have a few frame-rate problems when I try to play it at full graphics, (usually not a problem for my exceptional PC) but even then, its an enjoyable experience.If you enjoy games like Gone Home, give Dream a try!

								VR-MODE: ReviewPrimarily purchased Dream as an Oculus Rift demo, as its one of the best examples of VR done right around. Itâs as close as a lucid dream as Iâve felt, great sense of scale, epic music score, feels like your inside a Hayao Miyazaki world.""Seamlessly blends a realistic world environment with a surreal lucid dream experience. 9/10cons: Avatar height feels off a little, mirrors set to vampire mode, virtual hands would make interactive hit boxes more intuitive.

								Pretty good so far and lot of potentialwith only a few chapters done already.With only the first arc available, the story line still need to be more developped and polished. At its current stage, it can feel more like a disconnected set of puzzles than a constructed story... Even though parts of the story are indeed connected, some of the lands feel foreign with no way to trace them back to objects in the house. This is specially true for the garden and the black labyrinth which doesn't seem to remind any part of the ""wakeup"" environement.On the other hand, the few puzzles that are available can be challenging at times and the semi open world and surrealist graphics really do makes the whole place feel like a dream. This game takes from some of its predecessors like Myst and Antichamber to create some of the weirdest and most beautiful sceneries that I have seen in a game so far. I am sure this game is going to be a must in every one's library in no time.Keep up the good work. I can't wait to see what's comming up next.			"

								Complete honesty here, If you're looking for a fast paced game with lots of action, this is not the game you want. If you're looking for a challenging puzzle game, try antichamber or portal 2. If youre looking for something crazy, try Loadout, but if you want an immersive game with some of the most beautiful landscapes you've ever seen, your search is over. This game is amazing in that, it touches you in a way that other games can't. Wandering through the large worlds, it's easy to get lost, but when you get lost, there seems to always be more and more that you discover. Eventually every game has to come to an end, but Dream does a great job of making the end seem much farther away than it really is. This game is more about the journey than the destination, and the story is well made and interesting. I can't wait until it is in full release.			"

Early Access Review
								Dream is a good adventure game filled with lots of puzzles. Currently, the game suffers from quite a few bugs, but the game is still in its alpha stage for a reason. The game's mood swings from being relaxing to moderately scary. Scary enough that you start to get goosebumps, but not so scary that you want to turn off the game, which is good. I have yet to find anything in the game that can 'kill' you, though there is at least one enemy in the game. Despite being a good game, it does have flaws.The game's biggest flaw, I'd have to say, is that the game never gives you any idea as to what you're supposed to do. This does have some upsides to it for fans of exploration, though players trying to simply get on with 'the main quest' (if one even exists) will find themselves a bit annoyed. Also, it'd be nice for there to be a part of the map that tells you where you are right then and there, so you don't get lost.As for its strengths, it has plenty. Personally, I enjoy listening to the protagonist. He has a good sense of humor, and allows some of the darker parts of the game to be a bit more bearable. Also, the surreal environments are just gorgeous. Also, the game never holds your hand, which is also a very good thing.Over all, I'd say if you like surreal environments, exploration, don't mind just a touch of horror, then this game will be worth your money.

								Dream is an indie first-person adventure game where you play the role as Howard Phillips, a man obsessed with his dreams, and,  just as the game's name and that sentence implies, you play as him in said dreams. Dream is somewhate educational; throughout the game, you can find various bubbles with paper encased within them floating around. Upon interaction, they tell you random facts about objects and things that are found in your dreams, and what they mean if you see it in a dream. I thought this was pretty neat, seeing as I was once previously interested in such information, and I had to use a website to learn about that stuff. Well... now the game does that for me. xPDream is nothing extraordinary in my opinion, but it's good to play if you want to just relax and immerse yourself in some nice atmospheres, as well as not minding having to do some puzzles at times. The game also offers a very lovely soundtrack composed by Norman Legies, which compliments the game rather well.			"

												It's a beautiful game. However, the controls were hard to deal with, even though I played around with the sensitivity, it was still a bit chucky. I must say that there were so many instances where I didn't know what to do, and had to look up a guide for it. Narrator had an excellent voice, and I'm sure there is a good story in here somewhere if I could not look at a guide from time to time to find out what I'm suppose to do. I would probably say try the game out yourself, but would recommend waiting for a sale for it.			"

								Ignore that I reccomend this, because this is not a review, but something to help people figure out if this is a game for them. The reason is that this game is very different from the ""mainstream"" games (and I mean not to sound like some pretentious hipster, but that is the reality of it).Some people will look at this and think ""What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did I just buy?"" and will probably go on to try and be a pretentious dumbass saying that their review is the only one you should listen to, and that the game is utterâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Others willâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥themselves with joy at how incredibly artsy the game is, and will never shut up about how great the game is. (That is, if you have a decent PC. It is getting optimized, I can now actually play the game at a survivable frame rate, but if you have anything lower than a gaming computer keep your cash for now, unless you plan on waiting to install/play the game in what seems to be the near future.)Then there is no middle ground, because the game is a hit or a miss with everyone (like Proteus or Dear Esther).I VERY STRONGLY suggest looking at the game in VIDEOS. These are the only way that you will definitively know if you want this (I knew I wanted it due to these videos). Ignore the ""real"" reviews, especially user made ones, as they are biased severely one way or the other.			"

												Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge. Check out this review and others at Nouse Gaming: http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/------------------------------------------------You play as Howard, a man probably in his mid twenties. You wake upon your sofa having successfully managed to sleep through whatever show it was you were hoping to watch. So you decide the best thing to do is head to bed. When you get to bed your dream is full of floating cubes and a strange gate which you travel through. You now find yourself in a canyon of some kind which you explore until you find a stack of computers. Now in order to progress you must make your way through four mazes, turning off lots of lights whilst being chased by some mysterious âsmokeâ. Confused? So was Iâ¦The basic idea behind Dream is fairly solid. Walk around until you find a puzzle, solve said puzzle and then move to a new area. However itâs a game with no tutorial or even directions of any sort. The puzzles (when you eventually reach them) are fairly good. Theyâre varied, interesting and at times need some thinking about and highly enjoyable. With one particular puzzle took me a good amount of time to even figure out what I was supposed to be doing and solving it gave me a huge sense of satisfaction.Whether youâll like Dream largely depends on how long you think it takes for âExploringâ to become âAimless Wanderingâ. Returning back to the house I began to look around and found lots of clue to Howardâs life or rather more about his recently deceased author uncle whoâs house he now seems to be living in. The other levels also seem to have plenty of these little hints and secrets but finding them quickly becomes a chore and just finding the next puzzle to progress can be frustrating.There are three acts (four if you include the starting house) and each act offers two âSide Dreamsâ these are bonus optional puzzles and/or areas adding a little variety to the game. There are also the Nightmare Acts. Iâd love to tell you about them but I refuse to play them. I started the level something moved down the corridor a door slammed and messages were scrawled across the mirror in blood. Iâm not great with horror even when Iâm expecting it so I decided to leave it. However whatâs clear is that it contains a decent amount of content for a game of this type especially when you include the 30 collectable âDream Bible Scrapsâ and a handful of other collectable itemsDream is quite pretty and itâs also backed up by a great soundtrack. But the asthetic of the game is obviously made for a VR headset. This is especially clear in the rollercoaster side level that would probably be quite impressive if you were but on a screen was dull.Itâs difficult to make up my mind on Dream. On the one hand the puzzles for the most part were excellent, and felt like a grown up, slightly harder Professor Layton kind of thing. The small hints of depth in the world and varied locations were also great. But I keep coming back to one sticking point, it just took so much wandering around with no real direction to find what I was looking for. This is especially true in the third act where it took me about half an hour to even find one of the puzzles! There are some people out there will really really love this game, but for most of us I have to say itâs probably one that weâll never get round to finishing it properly.			"

								WAIT UNTIL RELEASE! I beg of you! It's a fun game to play, I won't lie. So why am I giving it a thumbs down? Because of all the bugs in this game. For example, once you get to the desert, it's hard to enter your room for you to save there so you have to keep playing the game over and over from the beginning. Yes, I know it's an early release and there are bound to be lots of bugs, but once you play, they just flat out ruin it for you and you don't feel like playing anymore. At least for me, I'm gonna wait till early release is over and the game is developed more properly so I can play the game without all these annoying interferences in the game. Plus, if you are thinking about doing a video gameplay of this, DEFINITELY wait till release. Again, not a bad game, but not worth playing anytime soon.			"

								~2 hours in. One of the best late night gaming experiences I've had in months. Turn out all the lights and immerse. The worlds are beautifully rendered and smooth. The music matches the moods of their respective environs, and while each world's puzzles have the same theme, they're different enough to maintain interest. Color usage is fantastic. I almost want a VR for this one.Try it. Seriously.			"

								I bought this game the first day it got released and i gotta say im very happy with the game and its a game i think everyone should play, the devs have made a really good job staying in touch with the community and updating the game so thats a big +, but what do i have to say about the game itself, well.............SPOILER WARNINGFirst thing i did was going around playing with the lights in the house, very fun, the second thing i did was look out the window, very fun, the third thing i did was go to bed and, well started dreaming or how you gonna put it, i entered a big, well, sand place, it was beautiful, i walked around collecting small notes with like poetry or something on them, then looked at how beautiful everything was, then i did some puzzeling and the place started snowing, very beautiful i did some more puzzeling and entered a dark portal thingy.............I became very sad when i did becuse i woke up in my bed and becuse the game was in early access (note: this wasnt in the game at release i think) i thought the game was over, i oppened the door to my room (by pressing a button wierdly) i hear some weird sound and see somebody run down the stairs, seeing footprints on the walls on the mirror in the bathroom i saw some weird text written in blood, i quickly pressed ALT + F4I came back later and played this part and the other dreams/nightmares when they got released and i gotta say that this game is AMAZING if you love either exploration, horror or puzzle games you need to buy this otherwise you still need to buy this. Im not so good at convincing ppl in reviews but just PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy this.THE END			"

								One of the most intriguing games I have ever played.  When you first go into your dream and appear in the ""central hub"" of sorts... it's simply breathtaking.  The beautiful soundtrack plays as you gaze among the mysterious room before you...  I absolutely can't wait to see what this game has in store, as it is only 1/3rds finished?  Buying this game now is a great investment for the future.			"

But almost all the time when I startup the game, the game closes and says ""BUILT UDK HAS STOPPED WORKING"" and I have been experiencing some artifacting in the subtitles and the TV in Phillip's room. Otherwise the game is amazing. I would give it a 6/10.			"

												Dream is a game that makes you think inside-the-box in outside-the-box scenarios. I came across this game by accident: I wanted to find a newer game that was similar to LSD: Dream Emulator, a game I have never played, but want to play something like it. Dream did not disappoint that urge, but in its current state, it does have a few things I want to point out.WARNING: The following will contain spoilers.I decided to purchase this game recently after it had been sitting in my wishlist while I was broke. I wanted something new and different to play. This was a good choice, but some things still bother me:REALISM: This game is set in a realistic scenario, where you play Howard, a British man who, should we say, talks to himself alot. The story comes from his abstract dreams which are supposed to represent the dreams (and nightmares) we have in real life. When playing this game, I don't feel like I'm in a dream at all. If we are being nitpicky, dreams are different levels of hazy, and are not always in perfect lucidity. I mention this because I want the game to feel like a dream, not just a series of abstract levels and puzzles.LINEAR: In its current state, the game is very linear, Yes, there are small worlds in which you can explore, but each dream leads to the next, and the start of the game is always the same: Go to sleep, go to the hub world, go to a dream world. I can't help but feel a sense of repetitiveness every time I start the game up. I feel that the dreams should be random, and should randomly link to other dreams. I also think not every world should contain a puzzle. In the abstract worlds of dreams, most of the dream is exploring, or for some people, just letting your dream control you, tell you where to go, and tell you what to do, like a story.PUZZLES: I've never had a dream with a puzzle in it. I also think this game puts too much emphasis on the puzzles, and not enough on the exploration. Puzzles, in my opinion, should be a rarity, not how you reach the next level. I think each level should be the result of picking up an item, or enteracting with a being. PORTALS: I think the portals that are currently in use are unrealistic for the dream scenario. I also think nightmares should not be easily noticeable based on the color of the portal. Nightmares are not something that can be avoided when they start, so seeing a black portal would be unrealistic, and gives us the choice to enter it or avoid it.DIALOGS: Between dreams, there are some dialogs between Howard and his uncle Ed. These dialogs seem to last for what feels like hours, and all I'm left to do is sit there and wait it out. If there's any way of making these dialogs a little shorter, that would be great. I want to get to the next level already.I think this game could be better, but I would still recommend it to those interested in playing a game based on dreams. I do wish that there will be larger worlds, more exploration, and a more interactive story. I also hope that there is a better use of Howard's house. Currently it is only used for the Tutorial and the nightmares. I think it should have more use as a bigger part of the story, such as if Howard has a job, or people coming over, then Howard could also live a life during the day, and the game could use Howard's workplace for dreams and nightmares, and more exploration. Consider the state of this game as a prototype. It could use some polishing and added content. Looking forward to the development of the game, and its evolution.			"

												The Game:There is nothing I really liked about this game; it was horrorifying not thrilling or entertaining, the puzzles themselves are ridiculously easy to find the solution yet frustratingly difficult to get past. Not to mention that this isn't just a horror game no it's a horror game and psychological horror game combined. Two words I would use to describe this game are frustrating and disturbing. In my opinion you shouldn't use a hazard element to make up for lack of puzzle difficultyThe Graphics:The graphics themselves are very beautiful however the short render distance and janky mechanics scares frustrates and demonicizes even the most tranquil of the games scenes, especially if you have played through even the first scary scene.Game Mechanics:The Game Mechanics are extremely janky, When Your character is constantly getting stuck by computer cords it makes for a tedious game.

								In short, I don't really understand what the devs are trying to do with Dream. After 2 hours, I don't have much sense for who the main character is, what his goals are, or what the game expects of me. I'm trying to like this game (I loved Dear Esther, which this is often compared to), but I just can't seem to find the hooks - in either a gameplay or narrative sense.That being said, there's definitely something interesting here.  I'll be keeping an eye on this game as development progresses, but I can't recommend it in it's present state.			"

												I believe that there's a difference between being non-linear and just plain mess. This game unfortunately is the latter one.Yes the screenshots look pretty nice and you get a feeling that this game is related to Myst or Uru but unfortunately it doesn't come even close to those games.The main character model is horrendous. It looks like it was taken straight out of an asset pack. Why did they even include it in the game considering they did not make any facial animations, swimming animations, proper walking animations, inventory animations and made the character look as a teen, while the voiceover sounds as if he was 30? Just WHY?The game world itself is an awful incomprehensible mess. The ""hub"" level leads to other levels, which in turn lead to other levels, which contain various items of unknown purposes and are hidden or scattered all over the place without any reason or pattern whatsoever. While the puzzles turn out surprisingly dumb and easy and can be finished in just a couple of minutes, getting to those puzzles is whole another thing - you don't have a map or a clue to where you are supposed to be going or what you are supposed to be doing or searching for. You can't even start to make sense or understand what you are supposed to do unless you find some walkthrough's or hints on forums and youtube of which there aren't that many.Honestly - this game is just too frustrating and confusing, and i couldn't force myself to enjoy it or being a remotely interested in the process. I don't understand whether the developers tried to make a horror, a walking sim, a genuine adventure game or neither, and i think the developers don't know either.If only levels had a pattern to them, if only you had a map, if only there were less bugs and texture glitches and invisible walls, if only they had a professional voice actor or didn't have voice actors at all, if only the music wasn't so damn loud and out of place... this could've been a better game but right now i feel like it wasn't even worth 3 bucks i paid for it on sale.

								I stuck with it for 2 hrs... but it failed to grasp my attention. The trailer looked fantastic, but the gameplay seemed a little too 'open ended' in the sense that I spent hrs just walking around trying to figure out what to do. There are plently of other casual simulators out there, but this one just didn't draw me in as expected. There's no direction whatsoever, and the puzzles (e.g., the Graveyard) are far too complicated for no reason and don't have any reward for the time put into them. One may argue that that's the point of a 'lucid dream simulator', but it just didn't make me want to jump back in over and over again. I'll keep my recommendation as positive because I see a lot of potential with this early access game, but it's not ready for the general public just yet. Good luck devs.			"

								One of the most beautiful games I've ever played, Dream is wonderful. The gameplay, however, is lacking; in that you really don't do much apart from explore and solve a few puzzles. The puzzles range from mildly entertaining to ""I'm going to spend four hours doing this"" and vary greatly. The game, to me, is a bit of a walking simulator; but that's okay. I love the game for the atmosphere that it gives me and the story it presents me with. The hub, which you'll see in the beginning, filled with white cubes, is absolutely astounding. Oculus Rift support makes the game even better; though the controls are fiddly and can get especially annoying when in the Oculus. It's not an experience I'd recommend to everyone because not everyone is looking for an experience, they're looking for a game. This isn't the kind of game you come to for that. If you want a mixture of walking simulator and game; take a look at Skyrim.			"

								A bit power-hungry, and probably not for those with old equipment (a better GFX card and CPU is recommended). Even with very light graphics settings, it's a tad on the intense side. But after some gameplay, I am convinced that I might need to upgrade to better hardware eventually.Computer stuff out of the way, concept-wise, I'm in my first dream world, and I'm liking it so far. Kinda reminds me of some of my dream environments already. I'll add more to the review the deeper into the rabbit hole I go. As an aside, I find it funny that the game's immersion factor is somewhat deep enough, the PC looks somewhat (though doesn't sound at all) like me. Personally, I found it amusing (as a coincidence).EDIT:Unfortunately, this rabbit hole is shallow, and can only go the initial dream inwards. Either my machine's not enough for it, or the latest version has some issues as of now. Kinda expected in it's current state. Keeps on running out of video memory, even on the lowest settings.EDIT EDIT:After a bit of tinkering, I made a bit more progress, and I found the first major puzzle. Unfortunately, even at current (low) settings, the game makes me a little scared to progress further without burning out my card or computer. However, this game does make me want to play Myst again as well. It has potential.			"

								At first, I was fairly negative about this game. Just a couple of points for possible buyers:1) The first 'world' is the least compelling and the hardest in terms of puzzles. Don't be put off by this, keep at it and you have some really incredible levels to look forward to.2) The second 'world' is actually really great fun. The office is well designed, reminds me of the Stanley Parable. The puzzles on the computer in the lab are really clever and feel rewarding once finished. The multiple-gravity-stairs miniworld was exactly what I imagined this whole game to be, I'm so glad it was added.3) This game is nowhere near being finished. There are clever bits, even a little personal branding going on, that make playing it feel worthwhile overall. For an early-development game, this is well done. Keep up the good work, maybe change around some things at the beginning and with the voices, and who knows, this could become one of the classics.			"

This is also my 1st game of this type and am happy with the game so far.pros:lots of content.cool enviroments.new added nightmares are pretty awesome.really intresting puzzels that challenge you.cons:no tutorial(i still dont know how you know if finish a dream 0.o)no hint system(not like a baby system or waypoint but the only time you know what to do at times is either by notes , object in the enviroment or what he says to himself and at times he says nothing for whole hour periods.)i suck at spelling too so ya.

								This is a good game for the little time I played it, but there is one major problem with it currently (yes I know it's alpha). This is that, when playing across a 3 screen setup, the game does not change the resolution in the correct way. Instead of you getting extra viewing distance to your right and left hand side, the game instead zooms in so that your normal 16:9 image, is expanded so that you still see that same width across the three screens. This makes the game very zoomed in, and impossible to play as you are missign 2/3 of the normal image from the top and bottom of the screen.As I said, good game, but this causes problems.Thanks,Zack			"

								If you like challanging puzzles and beutifully diverse, atmospheric environments and visuals, this is the game for you.If you, on the other hand, like having a clear idea about what the story is, what's going on, where you are, where you're going, what you're supposed to do once you get there and why.... not so much. This game doesn't spoon feed you anything, up to and including the button layout for your controls, which can be insanely frustrating at times, but I'm not sure I'd call it bad thing. If you've got the patience for it, it's definately a bit more rewarding. At least you've got some beutiful sights to look at while you're trying to find your butt (after having already had to spend several hours tracking down both hands and a map to find it with).So, quite enjoyable, but it takes patience.

LIke seriously, if you took half of this game and made it independent, it would be considered a horror game (which is something I loooove).All in all, this game has alot of wonder and fantasy in it, great visuals and puzzles to go along. I was slightly disappointed when I reached the end of this phase of development in the game, but with the newest update I have a bit more adventuring to do now and I can't wait to Dream some more.

								Amazing game!The visuals in this game are fabulous and the story is creative. Although you do not tend to do that much throughout each dream in the game, it does not matter. This is because you spend your time enjoying the visuals and the story that goes along with each dream. The atmosphere is great as well9/10			"

								This is a pretty cool game... Where you see through the eyes of Howard Phillips, a man who has been having vivid dreams... He's been wandering, in his dreams... Wandering, to strange places... There are metaphors in this game, metaphors everywhere, and part of understanding the story is figuring out what everything means...			"

								Looks amazing! Just bought it, yet I am having a few problems with the game so far that hopefully will get looked at.The biggest issue is that it takes exactly one second from when I move my joystick until the screen actually moves (left, right, etc.) This is extremely annoying as it becomes almost impossible to navagate.Also, when I was changing my settings, it inverted my axis even though I went in only to find it saying ""No"" to inverting it.After changing another random setting however, the problem went away.The main thing that I want to highlight however is that time between moving the joystick and a reaction from the game. Really hope this gets fixed because it makes it horribly hard to play as of now.Thanks!-Chas			"

								This game feels like it's trying to be two games at once. A puzzle game, and a horror game. I personally think that it should go with one path and stick with it. Now, I'm just going to say that I have never played many horror games before. This would probably be my first. But, I can say, the horror is far better than the puzzles. Most of the puzzles are simple things, like; run though a maze, or make all the lights light up at once, and are pretty boring, in my opinion. The horror, on the other hand, feels very scary; like it should, but it feels very out of place with the beautiful environments and, again, the puzzles. The two types of gameplay are so different, that, I wouldn't be surprised to find out one guy was making the horror stuff, and the other the puzzles. I'm still recommending this game, because it shows promise to become a great game, but that opinion may change in the future. Make me proud, Hypersloth.			"

								The game starts off at quite a slow pace, with the general idea of just being about dreams and escaping reality. However, I would say after the first tedious puzzle that has you turning off lights in four seperate catacombs, the game picks up dramaticly. More portals appear and the story develops quite a lot. The game has so much secrets and content for you to find and work out, you could easily play it for hours on end and still find areas that you previously never seen. The story is bled through the environment really well, with nightmares being alot more personal and quite uneasy at the same time. The atmosphere is incredible and the soundtrack. I hope this game is updated frequently because there is so much potential for this game, to be even bigger!			"

								>>This game is still in development<<In Dream, you explore the subconscious concerns of Howard, a young Brit who has inherited his recently deceased father's house. Dream is a mix of exploration and puzzle-solving in order to learn more about Howard and his development as a character (or person?). The amount of work put into the visual design in Dream is impressive for an Indie game, and the soundtrack ties into everything nicely. Even on the lowest graphic settings (like I'm using; it's probably time for a new gaming rig), it still looks pretty good. *****			"

The story and the way the game develops as you learn more abut the character and their story is also interesting. This game just has me wanting to keep playing. I'm a massive fan of exploration games so this has truely 'hit the spot'.

												TL:DR Good concept but not very well executed. While at times its enjoyable, overall it isnt great. Game has a lot of problematic bugs which need to be fixed. Until they are it may might be best to avoid buying this gameFull Version:This game takes quite an interesting concept of being able to explore dreams and solving puzzles in them. You play Howard ,a young author, who has moved into the house his recently deceased uncle Edward left to Howard in his will. The game has you exploring Howards dreams (and nightmares) to try and resolve Howards issues. The dreams are generally quite enjoyable and visually nice areas where you root ot puzzles and try to solve them. The puzzles are a bit hit and miss with some enjoyable, others not so much. Good points:-some of the dream levels are really cool and do look very beautiful- the music is good and fits the game quite wellBad points:-its a very buggy game. I had to reload a few times due to bugs. For example in the first Act i had to jump into a hole which my character got stuck in and i couldnt move. Later on while doing a puzzle i couldnt activate an item i needed to use. From reading the forums its seems like other players have had a lot of problems and the devs havent patched it in months.- the voice acting is very poor. The actors sound so wooden,like they're reading straight from a script. Also the sound level on the voices tends to fluctuate a lot going from audible to inaudible.-this game felt like a tech demo for VR at times. Theres one section which is blatantly there just for someone wearing a VR headset to experience and serves no purpose to the rest of the game.			"

								If it was not for top notch visuals and sound I would probably not recommend this game. It is early in development, and the puzzles and levels are extremely clever, but there is just not enough visual or audio guidance and aids to help you and more often than not you will just find yourself constantly wandering around aimlessly not knowing where to go next, or what to do. With that placed aside you will probably develop a love/hate relationship with this game, while the main character development is uninspiring thanks largely to the main charcter being some sort of dimwit and the connection relationship between reality influencing dreaming has hardly been touched, it will still inspire you want to venture further sheerly because of the imaginative and creative backdrops. I recommend this game solely for the experience it provides gamers...			"

I have to recommend it, it is mostly relaxating, perfect to play at night before going to sleep. The nightmares can be a little scary but not to much, just the right amount to be enjoyable even if you don't like scary games. It has a good story, not a masterpiece but perfect for a game like this. The graphics are astonishingly beautiful, and there's good music fitted perfectly for every moment in the game			"

								If it was not for top notch visuals and sound I would probably not recommend this game. It is early in development, and the puzzles and levels are extremely clever, but there is just not enough visual or audio guidance and aids to help you and more often than not you will just find yourself constantly wandering around aimlessly not knowing where to go next, or what to do. With that placed aside you will probably develop a love/hate relationship with this game, while the main character development is uninspiring thanks largely to the main charcter being some sort of dimwit and the connection relationship between reality influencing dreaming has hardly been touched, it will still inspire you want to venture further sheerly because of the imaginative and creative backdrops. I recommend this game solely for the experience it provides gamers...			"

												I really like this game but I hit a gamebreaking bug.I like the graphics style, the puzzles are interesting enough, and there's good atmosphere.However, the game is a bit janky with a few awkward problems like key bindings and no controller button support.Gamebreaking bug I hit was the language switching to French and then to Russian. I can't read the cyrilic and so I just can play anymore despite wanting to. The language setting in the menu still says English despite beign written in Russian.Can't reccommend, even though I want to.			"

												I bought the early access in August 2013, that is 2 years ago. And now that it has been finally released all I can say is that I am glad to have supported this early access and I am very happy with the final result.It has been a long path but it has been great to have seen the progress, and well this game has improved a lot since the first versions where there was barely a complete dreamNow, about the game. I have to recommend it, it is mostly relaxating, perfect to play at night before going to sleep. The nightmares can be a little scary but not to much, just the right amount to be enjoyable even if you don't like scary games. It has a good story, not a masterpiece but perfect for a game like this. The graphics are astonishingly beautiful, and there's good music fitted perfectly for every moment in the game			"

You can tell the developer is spending lots of time on choice. In one dream, you can't do everything. It's all about vast exploration, interaction, and choice making. Think of Dear Esther, but with choices and free roaming.If you have $15 to spare, it's most definately worth it!9/10			"

								The concept of this game interested me greatly, but in execution it seems to fall a bit short. Combine this with constant crash and graphical issues and I am disappointed to say that I can't recommend the game in it's current iteration. If the operation issues were the only problem I would understand, as the game is in it's alpha stages at this moment, but I felt that (from what I have been able to play when the game does actually run) the ""puzzles"" have been rather boring and redundant. The main character seems unrealistic and two dimensional, and after logging over an hour in this game, I have no idea what the overarching plot is. What is the point? Am I just... wandering through this dream-scape running through light mazes for no conceivable reason? Am I trying to fix my dreams or...? I don't know. You're just some British dude who is solving puzzles. Based on his voice acting he, like me, is just doing it because he has nothing better to do. I keep expecting him to say, ""well... I payed for this game so I might as well play it"" since that is what I've been thinking the whole time. I would also prefer some sort of alternative light source that emanates from the character without destroying some ambiance, or at least a brightness slider. This is the only game that I have ever played in which I was stuck, simply because I couldn't tell if I was walking into a wall or not.All in all it needs a good deal of polish before it is playable. I think if the story were more engaging, or if the performance issues didn't exist, it would be worth it, but for right now I'm probably going to delete the local content until the full game is released and I wouldn't risk the roulette of whether or not it would work on your PC if you haven't bought it yet.

Early Access Review
								NOTE:  This review was given during the Early-Access phase.So before I write this review, I want to say that I'll be listing all of the pluses and minuses of the game below, but unfortunately a very prosaic and annoying issue is causing me to give this game a negative review and give a ""buyer beware"" review.  Hopefully in the near future, the issue will be sorted and I'll be able to play the game.  In a nutshell, this game has a game-ending bug that the devs have known about for (at least) a year and a half, and there's an entire Steam forum thread dedicated to it.  And given that they're going to be giving out release copies for review in roughly three months, I'm slightly concerned for them.  It seems like it's going to go very, very badly for this game if they hand out review copies of this game to major reviewers and the only thing that they can say is ""Yeah, I played it for 5 hours, it seemed cool, but then the game glitched out and I couldn't play anymore.""  In spite of my current experience, I really hope these issues get resolved and that the game is successful.  It's the first game I ever paid any attention to on Steam Greenlight, and it's one of the few that I voted for to be Greenlit.The game-ending bug:  So there's a part of the game (the Terrace Walkway sub-dream) where you need to turn pillars to solve a puzzle, and the glitch is that the pillars don't turn, they just wiggle back and forth and prevent you from solving the puzzle (and thus unlocking the rest of the game).  So... yeah.  This basically forces my hand, and I have to not recommend this game until this issue is sorted.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A Review of the Game (the portion of the first world that I can actually get through)So Dream is a game coming from a group of unseasoned but clearly very talented game developers.  The style of the game itself is not entirely unique (it's in this new genre of games like Lifeless Planet and Dear Esther, which I guess you'd call atmospheric explorer games), but the execution and game itself are quite original and the execution is, in spite of a few issues, quite brilliant.  I think a lot of people are going to rag on this game essentially because they don't like atmospheric exploring games, but I think that they should be ignored.  The game itself is extremely fun.  So I look forward to being able to play the game in May.By the way, people have also been complaining about the puzzles.  I thought the puzzle of the head stones was really very clever, and it required probably two hours straight of messing around with it and a lot of logical thinking, which I thought was very fun.Warning: SPOILERS.  I will say a few things, however, that probably should be changed (and quite possibly are, this is an early-access copy after all).-- Although this game derives a lot of its uniqueness from sort of dropping you into a world and letting you slowly discover what the heck it is that you're supposed to be doing, there might be a little more of an idea of what's going on.  After spending an hour or two walking around aimlessly, the game starts to get boring, no matter how pretty the scenery is (but see my next point).  So would try to either make things a little bit more straightforward/logical or find some way to boost the player with at least a little bit of guidance.  I kind of feel like the beginning of the game needs to have a little bit more of a tutorial on what the game is about and some mindfulness of the fact that if they players get stuck in these large worlds, they're going to be bored.-- The game is supposed to be a big, beautiful open world, but your first level feels constricting and often claustrophobic, particularly the mazes.  Also, as near as I could tell, the mazes serve no function, yet there are many of them, and they aren't really fun and it's not conveyed in any way to the player that they don't need to waste two hours bumbling aimlessly in the scenic equivalent of a straightjacket.  If I have to bumble around aimlessly, I'd prefer that I was doing it in a big, open world where I get to freely explore.  (The Terrace Walkway, by contrast, had none of these issues.)-- You guys need to work out how to get the clicking of collectable objects more... functional.  I walked by the grass cutter to pick up the strange stone multiple times, and tried to press it multiple times to no avail.  You have to stand in the EXACT right spot the EXACT right distance, otherwise you'll never see that you can pick up the stone, even if you notice it might be something you can snag and actively try to snag it.-- The sun is WAY TOO BRIGHT.  Holy crap!  You guys need to turn that down a bit, you might blind someone. It also makes reading signs really hard, and it distracts from your wonderful landscape in certain cases.Again, I really hope I'll be able to play through this game in the future and give it a much more robust, positive review.  From an alpha stage, so far so good, but you guys are publishing this soon, so hop to it!  We want to see your game!			"

								I really wanted to be able to recommend this game... but I  can't.  I get that's it's early access and that is why I have given it SOME slack but this needs some serious improvement.  The washed out, over saturated dream world is annoying to navigate.  Does it really have to be that bright?  Some other items to navigate with or other places to go there would nice too other than just floating blocks.  I'm not a WASD player so the lack of key binding is also a minus.  OK, that will be added later. I let that one go.  Onto the desert puzzles.  Do I really need to be blinded by the sun everytime I try to read a signpost?  Lower the signs or lose the sun.  First, I solved the Graveyard puzzle but I expected more acknowledgement for doing so other than just the stone lighting up.  I think I am not the only one commenting on running the maze of lights FOUR TIMES is not fun. I also got my character stuck a couple of times in the pile of monitors by jumping/climbing then falling between some and I have been stopped by invisible walls from walking down corridors in the hollows that are clearly wide enough for my character.   It's not all bad.  The visuals in the puzzle world are beautiful and the music is fantastic.  I will try again later to see if thing have improved.			"

Early Access Review
								What follows is a critical review in the hope that the developers will see this and be able to improve upon a promising premise.There are so many design and technical issues with this game that it is hard to know where to begin.While I appreciate that this is an incomplete release, currently it doesn't feel like any game at all, with very little direction or intrigue to motivate the player. My friends and I attempted to play this game twice, and both times unfortunately ended with us quitting from frustration, at lack of gameplay and direction, at least from what was visible to us.The depth of field is far too aggressive in this title in general, where it seems completely out of place in nearly all cases. The desert level could benefit from a sandstorm to give the depth of field more purpose for being there.There seems to be quite a few scaling issues in this game also, particularly in the house, where parts of the furniture can end up dwarfing other parts, in particular when comparing the dining table to the piano, one is clearly out of proportion.There are also quite a large number of texture issues. One such example is the wood grain in the house, where all the furniture seems to have the exact same wood grain and also have prevailing texture seams that are easily seen. I would recommend the developers polishing up the existing assets before continuing adding too much more to the game.Also please fix the over repitition of some of the assets, such as the grass, and hexagonal rocks, as well as the overly used light shafts that do not match up with the cast shadows.In the stone maze in the desert level, we found that the corridors used perhaps 4-5 different types of rock, that were not only different sizes, but different colours and styles. While it is clear that this is a dream of the character, it still seems odd that the stones are so different.sand is bland, much boar, very no wow.			"

												I wont take a refund for this game but as of 27th of december 2015 this game is full of bugs or annoying glitches.I only have 30 minutes into this game so yes I am still eligeble for taking a refund.First of all and probably the most annoying of all, screen tearing. Despite vsync, a 980ti and other high end hardware this games gives me an awfull load of screen tearing. Lowering the resolution or overriding nvidia's settings on the game doesn't help. I like smooth gameplay and visuals, screen tearing is something that personally makes me hate a game. However this game has potentional and it looks gorgeous so I will patientfully wait for the updates...The graphical settings that can be adjusted are just to minimal. They should've given plenty more of options. For example I don't like blur, disabling it still results in a blurry depth in the distance. The game doesn't deliver much of a guide/tutorial on how to interact with certain puzzles. You just have to try every key to get to know the results, you can ofcourse check out the key bindings, but personally I don't think that a player has to go that far to get familiar with the important keys. It is also unclear as what to do, you kinda explore and free roam while solving a puzzle so now and then, then you enter a portal and scout out a new place where not everything always work as you'd expect. Probably the last thing for now that I found rather irritating, is the inventory. After messing with the keys I figured out that scrolling makes me pick an object from my inventory and it slowly materializes into my hand. This slowly.. is awefully annoying. It looks splendid and amazing, but that feeling fades away when you cycle through objects to inspect what they are... waiting for like 10 seconds per object results in a big time waste. If you have to look a small thing on a map you'd wait 10 seconds for it to materialize. So the wait is longer than what you have to look for. In the beginning I thought the game was just broken or so since it took that long.Apart from the puzzles being rather simple, they are close to unique. You won't find many other games with the same type of puzzles.I also enjoy the option of making my own choices rather than having a linear gameplay.As the last pro, the visuals are superb have to hand it out to them.TL;DR-screen tearing-unclear goals-hard to get used to basic game mechanics+visuals+freedomEdit:Forgot to mention 1 important thing, if it weren't for the music I'd quit this game after 5 minutes. Due the nice musics and clear voices I continued and discovered interesting elements, only reason I won't take a refund and just wait it out.			"

								As soon as I started this game I thought ""â¥â¥â¥â¥, this is going to be the pile ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I did not want"".Welcome to Dream, annoying brittish walking simulator.Early access so I will leave out the parts about the buggy menu/ settings and the way the foot tracking is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and how your character swims with his arms held out like hes trying to transorm himself into a giant captial letter ""T"".If youre interested in this game because you think, ""ooh a game where I can explore and find and see really interesting things while relaxing to some easygoing chilled gameplay and spaced out music"", youre â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wrong.Enter the mind of Britbong, the 14 year old brittish alcoholic who for some â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up reason, Looks 14 but sounds 40.Each night Brit here has some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lucid dreams which are boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and can't help himself but read everything you pick up out loud or comment on everything you see out â¥â¥â¥â¥ing loud with his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying 40 year old britbong accent.Even writting this review and having to re live the horrible misguided experience I had while purchasing and playing this deceitful piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ isnt as bad as the game itself.Not even 20 minutes in I was already bored as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and sprinting around madly, desperately trying to find the next point of interest hoping the game would finally pull me in. A brittish person talking aboutâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥All I wanted was to explore an open environment/s and find coolâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to interact with with some nice ambient music.â¥â¥â¥â¥, youve disappointed me, Dream.3.5 / 10, could be better, may improve on full release.EDIT: Okay so I admit I was a bit harsh on first pick up, ive been back now and i'll say that the game takes slightly more direction and the story telling does improve. Britbong is less annoying and youre left up to yourself to move through each dream/ scenario and find out wtf is going on. Definitely a more interesting game after the first couple of hours.At this point now ill be giving it a 5.5 / 10Ill also be uploading a video giving you a brief look at the level design in one of the dreams			"

								ATM, I have an old 1gb graphics card (I know the shame, but IRL), and right now I can not get rid of the shadows(again...I know QQ) which causes a bad cd skipping style lag.  I have tried tweaking some settings for the game but to no avail.  The game looks great, the concept looks great, and it is beautiful, even at 1-3fps(just not playable) and that 1-3fps only starts once I get to an open world area(not stating names or anything or locations XP).  Hopefully Uncle Same will buy me a graphics card, or in an update or two of this alpha I can lower the settings.From the Details and graphics of what I can experience so far I would still recommend this game, for those that don't know the genre or what to expect, you could get a similar idea (from my understanding) from ""The Stanley Parable"" or ""The Stanley Parable Demo"".I will update my review when I can experience the game beyond the start of the first Dream....

												Unfinished game full of bugs. Only good thing about this game is the atmosphere (music, areas etc.) and notes you found around (notes about dreams and meaning of dreams). Also this game lacks tutorial, hints are rare, no instructions how to use items, what they do etc. The good side-dreams can be found only if you read the walkthroughs or if you are extremely lucky. The house (when awake) doesn't change when you finish the acts. It's pretty weird and funny sometimes. Especially how the character uses the flashlight. The game would be pretty good if the developers fixed all the bugs and added proper tutorial for some things. Also there are no people in this dreams, wtf?			"

From the moment I started playing I was very disappointed, this was not what I expected at all and I wished I had refunded this when I still could. This game doesn't give you any direction, nor how to play and no hints on how to solve a puzzle or whatsoever. I even got terribly motionsick during one of the puzzles.

								It's entirely possible that I'm just not the target audience for this game, so please before taking my word for it, read some of the more positive reviews for it and see if they sound more in line with your expectations. Personally, I couldn't get into it. I really wanted to because the concept seemed really interesting and the screenshots were absolutely gorgeous, but there doesn't appear to be any gameplay - or at least, I couldn't find any. The game offers no concrete direction about where to go, what to do, or what's important. You are given a character you know next to nothing about and a dreamworld for him to explore. After a couple directionless hours, I managed to find and solve one puzzle, go to a second...place that didn't appear to have anything to do, and grab a few collectibles which could just as easily be critical to the story and its progression as it is to be just collectibles. I can get passed the lack of polish and the graphical glitches that make it run sluggish and jittery even on hardware above it's recommended specs, but I don't have the time or the patience to figure out what makes this game worth playing and what I'm supposed to do in it. I understand that the game is supposed to have a lot of exploration and discovery to it, and it does. The problem is that without a stated goal, exploration quickly turns into simply being lost.Honestly a solid tutorial would go a long way to giving direction to the experience, but I imagine that if one was planned, it would have been implemented by now. If you like walking around aimlessly looking at beautiful scenery, this game has something to offer you. If you're looking for anything else, unfortunately, I think you should pass on Dream.			"

												I love half of the game, the exploration and story are fasinating. Then you get to the actual gameplay, the character models hits invisable walls everywhere he goes, you cant climb basic rocks, item interface is terrible and looks dumb, the character model is extremly poor. Then it comes to the far to difficult puzzling, act 1 graveyard, are you serious this is a first area puzzle that takes people and average of 30mins to 1hour. How god dam enjoyable? For the first area and first puzzle you land on.  Rest of that area is a breese but hell lets through a master level puzzle in there. Then you hit act 2 which isnt as pretty and blow the master level puzzles and adds 3 of them. With noway to bypass the puzzle you have a hugely frustrating game where you just give up if you havent got the patience to play, now ive completed a few puzzle games on my steam list so im very good at them, But this game is totally lost all immersion.The nightmare almost gave it a thumbs up, giving a PT vibe.

												Played my almost 5 hours.  It looked to be like an amazing surreal experience, and for a little while, it was!  The developers were quite imaginitive, I'll give them that.  However, it's too heavy on the puzzles.  The puzzles totally ruined the immersion for me.  I had to spend too much time figuring them out, so much in fact that the environments and cool messages were no longer interesting.  Then, of course, the developers DID indeed disappear, as you've read in other reviews.  Don't call it an exploration game.  Exploration is fun.  This is like OOOOOOoooooo AAAHHHHHHhhhhhhh...... AAAAHHH LOOK GUYS ANOTHER STUPID PUZZLE IN MY DREAM. WHY AM I DREAMING ABOUT PUZZLES			"

												I didn't enjoy this game. Granted, I didnt get very far in it... but within an hour of play I didnt really want to any more. There are many graphical bugs (such as the player shadow not animating and looking like a scarecrow following you about) and landscapes are bland and its fairly easy to get lost and be forced retrace your steps. It gets old real fast.The dialog is lame and, in my opinion, the character just does not seem that special or likable... it's like peering into the life of that middle class guy from school or uni you knew was a decent person but simply wasnt fun enough to want to get to know.Its in my opinion that games are meant to be fun and their characters unique and memorable. Dream doesn't fit the bill or me in this respect.  Good luck to anyone who'd choose to spend their time in this game rather than other fantastic games that have been released as of late.			"

It's called a video game. I don't need a level where I sleep and dream of another world. That's just an overly elaborate loading screen. I was also hoping it was another version of ""Gone Home"".

												A very unpleasant game to play. It looks nice, it has nice music and it lets you explore. All nice things. But they don't explain anything anywhere. Some puzzles are obvious: you know what must be done.. but how must it be done? I dislike the fact that there is no tutorial, nothing to guide you ingame or even  to give you a hint if you're stuck. Yes, there are written walkthroughs by other people, but a good game shouldn't need it for the regular play. It annoyed me a lot.			"

Dream - A Steam Review [Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes] The good  Very gripping atmosphere Interesting puzzles with innovative design Nice graphics The not so good:  Couldâve used some hints during some parts of the games The conclusion: Dream really makes you think youâre in a dream. It really encapsulates that surreal quality of dreams to make the mundane things interesting. As soon as you step in, you really have the feeling of playing an actual dreamYou can see me playing it here -

								Early Access? I really hope the Game developers read this.if this game has been out for early access for years why didn't they release the game for real yet? its 2015 right, i can't even play this game, i payed $16 for it and i cant play it because it lags way to much, it just makes me very irritated. The game looks really beautiful, and i want to know what happens in the story, but it means nothing when the game lags so much that i cant play it, i swear the game developers better fix their game, this game was released for early access in 2013 but now its 2015 two years later and the game plays horribly, its not smooth, its very clunky and hard to play, i just wasted $16 dollars. thank you so much, if they fix the game, i'll definitely give it another shot. the only reason i bought the game was because i thought that two years after the release it would play smoothly. two years and the game is still lagging? other games on my pc run just fine. so obviously this game has problems, i just really want this game to be good. and if the lag was gone i would love this game, but it lags so much that i hate this game.

												There is major graphic tearing, but that can be fixed.  The audio levels are all out of control. you can barely hear what your character is saying one moment and the next he's basically screaming at you.  I also encountered more graphical/gamebreaking bugs in my 40 minutes of gameplay than I have with any other game. including menu GUI not being removed from the screen when you 'unpause' and a section where your mouse cursor disappears (making it impossible to back out of a menu).   The game is about exploration, but when I found a journal article that ended up being invisible and unreadable I had to call it quits.  The game looks beautiful, and it's a shame.  The game is ""released"" but IT'S STILL NOT DONE			"

								So far, I dont know what to think. I finally got the game to start with the new patch, and started playing it, immeadiately had to turn everything having to do with graphics to the lowest point possible, and less than an hour in, I get to a point that looks pretty good, and I'm sure would look better if it wasn't running almost 1 frame per second (Not even kidding) at most times. My computer is fairly good, but you probably need a super gaming computer to pay this game anything close to how it's intended, similar in my mind to Gone Home, as to the feel of the game being as good, I'll have to see.

Plus, it's really easy to get lost in the game. It doesn't give you base to start off on.			"

I love the puzzles, but they feel really unimaginative as far as I got and the way the game deals with movement makes me feel really sick.

Only things I didn't like were sometimes I had to use a guide to find out what to do next because of unintuitive procedures (examples: use a stone to turn a tower? and use the teleporter to find the hospital in Act 3?), confusing maps (examples: the desert map is large and all the cornors look the same it's difficult to navigate,  the office map has 2 side dreams that are hidden on the 1st floor and 3rd floor ), very little help from the game narrator and a few glitches (example: in nightmare 3 can't put down an object after picking it up). Doing the maze puzzle 4 times was not that fun either.Did I mention I enjoyed the music!?!			"

Sure it sounded awesome!The first couple times I tried it, I really wasn't happy with it. Basically walking around aimlessly with no clue where to go or what to do. Then I started finding pieces of paper and items. OK, so that meant I had to find more stuff like this. Well after an hour of walking around and not finding anything else besides some obscure graveyard puzzle, I'm calling it quits.This game is just too laggy and slow to be playable and enjoyable. Yes, the scenery is nice, but the music gets on your nerves and the slow responding controls are too unbearable. Save your money.			"

Gameplay sometimes items overlap, some times you wish more skip options, more helps/ hints/ guides, but its okay. More Steam acheivements would be good and the support isnt good, a Vinyl is long time bugged and still not fixed. The game isnt really long and the price is high, so get it with a good discount, but i love the game but it waste so many potencial. I can only give 73 % for walking simulator/ explorer fans. 57 % for normal gamers if they but it with 50% or higher discount. Thx 4 Reading. Hope for a new good gamer of  the developer.			"

Early Access Review
								As an Early Access Game, it is okay to be incomplete and contains bugs, but it is not as immersive as it should be. I saw the shadows of Gone Home, Anichamber, Stanley Parable and very little of Dreamfall, neither in a good way nor bad way. It just bits and pieces sewed together.The story of an uncle giving a house to his nephew is very similar to Gone Home, and it is not very convincing. There should be more materials to tell the backgroud story on why the uncle would give his house to his nephew, and why after he passed away, the nephew would feel bad enough to have strange dreams. (Edit: After replaying, I learned a bit more. There are still many mysteries to be solved.)Exploration is a good part of the game, but the puzzles are so-so. The desert part was great and the office part was good too, but that was it. The puzzles are okay. They had been created before and they are not innovative enough to be very interesting. (E.g. the mazes)I found some bugs. There are some with the food swapping puzzle which the sushi would move out of place and there was a hidden plate of food. Also turning on the subtitles would turn down all sound to zero, unless manually sliding them back up.(Edited: a minor typo)(The incomplete early access experience killed the feel of it. I hope it worths now.)			"

												A lot of potential, but feels unpolished, and fails to deliver on some of it's claims. Lots of glitches and narrative needs some work. Check out my full thoughts in the video below:

The Oculus Rift on the floor in the bedroom, I looked at it, and then I couldnt back out, so i had to restart.2. The Holiday food puzzle, half the buttons just stopped working, so I could not complete the puzzle.3. I got stuck, literally couldn't move in several places, had to restart.The game is a good effort, but is still horribly broken. Don't buy it, crack it, it is not worth Â£10. It is worth Â£3 at most.Developers, you need to fix your game, seriously.			"

												This game is simply unfinished and needs to be placed back into early access. It is also possible to finish this game in about 2 to 3 hours. There were many points in the game where the glitches either distracted from the game itself, or were entirely game breaking. For example: when I entered on of the side levels to see what was in it, the entire level was turned at a 45 degree angle which made it imposible to play. There is also some story that is presented by two voice actors talking to one another. i really hope you like it because it is reused over and over after literally every level, and it goes on for a long time too. Basically, it will replay the same thing just with a little bit more added to the end of it. It also has one of the worst I have seen in a long time; because, after you beat the sixth level, all you have to do is enter the last portal in the hub area to win. I'm not joking, that is how it ends. I'm incredibly disappointed because I have supported this since it first came on steam, and I was hoping that many of the issues would be fixed when it came out of early access, but they weren't.Just buy a different game, it's not worth $17. There are pleanty of other games that are much better and longer lasting than this game.			"

								I realize that this game is still in development, but I just can't make myself really like it. I have a long history with lucid dreaming, and so was naturally very excited about such a game. However the plot is quite vague and unclear (apparently the story is still in development), and the gameplay sits in an uncomfortable middle ground between an ambient open-plan experience and an abstract puzzler.Also, even if V-Sync is enabled the game has tearing issues which border on the nauseating (am playing with a GTX 980 and a 3Ghz i5 CPU, so I doubt my system is to blame). I'll give this game another go once it is out of development and re-evaluate my review then, but as it stands, it's very much a work in progress.			"

I'd wait till the final version came out to even consider buying this game. Really not worth the money in its current state (I bought it on sale half price, still not worth it).			"

												Trayvon Martin walked across the street, quietly humming a Christian hymn that his grandmother used to sing to him as a child. He looked up to see that it was raining and pulled his hoodie up before tucking the Skittles and iced tea into his pocket so that it wouldn't get wet.George Zimmerman rode along in his car while listening to the anthem of Nazi Germany at full volume, light from the street lamps gleaming off of his bald head. Suddenly he saw Trayvon and was instantly filled with rage when he saw this little ape walking in his proud white neighborhood.Zimmerman grabbed his Hitler Youth knife and AK-47 assault rifle, which was illegally modified for full auto and had banana clips loaded with cop killer rounds. You could never be too careful with these monkeys, after all.""Hey you fucking nigger, what are you doing here?!"" Zimmerman yelled.Trayvon jumped when he heard Zimmerman's brazen swearing and use of racial slurs. His grandmother had always made sure that such language was never spoken in her household.""Please sir,"" Trayvon said politely ""I am only on my way home to my grandmother's house.""""You walked into the wrong neighborhood, nigger."" Zimmerman said as he cocked his AK-47 assault rifle.Trayvon threw up his hands over his head in surrender. The iced tea and Skittles hit the wet pavement.""HEIL HITLER!"" Zimmerman yelled before unloading the entire clip of his AK-47. Trayvon never stood a chance against Zimmerman's full-auto assault. Trayvon hit the ground, bleeding out from 57 bullet wounds.""That'll teach niggers to walk around in my proud Aryan neighborhood."" Zimmerman sneered. He clicked his heels together and gave a crisp Nazi salute before leaving the boy to die.Trayvon looked up to the sky and saw the hand of black Jesus come down and lift him directly to Heaven.Zimmerman pulled out his cell phone and dialed 911. ""Yes, 911?"" Zimmerman said as he polished his AK-47 menacingly. ""I'd like to report a robbery...""			"

Desert, desert, desert, white place, desert, house, desert... If the desert place is something the player has to visit more than once, YOU PUT MORE EFFORD INTO THAT PLACE! If I can make a better looking game in UDK, what excuse do the developers of this game have?Also every place I've visited to so far has left me feeling like it didnt even matter that I went there because there was no conclusion or nothing really changed.I'm going to give this game another go but let's just say that the first hours have not been that great.

								I voted for this on Greenlight.I paid money for this.Actual money that I earned at my job.I spent my green, paper representation of time spent doing things for others on a game that virtually lacks gameplay.I don't know what this game is supposed to be, but I know what it isn't: a game.Or maybe it is, since people seem to think that Gone Home is a game, for some awful reason.In any case, if you want to spend money on a game where your character, who is terribly voice acted by someone who talks incredibly quietly (or rather the dev didn't bother checking the volume levels of his character's voice as compared to everything else), walks around in horrifically empty levels full of invisible walls, reminiscent of a game that was meant to be something totally different and then was abandoned, then be my guest. Buy this.However, if you'd rather save your money for a game that actually has a point outside of walking about, doing little more than faff about, I recommend that route.Perhaps the game will update into something that I could call ""playable."" Perhaps it will actually take on direction. In the meantime, steer clear of this non-game.			"

								I bought the game after seeing it in rift enabled and blared in every media as VR supported only to find out on its forums that the feature is coming up ""soon"" (and this was posted in august!). So I was pretty much scammed by marketing and when you check the community hub other users have done the same mistake too...the developer does no effort to tell that the feature is still not available.To tell the truth what this tech demo is (since its far from a game yet):1. You have a Gone Home (available on Steam for few dollars) type of house where you can switch lights on and off + close and open drawers. 2. You have terran generator run on UDK. You can pretty much test this youself by downloading it for free.3. You get REALLY FREAKING HORRIBLE voice acting alongside of disasterous dialogue writing (which suits it well). Luckly there are only around 5 lines that the guy repeats, always referring himself as Howard...devs please... the person in Stanley Parable repeats his name because he is the storyteller. If I refer to myself by first name all the time I am either Julius Caesar or just a narsist.All this can be experienced in a ""dream"" which is just a white room filled with cubes or endless catacombs. Depending on which one you like to have dreams more about! After about 2 hour of gameplay I found yet another interesting catacomb where I could run around to shut down the (wait for it..) lights in it! ...I need to spoil you, but my fun of running around and shutting lights was spoiled by black blob that teleported me outside the catacomb. I havn't had that much fun since 8bit Nintendo or C64 where this kind of gamplay was quite normal.Let's say something positive too: The background audio doesn't get annoying in the first 1 hour. The second hour on the otherhand...1/10THIS IS WORTH AVOIDING BY ALL COSTS (Even with 33% off steam sale)TL;DRThis is not early access alpha, this is ""I finally got it complied!"" prototype.			"

What the F!No no wait here's the best part. Some tools get stuck infront of you and you can't change it unless again you close the game and re open it,And guess what! all of those bugs only in the first 15 minutes of the game!

								An incredibly lacking game with the most annoying protagonist who feels obliged to point out every minor obvious thing. If you're looking for the next big story-telling first person adventure like Dear Esther, look somewhere else entirely (and also don't look at Gone Home, for similar reasons).			"

												Ok I recommend this game IF you like 1st person puzzle games (Like Ether One, though it isn't nearly as good as that) AND don't mind a slower pace. It's fairly interesting, The puzzles are nice and I like the setting. However this game does have some downsides that seriously injure it so wait till it's on sale. Don't pay the full price unless you think you REALLY want it.Let me give you a rundown of the largest cons. -THE ITEMS! I beat the whole game without using a SINGLE item.  Oh it gives you plenty and you have an easy enough to understand inventory that allows you to swap between them but all I could think was ""What is the point of these useless items?"" Well here's the thing, the items have uses but you can beat the game without using any of them, additionally the game never bothers to tell you that you can use an item by hitting F while you are holding it.-The forced dialogue! There's a conversation that gets revisted several times throughout the game and basically it builds the background. As you progress through the game more and more of the conversation gets revealed (about 4-5 segments in total). It's a cool mechanic HOWEVER, there is no way to fast forward through the parts you've heard already meaning you will be hearing the same begining conversation several times and it will get longer each time. So basically be prepared to go do something for a few minutes every time you finish a level.Minor beefs include: -too much character visability for a first person game. (This is just a personal preference of mine when I'm playing first person games I don't want to see the character other than arms or in the occasional mirror)-controls are a bit shakey (not terrible you get used to them soon enough)-not really enough puzzles-slightly empty at partsGood thingsThis game does a fair amount well.-The setting is cool and the level designs are interesting. (Personally I particularly enjoy settings where things are slightly out of place and this dream game does that well.)-The self narration seemed odd at first but I think it goes well with how the game turns out as it's about understanding the character.-The puzzles are enjoyable for the most part.TLDR: If you like 1st person puzzle games, get when on sale.Tips for playing:-F to use current item-select the empty hand if you don't want to hold an item atm-the paper changes when the dream changes check it often-the alarm clock wakes you up allowing you to exit the current dream if you get stuck.

												**UPDATE: So after the 1.1 update most of the technical issues have been addressed. The game is great, and admittingly I should have known there might be some bugs b/c I bought the game on launch day. The game is certainly quite a gem to behold now.**ORIGINAL: A quick synopsis; the game is great but is so buggy you can't even enjoy it. Firstly, I would like to comment that the concept, music, astetic appeal, and overall feel of the game is excellent. The developers have made something really cool. So, with that being said, I've had problems with EXTREME screen tearing (not hardware related from the other comments I've read), and at times the game won't even boot at times and I'll actually have to restart the computer just to get it to start. I bought this game on sale and right after it launched, and given the severaty of these technical issues I cannot enjoy this game. I hope the developers improve this wonderful gem so I can come back and give it a better review.			"

												Too short, too glitchy, too bad. While the idea of the game is great (it's basically a walk and click adventure playing in the subconscious mind with a set of varied puzzles to solve) the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. Looking through walls while standing against them with your back is a nuisance, but not knowing whether you have solved a puzzle or not because you don't get any indication that you did solve it is just horrible. Then there's the shortness, the game just lasts too short for its price and has little to no re-playability value, once the puzzles are solved restarting would only mean being able to solve them faster. All in all, nice try, no cigar. "

												Game is really challenging, have been playing it, getting addictied, worth the price. I just want to know how to fix preformance. Everytime I get into the desert level ""forgot the name""  it sometimes have lag spikes but runs really smoothly at the same time. Need to know how to fix the preformance so lag spikes can stop happening. Really love this game so far. Now I just need to get an Oculus Rift to play it... One question, can you use a controller to play this game? Or no? And have a question, does this game have event updates? For example, on a Youtube video in Desert zone I noticed it was snowing and mine wasn't. And will there be a Christmas dream level update since there was a Halloween one? How do those works? Thanks for making a great game coming from someone who loves Lucid Dreaming. :)			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not there. I'm a fan of other so-called ""walking sim"" games, but while the environments in Dream are pretty to look at and explore, they're dull to play in. Most of the gameplay is figuring out whether something's a bug or bad design. Why is the tunnel to the meadow sideways? Is that a puzzle or a glitch? What's with the endless corridor?What do items do? When? How?Not to mention it all doesn't feel very dream-like. There was a lot of potential for something really interesting here, but it just comes off as uninspired. "

												Cobbled together from a bewildering variety of products (I've never accepted so many EULAs for one program before in my life), Dream is a game that is, for lack of a better word, sloppy. The concept of a Myst-like game that takes place wholly in dreams was an interesting one, certainly one which got me interested enough in the game to buy it. However, the graphics are a disappointing mishmash, the controls fiddly and non-immersive, and the user interface completely unhelpful. Collision detection and other issues with simply moving around made the game feel tedious, where I'd hoped to experience a sense of wonder and novel exploration, as well as meaningful and engaging puzzle-solving.Instead I got a disappointing mess that felt unworthy of being called a game product, though perhaps it would be a suitable game-in-progress.Though it is far from expensive, I would suggest saving your money for something worth playing.

												After so many uninteresting puzzles and lackluster settings, I decided to not finish this game.  I got to about halfway through the final act and realized this game had left me bored the whole way through. For a game with such an interesting concept, it just seems to go nowhere and doesn't adequately use the dream concept.  You're supposed to be exploring dreams for God's sake!  Why are you having us do something as mundane as conveyor belt puzzles in a resort that looks like one you could actually find in the real world.  This is a video game.  You could have us exploring different worlds and seeing incredible vistas that would be impossible in real life.The description says the character's ""waking hours are tedious and dull"" and it doesn't seem like his dreams are any different.  Go ahead and skip this game.  You won't be missing much.			"

I wish the game felt more completed and wasn't so buggy, it's for that reason that this game has mixed reveiws; I'm sure if the game wasn't so buggy and cryptic more people could enjoy it.The Story is where this game really shines to me, granted, it's not your real driving force to complete the game, but I found it really powerful the way it is layed out using symbolism in dream environments and details to make you feel the emotion more.

Early Access Review
								Update 5/15/2016: Little has been done on this game and I am quite disappointed. And the movement of this game has started to make me feel sick. The swaying is something people have complained about. I'm going to have to change this to one I don't recommend. I hope the developers get back to this and start to dramatically improve this game. There have been fun exploration games like Qbeh-1, Talos Principle, etc... none of them that made me have a headache like this game. And the dock area was the worst. Oh and I haven't played it in a long while, and my progress seems to have reset when I first opened it. Sorry, but I need to change my review to a thumbs down. For now.Old Review: This is just a nice casual exploration game with some very interesting parts to it. The nightmare parts are a bit terrifying. The game is still in development so much more will come, but so far I am enjoying the experience. As far as to whether the game is for everyone... it isn't. This isn't a game where you will see non-stop action, even though it is based on the Unreal engine. The graphics are good in certain parts, while not as great in others... but that is to be expected. The puzzles are a challenge at times and require some level of thinking. The experiments in the Augmented Reality offices dream are quite a challenge. I will not spoil much, so i'll keep this short. If you want a game with non-stop action, look elsewhere. But if you like a casual exploration/puzzle game that provides a challenge, I do recommend Dream.			"

Unfortunately what we get is a buggy, atrociously voice acted college project. The game looks fine (although in dire need of a UE4 upgrade) and runs well enough, but there are numerous small problems which continually break immersion, be it clumsy collision detection, lacklustre puzzles, or awkward attempts at deep symbolism which fall flat of the mark.

The landscapes in Howard'as dreams also look pretty darn good too. I hear some people had some nasty glitched when they played, but my play nexperience was just fine. I would most certainly reccommend this game to fans of games like Gone Home, who like some degree of challenge and a tinge of mystery and spookiness to spice it up slightly.			"

It's theme/topic got me very curious at first and I was in it, hating the hunter, hunted a vision... but I got bored a bit. I haven't played for a while now.

												This review here very much sums up how I felt about this:http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/29278But ok, I'll write my own. First, the techinical issues, there are few, but with a game this short I expect none. I thought all the other reviewers were getting bugs from some unfinished version, but what I played is essentially a finished product. The most hilarious bug is when I picked up some random painting in the house and couldn't let it go and thus was stuck, this happenned very early on. Another is that some of the settings you select will revert back within the same session, everytime a new scene is loaded or something.So there are bugs, right, one can look past them, they aren't game breaking. How about the graphics? They look...decent, although with some downright lack of polish adn odd choices. Why the insanely short depth of field everywhere you go? That makes everything blurry some distance in front of you, it gets old really quick, it's not like it has some beautiful bokeh like in professional photography, it's just blurry. Maybe that masks some of the pop in artifacts, but surprisingly it doesn't mask the lack of antialaising, which isn't even an option, and it's very noticeable. The art style looks pretty at first, until you get into the larger levels and they look the same, oh gosh, the same art assets sprinkled everywhere, the same textures for miles, mazes that you'll just spin around in. I'm a very visually directional kind of person so if everything looks the same and there's no map, I get frustrated and lost. That issue with repetitive graphics really ties into the gamplay. In a game heavy on exploration, there's no incentive to explore when the novetly wears off so quickly and it all starts to look drab. Example, there's a section with four mazes, it all looks the same, and worse yet the lights turn out as you go around it, there's a shadow creature that goes in some pattern, but there's no way to learn or see what the pattern is. That's not good level design, that's not a challenging puzzle, it's just tedium. I really gave up on this in the third act, where there's about fifty little hotel rooms to go in that all look fairly identical, with absolutely no direction as to the purpose of these seemingly useless rooms, there I am feeling utterly lost, and not in a ""I really gotta find the solution"" kinda way. Upon looking up how to do it, you find arrows in these rooms and match the numbers, I think geez, that's not a puzzle, and my reward? Another identical section of these little hotel rooms.You get the idea, so sound and music? This game has it, some people like it, but I'm not into ethereal background music and found the mix quality utterly horrible. You can't hear the protagonist speaking over the music, he seems to murmur, and yet the music isn't even loud at all. I also found myself distracted when the voices didn't match the subtitles, was that inteligible Howard because it says illegible Howard, how did you get that line wrong Howard it's written on the wall Howard?!So in summary, ever since playing Portal 1 and 2 I've been looking for this kind of game, and I thought I would like the relaxing beautiful exploration trip this would take me on as I solved cool puzzles. Instead I found my intelligence insulted, and my aesthetic senses not stimulated at all, and above all utterly frustrated and lost...kinda like in one of those bad dreams...			"

The game also includes many fun side dreams, consisting of their own set of puzzles.The soundtrack for this game is also amazing. Developed by Norman Legies, the music truly portrays emotion throughout each section of the game.The only negative point is that the game is relatively short, only consisting of 3 acts, each with a main dream, 2 side dreams and a nightmare.Overall dream is a amazingly fun game, but you should be prepared for a short campaign.

												If you have a facintation for dreams and lucid dreams in particular, and enjoy playing puzzle adventure games like Myst, The Stanley Parable or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter you'll definitely enjoy playing Dream.  "

												Cobbled together from a bewildering variety of products (I've never accepted so many EULAs for one program before in my life), Dream is a game that is, for lack of a better word, sloppy. The concept of a Myst-like game that takes place wholly in dreams was an interesting one, certainly one which got me interested enough in the game to buy it. However, the graphics are a disappointing mishmash, the controls fiddly and non-immersive, and the user interface completely unhelpful. Collision detection and other issues with simply moving around made the game feel tedious, where I'd hoped to experience a sense of wonder and novel exploration, as well as meaningful and engaging puzzle-solving.Instead I got a disappointing mess that felt unworthy of being called a game product, though perhaps it would be a suitable game-in-progress.Though it is far from expensive, I would suggest saving your money for something worth playing.

												The puzzles are pretty generic and it's very much made for the AR boner, but there's a pointless level that is ONLY for the sake of experiencing the situation through an Oculus Rift, and while the scenery is nice, it feels very barren overall. Play it for the aesthetic, don't play it for the gameplay.			"

												A puzzle in Act 3 cannot be completed, because the buttons don't have triggers. This locked me out of completing the game.

I have tried several times to delete it and reinstall it to no avail. When I start up the game it will get as far as letting me select to start a 'New Game' then will promptly crash.Otherwise, fantastic game.10/10 would crash again.			"

												I'd love to love this game. It could have been spectacular, an immersive puzzler up there with The Talos Principle or Antichamber. Unfortunately what we get is a buggy, atrociously voice acted college project. The game looks fine (although in dire need of a UE4 upgrade) and runs well enough, but there are numerous small problems which continually break immersion, be it clumsy collision detection, lacklustre puzzles, or awkward attempts at deep symbolism which fall flat of the mark.

												After so many uninteresting puzzles and lackluster settings, I decided to not finish this game.  I got to about halfway through the final act and realized this game had left me bored the whole way through. For a game with such an interesting concept, it just seems to go nowhere and doesn't adequately use the dream concept.  You're supposed to be exploring dreams for God's sake!  Why are you having us do something as mundane as conveyor belt puzzles in a resort that looks like one you could actually find in the real world.  This is a video game.  You could have us exploring different worlds and seeing incredible vistas that would be impossible in real life.The description says the character's ""waking hours are tedious and dull"" and it doesn't seem like his dreams are any different.  Go ahead and skip this game.  You won't be missing much.			"

												Ok I recommend this game IF you like 1st person puzzle games (Like Ether One, though it isn't nearly as good as that) AND don't mind a slower pace. It's fairly interesting, The puzzles are nice and I like the setting. However this game does have some downsides that seriously injure it so wait till it's on sale. Don't pay the full price unless you think you REALLY want it.Let me give you a rundown of the largest cons. -THE ITEMS! I beat the whole game without using a SINGLE item.  Oh it gives you plenty and you have an easy enough to understand inventory that allows you to swap between them but all I could think was ""What is the point of these useless items?"" Well here's the thing, the items have uses but you can beat the game without using any of them, additionally the game never bothers to tell you that you can use an item by hitting F while you are holding it.-The forced dialogue! There's a conversation that gets revisted several times throughout the game and basically it builds the background. As you progress through the game more and more of the conversation gets revealed (about 4-5 segments in total). It's a cool mechanic HOWEVER, there is no way to fast forward through the parts you've heard already meaning you will be hearing the same begining conversation several times and it will get longer each time. So basically be prepared to go do something for a few minutes every time you finish a level.Minor beefs include: -too much character visability for a first person game. (This is just a personal preference of mine when I'm playing first person games I don't want to see the character other than arms or in the occasional mirror)-controls are a bit shakey (not terrible you get used to them soon enough)-not really enough puzzles-slightly empty at partsGood thingsThis game does a fair amount well.-The setting is cool and the level designs are interesting. (Personally I particularly enjoy settings where things are slightly out of place and this dream game does that well.)-The self narration seemed odd at first but I think it goes well with how the game turns out as it's about understanding the character.-The puzzles are enjoyable for the most part.TLDR: If you like 1st person puzzle games, get when on sale.Tips for playing:-F to use current item-select the empty hand if you don't want to hold an item atm-the paper changes when the dream changes check it often-the alarm clock wakes you up allowing you to exit the current dream if you get stuck.

												Ok Lets just say its bad. The entirty of it is just running thrugh mazes. (or the first part i cared to play) Well at least you get a meaningless achivement. I put an hour to do this just to find the 4 mazes that you HAVE to explore every single inch of. Honestly it wont let you progress until you have. I never wanted to ""explore"" the rest of his dreams and never cared. Oh well time for a refund.			"

												So. You give some randoms a free engine, they throw together some free 3D items, dump in some text and voilÃ , they call it a game.Really.That's what it feels like. People, if you don't have a story to tell, just shut up. Don't make a game from it. A game of nothing-ness. If I waste my life playing games, at least I want to have fun doing it.			"

												The game is great and a LOTof fun.HOWEVER, there are too many bugs and glitches with it so far, sometimes within the gameplay it is actually hard to tell what should and SHOULDN'T be there, due to it being in a dream like state.The user interface is clunky and never fully explained, you find yourself picking up items without being able to use them correctly.Would be a fantastic game if bugs were sorted, WOULD NOT buy at full price. Very short game, the only reason i ended up spending so long on it was trying to restart it so many times to overcome bugs :c			"

								I know that this is an early access game but this really pisses me off. I am stuck on the same level that many other people are too. The infamous Terrace Walkway. The pillars just keep jiggling around with out any pattern and I have no control over them. If this would get fixed then it would be a whole lot better.			"
