												For those who have not previously come upon it, Kentucky Route Zero is a five part point and click/text adventure hybrid described by its creators as a ""magical realist adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it.""I often find Kentucky Route Zero a difficult game to describe. The narrative follows the final delivery of a driver whose company is undergoing financial difficulty, as he seeks out 5 Doogwood Drive, an address that isn't on Conway's maps. Stopping for directions, Conway is told that it can be found on the other side of the Zero, a mysterious underground highway that the game derives its name from. As a vague plot synopsis, that probably isn't immediately appealing, and yet Kentucky Route Zero manages to be one of the most engaging and interesting gaming experiences I've ever had.Gameplay is a juxtaposed combination of traditional style point and click adventure mechanics in 3D scenes for key areas, and evocative text only sequences, punctuated by an exploration oriented ""driving"" interface represented as a stylised overhead map.The choices the game presents you with rarely offer alternate outcomes. In contrast to more traditional point and click adventures, where progressing is a matter of chosing the correct dialogue options or performing the correct tasks, KR0 opts for a far more subtle and resonating style in which your choices define the tone of the game and the attitudes of its characters in response to the situations and predicaments they encounter. In some ways, it feels as though the player's actions control a shifting lens through which subsequent revelations are seen - an understated, yet powerful mechanic that somehow makes the player's actions feel more real and meaningful than one would usually find.The characters in and around the Zero feel deep and rich. Even characters whose appearances seem bit parts carry a sense of life and believability. As the game progresses, Conway attracts a party of companions who join his search for 5 Dogwood Drive, each with their own outlooks and energies, motivations and troubles. Each new character shifts the dynamics of character exposition, bringing new aspects of familiar faces into relief with the flashlight of their own perspectives.Visually, Kentucky Route Zero offers a deceptively simple style, and at first glance could be mistaken for 2D vector work. Instead, KR0's point and click scenes are entirely 3D, combining some great set design, fantastic lighting and some nice camera work with dynamic effects that work to enhance and support the game's aesthetics rather than define them (in particular, there's a super neat bit with some trees towards the end of Act II that creates an opportunity for two pairs of characters' contrasting experiences and enthusiasm to be presented at once in a way that is both interesting and in some ways moving).From a sound design perspective, the game is equally striking, with the already atmospheric visual and narrative tone boosted further by the kind of immersive soundscapes that tend to not be directly noticed until highlighted, but as soon as you're aware, you can't help but admire them.Kentucky Route Zero is a masterful work of interactive storytelling that is executed astoundingly well. For those who already know this, here are a couple[superlevel.de] of articles[superlevel.de] and[superlevel.de] interviews[animalnewyork.com] which are worth checking out if you haven't come across them already.If you're undecided or would like to see more examples of this team's narrative work, Cardboard Computer have so far released two free standalone interludes, Limits and Demonstrations[kentuckyroutezero.com], and The Entertainment[kentuckyroutezero.com], which take place between Acts I and II, and Acts II and III respectively.

												Y'know, when all was said and done, Kentucky Route Zero managed to be my game of the year. I couldn't tell you exactly why. The game's trippy, mysterious. Gorgeous. I could stare at this game for hours, but, of course, the mystery drives me on--because this is a real mystery, not some generic 'who murdered whom?' It's far more than that. I want to know who Julian is, what significance the mine has, how the barn ended up in a museum, and why the museum's occupants... why does the museum have occupants? Kentucky Route Zero is a mystery, a real mystery. I want to know more--I must know more!And yet... the more I know, the less I understand. This is less of a traditional point and click adventure game, and more of... well, some sort of adventure. There's one point in Chapter 2 where my mouth dropped open, though I was looking at nothing more than inky blackness and a 2D map sketched in white lines.This game looks good, but it sounds even better. The experience is practically made by sound. Oh, sure, the strange figures that appear if you shut off the lights in the mine are frightening, but something about it is way more compelling when you've got those headphones plugged in. Immersing yourself in this game's aural landscape is like taking a bath. Soothing. Gentle. Calm.And yet... something there is unsettling, always unsettling. This is a room with a Bureau in an old cathedral, an abandoned storage facility that used to be a church, a floor occupied entirely by bears. This is a game that unnerved me with a simple phrase and a sound effect. This game... this game... it's something you, and everyone you know, ought to try.As games I tried in 2013 go, Kentucky Route Zero was moving, mysterious, engrossing, and over all too quickly. For now. The first two chapters have released, and the game will be updated with three more in the future. I can't wait.I loved every second of it, and I'm sure you will too.			"

												I never played many point and click games so I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I really enjoyed my time with Kentucky Route Zero. Its strange and puzzling story/atmosphere will certainly bring in fans of David Lynch and surreal story lovers.Soak in the world, the characters and the music. Don't speed your way through.And While all the acts aren't out yet, I only have positive feelings towards the devs. They are taking their time to make it the best they can!			"

												I've finished the 1st Act and I have to say I'm impressed. About 10 years ago, I went to a university course on ""Hyperliterature and new forms of narration"". It was very enlightening, we studied some of the new waves of storytelling, watched some David Lynch movies, played some live rpg games (based on Kult, best rpg ever) and so on... best course I ever attended, shame it was so short. I remember writing an essay about videogames, mostly focused on my experiences with graphic adventures and a game I couldn't stop playing by then called Half Life 2.  I just wish I could go back again today, after playing Kentucky Route Zero. It feels like the kind of game I was wishing for in those days.KR0 is a captivating exercise of storytelling, sucks you in from the beginning and minimizes the interface to focus on the audiovisual experience. Same goes for all the technical aspects of the game. Graphics, music and gameplay are well polished and just let you enjoy the story without getting in the way. They all do their part, and do it very good. The enviroment is dreamlike, inmersive, deceptively lifeless. So many details  appearing out of the corner of the player's eye, so many left to the player's imagination.This is not a usual adventure, but more an interactive story. The narration comes mostly from what you see and what you hear, saving you from reading huge walls of text. Actually, the text is just another element, and it doesn't give any important information most of the time. It does add up to the overall experience and it's a pleasure to read.Something that caught my attention is that you never seem to be in control, just like in a dream. Your mind will struggle to follow a logic path to the story, but the game will break your will and ultimately take you for a ride. Just sit back, get comfy and enjoy it. I can't wait to go back and continue with the game, just wanted to recommend it to everyone looking for a good, innovative experience in the already bursting indie scene. Games like this make me feel proud to be a gamer and, having passed my 30, look to my friends who jumped off the videogame train because it wasn't mature enough for society standards and think ""You don't know what you're missing"".PS. Big points for the references to Gabriel García Márquez, recently passed away colombian writer, creator of the magic realist that influences this game heavily. I bet he would be proud and happy to play this game.			"

												Edit for edit's sake, because I just realized that my review was from 2015 and the game came out in 2013 or something. It's now April 2017. No news about the final episode on the horizon. Episode 4 came out over a year ago.EPISODE 4 UPDATE: So, episode 4 just came out, after being announced ""almost done"" about 9 months ago or so. It's still a scam imho. Wonder when the final episode will come out. Perhaps 2020. If you're going to do an episodic game and your episodes are years apart, you're doing it wrong, because no one will bloody remember all of the previous episodes without replaying them...and I refuse to waste any more time on this ""game"". So I started up episode 4, briefly wondered why I'm on a boat now instead of a truck, remembered some of the characters, had pointless, meaningless conversations with people and clocked out about 1.5 hours later. You're travelling around this river and at each stop you have a choice of which characters to follow I guess...so there might be some replayability, but why would you want to replay any of it? It's just walls and walls of text with NO interactivity whatsoever. You can just click on random answers and what does it matter? It's not like your choices matter in any way, you just get different text passages. Now that might be interesting in and of itself, if the story weren't so inconsequential. Nothing interesting happens in this episode. There is no real sense of mystery anymore. Only 1 scene that is remotely intriguing. Why do I care about the life story of some person I will never meet again in the game? Why do I have to listen to an old man talking to a fish for several minutes? Why can't I skip cutscenes when nothing is happening? Why do I have to listen to a ""concert""? The art direction and world building is neat again, but the rest...where is the rest? Where is the GAME in all of this? Where is this story heading? What was episode 4 even for? Does it even have any relevance to episode 5? You could have boiled this game down to 3 scenes perhaps (instead of 12) and your overall knowledge of what was happening would be the same. Very sad.I'm sorry. I can't recommend this game any longer. It's been out for over 2 years now I think. It's supposed to include 5 acts...the THIRD act was published over ONE YEAR AGO...this is ridiculous (after already waiting for one year after Act 2). IF the game is ever going to be finished, judging by the glacial pace the dev is setting, it's going to be somewhere in 2018 probably, so...stay away from it.Now, what IS the game? It's actually a weird pseudo psycho trip. Calling it an adventure would be grossly overestimating the game's abilities. It's  a narrative driven story that drifts so far into lunacy it's getting extremely hard to even follow it, let alone understand what's going on. It's definitely ""interesting"" and I would have liked to actually finish it, but again...where are the remaining 2 episodes? You can't charge 23 bucks for an episodic game and then after over two years not even finish the story...that's actually a scam if I'm totally honest, so I wonder if you would get your money back from Steam...probably not, because Steam customer support sucks♥♥♥♥♥..

												There are roads in Kentucky that take you unknown, weird places if you allow yourself to go there. This game is a shortcut to those places wherein you don't need your imagination irl...instead the devs have done all the work for you. Enjoy the surreal, enjoy not having to work for strange magic, enjoy Ky. Rte. 0 ;-)Btw, if you are ever in the area of Mammoth Cave, do try to visit Pig, Ky - there's an amazing BBQ joint with the most perfect fried catfish and hush puppies...I was literally dragged back to my grandmother's house in a weird space/time continuum...so when I speak of this game, I know whereof I speak ;-p			"

												This game is broken up into five acts, the first of which was released in January 2013, nearly 3.5 years ago. The developers said they had intended to release a new episode every three months, which would have wrapped the game up by April of the following year. As of now, we still only have three episodes. There were also very few progress updates until recently, leaving customers in the dark as to its status for a long time. The developers insist that the game is still being worked on, but the fact each act only takes around three hours to finish would seem to suggest the developers aren't putting a whole lot of effort into a timely completion. It's a shame because the acts that are out are really good, but the constant delays and the developers lack of a sense of urgency force me to not recommend it.			"

												I agree with what most people say: The game has a cool art style, interesting story, and music. I do like the game but I can't recommend it in its current state especially for a $25 price tag. I bought it half price but even at that you've got a game that is only 2 hours long and add the price to the fact that it has been out for nearly a year with only 2 hours released I would caution anyone interested to wishlist this game and wait for both a final product, all five episodes, and a good sale, something more enticing than half off. That being said, I'm looking at it from a ""bang for your buck"" point of view and in my opinion, the game isn't good enough to outweigh how short it is right now.			"

												Two things1. Don't listen to these negative reviews claiming the game is a ""scam"".2. Don't look for anything on this game's story, if you think you're going to buy it, buy it without an idea of the story you're about to witness.It's true, Kentucky Route Zero has been in the making for over a couple years now. But how can you blame a 2 person devolopment team? Especially when they offer so much with each episode. Not to mention the INTERMISSION episodes they release for free on their website cardboardcomputer.com.It's been over a year since the last episode, and they have a srict rule of not having release dates for each new episode. An admirable stance as release dates can be a source of stress for indie developers, and often cause skimping out on certain aspects of the game.So they work at their own pace, working to make the story they aim to, with no restrictions. And they've done an excellent job so far.I refuse to say anything about the story, as I walked into this game with no prior knowledge beyond it's good reception. I've found it incredibly amazing and all the more engaging because of this.I will say this game is very close to the peak of the ""Weird Americana"" story genre. It's a game filled with ghosts (in more ways than one), tall tales, shady backgrounds, and many old things.It's a story of missed connections, faded relationships, longing, and regrets. The developers say it will be a tragedy, and I believe it.A major complaint is the illusion of choice in the game. Being text based, it offers you many different conversational options. The main character's backgrounds, feelings, and dialogue are all filled in by you through these options. But episode to episode they don't make much difference.But is that a real complaint? The developers have the story they want to tell, I don't blame them for not making these options integral to the games plot.But furthermore, why must these options have tangible effects in the game world? Each of the characters aren't total blank slates, but they do leave much room for your own filling in. I've found myself creating these character's intangible personalities, and basing my decisions off what i've created.And it's not like in life there are either options A, B, or C that all lead to different outcomes. Some decisions dont matter in the larger sense. Some don't make a difference.In short I love this game and if you're into narrative video games, grab this ASAP.A last warning though, I can't agree with the price either. I happened to get it on sale for 10 dollars, and I suggest you wait for a sale too. I don't see any problems with offering the individual episodes for the people not totally committed to the story, or skeptical of it's entertainment. BUT, I do see that it's a good excuse to say ""hey, if you buy it all, why not play through them?"".A+			"

												It's tricky to write about Kentucky Route Zero because it's best to know as little as possible about it before playing. The last thing I want is to reveal too much.That being said, I can tell you that it's not a typical adventure game in many aspects. It's closer to the new Telltale games in the fact that it has no puzzles, no collecting items, nothing to distract from the essence of the game. It's driven by dialogue, observation and exploration, any action scenes are basically non-existent. The most unique thing about it is the narrative mechanic. The player shapes the story, but not in a way that you might expect. The story is very reflective and melancholic, yet not self-absorbed or pretentious like some sad stories tend to be. It's quite ambiguous and not at all straightforward, exploring multiple themes and leaving a lot of room for interpretation and discovery of its meaning - not a thing for everyone. It might even seem not quite coherent at times, but there's a method in this madness. Audiovisual design is flawless. Distinctive art style helps create the vagueness and uncanny feeling of the world, perfectly corresponding with the story. There's a lot of atmosphere in almost every scene. Oh, and the scenes. Beautifully crafted, the moments they present can range from calming and touching to rather unsettling ones. And one of them is just the most perfectly executed musical performance I've ever seen and heard in a videogame. In overall it's not a game for everyone. You won't find in it a dramatic and dynamic plot, exciting action or difficult choices. What you'll get instead is a truly unique game full of beautiful, thought-provoking writing and overflowing with atmosphere.			"

												The description for Kentucky Route Zero says that it takes ""roughly the length of a summer night"" to finish the game. Having had overwhelmingly positive experiences playing other games (Bastion, Minecraft) during summer nights next to an open window, I decided to do the same with this one. At around 12pm, I started the game. After 3 Acts and 4 hours of absolute bliss, I looked up from my screen and saw the light of dawn creeping into my room. Feeling a bit lightheaded, both from sleep deprivation and the emotional overkill I had been feeling, I decided to put on some pants and climb the hill behind my house to watch the sunrise, which felt like a wonderful conclusion to the events in the game and was generally a great start into the following day. Pros:- Great Atmosphere, Storytelling, Plot, Soundtrack and Art Style- Wonderful blending of Point-and-Click and Text Adventure mechanics, leaving a lot of the game to the player's own imagination- This game not only has character development, this game IS character development, both on and off screenCons:- only 3 acts available so far- staying up all night left me slightly tired the next dayDefinetely get this game!

												It is spooky, odd, unsettling, disturbing, and unfinsihed.  It's a ghost story, and then it's surreal and absurd, and deeply disturbing from time to time.  Too real and too painful in places.  A ghost story that's just a shade away from reality.  It's not realistic graphics, and it's not jump scares.  But it haunts me.  And I don't think I have a second playthrough in me.  I don't think I want to walk through that graveyard again.  But how is it?  It's phenomenal.  It's an experience.  It's clicking and reading.  No real action.  Not ever too puzzling.  But so odd of an experience.  Characters I care about, and other characters I despise for one reason or another.  I will gladly play Act IV when it releases, but sometimes while playing, I would have to save and quit and walk around the real world to make sure I was in the right reality.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero can be charming and relaxing on one part of the road, then creepy and surreal on the next. It's obviously influenced by Lynch, but it's a lighter version of his surrealism, never completely succumbing to darkness. Heck, you might even get some bluegrass songs to lighten the mood. The visuals are incredible, with some truly great panning shots and camera work. For this aspect alone I feel obliged to replay this someday. This is a  story-driven game that gives you choices in conversations, but luckily without a big 'this game adapts to the choices you make'-stamp. Choose, but don't worry about the consequences. Just react however you feel like, without the risk of unwanted results.There are only two episodes available now (out of five), but these alone are more than worth your time. I urge you all to take a drive and look out for the Zero.			"

Review currently in progress, to be updated as more episodes are released.There's something just slightly off about Kentucky Route Zero.Not the sort of ""off"" that turns you away and makes you consider whether it ought to be locked up with its unnerving peers, but the kind that leaves you puzzled and transfixed upon the play of sorts being performed before you. The unusual atmosphere and odd interactions with characters is at once unsettling and hypnotic, its logic clashing with reality yet somehow seeming entirely natural in this bizarre segment of road you've found yourself lost on.The plot trickles out through nebulous exchanges with persons that may or may not even exist, giving you answers as they simultaneously create an abundance of new questions you haven't time to ask. This ambiguity could very easily be the downfall of the game, but there's a self awareness to the narrative's construction that holds it together as it continues to distort its world into a mysterious cloud of disconnected yet overlapping plot lines.I'm being intentionally unclear with my descriptions because Kentucky Route Zero relies so heavily upon the player's unknowing of what exactly it is. Were I to have come in already versed on its events, I have little doubt that the magic that kept me engrossed as I tried to fit the misshapen pieces together would have been lost, and what I would have been left with would be an artistically inspired but far less stimulating experience.After only playing the first act of five, I haven't a great deal more to say about Kentucky Route Zero besides how immensely it made me want to explore more about it and learn its secrets which it has only just touched upon. It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what makes it so interesting to me, but more than anything it is likely the endless possibility of what could be in store after what was essentially a prologue of sorts. Perhaps I'll have better answers when I've been through the remaining acts, but regardless of what they contain, Kentucky Route Zero has already established itself as wholly compelling. It feels like the road I'm heading down could take me anywhere, and I want to see everything along it.Act II Review UpdateAfter completing the second of Kentucky Route Zero's planned five acts, the first is now clear as existing as a sort of necessary introduction to what is to come. It displayed hints of an almost hypnagogic second world hidden beneath our own, setting the story in motion without drifting too far from reality as it slowly allowed its mystery to reveal itself.Act II is when the Zero is finally allowed to take the spotlight, where former pretenses are rejected as the developers firmly take our hand to guide us through the play being performed in front of us. Kentucky Route Zero's vision of what it is and what it will be is so strong, so confident, that it need not hamper itself with explaining its events as its method of storytelling so entirely encompasses its plot that it would almost be detrimental to the experience should any clear answers be given, or perhaps exist at all.As its dreamlike world comes more into focus I still have no idea where it plans to take me, and oddly I'm entirely accepting, even excited by that lack of knowledge. Kentucky Route Zero is keeping me in the dark, but its steady reassurance that it knows the way through is enough to keep me moving onward. Wherever this might end up, act II showcased nothing that leads me to believe it has any chance of losing focus, only becoming more captivating as each new piece of its overarching narrative is introduced and I'm taken further inside boundless imagination.

												Kentucky Route Zero is best described as an interactive visual novel, along the lines of Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery EP.There is a huge amount of talent being demonstrated here, and primarily for that reason I'm ultimately going to give this game the thumbs up.Unlike related games such as the marginally more successful The Walking Dead, however, it left me with little real feeling of player agency.Sure, there is some flexibility to move around and experience different absurdist vignettes between story-arc set pieces, however for the most part these don't pretend to influence the narrative progression in any observable way.The game doesn't demonstrate any noticeable sense of self-awareness about this either, like in The Stanley Parable.Ultimately, the best comparison I can draw is to meditative extended video-clips, such as Baraka and Powaqqatsi, in that this game is a thing that exists primarily to be watched and admired.As a meditation to be watched and admired, this game succeeds admirably.The block colour/silhouette style is gorgeous; the audio sparse and evocative; and the melancholy dialogue intelligent, mature and well written.The setting is whimsical and dream-like, with absurdist elements, and the pacing and tone works well in the context.I'm on the fence, however, about whether I think that Kentucky Route Zero is any good as a game.As I would define a 'game', player agency seems to me a defining characteristic. Agency might be via micro-decisions, such as what to shoot in a linear FPS, stat progression trees and character customisation in an RPG, or varying strategic and tactical choices influenced by the randomness of procedural generation. It is the perception of player agency, even if only a perception, that adds a level of immersion that allows one to be drawn into a story and personally invest in it.In Kentucky Route Zero, while the player moves various protagonists around the screen and clicks dialogue choices, these rarely have any noticeable influence on the story other than exposition.I therefore find myself drawing comparisons with other, more established, non-interactive media, such as graphic novels, literature and film that are more reliant on narrative and where examples of mature, quality story lines are plentiful.How, then, does this game compare to great film, great literature, or a great graphic novel? On that basis Kentucky Route Zero can reasonably claim to be good, I think, but not quite great.Ultimately, if I want to be taken for a ride I actually get better immersion from letting a story wash over me while reading or watching a movie. At Kentucky Route Zero's pace, the interaction can tend to break immersion rather than enhances it.It does seem to me, however, that there may be a tendency for those well aware of the woeful absence of genuinely intelligent, complex and mature themes in most games to be a tad overenthusiastic when they find a game that does take a decent stab at these, even if it fails on virtually every other measure by which we normally assess computer games (Rock Paper Shotgun 2013 GOTY, I'm looking at you).Having said that, after now playing through Episode III, I feel compelled to add that for the first third of this installment the game genuinely transcends its limitations to become something truly sublime. It is therefore even more of a disappointment when the remaining two thirds of the same episode drops the ball a little on several levels. Nonetheless, there is certainly potential for masterpiece if the game's best form can be recaptured for the remaining episodes.Having now played through Episode III after decent break from the release of Episode II, it is also worth adding that the game doesn't hold up at all well to extended pauses between episodes. The complexity and nuance of the characters and story, one of the game's big selling points, is also its biggest downfall as the minutiae is particularly hard to recall several months down the track. For this reason, I'd urge people to consider resisting the need for instant gratification and wait for the complete five episode experience.Episode III is slightly longer than the first two episodes, possibly due to some repetitiveness. With two more episodes to go, one might estimate that a full meandering playthrough will likely take around 9 hours, which seems fair for a game of this type.Edit: updated 30 June 2014 to reflect having played through Episode III.

												After playing the first episode a couple weeks ago I can easily say I am more drawn to the characters, more engaged in the setting, and more immersed in the atmosphere of this masterpiece than I was with The Walking Dead and almost as much as I was with adventure game classics such as Grim Fandango or Full Throttle.If you enjoy the adventure gaming medium in any way, shape, or form; do yourself a huge favor and play this!

												Man, I tell you what. I played through the entirety of all 3 currently-available episodes on a cold, rainy, New Year's Day 2015, and it was the perfect companion to such a day. Each episode gets progressively more serene, surreal, and...satisfying. It's not a spoiler to say this, but: the dialog choices you make have virtually no impact on the eventual outcome of the story. But that's okay, because the flavor they add is fantastic. They all add to your own personal narrative for the game.Bonus #1: The music is amazing (especially the songs with vocals). And they're all available for free, right there in the install directory of the game.Bonus #2: Be sure to check out the 3 interludes that they released between episodes. They're free downloads from the official website, and add even more color and background to an already great experience.Tl;dr: just buy this, and play it. Don't do the whole 'I'll just wait until all the episodes are out' thing.			"

												I'm going to have to side with the ""Don't buy until finished"" camp. Over 3 years and still incomplete on a 5 Episode game with only 3* of the 5 released at the time of this writing. I'm not sure any game can possibly deliver a satisfying experience when leaving customers waiting so long. I must say I am very disappointed in Cardboard Computer not being much more upfront about their incredibly, insanely long development cycle. Had I known, I would have held off until the complete experience was ready. I mean, we're not talking a few months between content, we're talking almost 2 years waiting for a single episode.Though I don't feel that Cardboard Computer are scamming people, I do feel they are slightly 'shady' and I think they should be a little more upfront with the community and provide a little more contact. I'll happily update my 'review' in 3 years when the game is finished.*As of July 20, 2016, Act IV has been released. My review will stand until I can review the game in its entirety. Check back in 2018.			"

												First: I normally don't review games. Second: I'm seeing a lot of negative feedback for one of my favorite stories ever told in a game*, so I'm reviewing it.Lots of folks complaining that the game* lacks a cohesive story, meaningful interactivity, and lacks ""progression."" Some pine that this was a perfect opportunity for a True Detectiveish point and click. Others are just left startled and confused at what seems like an empty shell of a game. I don't want to be the hipster, art critic dude who says: ""If you don't like it, you just don't get it,"" but based on the criticism I'm reading, people just don't get it.* = I'm not sure you can really consider this a game, and that's likely why people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. But it's worth the money. This is a story told between the lines. It's not a game—it is an elegy for a dying breed: the distinctly southern person. It is meant to point at the pitfalls while sympathizing the issues plaguing the American South right now: alcoholism, debt, lack of work, familial abandonment, rapid culture change, etc. And while most would just like to read a book to experience those things, the ""atmosphere"" and ""sound"" and ""visuals"" that so many negative reviews actually praise are the key to the experience of Kentucky Route Zero. This couldn't be told through a book, because you wouldn't hear and see the dive bars, the truck stops, the old diners. And a book wouldn't be able to sell the experience in such a surreal environment.TLDR: this game is a surreal experience and is focused on digesting ideas over expansive gameplay.			"

												Steam asks me to say ""yes"" or ""no"", so I choose ""no"" in this instance. With that said, if you are interested in what games can do, this is a must play. Absolutely.Between the art and the soundtrack, Kentucky Route Zero is beautiful. You watch scenes literally construct and deconstruct. The ever present ambient music calms you. Personally, the musical performance at the Lower Depths in Act III justified my purchase (though I did buy it on sale). The unfortunate part is that it isn't a game and there isn't a plot. There aren't even characters. It's simply a world that you explore. There's a foundation for a strong game, but the execution relies on one aspect (atmosphere) and abandons everything else. I admire its ambitions--the dialogue selections become a personality test for the player through (sometimes seemingly endless) dialogue selection, and the pacing, when done well, is done VERY well--but, for me, it hasn't (as of Act III) been successful. Random things happening to / at / in the vicinity of empty shells of characters drives me away. I found myself skipping dialogue, hoping to push everything along. Conway limps through the entirety of Act II, nearly slowing the game to a hault by discouraging you to explore the world. Even magical realism and surrealism need a tether; and that may occur in the remaining two acts but that's a little too late for me.			"

												This game really bums me out. There are so many things to like about it; the art, music, and atmosphere are all amazing. And the story is a wonderful surreal journey that you don't often find in games. It's really a shame that I wont recommend this game because it had such promise and I was looking forward to playing it before the first episode was even released.But all that being said, the game is incomplete. You're always going to have to wait for the complete package in an episodic game, but after 2 years without news it seems like we wont ever be getting the rest of it. I played the game when episode 3 came out, and I can honestly say that I just don't care anymore. Even if episodes 4 and 5 eventually do come out, I probably wont bother playing at this point.I fully recognize that this game is made by a really small development team and that these things take time, but whatever the reasons for the lack of updates, it doesn't change that the game has not not been added to in years. Charging $25 for 3/5 of a game without being up front about the fact that there's no schedule for the other episodes verges on deceptive at this point and no one should waste their time and money unless the full game is released.If the game is ever completely I might consider going back and playing through the whole thing again, and will update my review accordingly, but for now it's barely more than half of a game that we probably wont ever see the end of, so there's no reason to play it. Note: Regarding my play time, I actually played it quite a bit longer and completed episodes 1-3, but did so in offline mode so my time wasn't recorded.***Update: I remembered this game recently and decided to check on the status of the remaining episodes. Or rather, I decided to try to find some status on them, but the developer is silent best I can tell. I bought this game over 3 years and still don't have a complete version of it. I'm generally pretty understanding when it comes to delays, but silence from a team that's this far behind is completely unacceptable. I have completely given up any hope or interest in this game ever being finished and honestly think it should be removed from the store until they prove active development. Hopefully that anyone thinking about buying this game will take notice of the fact that it's being as a complete package but isn't and wont buy it.			"

Posted: November 2, 2014
												Let me preface this by typing out why I really thought this would be a game that I enjoy and would be able to recommend:I played and loved pretty much all of the classic point & click adventures in their golden era. From the Sierra adventures to Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, all the Lucasarts games really, Simon the Sorcerer, Baphomets Curse, you name it.In more recent times I really enjoyed the Telltale games and also the more philosophical approach of The Stanley Parable for example.If you are in a similar position and thinking about getting this, it is actually not enough to tell if you will like this game or not. I cannot recommend this to you with a straight face.First off, the graphical fidelity is really limited, as you might have seen already, but I wouldn't really count that as a negative point. The art style is very distinct and on point, and amplifys the creepy and uneasy mood throughout the whole game. They also manage to get some stunning panoramas and effects out of this minimalistic style, it definitely works for this title.As for the gameplay, there really is not much to speak of. It mainly consists of walking, driving and dialogue. The conversations aren't voiced so get ready for reading. A lot. Also a lot of really basic small talk that has no connection to any part of the story whatsoever. There are also frequent, short (mostly optional) detours from the main path that happen entirely in text form, no visuals.As far as I've seen there is no form of puzzles or decisions in the game that have any impact on how it unfolds. I disagreed with people that said this is the same in Telltales games. Although the end result is pretty much always the same, there is at least an illusion of choice and advancement, using a thing with another thing to make something happen. Getting the player busy. There is none of that in KRZ, if anything it is very close to a graphic novel where things play out for you, not through you. (This is also evident in the way it is broken up. Acts and Scenes.)It does a few really neat things, like seamlessly switching the character you control without you actually realizing it.Well then, the story. This is where I seriously got lost. I can't really tell all that much without spoilering anything, but I can tell you that it is basically all over the place. There is a goal or finish that you know about, but it gets replaced with another goal in the first few minutes of the game, and this new one never gets questioned, just accepted as necessary.Come to think of it, everything in this game just gets accepted, nothing is questioned. As a result, nothing gets explained or ""solved"" either. It's like a very elaborate acid trip. A ride you hop in that trails you along, getting crazier and more confusing by the minute. And you really have no choice but letting it happen and not thinking too much about it, moving on.You would think that the game would make fun of itself through it ridiculous developments, but it doesn't. Apart from literally one or two very brief instances (one ""running gag"" and a kid), the tone of this game is dead serious. The soundtrack is used very sparingly, but to great effect, and it's phenomenal. If anything, I really recommend getting that. "

												This game is a scam.There.  I said it.  I tried to come up with a nicer way of saying it, but I just can't sugar-coat the truth.  This game is a complete and total rip-off, and here's why...They're charging full price for a game that isn't just unfinished, but shows no signs of ever being finished.  Simply put, the game is trying to follow the pattern of timely episodic releases popularized by Telltale Games.  There's just two problems with that:1) You can't buy individual episodes.  The only purchasing option on Steam is a full Season Pass.  You can't buy the first episode for $5 and then decide if you like it enough to buy the rest.  Nope, it's all or nothing.2) Releases have been anything but timely.  The first two episodes came out in January and May 2013.  The third was released in May of 2014.  There is no announced release date for the fourth.Think about that for a second.  They are charging full price for a game that has been only 60% done for over a year.  Early Access games wish they could get away with this.What's worse is that game critics have been tripping over themselves trying to heap praise on unfinished product, and it's not hard to see why.  The visual are striking, the music perfectly captures the feeling of rural Kentucky, and the story certainly has me on edge for the next two episodes...What's been delivered is certainly worth an 8/10.  Unfortunately, since two fifths of the game is missing, that gets dinged down to a 4.8/10.  Until the developers get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, I suggest you turn your attention elsewhere.			"

Weird things happen here so choose your answer wisely because some options are unique.

The game (story? narrative?  memory?) doesn't ask you to suspend your disbelief for its rich, aluring, surreal atmosphere; it doesn't need to.  It draws you in, inviting, aluring, mysterious and yet sometimes disturbingly familiar.  Simple and satisfying, that is Kentucky Route Zero... but be warned: once you figure out some of what's driving you along this highway, you might just stop looking for an off ramp.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a ghost story. Not the kind to spook you, but the kind to make you stop and think about life.First off, the bad. It takes a hell of a long time between episodes, which many people have complained about and is a valid issue. Gameplay wise, it's a fairly standard modern adventure game. you explore, solve an occasional puzzle, and talk. Other than that, this is a beautifully designed, beautifully written game that evokes everything from early 40's americana, to the 80's computer revolution, from Lynch-esque surreality to Springsteen-esque yearning. The artstyle is minimalist yet vast, with each scene having a distinctive palette and tone. The writing is top-notch throughout, mature and emotional where a lesser game may have been corny. The music and sound is stellar, combining traditional bluegrass and folk with dark ambient soundscapes.There are choices in the game, yes, but they are not the kind of BIG, GAME-CHANGING choices that you'd see in a TellTale style game. The choices you make define who these characters are, what their past is, what they want to be. There's a beautiful scene in the third act where  Junebug sings a song, and your choices affect the lyrics. This is a beautiful scene for two reasons; each choice is actually sung, the only voice acting in the game, and as you hear it you realise that the song is, in fact, about Conway . Scenes like this are what make the game for me. If you're a fan of adventure games, of litterature, of ghost stories, I highly recommend this game. If the lack of a release schedule bothers you, or if you play adventure games more for the puzzles than the story, you might find this lacking.			"

												Don't give a **** about the delays because this game is incredible. The only other two games I've played as atmospheric as this are Limbo and Hyper Light Drifter. I remember a long time ago I think it was One Life Left that stated Sunless Sea had some of the best written content in all of videogames, and for a while they were correct, until I played this game. I've never enjoyed reading any videogame narration anywhere near as much as this game.The entire game is surreal and abstract - including the writing - so be a fan of that. But if you can handle it, and game atmosphere interests you, this is an absolute must-play.10/10 would cry at the song in the woods again			"

												Kentucky Route Zero takes you on a surreal journey like none that I've experienced in a long time. I especially like how the games shifts which character you control without telling you, but it always makes situational sense. This is truly an interactive story - beautifully woven narrative and some subtle and not-so-subtle imagery sprinkled throughout that makes you wonder what this story is really about. Do yourself a favor and go play it now.Side Note: Playing this game makes me wish I had better reading comprehension skills. It's something I've struggled with my whole life, but this game in particular makes me wish I could process prose more completely. I'm absolutely certain that there are subtleties in the writing that I'm missing, but that doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.			"

												This is a David Lynch movie that I'm never quite certain I'm in. It's the kind of game where I think at the end of it all, the choices I make will tell me everything I ever wanted to know about myself, or not. Because it's like that. I'm not sure it exists. It is a beautiful fever dream, though.Like all art, this is neither good nor bad... it takes you out of your own context.			"

												*SPOILER-FREE*I can't recommend this game enough. I planned on sleeping last night, but I decided I would start up act 2 last night and play through until I finished 3. I ended up totally engrossed in the story of the Zero, on the edge of my seat, envoloped in mystery until the big hours of the morning. Needless to say, I liked it.Basic info: No puzzles, mouse only interaction. That means you can play this on your laptop, in your bed, upside down.Basic story: You're a delivery truck driver, Conway, and this is your last delivery. Ever. But you can't quite figure out the address...Now for the gameplay: what's that like? First of all, there is only one kind of puzzle in the game, and that's at the very beginning. This game doesn't try to be a puzzle game, at least not in the traditional sense. You'll never have to go find that one stupid piece of whatever to fit into the ambiguos slot to progress. Most of your time will be spent reading the humanlike interactions you have with everything around you and the stories they tell you and the stories you tell them. The dialogue and descriptions are all meaningful in the most insignificant way. Your choices don't matter, but at the same time, they are what make up the game. Your choices are what make Conway, his/your companions, and the world of Kentucky Route Zero something uniquely yours. There are no wrong paths in this game, and as soon as you realize that, you can invest into your conversation decisions that sculpt the worldviews of the cast of characters and their perception of Conway, as well as yourself.By the end of this masterful ordeal, you're playing Conway as much as you're playing yourself. People will make comments about Conway that resonate within your psyche because you made Conway who he is, so they're really talking about you. Or maybe they're not.The beautify of this game is left to your own interpretation of the events. So please, don't watch a let's play of this game. Play it for yourself.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is unlike any game I have played before, and so it is pretty hard to explain in terms of genres we are used to. It is definitely a point-and-click game, but it has very few puzzles and it never uses the pre-rendered static backgrounds that have been common in the genre since the 90s. The visual style is simple, but it is a sight to behold. It is amazing what the artist was able to do with flat shapes; shadows and contrast are used heavily to give the scenes depth, and the game actually looks gorgeous in 3D as well.Some of the scenes utilize angles very creatively to hide objects from you until you have done a bit of exploring. Of course this only works because the game has complete control of the camera the whole time.The plot centers around a truck driver named Conway who works for an antique shop. He is trying to get to Dogwood Lane in order to make a delivery, but of course that turns out to be much more difficult than he originally anticipated. The gas station attendant that you meet at the beginning of the game tells Conway that he is going to have to take ""the zero"" and you spend the first act looking for Kentucky Route Zero.Everyone who gives you directions is pretty cryptic, and the landmarks they navigate by border on the surreal. Once you're on the road, you have a lot of freedom and there are more odd places to visit that have nothing to do with the plot of the game, but they add to the atmosphere nicely.I really liked the conversation system they use. You always get to choose what your character says, but I am pretty sure that the story line does not diverge based on that; the choices are purely to shape the character in your own mind.The game sometimes switches the character that you are controlling. Most of the time you control Conway, but when they were introducing Shannon the scene played out from her perspective; Conway was simply marked as ""Stranger."" This gives the player the chance to decide what kind of person Shannon is before she joins the group.If I have convinced you to buy the game, stop reading and go play it now. I'm going to start talking about Act II and I don't want to accidentally spoil anything.At the end of Act I you find The Zero. There, I spoiled it. If you were hoping that finding The Zero was going to be Conway's big break, you'll be disappointed. The Zero is a strange circular highway underground with a very confusing navigational system. Depending on whether you are going clockwise or counterclockwise you will find different landmarks. If you turn around at a particular landmark, you will enter that landmark's layer and you will see different landmarks than before. It's easy to get lost, but don't worry- there is always a way out.Act II continues the outside-the-box storytelling. In one scene the narration and conversations are being related through people who witnessed the scene to a museum staff who is trying to figure out what Conway and Shannon were up to. I found it refreshing and quite delightful.Now seriously, if you are planning at all on playing this game stop reading now. I'm just going to straight-up tell you the craziest stuff that happens.My favorite crazy moment was when I was trying to find a clerk who was supposedly on the fifth floor of an office building. I enter the elevator and see this:""(Conway scans a column of elevator buttons.)Fifth floor. (Diagrams and drafts)Fourth floor. (Archives and records)Third floor. (Bears)Second floor. (Conference room)First floor. (Clerks' offices)Lobby.""No, it couldn't possibly mean real bears. So I go to the third floor.Oh. Bears. Bears that just sit there and watch me as I walk around.And then there was the time when we all went riding around on a giant eagle to find a hidden forest far away from the highway system.The forest scenes were absolutely gorgeous, and some of the images are downright mind boggling. Look carefully at the eagle and the car.Act III:It's been almost a year since Act II came out, with an interlude released in between. Normally I would be pretty miffed, but in this case I don't mind so much. The game is so strange, the waiting almost feels like a part of the experience. Speaking of the interludes, Act III is the first time that these have been clearly pulled into the main game. The Entertainment[kentuckyroutezero.com] was originally built as an Oculus Rift experiment where the player was a part of a theater performance; in Act III you visit the bar where this play was set and find a pair of expensive-looking goggles. Limits and Demonstrations[kentuckyroutezero.com] featured an interactive art installation; in Act III you meet a couple of people whose story was told in that art installation.My favorite moment in Act III allows you to choose which lyrics are sung in a heart wrenching song.A lot of old technology has been featured in Kentucky Route Zero, usually tube televisions or transistor radios. Act III takes it in a computer science direction: a computer simulation called Xanadu has a large role; I am fairly confident that it is a reference to the vaporware Project Xanadu[en.wikipedia.org].Act III also hints at what may be in store for Conway after he completes this delivery run, and it isn't good. It isn't necessarily bad, it just has a vague sense of foreboding, which is a pretty good summary of the series as a whole.Act III certainly does not disappoint, so I definitely recommend that you go pick this game up. Definitely worth the $25 it costs.			"

												As many others have stated in previous reviews, this game isn't like other point and click advetures. It's part dream, part novel with some rye humor thrown in.  If they ever do get to finishing this series, it should be worth picking up again. It does have replayablity in it's current form just to see where your alternative choices will lead. I also found the artstyle appealing as well as the characters. If you like bluegrass and old-timey hymns, I found them to be rather charming and it helped set the tone.A definite buy if want a truly unique experience in a P & C game.			"

Numerous times I just stopped playing and stared at the monitor, thinking outloud, ""Wow"" in just sheer wonder and amazement at how creative and compelling the scenes are.  If you're in the mood for something a bit off the beaten path, definitely give this game some of your time.  It reminds me of O Brother Where Art Thou and I loved that movie for having many of the same  qualities.			"

Great replay value since, as more characters are introduced (acts 3 and 4) you sometimes have to choose which ones to follow in certain parts. I will definitely play through again once I finish. Next time I'll be sure to take plenty of screenshots since the environments are beautiful. The music is awesome as well. Sorry to gush but it is that good!! BUY, PLAY, ENJOY!			"

												I wasn't immediately impressed when I started this game.  I was bugged by this reoccurring thought that, ""Oh, this is just another in a recent string of indie games where everything is just... So Weird."" The story was a little non linear and slow going, and it had to break through a lot of other minor annoyances in order for me to see the merit.  There is a lot of unskippable animation that really grinds (especially when one of the main characters is forced to walk around with a real time limp). It's as though one of the designers put their foot down because they didn't want any of the intricacy of their animations or level design to be missed.  And it is a beautiful game.  I was gradually won over, which is why I kept playing the game, but act three is where I really became a fan. If you have the patience, stick it out to the end.Horrible video game analogy: This game is like Grim Fandango if it took place in a folksy acid dream.			"

												Just waiting for that fifth one. Until then I'll just say thing becuase you could go read literally hundreds of reviews telling you to just shut up and buy the damn thing.It's surrealisitic at it's core, non traditional linear story telling.  You got from place to place, each place is a strange commentary on somethin in life but done in such a way that it really pulls you out of yourself. You will feel isolation, pitty, sorrow, joy, elreaction. This game has little moments that are so well done that it makes you want to be an artist too. Other then that, game play is practically a non entity here, outside of a rare logic puzzle here and there.  And I really mean there. Any way.The music is absurdly good when it's there and lastly all five episodes are tonelly speaking completely different things. Each one borrows some peice of a previous one but in my opinion just enough so, that the games have some shoe string connection, a.k.a. can be seen as 5 peices of a larger whole.To be fair though it's so intresting and lovely made you won't care. Like most things in life it will be more about how you got there.Now let me get back to waiting for episode 5, thank you.			"

												Tried playing this game twice through.  Both times hit a game breaking glitch where the storyline would not progress in Act 3.  Once at the start of Act 3, and once in Act 3, Scene XII.Besides the above,  the story is free flow marginally directed story.  But the story is SO convoluted that you're just spending your mental capacity trying to connect the dots.  Which are so scantly connecting that it makes it almost not worth playing. It has unique down-home comfy acoustics and visual presentation, which gave me a novel enjoyment, and why I even attempted a second playthrough... But the negatives, sadly, do not outweight the positives. P.S.- Note this game is not even complete as released.  They are still developing the farther acts that will complete the convoluted story.

Kentucky Route Zero is a beautiful game. It's stunning in all aspects—visually, poetically, thematically—and it explores many important, often poignant, themes of loss, debt, grief, as well as curiosity, perseverance, and adaptation.At its crux, Kentucky Route Zero (KRZ) is about people. It's about people with stories (nonetheless fictional, or mostly fictional)—stories that provide human connection and emotion-based interaction, and that engage the listener/player. The game description [given at the top of the page] does its job in beginning to encapsulate the game's many complex themes and overtones, and ends on a note which implores players to discover, learn, and explore.""It is important for me in thinking about working on a video game that it be about being alive right now,"" says developer Jake Elliot. Even with only three acts completed out of five total [as of April 2016], the game and its story so far accomplish this in full. KRZ is not about prescribed dialogue or stories, but about the human connections and moments found in players' experiences with these stories. It is the sum of these individual moments that serves to create an experience that is authentic, haunting, and real.Read my full piece on the game here: http://elifessler.com/games/blog/posts/finding-poetry-caves-beneath-kentucky__________Some earlier thoughts on the game:Kentucky Route Zero is a great story with great writing. Kentucky Route Zero is poetry. Kentucky Route Zero is art. I can't express just how much this game means to me and how it's affected me as a person.The world of Kentucky Route Zero features a story with hauntingly incredible characters, emotions, and explorations, and it's much more than meets the eye—not that it seems underwhelming in the slightest, however.This game will make you learn.

												The style and atmosphere of KRZ are great. Some moments really feel magical.However, after some time I lost interest in the story and the characters because it all feels very random. Some new characters appear at random moments, having some random backstory, dragging you to another weird location... Somewhere in episode 3 or 4, I realized that it just wasn't really going anywhere and I didn't care at all about the characters. That realization kind of ruined the magic for me.And apart from that, the game still isn't finished after four years. This is really what ""Early Access"" is meant for. It shouldn't be sold as a finished product right now and definitely not back in 2013. Apparently, instead of finishing the product, the devs are also taking their time to make intermediate stories which are not integrated in the game but are available on their website. I find this very odd.Although I really liked certain moments when playing KRZ, I'm not recommending it and I don't think I'll ever buy something from these devs again.			"

												This game is beyond amazing. The updates have been a bit slow as other people have mentioned - and it saddens me that some would not recommend the game because of this - but are well worth it! They're just making sure that it's done right. And, let me tell you, the game is an absolute master piece. Wonderfully weird and meandering with an ever expanding cast of characters with their own stories and losses coming together and coming apart and coming together again (sometimes.) It is one of those games that is more a visual novel than anything. (Though I would say it's more than that, it's an entire experience.) There are a million little stories told through the characters. Bizarre stories always, sad stories most of the time, always feeling like they're maybe on the edge of some deep meaning. And the dialogue options allow you to take a part in this story telling and guide what happened to the characters. The latest chapter especially allows more freedom, I think, in what happens and what scenarios you experience that gives a greater sense of freedom that the other chapters. I enjoyed this change. It makes a difference if I can decide if my characters are making a mushroom stew or playing cards. Honestly, I wish I could convince everyone to play this game with an open mind, but if I can convince even one person to play who might fall in love with it then I will be very happy.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a highway that you have to believe in - a haunting story that takes places on nighttime Kentucky roads, abandoned mines, and locations not quite ordinary - and the people you get to meet aren't either. If on a slow night you can imagine yourself tuning your radio to a bluegrass station and maybe catch a radio play, you'll love Kentucky Route Zero. The drawback: The sound design of the game is impeccable, evoking the mood of each place perfectly, but due to budget constraints, the descriptions and dialogues are written and not voiced.Right now you'll get act I of what is to be a 5-act-game that has been 2+ years in the making, on a kickstarter budget of $8500. However, this game is by no means cheaply made, and I can see where the developers would need the money now to keep going without entering compromises. If you don't live in the US, their website using the humble store might actually be cheaper than Steam.You should visit cardboardcomputer.com anyway to get all of their freebees - small games the developers have done before that clearly display their attitude to mood and exploration.

												All games are art. Some are like a child's drawings, simple, meaningful. Some are complex works of geometric beauty, story and aesthetic and sound design all blending flawlessly into something greater than the sum of its parts.Kentucky Route Zero is beyond all of that. It's the best of Americana, distilled. A masterpiece in asphalt and ambiguity, broken street-lights and bargains kept. Its soundtrack is wanderlust. Its art style is a stranger you've always known.And its story... Oh, its story... A bittersweet tale of old, forgotten roads and horizons beneath the earth. Of broken souls. Of loss.Breath the open air.Leave your burden behind.I'll see you on the ZERO.			"

												There's a running argument about whether games can be art.KR0 suggests a new argument: whether games can be literature.There's a depth to the writing in KR0 that outshines what you usually see in games by a tremendous margin. Part of that depth is the stubborn refusal to outright explain any of its themes, a decision in stark contrast to how most games choose to make absolutely sure that the player does not miss the Important Message, no matter how little they are actually paying attention.Almost nothing in KR0 is without purpose or meaning. Do not take anything at face value. KR0 has a very high level of difficulty, but of a kind that's not usually found in games.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is the most bewitching, intriguing, thought-provoking, and simply beautiful piece of interactive media I've come across in years. Many criticisms have been levelled against the protracted development time, which is both a weakness (unclear communication) and strength (opportunity to revisit, the release of interludes) of the episodic nature of the game. Now that 4 out of the 5 planned Acts have been released, it's a perfect time to pick it up and dig in. With the recent release of Act IV, it's clear how much care and detail has been put into each successive release - including a major revamping of the engine. Small choices and decisions from each Act carry through in unexpected ways, combining exponentially to create both subtle and major changes in each playthrough. The writing is simply great, too - probably the finest example of Telltale-style narrative choice out there. Every option you don't pick adds flavor to the world, its characters, and their motivations.The game opens up a few times each Act, letting you explore the roads of Kentucky and the mysterious roads & rivers beneath it. Tons of hidden encounters and locations can be found in these parts, completely missable if you choose to rush through. Many places can be revisited, with some surprising changes to be found. It's really a joy to replay and uncover these secrets, choose different paths in conversations, pick up on new threads and connections each time. The game's themes of memory, loss, debt, place, identity...are really embedded everywhere you look. I get a kick out of all of the references and influences, too: historical, architectural, artistic, early poetic computation, stagecraft and set design - not pretentious, just added depth & flavor.A Few Situations You Might Encounter Playing Kentucky Route Zero: - Performing recorded found sounds at a theremin concert on a houseboat. - Playing a text adventure simulating the creation of the archaic supercomputer you're playing it on. - Picking mushrooms on an artificial island of cypress trees. - Exploring a museum of domeciles, mostly inhabited. - Touring a subterranean whiskey distillery underneath a church burial ground.

												Kentucky Route Zero is truly the epitome of the quote ""Every Frame a Painting"". Beautiful, sad and thought-provoking, it's the kind of game you end up sitting in silence and thinking about long after you've finished playing. If you're anything like me you'll probably be screenshotting your way through your playthrough every chance you get; the cinematography and use of colour is just gorgeous and every move the camera makes works to frame the game's subjects in the most gorgeous and cinematic fashion possible (much like Shadow of the Colossus does)*. The attention to detail in the storytelling is simply breathtaking and the humour and references to media/information theory are v clever in their implementation (see: the Shannon-Weaver model).If you enjoy stageplays, quietly weird fiction, and slow, thoughtful and intelligent storytelling then I definitely recommend this game. A wonderful example of Southern Gothic literature and excellent playwriting, it touches on themes such as debt, poverty, loss and being lost, and overcoming obstacles. The characters are diverse, sometimes quirky, often sympathetic, and always fascinating and engaging in their own rights. Having just finished Act IV last night in one sitting I'm left fairly heartbroken at its turn of events, but also hopeful that things will turn out okay in the end, even if the main players may not have much in the means of influence within the world of the game. Ben Babbitt's soundtrack is beautiful and adds perfectly to the ambience of the game, and the aliased style of the graphics are simple and minimalist (especially whilst traveling the Zero) and yet perfectly unique and fitting to the feel and tone of the game.It's a multitude of things that make Kentucky Route Zero as enchanting as it is – it's a poem, it's a ghost story, it's a piece of art cinema;  it's a collection of vignettes on what it means to be lonely vs alone and the many different ways people may find it hard to fit into society. In my experience, it's best played late at night, when it's quiet both within and without – being in the right frame of mind is key to fully appreciating the game, but KR0 does a fine job of bringing you into that mood as soon as you start up the game anyway.I'll finish here with a quote from a Tweet my friend (who gifted me the game) posted last night: ""He just wants to finish a delivery. She just wants answers about a family mystery. Things complicate, as they do. I hope they un-complicate.""So do I... so do I.(*In case you haven't guessed by this point, I am, in fact, a Film Hons. grad and a filmmaker. haha)			"

For a game that doesn't really have puzzles and is pretty much a walking simulator, it's still wonderful and charming. That being said, the game is 3/5 done and there's no sign of it being done anytime in the near future. The last real update for the game's progress was 6 months ago and there has been little since then other then the vague ""It's still alive"". So be warned, what's there is wonderful and worth your time, but there's no gurentee you'll see any conclusion.  "

												A game about exploring the weirdness along the roads and highways of Kentucky, KRZ is a memorable journey through a variety of unique and interesting environments with a wonderful cast of characters.   The visuals are beautiful and the dialogue is the best I've ever seen in a game; both perfectly capture the essence and pull you into the story and world that it creates.  Although the waits between acts have been lengthy, you will find it well worth the wait when you see what they accomplished with the time (Act III came a couple years after Act II but is the most fleshed out, diverse, and impressive to date).If you love games with distincitve visuals, extraordinary dialogue and characters, and a bit of surreal mystery, this game is 100% for you.  See you on the Zero.			"

												When I first started playing this game I was kind of thiking, wtf is going on. You have a truck driver and his dog looking for a mysterious highway that seems to be a portal for all things strange. Along the way he meets some odd characters with even odder stories.  I'm a huge fan of strange and random stories, and this plays out similar to a Douglas Adams novel. A lot of it isn't going to make sense, but who cares? Its fun and does at times make you think about abstract ideas. The graphics aren't reviting, but its really an art form in itself with shadows and some intense music. That scene with Junebug at the bar singing was amazing. I really hope that is implemented again (I haven't played Act 4 because I want to do a full playthrough again).I don't often like replaying games, but I will make an exception for this game. I love the idea behind it and will definetly support any games in the future by Cardboard Computer (what an appropriate name for the makers of this game). The only thing that upsets me is having to wait another couple years for the last act. So sad. I will have to replay YouTube videos of Junebug singing in the meanwhile.			"

												The game has a great score thanks to its composer and performer Ben Babbitt and his friends. It's really one of the nicest scores i've ever heard, I even enjoy listening to most ambient pieces seperately from the game. What make it better are some nice covers of classic bluegrass songs. I've rarely heard this type of music before, but I still find it pleasing to listen to and to understand it via the context of Kenucky Route Zero themes. I think, at this point Kentucky Route Zero is worth its price just for its music alone.I don't see much point in mentioning such things as narrative and quality of writing, lore, art style and locations, random things and details and the way gameplay works, since I can't add anything worthwhile to what other people already said. Overall, Kentucky Route Zero is a great package. I keep returning to it, exploring it from the beginning once each new act is released, and I always find new details about its story and lore and new awesome scenes, locations, etc. Even if the fifth act won't be ever released, I still feel like I've got more from it than I paid for.

												I dont say this lightly, but Kentucky Route Zero is the best point and click adventure game of all time.This is the kind of game that transcends everything that has come before it in its genre to create something truly special and poignant.And it does it with such confidence and creativity in itself, that it doesnt even require gameplay mechanics like puzzles, branching story paths or platforming and combat segments to somehow justify it being a videogame.And make no mistake, this is a videogame, something that cant be achieved in any other medium, and dont let anyone try to tell you otherwise.Boasting a gorgeous artstyle and aestethic, Kentucky is transformed into a feverish purgatory Lynchian dream dealing with themes of loss, grief, nostalgia, regret, memory and longing, creating one of the most mature and well written stories I have had the pleasure to experience.I know im being very vague about this game, but thats because I want you to go into this game fully blind as I did, and be surprised by what you find.Take your time with it, explore every nook and cranny, and let yourself immerse in this beautiful tour de force.And dont get dissuaded by the people angry that the episodes are taking more time to be released than what was promised initially. Once you play it, you will understand perfectly why these devs take their precious time with each episode. I have no problem with waiting for another episode if it will be of the calibre of the 4 before it, and I now wait patiently for the final resolution of this amazing experience.			"

												I have completed all the available episodes and had this to say:Kentucky Route Zero is an incredibly aesthetically-pleasing game with a LOT of potential. It's dialouge and story, however, crippled it's chance to become an Indie-game masterpiece. I really wanted to like this game, truly, but the story was too damn boring to go on. Some parts of the game makes you begging to skip to the next chapter and, in very few occasions, actually has something worth hearing/seeing. But usually, those rare instances are brief and the game drops back into it's same, repetive, boring, routine again. The only thing thats preventing me from unrecommending this to you is because all the episodes haven't been released yet. Perhaps the remaing episodes could truly save the game, but for now, I can only recommend this game for folks who are seriously into those novelty or indie games.			"

												So what that you can't use insane control-mashing combos to immerse yourself in this game - you don't need to. Just a few little clicks of the mouse while the text scrolls past is more than enough to see yourself though this whimsical adventure of the rural deep south. East. What I love about the setting is how it connects the more fantastical elements about astral projections and mysterious time-skips and ties it all up with the familiarity of the light breezes through the cornfields and grandpa's old guitar perched up against the wooden walls with two if its strings missing and other stapes of the 'Murican countryside. I felt as if I was a kid again, poking my nose into other people's business while making up random♥♥♥♥♥♥about places that everybody else visits but nobody else can truly see.

												Act IV of Kentucky Route Zero is a more linear and seemingly more grounded experience compared to Acts II and III (I personally find Act I to be a not-so-abstract-or-confusing introduction to the game, similar to Act IV). It actually now feels like a game with a -- relatively -- clear storyline that you can wrap your head around, rather than the almost nonsensical or random (and even downright boring) string of events that you had to follow before.I would definitely recommend playing Act IV at least twice, since there will be parts that you'll have missed out on during your first playthrough (decrepit Civil War battleship filled with cats, anyone?).Act IV has almost made me forgive the devs for the long delays between the acts.

The subtext in the dialogues, the eerie beauty of the art, the melancholy, the sensation of weird that that makes you shiver as you navigate the world. It's magical realism in the American South, and each chapter is better than the last.The team at Cardboard Computer has really done their homework.

Some wonderful moments as you move along, but the interface is incredibly clunky, and some locations, such as the museum, are poorly laid out.

												Woah, Kentucky Route Zero. I started playing it just to get a feel of what it was like and actually couldn't stop until there was nothing left at the end of Act III. The story has a ""familiar, but strange"", kind-of-creepy-and-mysterious atmosphere to it - like the ""this makes sense, of course it should be like this"" logic of dreaming that actually makes less sense over time but gets more intriging; like a nostalgic mystery from your childhood you can't recall nor explain with words completely, and that warm but murky feeling still lingers. I'm a sucker for the character-driven kind of narrative, and this game does it in a brilliant way. The dialogs are amazingly well written, it has a lot of great references, the soundtrack is beautiful and it's visually stunning at every little detail. The gameplay is like a homage to those old point-and-click adventures we hold dear in our hearts, but with a nice, refreshing twist. Also features bears on the third floor.Jaw-dropping. It hits me in all the right places.I couldn't recommend KRZ enough, and I'm waiting restlessly for the next acts.			"

												This game is probably not for everyone, but it's perfect for a guy like myself. Despite a few minor bugs (nothing game-breaking) I'm loving it. As I write this I have finished all but Act 4. It has a dream-like quality that I can appreciate, and some interesting psychological as well as technological points to make. Fans of movies by the likes of David Lynch and some of David Cronenberg's will feel at home playing this game...also makes me think of writer Philip K D*ck. I went in pretty blind so won't say much else to that end. There is a quite a bit of dialogue which - while interesting and well-written - does not seem to affect the outcome much. Even so, I appreciate the writing more than in most games that are dialogue-heavy. The characters are well written and interesting, and the dialogue feels true to them. It's definitely worth picking up on a sale if you are into atmospheric games with some pretty unique themes.I definitely hope to see more games like this in the future. I believe it will be a game I will play through again at some point, the same way I periodically rewatch Twin Peaks every so often.The only bug I really encountered relates to saving the game. While in the Forest I saved the game and exited before I got to the doctor. Later when I loaded the game back up, the triggers to progress had disappeared. I ended up having to restart the entire Act, which was a bit frustrating because it was at the very end and I could not restart just at that scene, but had to go all the way back through all the scenes. I didn't mind terribly going back through and choosing the other dialogue options along the way, though the outcome is the same regardless. I can see this frustrating some folks more than myself.

												Above all, Kentucky Route Zero is driven by the atmosphere and tone. This has to hook you in order for you to find the game, especially the first two episodes, compelling. The overall experience is dreamlike. There's some obvious Twin Peaks influence. And it can be beautiful, in a lonely sort of way. I find it nice to play at night with the lights turned off.The way the narrative unfolds is completely unique in my experience. It takes fascinating advantage of possibilities that are only available to an interactive, participatory mode. You seem to have more control over what happened in the past than what will happen in the future. ""Seem,"" because nothing in this game should be taken at face value. Or maybe all of it should.

												This game  is the reason I joined Steam. I initially started playing it a friends house and decided I needed to throw money at these developers. It's one of the most unique game worlds I've ever experienced: A lost boy has an eagle as a brother, android synthpop robots following their dream, beautiful structures are both inside and out (You'll be blown away by this), and sports one of the coolest soundtracks : a fusion of ambient synth/noise and bluegrass. The camera work and the way in which the universe is presented is incredible - it's both cinematic and brings life to what is 'simply' a point and click game. This game demands the patience of a ultra descriptive classical novel, though you'll be immediately entranced. Do yourself a favor: Lock yourself in a room where you won't be bothered by husbands, wives, significant others, dogs, children, brothers, and warlocks. Give this game a whirl.

Picked this one up straight from the source over a year ago (which is why my hours played via steam is non-existent) and each episode of this surreal noir gets weirder and better. Not so much a game but rather a ""explore and discover until the creepy end"" product. Non-David Lynch fans need not apply, for it'll just bug and bore and irritate you. For fans of text adventures, lucid dreams, and mellow existential panic trips only. And a bonus for those living in Kentucky, because a lot of KR0 hits pretty close to home in terms of countryside strangeness (in a good way). Cheers.			"

												""It's like dropping acid, but without actually having to take any...""Joking aside - this game, well I guess  we probably should not call it that, if anything I would see this more as a very atmospheric walking narrative - with an almost ""Twilight Zone"", ""Tales from the Darkside"" feel to it. Is it any good? Well from the big blue thumb on my review you would almost venture to guess, it is. But the answer to that is really up to the observer - if you are the type of gamer into fast paced action type games, this title will only disappoint you.  However if you are into the art, atmosphere, soundtrack and writing style of a particular piece then this will certainly be up your alley. I see a few negative comments that complain about act 4 and 5, personally the fact that they are not here yet does not take away from the title. This game is about a strange journey, and taking it has been a pleasure so far. Personally I cannot wait to see where the story goes.			"

												kentucky route zero is an absolutely gorgeous game with a compelling story and interesting characters who you can shape in minute ways as the story progresses. i'd go so far as to call it a masterpiece - the storytelling is wonderful and the writing invokes the exact emotions it needs you to, or, occasionally, that you want it to.i absolutely recommend this game, especially if you like exploring. maybe not if you don't like reading, because there is A LOT of reading. seriously. so much.

												The best prose you will read in a video game, bar none.Kentucky Route Zero is meticulously constructed. Its writing is sparse but meaningful, its scenes transition with the awareness of a good film, its art and use of lighting is striking, its soundscape is dense, and its choices toy with ideas of player agency without assaulting you with half-baked moral dillemas.Above all, the story is at times mystery and morbid and heartwarming, and it works.The game is good, basically. It is a structured, crafted, linear experience, and it's pointless if you don't want to read, but it's stunning at being what it is.			"

												There's a lot of talk about the ""Citizen Kane of videogames"", but I'm pretty sure Kentucky Route Zero is the Waiting for Godot of videogames. You should probably play it.I don't know how else to describe it in a way that makes sense short of writing an entire essay. Even then, I'm not sure it makes sense, except in a kind of dream-logic way. You should probably play it.What is it about? Antiques, driving, a dog wearing a straw hat, old electronics, music, art, debt, regret, being specific, text adventures, and probably purgatory. (I told you it wouldn't make much sense if I explained it.) You should probably play it.			"

												Let's sweep away the indie circlejerk and pretentious flowery language: this is not a game.Stay with me here, there's more to this.What we have is a product of an age where video games have become mainstream. Developers that tell a story, or show off cool graphics, or innovate with polished, unique, and engaging gameplay can all live happily together, because in the year of our Lord 1984 + 31 there is an audience for any and all three. And if you hit all the points, you'll have a mastery of the medium, a true classic for its time, worthy of every 10/10 ""it didn't offend me"" it can get.What you'll find is that not all can be skillful when it comes to ""gameplay"", or else discard the concept from the start. What is a game without gameplay? It's not a game.Kentucky Route Zero is what you might call an ""interactive storytelling experience"" because there is just one (absolutely gorgeous) path without a single challenge or losing condition from start to finish. They say you only use 10% of your brain (and they are WRONG) but you'll only be using the parts that extrapolate out into infinity because the story is abstract and convoluted as ♥♥♥♥. Like they played Metroid Prime and ripped off its method wholesale, but decided it just wasn't cryptic enough. I liked Metroid Prime, mind you, but this comes back to the point I'm blabbing about for my share of internet points: it is not a game.A game involves the player in a challenge, a puzzle, something that puts bearing on the flashing lights presented before them. I have a whole bookshelf for the opposite, and if I wanted the sweet visuals and soundtrack too, there's always LSD and a Boards of Canada album. I played each act over a few weekends with the lights off and headphones on, just getting absorbed in the storytelling without having to break federal law. It demands some days of padding, because it's not a game you would want to kill in a day. There is probably less than 10 hours of runtime (as of this writing) to KRZ, and that's a generous estimate - the replay value is virtually nil, but maybe that's the point. It's firmly an ""experience"" but clicking back and forth to read more dialogue is not ""interactive"". It is a movie that pauses itself every time something cool happens.Let's wrap it all up here: I like KRZ and for $5, it was worth the dosh. It really is stunning once you adjust your expectations, but I know that not all of us are ready to do that when the word ""game"" is at the top of the page and ""$24.99"" somewhere below. Spend your disposable income on it, but know that what you're getting in return is disposable as well.			"

The Story got me really intrested at first but there were a lot of parts that felt really boring to me. I have played all 3 currently available acts because, like I said, I really wanted to like the game. So at the end of act 3 I started to give up and just forced myself to play through it. The Story just didn't get to me.I will play the other acts because I want to give the game another chance, but for now I cannot recommend this game.I suggest watching some videos before purchasing, you don't really need to worry about spoilers. If you can get into the story I'm sure you can enjoy it and it also has amazing artstyle and locations.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is an atmospheric masterpiece that draws its narrative mechanisms from the very genesis of computer gaming; a text adventure brought to life amid evocative sets and soundscapes. It's fair to say that it resembles modern adventure games appreciably less than it does earlier forms of interactive fiction—it lacks a robust puzzle-solving element, centralizing rather on exploration and immersion in the melancholic familiarity of its setting. It's true that if you're planning on spending $25 on the season pass (which includes all five acts), you should know what you're buying: this is not an action-packed game, and to play it does not require skill or even a discerning eye for puzzles. Rather, it's a piece of literature—one that weaves magic into the edges of the American South and holds your interest, as a novel would, through a story that narrates the sweet spot between realism and ambiguity, turning the space so often occupied by feeling and memory alone into a navigable experience. From a literary perspective, KRZ is extraordinary and unique, a must-have for those who enjoy gaming as a storytelling art.			"

												It's difficult to articulate why I like this game, if you can even call it a game in the traditional sense.  It's more like a graphic novel that allows you to choose the dialogue, or a text adventure with moving pictures. I've read it described as a ghost story, where there is always a vague sense of forboding and mystery.  Whatever it is, it's very unique and original.  It focuses heavily on cinematography, character development, and a soundtrack that matches the minimilast aestetics of the environment and character profiles. The story follows a growing variety of characters who find themselves dealing with difficult situations.  As one of the creator's said, its not a game about people who are in power, but people who have been disempowered by circumstances.  You start out as a tired, old truck driver looking for directions to the mysterious highway called the Zero.  However, the game's narrative doesn't take place through the eyes of just one character.  The controls seamlessly switch from one player to another. The game's characters stay true to the story the creators are telling.  Instead of having absolute control of where your characters go and what they do, you simply choose what they're thinking about while they're doing it.  You begin to surrender to the storytellers, and just accept the bizarre environments and directions they take you in.  Additionally, the conversations feel more natural than compared to other games.  That although you have the option to select the dialogue, it always progresses the conversation forward, as opposed to the hub and spoke dialogue options you typically see in RPG's, where once you've depleted a path of dialogue it returns to the root phrase or sentence.I skimmed through a review on The Guardian (http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/04/-sp-kentucky-route-zero-review-best-game-of-2014) that describes the game pretty well.  ""This game induces a mood that is rare and hard to describe: a feeling of unhurried and joyful uncertainty, of being in the hands of master storytellers and surrendering to whatever they might have to offer.""Unfortunately, the pace of the development matches the pace of the game. Although you receive access to all episodes when they are released for the retail price of $24.99, it's hard to justify that price for what is currently available.  I bought it on sale for $12.49 and I'm totally cool with that.  It took me almost 5 hours to complete I-III, and played together they can still give you the feel of a full game.  If V ever comes out it will just be a nice bonus.			"

												I think this might be the best written game out there. The illustration, animation, and sound are also all beautiful, rich, and specific: just watching the character Conway walk lets me feel like I know how he feels; some of my favorite moments here just involved choosing to wait in a particularly beautiful environment while a song plays out.  Every setting carries a rich sense of place, that is simultaneously surreal and rooted in specific American landscapes. What this game put forwards is the idea that a player can choose how the characters experience and react to events, rather than affecting the outcome - and oddly that this can lead me to feel even more stake in the characters stories than I do in games where I make many plot-significant decisions. Though note, it's closer to interractive fiction / animation than game, and the plot itself is mostly linear. Whatever you want to call it, it's one of my favorite adventure games, works of magic realism, or just examples of storytelling in any medium			"

												Artistically elegant, poignant and emotional, this adventure about the search for an enigmatic highway cleverly draws you in by never giving away too much of the story. The absence of any traditional gameplay objectives actually adds mystery and strengthens your personal investment in your character and in the stories of the people you meet. You are welcome to set your own goals if that seems apt, but nothing has to be done, other than finding the way.Although the game isn't yet fully complete, this promises to be the most original adventure in years.A tip for people who already own the game: Check out the Cardboard Computer website. The developers are releasing minigames in between the chapters. They are side stories up to the same standard as the main game, although with quite different styles.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero aspires to be, if nothing else, esoteric. The plot follows an aging truck driver moving to deliver a package to an elusive street named Dogwood Drive; a journey peppered with unlikely travelling companions and quizzically absurd happenings - presented with qualities akin to that of a bizarre dream that you only begin to question upon waking up.Kentucky Route Zero is certainly not for everyone. It is slow, wordy and deliberate - sharing more in common with art-house cinema than a typical video game. Those coming in search of thrills will likely do well to look elsewhere; but those looking for a romp that is mysterious, understated and charmingly quaint could do worse than taking a ride on the Zero.Side note: At time of writing, this game is incomplete - the final act is currently in production and will be released in an update for free.

												I can't in good conscience /not/ recommend this program, but I definitely want to echo the other reviewers who have pointed out that it is barely a game.  The designers have clearly put a lot of love into this setting and story.  It is an interesting read; sort of a mix of Steinbeck, Douglas Adams, and maybe a little William Gibson.  It feels like Oh Brother Where Art Thou meets Lost.  The graphics and music are gorgeous, if not exactly cutting edge, and all in all the experience is enjoyable, if a little slow.Unfortunately, Kentucky Route Zero's interactivity is minimal at best.  The player is badgered for input at every turn but it is all conversational and does not seem to affect the order or occurrence of events.  I'm reminded of Roger Ebert's assertion that video games are not art because they change based on the player's actions.  I think that if Ebert played Kentucky Route Zero he might consider it art.That said, it does seem like multiple playthroughs involving different choices might allow the player to learn more and different things about the mysterious characters, but I do not find the story so exciting or the characters so intriguing that I am chomping at the bit to engage the plodding point-and-click interface for a repeat performance.  For what it is worth, I am also not the sort of person who reads books more than once.What disappointed me the most is the wasted potential the concept had for exploration -- although the early part of the game takes place in a more or less open map of central southern Kentucky around Route 65, the eponymous underground highway, Route 0,  is literally a single beltway that the characters navigate only by making u-turns at landmarks.  These landmarks are not themselves destinations, but rather visual cues with the single purpose of telling the player where to turn around.  The visual cues are unusual and thought-provoking, but I found myself wishing they were all more like ""The Maw,"" with jagged stalactites and stalagmites reaching out of the darkness to appear to consume Conway's truck, and less like ""The Television,"" which was just a... well, a giant television.  Floating in space.   I definitely enjoyed Kentucky Route Zero, and I look forward to the release of the final two acts.  It just wasn't the game I thought it would be, and the disconnect was sharp enough that I want to pass on the warning.  I find caves fascinating; I really feel like the designers could have done more to make the spelunking aspect of the Zero more compelling.  Instead, Route 0 is just a contemporary Kentuckian faerie land with a convenient and tangential link to the region's limestone karst geography.In conclusion, I'm not saying don't buy this program.  Just know what you're buying before you buy it.  It is an interesting, well written story with a well plotted but linear arc.  While not as blatantly click-through as some visual novels I have ""played,"" it is no adventure game.  There is no thrill of achievement here, no risk of failure, and the sense of discovery is the same you would receive from a good novel.  The tale progresses at its pace; do not look to direct it rather than be led through it.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero's trip into the underbelly of the American countryside is really something. It's creating an overwhelming feeling of melancholy fueled by the consequences of capitalism, regrets, the loneliness of the road, getting old, a brilliant bluegrass/sythie-soundtrack and a million other things.With the exxeption of the games by ""The Chinese Room"", Kentucky Route Zero is also probably the only game I've ever played that is actually deeply concerned about the quality of its prose and dialogue. The words and sentences flow majestically and are worthy of the games' rolemodels:Kentucky Route Zero is as close to ""Lost Highway"" as it is to ""100 Years of Solitude"". It's as much ""No Country for Old Man"" as it is a ghost story. In the end, despite all  the references, it is a very unique work of art that you should play if you have any interest in games as an art form exploring the human condition.There's also a bureau full of bears sitting around peacefully, in case you needed any more convincing.

This game takes you on a journey where you decide what and who the characters are, and then you get to decide what they experience. In the end you become all of them. You will be lost in the visuals, you will be entranced by the music and you will be seduced by the charm and wit and style.In the end the only reason to buy this game is if you love to be entertained. Which is a bit conceited and presumptuous. In reality however the reason to not buy the game follow if you prefer quicker games, if you prefer less choice, if you prefer games that do not fall into the adventure game category.And even at that point I'd still recommend the game as it is so far and especially when it's fully released.I pirated this game when there was only one act.

												It's pretty mystical, I'll give it that, and I am enjoying playing it, but it's also hard to keep up with the story. I feel like there's a lot symbolism I'm missing or hasn't been made clear. There's themes of purgatory or moving on or death, but three episodes in, it's still not 100% clear. What's the Zero? Who are the characters? What's going on? This confusion is broken occasionally by wonderful gems like Too Late To Love You Now, but it feels like those are the exceptions, not the rule. The developers have also been way too slow to deliver new episodes. They are now at least three months late, and I don't see a clear post explaining why. Probably worth it 75% off but not otherwise. Even then, it's a huge time sink for a few good moments.			"

												Some reviewers are saying to wait for all five Acts before purchasing this game. I bought the game on GOG, rebought the game on Steam, have shown the game to students, colleagues, friends, family. If you are interested in narrative driven games (Elegy for a Dead World, Gone Home, Dear Esther, Life is Strange), then this is the narrative game equivalent of a Flannery O'Connor novel (but more lighthearted). The writing is superb, the interface is simple and elegant.Would spend money to wait years for the full game again.10/10			"

No story, no gameplay, nothing even remotely interesting goes on in this game.Some scenes from Act I (and Act II) took 8 seconds to complete - just click on the correct object. Seriously, WTF?!If you want something interesting in the point and click category, try Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" or ""Wolf Among Us"". Both are lots of fun and quite interesting.			"

												Some have lauded this game as some kind of esquisite work of indie gaming art but the actual gameplay experience leaves much to be desired. There is no clear direction where you are supposed to go or do making it feel like a waste of time and an utterly pointless experience. The game feels random and disjointed. I made it up to act 3 and am suprised I stayed with it that far given how unentertaining it is. I really wanted to like this game based on the hype that surrounded it, but sadly it was just that hype and little substance. The game is just plain boring and I think the writers have simply lost track of what kind of experience they were trying to deliver.  I feel no more motivation to continue playing and have deleted it off my PC.			"

												If you haven't bought it; don't buy it. As it is unlikely to ever be completed. The price point of an Early Access game should also reflect the risk that the game will not be completed; as you have effectively waived basic consumer protection laws despite Steam's updated emphasis that Early Access is not intended for crowdfunding prototypes. The developers have most likely found their indie game to be unprofitable and have discontinued development. In any case, there are games that better reflect the strengths instead of the weaknesses of the Early Access model. If you haven't been entirely put off the model like I have thanks to games like Kentucky Route Zero.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a wonderful point and click adventure game. I loved playing through all three of the currently available acts and I can say I haven't been disappointed by any of them. The game in general gives off a relaxing tone, though it all depends on the player's view of the game. Being born and raised in Kentucky, I can say that it's nice to see some familiar features from my home state in a game. Despite being mostly serious, Kentucky Route Zero has its share of strange and crazy moments. I highly recommend this game, not only to those who are from Kentucky, but for anyone who enjoys an excellent story and amazing atmosphere.			"

I hate the term ‘video games’. It conjures up images of pimple-faced nerds with bad haircuts sitting around an Atari 2600 with a two button joystick hacking away at Pong on a precious Friday night. Yeah, sure, that can be fun – but the medium has evolved dramatically from its fairly simplistic roots to what I would consider one of the highest forms of art. ‘Video games’ is an overly simplistic and even fairly derogatory term for something so complex and creative and beautiful that they have literally captivated the entire world. Many of us don’t simply play to ‘beat’ the computer or chase a high score, but to admire and be enveloped in some beautiful experience that has been created and put forth for us. In its rarest and most coveted form, it is candy for my brain; something I crave and cannot get enough of.Now back to the notion of art.Art has layers of complexity, of course. For example a singer/songwriter wears two hats. They are both a poet and a singer. This is inherently more complex that just being a poet, with all else being equal. Creating a modern gaming experience that is exceptional really takes a delicate balance of it all – variables such as great music, artwork, technical and efficient programming skill, and of course a killer mechanic and conceptual design. You need the whole shebang in many cases. And perhaps the most important thing, in-fact the thing I value the most, is that there is little relationship between big budget titles and artistic success. I find most AAA titles to be quite sterile. The notion that a dude can brew up some small-scale indie game in his basement that goes on to take the world by storm, is amazing, and truly is one of the most important aspects that makes ‘video games’ art. I don’t think I even need to list examples to get agreement on that point. In fact, it is arguable that some of the most risky and artistic gaming experiences could only be birthed from a single person or small team who had nothing to lose and everything to gain from putting their wonky, albeit sometimes brilliant, visions out there.IntoxicatingWith all those grimy pixelsKeeps me coming backAt the end of the day, the gaming experience is built by simply arranging zeros and ones in specific orders. Of course it works quite differently in reality, but that’s essentially it when stripped to its core. I’m not sure at which point video games made the jump from simply technical possibility to pure entertainment to something verging on art, but it certainly did happen. Games that really make you feel something, instead of just throwing an obstacle in your way such as finding a key to open the door. All I know is that one things most successful indie games have in common that many AAA title do not is pure where-it-on-your-shoulder heart and soul. Yeah it’s weird, but it’s got character. And it sits you down and makes you smile and you are swept away and caught up. You had no choice. Well, here’s to the indie titles with rough edges bubbled up from nothing but pure brilliant ideas that sent us forever into that love affair with modern gaming, never to return. My hats off to all the weird abstract shoestring-budget titles that dared to challenge gaming paradigms. And sure, there are casualties. Some titles fall from misinterpretation or even being too abstract. Perhaps missing the mark. Others fall for lack of funding, and overall lack of support. But perhaps in a sense they pave the way. They may be delicately priming our minds for something better; for the future. So, my hat’s off to the fallen, as well. "

												UPDATED REVIEW due to many recent negative reviews:Waiting is never a good thing, and rarely with games does it make the heart grow fonder.Part 4 of this game is looming. It's loomed for a year. Thats so much loom I could have remade LucaArts LooM for Mobile Devices using a loom!!!However, I don't actually mind. I've just ploughed 200hrs into The Witcher 3 and now will have to wait for CyberPunk 2077 for my next fix of CDPR gaming, but waiting is fine, as I also believe that what I'm waiting for is going to be exceptional.Kentucky Route Zero is exceptional. And worth the wait. Review this game on it's content, not it's delays. The people who make it aren't wasting time, but making it perfect. Each part released is a complete product delivered with care.Waiting for something unique to unfold is part of the fun sometimes.You just have to relax enjoy the ride.ORIGINAL REVIEW:An excellent game. It's taken me three playthroughs of act I & II to see and read all the extra scenes. They are worth seeking out.With such superb lines as 'This crab is wearing four other crabs as it's shell.' you can't go wrong. Make sure you download the smaller free scenes that compliment KRZero. You can get them from the main website.I've yet to play part three, just DL'd it, and can still heartily reccomend this masterpiece of storytelling. Get your pens and papers ready to put this one together, make notes and avoid the WIKI pages if you can. Working it out yourself is definately recommended.The Sponge scores it 5/5!EDIT Part 3 is exceptional!			"

												Do you know that feeling? That special, rare feeling? It's a feeling that watching Breaking Bad gave me. That feeling that what you're watching (or in this case, playing) is something that you're not going to see anything like for a very long time once it's over. That it's cut from a very rare, valuable cloth and stitched together with the utmost care. Kentucky Route Zero gives me that feeling.The more I see of Kentucky Route Zero the more in awe I am of the developers, Cardboard Computer. That this game was made by an impossibly small team of only 3 people blows my mind, but makes so much sense the more I think about it. The world of KR0 couldn't possibly be made by a large team, all throwing in more and more ideas, diluting the original vision. This game feels personal and intimate, but it's slow to reveal it's secrets.Act 1 will see you through a mostly grounded-in-reality Kentucky backdrop, looking for an address to make one final delivery. Everything feels frozen in time, like it's caught both in the past and some weird version of the present at the same time. People you swear you just talked to will vanish out of sight when you look away for a second. Walls melt away as the lead character, Conway, lets his thoughts drift toward the Zero, a mythical road supposedly where your final delivery is to be made. Your sense of reality will all but fade by the time Act 2 closes, and seem like a distant memory once Act 3 is done with you.Kentucky Route Zero is determined to drip with atmoshpere and mood each and every second you play it, and succeeds in spades. Music is very sparse and is usually a low humming ambiance. What little noise there is is generally droning static of caves, engines, and wind. Each act features a song by composer Ben Babbit, however, and all 3 are just beautiful. There's going to be a lot of talk of both the ""Long Journey Home"" and ""Too Late To Love You"" scenes.The game is played entirely with the mouse, and is almost boringly simplistic in it's interactions. Pointing and clicking is literally all you will ever do, and I like it that way. There are no puzzles to impede progress, no quick time events. There aren't even any branching story choices, which again is something I like. You are given many many dialog choices, but they serve more as a way for you to choose which snapshots you want of each character and environment rather than a big story choice. Picking dialog in KR0 feels more like stitching together a screenplay or a poem. Kentucky Route Zero is doing so much that I've never seen before in a video game, and it feels like the game is smarter than me. It's so dense and detailed, and 3 acts in it feels like we're just now getting a peek at the larger picture. Part of me hopes that once this sleepy, sad, hopeful journey is over that we won't have all the answers. That there will always be some mystery to the Zero. Considering what Cardboard Computer has delivered thus far, I think I an trust them to do just that.			"

												This is like the video game version of a David Lynch film. The basic starting point is that you are trying to make a delivery for an antique store. Since this is episodic and only the first three acts are available I am going to assume that at some point you might actually get to make this delivery. Whether that is important or not is unknown. However, the journey is bizarre and filled with all kinds of oddball characters and settings, both above-ground and in the mysterious underground ""Route Zero"". It is a point-and-click adventure (but with no inventory), with interspersed instances of old text adventures and RPG style dialogue options (though having only played through once, I don't know if the different choices have any significant impact on the story). The art style is fantastic and reminiscent of Another World.I had a lot of fun with the first three acts and can't wait for the remaining two.			"

												At this point only three of five parts have been released.Not so much a ""game"" as an interactive story. There aren't defined ""puzzles"" and gameplay is limited to interacting with certain things in the environment, but it's still a fascinating experience.In this game, you play Conway - an aging delivery driver for a failing antique store. When out making a delivery, you stop to ask for directions where an unusual man directs you to ""the zero"". The world is very well built, with the entire design being beautiful - soundtrack, visuals, writing... everything. Characters are compelling, well developed, and just as odd as their surroundings. Everything is pretty abstract but there are stunning moments of beauty. I've sat at a still screen for minutes at a time just soaking in the atmosphere. It helps that there's somewhat of a ""less is more"" idea at work - the narrative isn't thrust upon you, but builds from your experiences.But that works to its advantage. A lot of what you get from the game isn't a result of the choices you make, but the choices you make don't railroad you down a certain path. Different bits of story will open based on your choices, but they're more a reflection of how you intend to play the game than how the developer intended you to play the game.Definitely pick it up. It's a storytelling experience I'm very happy with thus far.			"

												More a point and click driven story than a game --there are no wrong things to do, no loss conditions-- Kentucky Route Zero's lonely roads are peppered with eerie, sometimes surreal encounters and poetic scenes.The minimalist graphics are an asset, not just a throwback to 'retro' design though the fluidity of animation and sharp lines are reminiscent of Out of This World, at once sharply defined and dreamlike, like the way the game itself weaves in and out of the realm of the possible.The first episode will take a couple of hours at most to complete. I'm glad it wasn't longer, because I was exhausted by the end.Note: The second episode was released around May, and while there's been a related little thing released recently, there's no sign of the third part. As much as I have enjoyed it so far, I think this is going to be the last 'episodic' game I buy before the whole thing has been released.			"

												This game is wild. It seems a little pricey for a game that the reviews don't really explain what it's about, but i took the plunge anyway, and now i sit, writing a recommendation for a game that i can't really explain what it's about. You walk around, you talk to people. You drive about aimlessly. Bizarre things happen. Beautiful things happen. It's a bit melancholic, it's a bit funny, you never quite figure out what is going on, but it doesn't matter. It's a perfect slice of Americana. I've never played anything like it, and it really is pretty amazing. If you dig dialog-driven adventures and are happy to wander, you're in for a real treat.			"

												I really don't have the words to express how much I love this game, on so many different levels. For one, I'm a sucker for beautiful visuals and ambience, which is exactly what this game delivers. It is, on the surface, a simple point-and-click adventure in which you navigate from one set piece to another. But that is where the writing of the game comes in, and why I fell head-over-heels for this game. As with so many popular titles these days, the story leans more towards ambiguity and 'draw your own conclusion' than straightforward storytelling; the game manages to create a visually-captivating world that is similar yet very different from our own, but I never felt like I was simply going from one batch of symbolism to the next. I didn't always quite understand all the events in the game, but before long I was immersed in the world and deeply attached to these characters, of whom I felt we knew so much with only a few words.That brings me to another awesome point to the game which, for personal reasons, is so important to me. One of the two main characters of the game, whom you alternate in controlling, is a hispanic woman. I know that seems like a silly detail, but think about it: what other game character, much less protagonist, can you name that fits that description? Yet the game never felt heavy-handed or like it was trying to shove things in your face, going ""See? See? Isn't this thing we did here awesome? Aren't we awesome for doing it?"" All of the things it does right (of which there are many) are subtle details, inter-woven into the story in a way that just serves to enhance the entire experience.Plus, you get to make choices. Not big, world-changing moral choices, ala Fable series. More along the line of what Telltale Games have been doing: little choices in action and dialogue, things that truly make you feel as if you're in control of the character. If you consider yourself someone who enjoys narratives, want a unique and interesting experience, or are just looking to pass the time with something engaging, then I highly recommend this game. Hell, I recommend it even if you don't fall into any of those categories! Missing this game is just doing a disservice to yourself.			"

												A friend of mine (seven5three) reviewd this game and called it a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" type of game. I really think that is best way to describe this game, The story is very player driven. You can do pretty much anything you want defnined by the choices in the game. Very fun and a neat game. I have not yet completed both Act I and Act II but I very much like the game so far and recommend it to any one looking for a game in the spirit of choose your own adventure.			"

												More a point and click driven story than a game --there are no wrong things to do, no loss conditions-- Kentucky Route Zero's lonely roads are peppered with eerie, sometimes surreal encounters and poetic scenes.The minimalist graphics are an asset, not just a throwback to 'retro' design though the fluidity of animation and sharp lines are reminiscent of Out of This World, at once sharply defined and dreamlike, like the way the game itself weaves in and out of the realm of the possible.The first episode will take a couple of hours at most to complete. I'm glad it wasn't longer, because I was exhausted by the end.Note: The second episode was released around May, and while there's been a related little thing released recently, there's no sign of the third part. As much as I have enjoyed it so far, I think this is going to be the last 'episodic' game I buy before the whole thing has been released.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a wonderful point and click adventure game. I loved playing through all three of the currently available acts and I can say I haven't been disappointed by any of them. The game in general gives off a relaxing tone, though it all depends on the player's view of the game. Being born and raised in Kentucky, I can say that it's nice to see some familiar features from my home state in a game. Despite being mostly serious, Kentucky Route Zero has its share of strange and crazy moments. I highly recommend this game, not only to those who are from Kentucky, but for anyone who enjoys an excellent story and amazing atmosphere.			"

												This is like the video game version of a David Lynch film. The basic starting point is that you are trying to make a delivery for an antique store. Since this is episodic and only the first three acts are available I am going to assume that at some point you might actually get to make this delivery. Whether that is important or not is unknown. However, the journey is bizarre and filled with all kinds of oddball characters and settings, both above-ground and in the mysterious underground ""Route Zero"". It is a point-and-click adventure (but with no inventory), with interspersed instances of old text adventures and RPG style dialogue options (though having only played through once, I don't know if the different choices have any significant impact on the story). The art style is fantastic and reminiscent of Another World.I had a lot of fun with the first three acts and can't wait for the remaining two.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW due to many recent negative reviews:Waiting is never a good thing, and rarely with games does it make the heart grow fonder.Part 4 of this game is looming. It's loomed for a year. Thats so much loom I could have remade LucaArts LooM for Mobile Devices using a loom!!!However, I don't actually mind. I've just ploughed 200hrs into The Witcher 3 and now will have to wait for CyberPunk 2077 for my next fix of CDPR gaming, but waiting is fine, as I also believe that what I'm waiting for is going to be exceptional.Kentucky Route Zero is exceptional. And worth the wait. Review this game on it's content, not it's delays. The people who make it aren't wasting time, but making it perfect. Each part released is a complete product delivered with care.Waiting for something unique to unfold is part of the fun sometimes.You just have to relax enjoy the ride.ORIGINAL REVIEW:An excellent game. It's taken me three playthroughs of act I & II to see and read all the extra scenes. They are worth seeking out.With such superb lines as 'This crab is wearing four other crabs as it's shell.' you can't go wrong. Make sure you download the smaller free scenes that compliment KRZero. You can get them from the main website.I've yet to play part three, just DL'd it, and can still heartily reccomend this masterpiece of storytelling. Get your pens and papers ready to put this one together, make notes and avoid the WIKI pages if you can. Working it out yourself is definately recommended.The Sponge scores it 5/5!EDIT Part 3 is exceptional!			"

												Do you know that feeling? That special, rare feeling? It's a feeling that watching Breaking Bad gave me. That feeling that what you're watching (or in this case, playing) is something that you're not going to see anything like for a very long time once it's over. That it's cut from a very rare, valuable cloth and stitched together with the utmost care. Kentucky Route Zero gives me that feeling.The more I see of Kentucky Route Zero the more in awe I am of the developers, Cardboard Computer. That this game was made by an impossibly small team of only 3 people blows my mind, but makes so much sense the more I think about it. The world of KR0 couldn't possibly be made by a large team, all throwing in more and more ideas, diluting the original vision. This game feels personal and intimate, but it's slow to reveal it's secrets.Act 1 will see you through a mostly grounded-in-reality Kentucky backdrop, looking for an address to make one final delivery. Everything feels frozen in time, like it's caught both in the past and some weird version of the present at the same time. People you swear you just talked to will vanish out of sight when you look away for a second. Walls melt away as the lead character, Conway, lets his thoughts drift toward the Zero, a mythical road supposedly where your final delivery is to be made. Your sense of reality will all but fade by the time Act 2 closes, and seem like a distant memory once Act 3 is done with you.Kentucky Route Zero is determined to drip with atmoshpere and mood each and every second you play it, and succeeds in spades. Music is very sparse and is usually a low humming ambiance. What little noise there is is generally droning static of caves, engines, and wind. Each act features a song by composer Ben Babbit, however, and all 3 are just beautiful. There's going to be a lot of talk of both the ""Long Journey Home"" and ""Too Late To Love You"" scenes.The game is played entirely with the mouse, and is almost boringly simplistic in it's interactions. Pointing and clicking is literally all you will ever do, and I like it that way. There are no puzzles to impede progress, no quick time events. There aren't even any branching story choices, which again is something I like. You are given many many dialog choices, but they serve more as a way for you to choose which snapshots you want of each character and environment rather than a big story choice. Picking dialog in KR0 feels more like stitching together a screenplay or a poem. Kentucky Route Zero is doing so much that I've never seen before in a video game, and it feels like the game is smarter than me. It's so dense and detailed, and 3 acts in it feels like we're just now getting a peek at the larger picture. Part of me hopes that once this sleepy, sad, hopeful journey is over that we won't have all the answers. That there will always be some mystery to the Zero. Considering what Cardboard Computer has delivered thus far, I think I an trust them to do just that.			"

												A beautifully crafted point-and-click adventure game that blends the supernatural, classic journey, and thoughtful dialogue options that leave you wondering what could have been.  It's so poetic and subtle that I couldn't help but feel that I was always missing something.  Fortunately the acts are short, so replaying it for more information and a better understanding isn't difficult.  Like a good film, you may have to go through it a few times to truly apreciate the nuances.  The clean, vector style art that reminds me of Another World blends nicely with the narrative.  The purposeful lack of detail allows you to think longer on the dialogue and read deeper into the symbols and messages rather than what is present in the graphics.  There are a lot of great cinematic scenes and use of sound that liason from the point-and-click experience into experimental, somewhat meditative intermissions.  Check out this game if you liked The Longest Journey, Gone Home, Dear Esther, or experimental games that push you to think and question what you are handed.  I greatly look forward to the rest of the episodes.			"

Check this game out, you will not be disappointed.  ""..I've lost all my money, but a two-dollar bill, I'm on my long journey home..""			"

												A haunting, beautiful episodic game (3 of 5 episodes which are available at present, kickstarted). The game starts off with a a lost deliveryman's request for directions to the highway; where it goes from there is anyone's guess. Conversations are branching though inexorable, and I found myself constructing a narrative for each character that evolved organically over time (e.g. role playing in an adventure game).The story and characters are perhaps this game's strongest suite, and the art style is both minimalist and highly expressive. On a personal note, it is simply unlike anything else I have played, and tends to evoke a powerful sensation of longing and cheerful melancholy that I've simply not expressed in any other media.Gameplay is limited (point and click), so if this is a major criteria for your enjoyment of a game Kentucky Route Zero may not be for you. However, If you enjoy a strong narrative, highly stylized art, and are looking for something a bit different,  I strongly recommend this game.			"

												What a surreal game---And not in a way that it beats you over the head with the bizarre... it draws heavily upon the atmosphere and interactivity of text adventure games, leaving a lot of the specifics of story and setting up to the interpretation of immagination.  Perfect for a solitary night of drinking.  Not that this is something I obsess over, but KR0 is a solid example of games as art---> not just that the components that make up the game are art (although they are), but the game entire and its tone / rhetoric seem like a modern-day version of the Renaissance / Dutch memento mori....

Games don't generally have as much of an emotional pull on us as these other things.This game is full of uncertain adventure.   The unknown is a risk and exploring that unknown can sometimes disturb you  But othertimes you'll be rewarded  with something so unexpected and beautiful that you were glad you were brave.  You will be glad you went out looking in the dark.This is unlike anything else I've played.  I'm so glad I did (and continue to).			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a strange game, and for many people - it most certainly won't strike the same chord that it does for some like myself.KRZ is a click and point adventure through a dreary and ever-increasingly strange landscape that holds an ethereal mood in its depths.It does not revolutionise gaming, nor does it jump out at you and grab your attention.No, Kentucky Route Zero is different. It's different in a manner that continues to mystify you as you delve through its beautiful, lonely aesthetics; carrying on your simple journey through a night that perpetuates your solitude.KRZ is a story that won't appeal to the conventional gamer or even the typical indie game fan. It requires an emotional aptitude to appreciate the environment that Cardboard Computer have brilliantly crafted. You won't find yourself loading up KRZ with an attitude of immediate adventure or conquest, for there is no regular high-riding emotion within the confines of Kentucky Route Zero's acts (currently waiting for Act IV). But, this is not needed. You find yourself immersed in the surroundings deeply, carrying the central character's journey truly as your own. The low mood of KRZ allows its emotive sections to soar effortlessly and truly touch you in a meaningful way that only builds into how brilliant the game is. All that exists within Kentucky Route Zero's ethereal confines solidifies its elegance in striking you with absurdity, loneliness, yearning and a great sense of understanding that very few games achieve, yet alone aim for.Kentucky Route Zero isn't necessarily something that everyone will appreciate. It is a game meant for the early hours of the morning: to explore a world of night, where there is no fear, but a strange longing for the unknown and to explore its mystery. To finish what you have to do and conclude, to reconcile with yourself somewhere upon a long journey home that is Kentucky Route Zero.			"

												Kentucky Route ZeroA Game In Five ActsBy Cardboard ComputerThe sun lays low on the distant horizon, emblazoning the once-blue sky in fiery oranges and pinks, casting long, rolling shadows across the Kentucky turf. An old truck winds down Interstate sixty-five almost across the Tennessee border, it's driver and his dog lost on a delivery job. The greying man forfeits pride and exits the highway, easing the diesel mobile into the darkened lot of Equus Oils, in search of his destination and a way to get there. He finds his only route - The Zero.Kentucky Route Zero is a magical-realist (I know, weird) point-and-click adventure game set along the mysterious, lost highway of KY 0, the caves it is paved in, and the river, Echo, it runs along.In the beginning, there's a horse-head. Conway walks onto the stage. He will be the player's first character to choose for, though other people will join him along the way. Conway is looking for a 5 Dogwood Drive, somewhere along I-65 near Bowling Green, Kentucky, near the Tennessee border. After a tip from a blind gas station attendant, Joseph, Conway is sent down the interstate to find a ""big, ugly tree that's always on fire.""From there, the story erupts into a strange bath of folk music, hoarse coughing, clinking bottles, static, robotic punk bikers, XANADU, regret, debt, mammoths, skeletons, bats, and horses. Lots of horses.Sound strange enough?OK, so here's a little less of a poetic, rambling view, and a more practical one, focusing on the gameplay, visuals, and sound.It's point-and-click, built in Unity, with a minimalist menu style and click-the-option progression in speech. The world is presented two-dimensionally, though it all exists in a three-D scape, which is revealed at times to create stunning sights or just to rip a mind apart.The graphics are minimalist. Nobody has a defined face. The characters are more defined by words than looks, though each is significantly different in posture, height, and attire. Conway is tall and grey, with a brown jacket, whereas Shannon is short and brown, with a bright-blue shirt. The other art, like backgrounds and similar, is painted in a very geometric, yet lively way. Screenshots can do more justice.The sound design is absolutely amazing, though I'm biased on the bluegrass music, as I grew up with old people from the Appalachian Tennessee. There's synthetic, ambient music in scenes to emphasize a feeling, and compliment the false-2D world, like in the trailer video. Small, consequential effects are implemented well, with car sounds while driving I-65 and soft tube-sound while browsing XANADU. The bluegrass is gorgeous, with the game developers contributing freshly-recorded songs from the 20th century at climactic times. Sad songs during a time of pain, asking songs during tense moments, melancholy with dread.Now, the elephant in the room(on the boat).KRZ is incomplete by July 2016. There are five acts, yet by now only four are released. Despite initial advertising with a 2013 release schedule, the game's individual acts have been delayed for personal reasons of the developers,' and quality concerns. However, rest assured that the final act is coming, even if at a slow pace. Cardboard Computer, developers, have other projects and works they participate in. To bide time, free minisodes are released on kentuckyroutezero.com between acts, so those are good to grab if playing or if you want a taste before you decide to buy.TL;DRWell, if you're into experimental, easy-paced but strangely thrilling folk wandering... things, buy Kentucky Route Zero. It's art work, and a fun game to explore and find the secrets. If you're patient and thoughtful, you might pull a meaning out. If not, you atleast could spot some references to real-life events, or appreciate the unique stage-like style to the game.I recommend Kentucky Route Zero, from the bottom of my heart. It means so much more to me than just a game.			"

												If you don't mind letting something take its time to tell a story, this could be one of the best things you'll ever play. It's a game that understands pacing, and uses it very well, but asks a lot more from the audience than the typical title. Because of this some people might dismiss it with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 'art-game' label, but what it is is a modern adventure game that understands every single aspect of its craft and utilises, breaks, dismisses, builds upon and honours them all on the way.There is not enough praise I can heap on this game, for fear of both babbling and ruining any personal experience someone might get. Everyone should play this.			"

												There's very few people to whom I'd recommend KRZ. It's not a game in the strictest sense and there is a heckton of reading. That's going to disqualify it for most right off the bat.But those few who stick around -- who aren't turned off by a lack of puzzles and objectives, and who are willing to take part in an interactive storytelling experience -- will be treated to a wonderfully bizarre, magical realist trek across a parnormal rural highway, complete with gorgeous vector graphics, haunting music, and a wonderfully evocative, melancholy world that time is leaving behind.If you're one of the few for whom KRZ is a good fit, you're going to find a lot to like.

												This is not a game, this is not a book, this is not a movie, i honestly don't know what this is but it is truly amazing. While the narrative isn't the most straight forward, the game doesn't hold it against the player but uses it as an opprotunity to help you get lost within the world. The Southern American setting mixed with the supernatural elements make this whole game feel like a familiar dream. The soundtrack falls somewhere in an ambient folk category with some beach house (the band) thrown in there for good measure and really is perfect for this game. Yeah the time it takes for a new act to come out can sometimes be rather long and annoying but when it released you can tell that time and thought was put into it. There is so much good about this game it is worth investing in. You will not regret buying this game.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a masterpiece. Atmospheric, intelligent, insightful, sublime, magical realist and thoroughly American, it is a beautiful and well-executed exploration of the possibilities for storytelling in a young medium. Some may accuse it of aimlessness, or a meandering, dense-and-yet-unexplained plot, but plot is both what this game is about and what it is not about. If you want clear-cut answers and no ambiguity, this game is not for you. If, however, you have an open mind and a romantic heart, you will experience a game like no other. No doubt it will stand as a classic in the canon of literature, film, theater, and yes, video games, that stick in your mind and refuse to leave.Highly recommended.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a surreal masterpiece. It is on par with (and a times even better than) surreal classic films of David Lynch and Luis Bunuel. Act I was quite difficult to like and Act II was not to different but likeable. However, Act III takes it to an amazing level. I can't wait for Acts IV and V. As a game it is not very exciting, but as an interactive animated narrative, it shines. Kudos also goes to the developers for making it run flawlessly on Linux from the day of launch. Highly recommended for those who are artistically inclined. People with low attention spans won't be able to see what the fuss is all about.			"

												I'm going to start by saying this game is not for everyone, but for those it is for, it is great.Kentucky Route Zero is a story-heavy point 'n' click game with minimum gameplay and maximum aesthetics. Rather than focus on puzzles, it focuses on exploration (of both environment and story), immersion and atmosphere, and uses these mechanics to create a brilliant game (I considered putting the word ""game"" in quotation marks, but no matter how you look at it it is still a game, that you play (and enjoy)).It has an interesting take on the typical 'choice' system. Generally the choices you make in a game shape your future, but the choices you make in Kentucky Route Zero shape and explain your past, this works seamlessly while still involving the player.I have seen a lot of complaints about the episodic release, but for some reason I wouldn't have it any other way with this game. The excitement I get from waiting for the next episode, any news filling me with joy, is all part of the experience. I almost feel like the game was designed for the player to have relatively long breaks between episodes, and the episodic release does allow them the opportunity to release neat little interludes (Which in and of themselves are pretty darn great (And free!)).I also feel the need to throw in something about the soundtrack, but I got nothing other than: It's great. Good job, Ben Babbitt and the Bed Quilt Ramblers.If you're still unsure, here are some other keywords that might convince you:DreamyMysteryStylisedUniqueSurrealVisually and sonically well-designed-Written at the time when 3 out of 5 Acts were released.

												I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting into when I bought this game - and truth be told I'm still not entirely sure what I'm in the middle of. Kentucky Route Zero is probably most accurately titled an ""interactive story"" where you have the ability to subtly shift tone and subtext, but calling it that doesn't really do this game justice. It's much more involved and captivating than other games slotted into that genera. Not only is it more captivating it's also more ambiguous. I can't really tell if I'm playing it or spectating - and as a gamer I think that's pretty remarkable.I'm not sure it will hit home with everyone as well as it has with me but if you boot up this game with an open mind I think you'll find a lot amazing things here.Also (no spoilers) this game contains one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever experienced in any form of entertainment.

												Kentucky Route Zero is an interesting game, one that doesn't require a whole lot of quick wits, but does require a lot of attention. The story of KR0 is surreal, interesting, and at times confusing, but in a somewhat good way. This game is not for the average person, it is much less a game than it is an interesting story filled with eye-candy. The graphic style is very interesting, never showing too much detail, and adding to the surreality of the story. I like Kentucky Route Zero, mainly because of its take on an interesting story without too much gameplay. I would recommend this game to people who liked Gone Home or Dear Esther, people that can look past a lack of gameplay for an interesting story.			"

												This recommendation comes with a lot of caveats. 1) If you don't care for the point-and-click adventure game genre, this is not a game for you. 2) If you are not a fan of surreal storytelling, this is not a game for you. If neither of those apply, Kentuck Route Zero is probably up your alley.The sound design and graphics are spare but expertly used. The game leans heavily on swathes of color and ambient sound to pull you in, and I feel like that works really well (as a side note, the soundtrack is included with the game, so that's a plus). The whole thing has a very dreamy quality to it, though as a lifelong resident of the southeastern US, I can't say as it bears much resemblance to real life Kentucky. But that's okay. The Kentucky of Kentucky Route Zero is a strange almost-character that feels very much alive as you guide Conway through it.I'm eagerly awaiting the next chapter.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is probably the most inventive game ive ever played. Charachters: rich, Story: Just enough, to let you fill in the gaps. Gameplay...There isnt much of that. Kentucky route zero is more of a walking-ish simulator, but with supernatural elements. Its incredibly difficult to put into words what this game is about, because theres no gameplay elements, just dots on a graph pointing to the final delivery on the zero.Lets see when episode 5 comes out, but right now its definiately worth the money. I can not tell you how long ive had my cursor on the buy button but when i finally dived in it was a fullfilling experience.			"

												This is a beautiful, surreal storytelling game.  I usually get annoyed when episodic games don't stick to a schedule, but in this case I don't really care how long it takes them to publish each chapter - this is not a thing that should be rushed.  Turn up the sound and play it at night.			"

												As of Episode 3, Kentucky Route Zero is one of the very best games of all the time. I know that sounds like utter hyperbole, especially when people call tripe like Bioshock Infinite the Citizen Kane of games unironically, but its not, KRZ is amazing to an almost baffling degree for a video game. KRZ is an adventure game focused on exploration and character development, the main crux of the gameplay is exploring the Kentucky backroads and the enigmatic Route Zero and having a hand in shaping the cast's personalites and pasts along their journey.A melacholic sense of loss and slow decline just permeates throughout the game.The graphics are minimalistic but beautiful and really adds to this lonely and mysterious atmopshere. The level design  and how its all framed is also great and it can get quite unique, showing the game world in different and interesting ways. The game's fantastic soundtrack also really adds to the atmosphere and  it is used to great effect making for some really memorable scenes. KRZ's writing puts every other video game to shame and it has a creativity and skill that most games lack. The characters are also quite likable and you want to see their journey through. Overall KRZ just sucks you right in and really feels like you're on an adventure into the unknown.Episodes have been slow going but its been totally worth it. Wait if you want to, but if you buy it now you will not be disappointed. KRZ is just a great example of what video games can do with storytelling and really needs more love.			"

												Okay, so after spending a long time putting this off, I finally dove into Kentucky Route Zero...  And I couldn't be happier that I did.  Ugh this game is just so good!  I would even argue that it's perfect.  It has everything I love, and if it's not my favorite game of all time it's pretty damn close.So here's the thing: I absolutely love my pretentious/artsy games.  Vanishing of Ethan Carter?  Hell yeah.  The Stanley Parable?  Obviously.  Limbo?  Grow Home?  Flower?  Journey?  Check, check, check, and check.  I think you get the picture.  I want games that give you this greater sense of depth, this feeling as if there is something big, something important behind what you're experiencing that you just can't quite grasp, and Kentucky Route Zero pulls that off perfectly.  Does this game's story make sense?  Not really, and yet in a way it still does.  As you get further into the game and more deeply immersed into the world, it all starts to feel as if while you don't have all the pieces necessary to solve the puzzle you're still not too far behind, and if you pay close enough attention you'll start to make some really interesting connections and have some really awesome moments of clarity.On top of that, Kentucky Route Zero has some of the best dialogue I've ever seen in a game.  There's no voice acting so you'd better get your reading glasses but believe me, it's worth it.  Not only is it insanely well written but what makes the dialogue in the game all the more incredible is how you can interact with it.  For instance, you can have perspective changes where suddenly you're participating in a conversation as a different person than you were before.  On top of this, you often get dialogue options that essentially give you multiple ways to respond that will actually shape the past.  For instance, you have a decision right at the start where a guy asks what your dog's name is.  The way you respond actually determines what the dog will be called for the rest of the game, and while that may not seem too significant, I still found it to be super cool.  Later on, there are some moments where these decisions do seem to be slightly more significant as well, I'm definitely not gonna spoil those though.  All of this excellent writing does wonders to build this incredibly beautiful, strange world of magical realism that I've quickly fallen in love with and found myself wanting more of.Of course, that brings me to an unfortunate point:  This game will be composed of 5 acts, of which only 3 are currently out.  I've looked at the history of their releases and it took about a year for Act 3 to come out.  It's been almost a year since then with no Act 4 in sight, but it seems very likely that it will come out soon based on that time frame.  The amount of love and work that went into Act 3 was so evident that I have nothing but the highest hopes for Act 4, there's no doubt in my mind that it will be absolutely mind blowing.  In the meantime, I'm probably gonna have to replay the first three acts once or twice because I just can't wait to dive back into this world and see what else I can find!Happy trucking on the Zero.

												As a big Twin Peaks fan, and a fan of most things the show has inspired, Kentucky Route Zero was on my radar for quite some time. I held off though because it was rumored to have been abandoned by the developers. Thankfully, that's not the case! There will be a total of 5 episodes and Episode 4 was just released this week. There was a long wait between Episodes 3 and 4, so long in fact that's why there are some recent negative reviews. With the advent of Episode 4, and the fact that it's currently 50% off, now is the perfect time to buy.As far as the game itself, it has quickly become my favorite Point & Click game of all time. There is a lot of reading involved, but since the dialog is so clever and fascinating, it goes down like reading an excellent novel. The graphics are minimalistic, but the art style is unique; it's as gorgeous as any other game in my catalog. The minimalistic approach lets the player use their imagination to fill in the gaps in an already mysterious world.Even when it's not on sale, the game is well worth every penny of the asking price. We can expect that Episode 5 won't take nearly as long to be released because the reasons for the prior delay are no longer factors. If you've been waiting for the perfect time to buy, DO IT NOW!

												It's not a bad game by any means...but it's not really a game.  The art is beautiful, and the story is interesting, but I can only recommend this game if you're looking to play a slow and highly detailed book.  I'm in the middle of ACT III, and with all that said, the game isn't really story/plot driven.  It's more of a meditation and character exploration.Again, it's not bad, but it's not the most captivating adventure and there's really little to no actual game play.			"

												Now, at the time I'm writing this review, the game is rather far away from completion, with a release rate of barely 1 per year, which has rightly earned them some criticism, because there is most definitely cause and reason to asking for the product you paid for. The format in which I am going to review this product will be with the individual episode, and then, when the final episode is released, a sum-up/TL;DR will be at the bottom.Episode 1The first episode sets an incredible standard for the rest of the series to follow, as it sets the stage of an incredibly visceral and surreal saga with awe-inspiring beauty, in even the most subtle of ways. It introduces the player to set characters, as well as the main system of the game, basically being able to write your own character's story and character development, leading to a huge amount of dialogue. Out of the three currently released, this one is most likely my favourite, as it's when the game is still slightly odd (Constantly burning trees, ghosts, .etc) without stepping into the territory of batshit insane.Episode 2The second episode allows for the backstory of the already presented characters to come to light, as well as what exactly The Zero is, its relevance to the surrounding characters, and its use. One of the greatest experiences in a game I've ever had the immense pleasure of enjoying was exploring the Zero, all of its nooks, crannies and locations.Episode 3The third episode introduces colourful and enjoyable characters into the game, as well as some of the most atmospheric computer segments in a game ever. This was most likely my least favourite of the episodes so far, but I still enjoyed it far more than other adventure games that came out this year (Life is Strange).(TL;DR before Episode 4: Would I reccommend this game in it's current state? Only if it was to somebody that greatly enjoyed a story intense and immersion based experience.) But in order to enjoy this game it's true atmospheric glory, I would suggest playing the game with someone in the room, in order to converse the significance of events in the game and characters. After grabbing that person, turn your lights off, close your blinds and explore The Zero.			"

												Beautiful and surreal, but vastly beneath its potential. Story presents you with ability to make choices, but most choices are irrelevant to gameplay and don't alter the story. Sometimes choices presented to you are false choices. If you haven't picked the right choice, you are more agressively steered toward picking the right one. There's no freedom in this game.Story overall was very interesting at first, but after 2 hours of play, lost its allure with tangents and prematurely terminated story lines.			"

												To put it bluntly, there's a scene in Act 2 in which the (already pretty slow-paced) game starts actively wasting the player's time, and then has the gall to mention it.Graphics are pretty; gameplay is mostly talking to characters who are either irritatingly vague or irritatingly obtuse; much less bluegrass than I was promised and much more terrible synth-pop.I don't think there will ever be any pay-off to tie it all together, and its atmosphere is diminished by the inevitability that none of it, neither the player's decisions, nor the developer's plot, will ever actually add up anything.  So yeah, buy if you thought Lost Highway was a deep and meaningful experience.			"

												I'm not sure how to feel about this one. It feels kind of like a slap in the face that they charged for all the episodes up front and advertised a reasonable release schedule only to scrap it from the store page. Act 3 was released 2 years ago. An update from November 2015 said 4 is on it's way, still not out more than half a year later. I've played 2 of the acts so far and would rather wait for them all to be out because each act by itself is painfully short, but I'm losing interest in the whole thing by now.Plus, I don't know if it's just me but I vastly preferred the first act to the second one. It's very atmospheric, dark and creepy yet at the same time tranquil and quiet. Even the text adventure stuff on a black screen was unsettling in a good way. The second seemed to drop this though and I just couldn't really get into the story anymore. Would still like to see where it goes next but in the game's current broken state, it's difficult to recommend.			"

												Can anyone including Steam provide some proof that this game chapters 4 and 5 are going to be release--ever?  As much as I enjoyed the game through Chapter 3 it has now been so long I'll have to play it all over again for some understanding.  But if understanding isn't really needed it would be very nice if (the missing chapters are ever released) one could just start off at chapter 4 without needing a previous saved game.Don't know what to think of the position many of us are in.  I'm going to see if Cardboard Computer even exists today.  Real sloppy development and I sure won't play anything else the devs are working on until I finish this one.  Can't recommend this interesting game to anyone, and how silly would it be to buy and play the game up to the end of chapter 3 only to wait with the rest of us?			"

												It's interesting, sure. I just can't recommend it because it's boring and I have no idea what's going on. It just feels a bit weird for the sake of weird. Everything is disconnected. It's slow. I played the first three chapters in something like 7 sessions because I couldn't get through 30 minutes of it without starting to feel my eyelids droop. ""Time for bed, I suppose"" I would say out loud (I live alone), and then I would realize it's only 9:30PM. I swear this happened at least 3 times. The writing is really good, actually. That's what's so dissapointing really. It's just really well written sentences and sentence fragments that don't tell you a whole lot, they just sound like a smart person wrote them. Lots of little vignettes that I haven't been able to put together.The sound is very well done too. I like the songs, I might actually purchase the soundtrack. The Zero itself was a huge let down. I get it, it's this mysterous highway and we're supposed to use our imagination on what it looks like. I wanted it to look like Homer Simpsons fever dream when he ate the insanity pepper. The visualization somehow broke my ability to use my imagination. I was just like, ""Why bother?"" I'll still play the next two chapters, because I put in enough effort to find out what the f this game is about. But I am prepared to be dissapointed.			"

												One of the weirdest and most beautiful games I've ever played. The graphics are minimalist in a way that I personally love, but they may not be for everybody.  Additionally, this is a point and click game, but most of the game revolves less around what you DO, but more like dialogue choices on how your character reacts to a particular situation.   Deeply affecting for me.  Additionally surreal, since I actually grew up in the area where the game takes place.  Makes me wonder what I might have missed down some of those country roads...			"

												A slow paced, fascinating adventure with some of the coolest audio-visual moments I've expereinced in a game. Currently, the game has about six hours of content, all of which embraces a minimilast, magical-realist aesthetic that fans of nice atmosphere should enjoy. I'll enjoy seeing where the story of Conway goes over the release of the next two acts, which, unfortunately, might very well occur over the next couple years. That being said, I feel like I'm experiencing the slow development of what might be one of my favorite games of all time when its over. If you're interested in narrative, downright brilliant uses of sound, or horses then you should pick this up.			"

The story, the characters, music and world are able to shine through much better.My only qualm wiht this game is that, while the episodic structure is great, with long, robust episodes, the episodes themselves take too long to release. The game tends to lose its steam after waiting months for the next episode. 9/10			"

												It doesn't take long to see that Kentucky Route Zero is far from your average point and click adventure game, rather than engage you with a linear series of puzzles and problems you have to solve, KRZ is more like a beautiful dream that draws you in with it's ethereal atmosphere, visuals and story. KRZ seems influenced by text adventures, every conversation gives you multiple responses, making each interaction with other characters feel unique. With each act this series gets better and better, it's full of surprises, it's like no other adventure game out there and in my opinion one of best in the genre of recent years.			"

												KRZ isn't your typical point & click adventure. it has almost no puzzles and the visuals/story is very abstract. although, saying there are no puzzles in the game is a bit rude, while gameplaywise there's no particular challenge, you'll have to crack the nut of what KRZ really is. it starts out rather simple in its world building but very soon you'll find yourself falling down a rabbit hole of a very different kind of wonderland.

												This beautiful interactive story is definitely a one-of-a-kind and something you have to experience yourself. The artstyle is beautiful and implemented with the greatest care, making great use of lighting and perspective. If you can at all find joy in a slow paced, writting heavy game, this should be a no brainer.Also absolutely great technical delivery!			"

												Never in my life have I played a more beautiful game. Kentucky Route Zero is a beautifully created game where the term ""every frame a painting"" truly applies. Every shot is visually interesting and creative, the dialouge is moving and literate, and the gameplay is simple yet enjoyable. Not only that, but it's great to listen to. The sound design is subtle yet perfect and the music matches the surrealist imagery it accompanies. Well worth the $24.99 price tag.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. Yes it is a point-and-click. Yes it is basically an interactive story book. No it isn't actually finished yet, but unless the devs somehow manage to completely drop the ball with the upcoming acts, I can't imagine the experience being soured. Unlike most point-and-clicks, this game does not rely on obtuse puzzles or ""look-and-find"" mechanics to progress the player through the game. Instead it lets the character development and presentation propel the story. The art and camera movements are fantastic, allowing for some genuinely stunning moments. It's difficult to explain without seeing it in motion, but this may be the most beautiful game I've ever played. Even if you don't like point-and-clicks, if you enjoy a good story and cinematic presentation please play this. I still can't stop thinking about it after finishing what the devs have already put out, and I can't wait to see how it all wraps up at the end.			"

												I'm only at Act I, Scene 3, but this game is astonishing.  It's beautifully written and deeply clever (the choices you make in the dialogue trees are unconventional and interesting, although I have no idea how varied the game is depending on what you choose to say; I will simply say that it drastically changes the storytelling going on in your own head, at least).  The game is gorgeous and elegant, the characters are endearing and unique, and the incidental moments of folk tunes that slowly build in your speakers at unexpected moments give the game a haunting beauty.  The story is very mysterious and endlessly fascinating.  I cannot wait to see where this goes.Update: Having played all the episodes currently available (up to Episode Three), all I can add to what I said before is that the game continues to deepen into one of the most intriguing and original pieces of electronic art I've ever played.  The wait for the final two chapters already feels interminable, but even if I played no more, my time was well spent and absolutely unforgettable.  I think it's about time I relive the game...			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a masterfully crafted point-and-click, narrative adventure with the conceit that indirect storytelling is an effective form of character building. For the most part, it succeeds. Dripping with rich dialogue and gorgeous atmosphere, Kentucky Route Zero peers into the life and past of Conway, a down-on-his-luck deliveryman, as well as a cast of other strange folks driving the less traveled ‘Route Zero’. Conversation options are creative, often giving control instead to whomever Conway is talking to.  After most scenes, you return to a roadmap where you can drive around freely. There is no marker on where to go outside of directions gleaned from dialogue. KRZ does not contain any ‘action’ outside of narrative choices and the driving sections. Where KRZ shines is its unforgettable imagery and its strangely relatable cast. If you are not a fan of ‘art games’ or tons of unspoken dialogue in your games (which is the crowd KRZ is catering to), you probably won’t enjoy this one. For everyone else, KRZ really is a must-buy… if you can find it on sale. The price has not fallen much since it's release.			"

												The game really captures the folk music's essence through broken people views in a harsh, but mysterious world. The writing is book-worthy with touches of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's mundane mysticism.        The graphics works as a melancholic veil that covers the many shades of the characters, in which are revealed to the player in a gentle way by the dialogue choices. Music is a force of nature here, whether it's the background static howling or the gloomy folk tunes.         If you like a mysterious universe, relatable characters, realistic problems in a metaphorically way, unique artstyle and a zelous soundtrack, this game is for you.			"

												I come back to this game after playing 'Where The Water Tastes Like Wine' at Day Of The Devs 2016, a game I have been looking forward to since the first trailer. I talked to the developer demoing the game there, and he confirmed my suspicions that it was influenced by Kentucky Route Zero. After a year, and having played it before, the game has lost none of its magic.  This game still contains some of the most mesmerizing scenes I have ever played in a game. The amazing soundtrack, a mix of ambience and bluegrass, only adds to the already mysterious, dulcet atmosphere. My only complaint would be the amount of reading that has to be done. I understand narration would not work well with the feeling of the game, but the substantial amounts of dialouge do grate on my patience a bit.			"

Its definitely one of the best indie games I've played, probably one of the best games ever. But I'll have to wait till the last two episodes come out. The story is very intriguing and confusing and I'm looking forward to seeing how it all ends. Its a very beautiful game and if you like games like Broken Age, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, etc, then you will definitely like this masterpiece.			"

I'd recommend it at about half off even just for the first 3 acts, and there's 2 more yet to come. Bear in mind it's all about the story and presentation, no puzzles or contrived action sequences here, but if you absolutely need those, maybe give it a miss.			"

 Art It's an eerie and spooky journey, through a mysterious road where you will meet with strange persons and their weird stories. It's evocative, atmospheric, claustrophobic , has some magic. There's some sense of longing, some nostalgia. Is a beautiful and artistic piece of work, filled with stunning music and images. Has an strong and powerfull narrative, very smart. Full of bizarre moments where you do not know what's going on, if what you see is real or not.An experience like no other.			"

New Review, after waiting over two years for this game to release: I can't recommend this game anymore. You're paying a lot for a good movie, but it's an unfinished movie. It's become a scam. If act 4 releases with a 10 hour storyline it'll be worth it; but let's face it: I'm no shill so I can't recommend this anymore. Basically a scam now, and that's sad. It had great potential, music,artwork, and an interesting storyline but it's probably dead.Prior, positive review:I honestly can't say I've ever played a game like it.I spent ~3 hours (Steam says this) getting through acts 1-3. I still think the $18.74 was worth it, for something I've never experienced before.It plays more like a movie, and anything your character says twists how the game works. I will warn that the game is short, though.			"

												Before you buy this game, understand that it should be labeled Early Access. It's 40% unfinished a year and a half after they started charging for five episodes. Who knows when four and five will come out. Feels very disingenuous that this doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere. It's interesting, but all those high reviews are based on playing a fragment of the finished game. Caveat emptor.			"

												The atmosphere is fantastic, but I need some good strong meat to go on the bones, and all I'm seeing is a load of exceptionally up-itself deliberately obtuse-for-no-good-reason squirrelly crap.  By Act III there starts to come a reason to care about the characters that I'm following around, but it's too little too late.I like many of the things it's trying to do, particularly the form that the choices take.  I just wish it had all been done in the service of a better story.  The game may have been getting a lot of attention recently, but the Emperor has no clothes.			"

												I appreciate trying to tell the story through the medium but the minimal interaction you have with the ""game"" is a turnoff for me. Its a struggle to continue playing at this point and decided to cut my losses and play games that are more interactive and involving. I'll read a book later when I want this type of story delievery.Nothing against the developers though. The game is visually appealing and functions well. I'm just not the type of gamer who gets into games of this pace.			"

Only two out of five acts has been released.Unfinsihed games should have a big red sticker slapped over the whole page sayining ""UNFINISHED"". I made a mistake and didn't read carefully enough that the whole game hasn't been released.			"

												*Updated for Act III, see bottom of the review*Kentucky Route Zero is an indie episodic point and click adventure game, developed and published by Cardboard Computer. Revealed on Kickstarter back in 2011, the developer had to reach a goal of USD 6,500, but managed to raise USD 8,583. Kentucky Route Zero was planned for release in late 2011, but as with every single game development project ever, that never happened and eventually the game was instead split into 5 episodes with the first one released in January 2013 and the second in May.The game’s story revolves around a secret highway in Kentucky and the mysterious folks who travel it. The player controls Conway, an antique furniture deliveryman, as he attempts to complete the final delivery for his financially troubled employer. Along the way he’ll meet dozens of strange characters and make a few new friends to help him overcome the obstacles in his path. Gameplay in Kentucky Route Zero is slow-paced, focusing on exploring new environments and talking with new people. Thankfully, “slow” doesn’t equal “boring”. The story is very well written, and although the player seems to have no way of affecting the outcome at all, it’s a pleasure to discover everything along the way.The game has a simply, yet beautiful art style. Background and scene transitions are often brilliantly done, and it’s a shame not all the locations are visualized: Some of them are only described in text on the map screen. I’ve got a feeling the game could have been so much better with every location drawn in the Kentucky Route Zero style, even locations that are not responsible for driving the story forward. And driving is a key word in Kentucky Route Zero. You do spend some time “driving” around on the game map, making it a little disappointing when you reach a new location and it’s simply just described to you textually.The music in the game is, like the visuals, great, but it suffers from the same problem: It’s just not enough music. Also, it’s a soundtrack that works very well with the game, but it’s not a soundtrack you’ll sit down and listen to, like the Machinarium soundtrack. The sound design, too, is a curious piece. I played the game with headphones on and it has serious volume problems at times, with some sound effects almost drowning out other sounds in a scene. This could of course be intentional, but I doubt it.The replayability isn’t much to talk about. There are a lot of nice surprises, twists and turns the first time you play through, but since it’s hard to surprise the player twice when telling exactly the same story, Kentucky Route Zero is a game most people will play only once. And this brings us on the the subject of game cost. The game retails at a massive $24.99, which is rather pricy for this game. Yes, you will get 5 acts for that price, but I’ve already played through the first two acts and spent around two hours doing that. If we can use that as a pointer, you’ll get 5, maybe 6, hours of gameplay for $24.99, which isn’t impressive. It should be mentioned that you also get the soundtrack and a “private newsletter” included, but even though the soundtrack is very good, it does not justify the price. To put it in a way the internet generation understands: The price of this game is too damn high!Kentucky Route Zero is not a bad game, far from it. But I’ve got a feeling it could have been so much better. Just a little more music and a few more visualized locations would have made wonders. Cardboard Computer has promised to release three more episodes, and unless they decide to pull a Valve on us all, those remaining episodes might very well change my overall impression of the game – for better or for worse. If that happens, I’ll come back here and let you know.At the current price and with only two episodes released, I would not recommend Kentucky Route Zero, unless you are a die hard point-and-click adventure fan.*Update for Act III*Cardboard computer finally managed to release the third act (still out of five acts) of KRZ. I know this goes against popular opinion, but even with this third act, I can't recommend the game at the current price. Act III adds roughly 2 more hours of gameplay, and while it's a beautiful audiovisual experience that will tickle your brain where it fees good, I don't feel that I get my money's worth. Wait for all five acts to be released, THEN go ahead and throw your money at Cardboard Computer. At the current release pace, this will be some time in 2016.This review is also available on http://www.vegard.net/.			"

												For the premium price I was expecting it to be a complete story.  It currently contains only 2 acts out of 5.  And it's not certain that the other three acts will ever be finished, or whether the user will be expected to buy them as DLCs.  Don't get me wrong, the story is decent, and the storytelling is engaging.  But it's way too short I got through both acts in under three hours, and I did plenty of exploring.  My advice, is don't buy this game untill all 5 acts are finished.			"

												This is a very strange one. At the risk of sounding extremely pretentious; this is not a game. This is an abstract work of art. It's not meant to be played like a game. It's meant to be watched, appreciated, and have its meaning dictated by the viewer while applying interactive elements. There is no plot, your goal isn't made apparent, it can even be purposefully boring and monatonous at times. It is an extremely strange and interesting experience. If you are interested in maybe watching a stage play where you pick the dialogue and you find the pricepoint a non-issue I'll recommend it, but if you want to have fun with a game there are much better options on steam for much less cash. That being said, I went into it completely blind and interested and had a very strange, pleasant experience.			"

												I have to admit, I think this game it too arthouse for me. I'm missing it. I played for the first several chapters and I just didn't latch onto any piece of it. The responses you give in dialogue seem to allow you to... shape reality?... in that the response to questions are very different, e.g. What's the dog's name? a) Her name is Lady b) His name is Butch. In my opinion, KRZ leaves you with an experience that is unhinged and incoherent. I see all these great reviews but I'm sorry, it's just too artsy for me. I think it's best put that this game is like if someone wrote a poem about a dream they had, this would be it. If that description appeals to you, awesome. If not, stay away.			"

												The game is not complete, and they have not released a new part in over a year. I love pretentious story based games (I just played Ethan Carter and I'm in love), but this game has all the pretentious and none of the story. Your character is not interesting, nor are the other characters, and nothing makes sense. You get gas, then go talk to (presumably) a ghost. You hang out in a mine with the ghost's friend for 10-15 mintues for no discernible reason, and then go home to where the ghost was, and then drive onto a magical highway. That's literally all that happened in the first Act. Nothing to make me want to play the other two (and nothing to make me want to wait years for acts IV and V).I would absolutely not recommend.I'm really happy that Steam has the ability to refund now, because even at 50% off this game is an insane ripoff.

We're 3 Acts in and I'm still waiting for the main character to reach the same revolation about what's going on as I have. One of the few duds I've come across in Indie Adventure games on Steam.			"

 Art It's an eerie and spooky journey, through a mysterious road where you will meet with strange persons and their weird stories. It's evocative, atmospheric, claustrophobic , has some magic. There's some sense of longing, some nostalgia. Is a beautiful and artistic piece of work, filled with stunning music and images. Has an strong and powerfull narrative, very smart. Full of bizarre moments where you do not know what's going on, if what you see is real or not.An experience like no other.			"

												I come back to this game after playing 'Where The Water Tastes Like Wine' at Day Of The Devs 2016, a game I have been looking forward to since the first trailer. I talked to the developer demoing the game there, and he confirmed my suspicions that it was influenced by Kentucky Route Zero. After a year, and having played it before, the game has lost none of its magic.  This game still contains some of the most mesmerizing scenes I have ever played in a game. The amazing soundtrack, a mix of ambience and bluegrass, only adds to the already mysterious, dulcet atmosphere. My only complaint would be the amount of reading that has to be done. I understand narration would not work well with the feeling of the game, but the substantial amounts of dialouge do grate on my patience a bit.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is an odd storytelling game, focussing purely on story and very little on gameplay.I didn't much enjoy this game, and haven't got much to say about it. To begin with, the game is only in Act 2 and has been out for a *very* long time. Where is the rest of the game?Secondly, the game is just kind of boring. The story lacks a narrative drive and at times is very confusing and odd. Surreal is what they must have been going to, but personally I just found it all odd and felt the game fit badly together.Maybe I'm wrong and the next 3 Acts will make the game stupendous, but I've been waiting for a hell of a long time for those, so I'm going to bite the bullet, uninstall the game and deem this experience ended.Nilesy			"

												It's one of those ""I'd rather not call it a game, but an art project"" type of releases that we've got so many this year.It's a point and click adventure in style with barely any gameplay, you follow along a person and his dog on a strange journey that asks many questions and doesn't like to give answers. Minimalistic strange graphic design will most likely not get in your way, but is not really great to look at if you are not a fan of Picasso or smth like that :DMost of the time spent in this game is reading dialogue and descriptions of items. Probably going to be even more convoluted in later chapters, but I do not care to find out.PS. I don't think this is even out fully yet, they seem to be releasing chapters once in a while and I'm not sure how many of them will be there really, but unless you are really intrigued by what you've read - don't bother. =)			"

												Arty farty nonsense masquerading as a game. This is the third time where I have been conned into buying a rubbish game by review sites (the first two being ""Dear Esther"" and ""Gone Home""). Art house games should be clearly labelled and come with a warning that they are terrible. This situation reminds me very much of the ""Emperor's new clothes"" children's story - pretentious reviewers are so hyped up over proving how sophisticated and arty they are, they fail to realise that they are reviewing an insubstantial turd.I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

												This isn't a game. It's art. However, art comes in a lot of varieties... and you'll hate it if you don't have the proper mindset. This is one of those games where the gamers who are tired of the same old same old hold up as an example of ""look, video games can be so much MOOOARR!!0eleventy11!!"" Kinda' like when your pretentious friend invites you to eat at some artsy restaurant, and you order and the food tastes meh bordering on WTF because your food palette really wanted a non-subtle burger and fries, but you got some kind of truffle pate in a soufle or somesuch.Since mindset is everything for this game, let me describe what you need.1] you need time and patience. you can't rush this.2] you need to have an open mind and keep clicking. yes. suspend disbelief with that wtf moment. keep clicking.3] you need to be inquisitive enough to wonder what happens next, even if you're confused.I really can't recommend this game at this price. Right now, I'm feeling like I want 3 hours of my life back... you're buying an experience... an experience I'd liken to getting a major second-hand high from a bunch of dudes filling the room with the Light of Jah.

But bearing in mind that the three people in Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliot, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbit) are putting so much love and time and care into getting Act IV perfect for release, and looking back on what I've played, it will undoubtedly be worth the wait.

												It's a Click and Point Adventure where you also choose the entire adventure. You'll not only make choices for your character, but also everyone else and sometimes the things around you. You'll dictate how things are as much as you'll uncover through investigation.It's beautiful, haunting, eerie, and melancholy. It's slow, obtuse, and impressionistic. You won't understand what's going on, and it won't try to change that.No action and only a strange artistic kind of satisfaction will make this a pass for most.

												I've played a lot of adventure games and they are undoubtedly my favorite genre.  I don't have nearly as much time to play games as I used to so a purchase and commitment like this is somewhat a big deal to me and as such I researched this fairly heavily before jumping in.  I have to say, I regret it.   People talk about the great writing, but I think it's more non-sensical, abstract dialogue rather than something meaningful.  It's sort of like back in college when you'd sit around with your friends on a Friday night in a chemical-induced haze and say things like ""But doesn't *everything* matter?  I mean *matters*!"" and you'd all think that you guys were speaking brilliantly about life.  People will talk about the story and what not, but even that is so muddled.  At the start, it seems like it's going to be a ghost story but Act III almost devolves into some sort of corporate dystopian theme and it's not a good direction.  Even the music scene that people rave about is nothing special.  I was expecting a big setup but it's really just a meaningless musical number in the middle of the game.  There have been some great games with great writing, great story, great dialog, and even great music.  This game attempts to be all that but in the end is just pretentious at best and a waste of time at worst.  That said, I see value in this type of ""game"" -- that is, the game that's more of an interactive novel rather than the traditional puzzle-solving quest.  However, there's a way around that -- just buy a better adventure game and play it using the walkthrough.  It is guaranteed to be a better experience.			"

												By all accounts, this should be a fantastic game.  The first 3 acts are well done.  The game play is interesting, the visuals are fantastic, the music is hauntingly beautiful, and the story is intriguing.  I genuinely enjoyed my play time.The reason I can not recommend this is that there have been zero updates on when Act 4 and Act 5 will be released.  Act 3 came out over a year ago, and even when there was a delay then, the developers let fans know what was going on.  There has been nothing but radio silence from Cardboard Computer on the progress of this game.  Their website has not been updated since the release of Act 3.  Fans post to facebook expressing their concerns and are ignored.  The only activity seems to be added gamepad support in February and an auction held in March.  Fans understand that delays in games happen, but to hear nothing over the course of a year is getting ridiculous, especially after paying for a full game. The game is only available as a season pass.  Don't pay full price for an unfinished game that has no end in sight.  This is the last time I will buy a season pass on Steam.			"

No puzzling or anything that could be considered a challenge gameplay-wise, more of an interactive story. Lots of details and deep text lines and settings. Altering perspectives, surreal elements making you often question whether this is supposed to be real or some odd mythical tale told among friends sitting in front of a fireplace. It's not finished yet but I can already tell at this point that it's of one of the most unique, subtle and immersive games I've ever played.			"

HOWEVER you may want to purchase it when all the acts are released, this is my current and only gripe. IT TAKES SO LONG FOR NEW ACTS TO COME OUT. I have completely forgotten the story since the start. I'll have to go back through and play them all again once all the acts are released. This is why I'm suggesting you hold off buying until it's fully released.Despite being completely bizarre and surreal, it's very well written so far. If you enjoy getting lost in feelings and emotions for a game, please try this. It is possibly the most calming game I've ever played.			"

												Kentucky route zero is a game with a very strong narritve. it does not focus on being innovative and creating something that will change the way games are created or whatever people want today, and thats okay.

The game does not invent a new genre or whatnot but, I can say that this game has the best narritive and story I have ever seen and its not always what it appears to be on the surface it has deeper meaning and is captivating, bizzare, and intresting. This game is not for everone. But on the other hand, if you give it a shot, you may see it for the masterpiece that it truly is.			"

												I won't bother giving a detailed breakdown here, others have done it better, go read those if you want to know why you need this game. I'll just sum that up by saying you *need* this game.However, this review is unique, because I need to explain something else: THIS GAME NEEDS YOU. This is a fantastic game, with a beautiful atmosphere, engaging characters and wonderful, surreal environments, but it has gone on largely un-updated for a few years now, because the fact remains that there are not enough people playing this game.This needs to change.Get this game. Play it. Tell your friends. Talk about it. Post it on social media. Leave a review. Just please GET PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS GAME. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, but it has gone so unnoticed for so long, that the developers probably don't care about even trying anymore.			"

												There is no story. Everything is just random gibberish strung together in way that locally seems impacted by your choices, but doesn't form a whole. In fact they don't even try to form a whole, and just uses ""artsy"" as an excuse to be lazy.On top of that animations are slow, very slow at times, which gets annoying when nothing is actually going on anyway.

												So far I've really enjoyed KRZ. Acts I, II and III have all been compelling.But Act IV... it's different. It seems like a lot of vignette scenes, and maybe I've forgotten the first three acts in the two years it's taken IV to be finished, but it feels like IV is just chock-full of expository dialogue, whereas in the prior episodes the dialogue was tighter.I hope that Act V returns to form, because whilst I did enjoy IV in the sense of I've enjoyed KRZ to this point, I didn't enjoy it *as much* as the first three acts which were truly mind-blowing.

												Kentucky Route Zero has the most interesting dialogue system I have ever seen in a game. And not because it has particularly many choices or branching paths (though it certainly scratches the itch of dialogue tree decision-making), but because the dialogue system fluidly gives you information about the character you play as without a plot dump or exposition of their backstory. You don't learn anything about characters when you meet them, you learn it when you play as them. And when exactly you play as them is another interesting point, as what character you are controlling changes often once you meet the first other main character. And eventually you don't really control any one character, but rather you get to see what everyone in your party is thinking and choose one of their dialogue options. It's an interesting and effective way of learning about a main cast of characters that I've never really seen before. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous while running on a potato, because everything is solid colors and nothing in the environments needs to move much. Lots of pretty scenes and abstract imagery, in a nice rural setting. It's not usually something I bring up, but the audio design is such an important part of this game and done so well that it deserves praise too. I'm excited for acts IV and V, with act III being one of the most intriguing segments of a game I've ever played. If you're on the fence because all the acts aren't out yet, you should buy this. I don't want to spoil much more, but it's the best game I've played of it's genre, and this is probably my favorite genre of games. What's already here is great, and the developers are working hard to complete it.			"

												A lot of people have complained about the delays, and I can understand that. However, the amount of time that has passed has made it so I've needed to play it multiple times, which has been awesome. I've enjoyed it thoroughly each time, and it's given me opportunity to ruminate on the story, the themes, the characters, and their motivations. So many things I didn't quite piece together the first time become connected, and gain so much more significance.Beautiful and sad, this game is worth your money and it is worth the wait. Act V ho!PS: Props to Ben Babbitt for excellent soundtrack. Also, if you like the music, you might want to give Cross Record (Emily Cross sings lots of parts, but most notably as Junebug in Act III) on Spotify.[play.spotify.com] "

Totally immersive and amazing game.That said, it's more of a visual storytelling experience, so if you can't handle or don't want that level of indie then this isn't for you.

												Imagine the morning: you got out of your bed, went to the kitchen and forgot why are you here. Later, you end up in this small town, and you are lost and you're not entirerly sure if you're not being watched (you are). But hey, it's a quiet and friendly town, you can ask for help (and you will); you're in a hurry (well... you was?) and this dog... (is she yours?) You know how it happens: turn left, then on 26, than to the Crystal and back. Does your hand still glow?This isn't your typical 'point n' click' game. There isn't spare parts in your inventory, there are no puzzles to solve. You're immersedto the story and only your desisions matter.I bought it a year ago. Today I come back again and again. I'm sure it's worth the wait. I'm ready to wait, it grew into me. UPD: It was worth it, every month of waiting. After episode IV I feel like the end is near and I'm scared of it, I'm sad. I just met more new people with more strange stories. I stole a cat! I can't imagine how this roadtrip can end.			"

												DISCLAIMER: It's been awhile since I played this game and I am finally getting around to reviewing it. I put off reviewing it for so long because it's such an odd game and I didn't know what to say about it. Anyway, the point is that I am going off of my faulty memory.I liked this game but it's not for everyone. It's really hard to pin down. It plays like the graphical adventure games of olden days--King's Quest, Police Quest, Space Quest, etc. except you don't really collect items in an inventory, neither do you really solve any puzzles. It almost feels like a surreal text adventure populated with quirky characters but with some impressionistic graphics and haunting music to go along with it. It's like a game that Sierra On-Line would have made back in the day, if David Lynch and William Faulkner had worked there.The game feels more like a tone poem. It's eerie at times, but not scary. It can be hauntingly beautiful at times, leaving you feeling melancholy. Sometimes it can be weirdly comical. As I said before, you don't really solve any major puzzles and you only occasionally feel like you are pursuing any sort of goal or are part of any story that is advancing toward any kind of resolution. You sort of go along for the ride and you do have decisions to make, but those are mostly just selecting dialog. The gameplay, what little there is, feels like mostly just adding some subtle nuance to the way the characters interact with each other.Looking back over what I wrote, it can seem like I am being negative about the game, but I can say that it was a very unique experience and I thought that the presentation, however odd, was enjoyable. If you want to try something really different, I suggest you give this game a shot when it goes on sale.			"

												To get to a serious issue:A lot of people criticize the game for its slow dlc releases. I didn't notice that what I bought was a ""season pass"" and not a full game until well after I'd finished playing as much as I could. I honestly loved the game. Its narrative was touching. The music still sticks with me. The game was like a work of art. So I personally did not mind that the game was unfinished. However, the enterence fee is a bit hefty. So: If this is going to be one of the few games in your library, do not buy it. It is a bit of a one-hit-wonder. It doesn't have a lot of replay value, at least not to me. The beauty (or downfall, in some cases) of this game is in the way it tells the narrative. You cannot backtrack on your dialogue choices, and some choices are relatively similar. This gives the whole adventure this feel of permanence. If I were to replay the game, I feel like it would almost water down my first experience. It's almost like a book or movie. I have to wait a while to replay it, otherwise it won't be great. But with the lack of replay value, the long wait for scenes, etc, is this game any good? Yes. The craftmenship of this game is amazing. It has a lot of moments that captured me. There's this one scene I remember getting particularly entranced in, this moment in a bar where the visuals and audio worked together to recreate the feeling of music. There is a lot of love that goes into this game. It is unlike any other that I have played before. It's strange, but awesome. I guess captivating is the best word to describe this game as a whole. It is definitely a labor of love; you can really tell that the developers put their all into making this game. It's worth playing at least once. Try to shoot for a sale price if you're concerned about the longetivity of the game. This is a game that lasts longer in memory than in playtime.			"

												At first I could not understand what this game is about, and did not know what to expect. I played this on my laptop for an hour or so but I just found the game strange. I returned to the game again after a month or so and something finally clicked.This is not a game in the traditional sense, but more of a psychedelic interactive novella. The gameplay, if you can call it that, consists of travelling around a bizarre world and encountering strange characters and events as well as choosing dialogue options (sometimes for multiple characters at once!).To best be able to appreciate this game I think that you need* to play with a controller* to play on a big screen or TV. While they graphics may seem primitive there is a lot of detail in the surroundings, especially from Act 2 onwards.* decent sound. The sound design in this game is great, but on laptop speakers it is terrible :PIf you like games in the style of ""Dear Esther"" and ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" but want a more dialogue-driven alternative, this might be something for you. If you want a traditional point 'n click adventure with puzzles, this will probably not be your cup of tea.Beware though that the release rate of the 5 acts in the game has slowed down by a lot (act 3 was released 2 years ago).

												Mythical and charming, Kentucky Route Zero is like nothing else out there. Be charmed by theater-set-design-inspired set-pieces scored with bitter sweet folk music, smart writing, dream-like situations and lovable outsider characters. The magical highway underneath and through Kentucky links many amazing places - the Museum of Dwellings where displaced people live in homes ferried to a ghostly forest during the day by a giant eagle and his little human brother, the Kafkaesque Bureau with it's nondescript brick and cement walls, piles of nonsensical paperwork, and ... a department of bears?, the cyclopean caverns under the earth inhabited by a depressed scientist and his crew who once worked upon a revolutionary mold computer that simulates a strange echo-world, the haunted remains of a church yard in which the graves have been tapped to produce a strange brew by light-and-shadow people who trick others into working for them for near-eternity through debt - but none of these places are stranger than the human heart. There is a humanity and compassion here deeper and more moving than I can express adequately.			"

												This game is supposedly about 1 hour per act.  I have 7 hours logged and I've only played two acts.  Hows that work?  Well, just moseying around has led me to so many strange side interactions that I find myself crawling along every inch of the backroads and exploring every nook and cranny in the game.  Granted, I probably fell asleep to some bluegrass music at some point and logged a few hours that was as well =) The point is though, tat beating this game is not a challenge, nor is it the point.  Simply experiencing the game and absorbing it's atmosphere s the entire purpose of KRZ.It's the perfect game for late night insomnia. It will have you asking yourself if you read that right... did the text just fade away or did you start to fall asleep?  Where did the person go you just saw flicker in the light?  Was it a person?  Or are you just tired and seeing things?  That area between conscious and unconscious thought is where the game resides, and it is where I tend to play  it.  It has the a warm mysterious nature about it that seems earie and welcoming at the same time.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is an odd game, to say the least. It is developed by Cardboard Computer, and there is a computer made of cardboard in it. Actually, the game may really be made of painted bits of cardboard cut into interesting shapes. I do not know, but what I do know is that this game is quite decent.You start off the story with an elderly fellow named Conway, who is delivering a package in his truck to someone located on Dogwood Drive. To get there, he is told, he must find a way to [wobbly, smoky lettering]The Zero[/wobbly, smoky lettering] in order to get there. What follows is what happens in his pursuit of this location.I feel I ought to address the issue of the acts, as they stand currently this fine January afternoon in 2016. There are at this time three of five promised acts, and the development of the remaining two acts has been pushed back to an indefinite time. Act IV is purportedly imminent, but the exact timing is still undefined.It is some folks' opinion that you should wait until the game is completely and totally finished before you bother with the first three acts, as the developers are totally attempting to scam us all by falsely advertising a five-act game while only delivering three.It is my opinion that if those are your thoughts in this debate, you ought not be playing this game, as I am reasonably certain it simpy is not your sort of game. Having played through the first three acts, I do not feel particularly stiffed in not having the last two yet. I have backed projects on Kickstarter, for goodness sakes, and if that has taught me anything it is that a rushed project will yield nothing but misery. Certainly, this is a long night, out on the road, but isn't that kind of the point of the game?			"

												There's no puzzles it's more like an adventure game where you just make decisions about characterization and plot points via your dialogue choices. For something linear that doesnt involve puzzles or rubbing objects together and hoping they mate, you have a  lot of control over the contextualization of the story and it's a really good surreal little road trip.   You're going to follow the exact same linear path but it's a nebulous morale choice system that simply chooses your own adventure in a unique way. It's really vivid, and entirely narrative driven. And it doesnt rate your decisions vs everyone elses, you could just play it again and be surprised at how different things turned out . (while still being the exact same chain of events)			"

												First off - it´s not a new game, and there are already plenty of in-depth-reviews out there, I guess. If asked to briefly sum up my experience, I wouldn´t really know where to begin. Also, I´d have to ask myself if such an approach doesn´t spoil someone´s experience with the attempt to breach that surface, to ""elevate"" things from their sub-concious dream-like continuum that are so rarely verbalized in this game. That´s what it feeds on: A lot of it is sub-text and imagination, non-linear and intuition (which is not surprising, given the sources of inspiration of the creators).Characters are sketchy at first, but as your journey down this road continues, their dialogue options and choices become the bits that fill the empty spaces and before long it will feel like you actually inhabit these characters to some degree.Everything remains vague while familiarity creeps in. One starts to wonder what lies behind some of the ghost-like appearances and the cursed world they inhabit.Anyone with a tolerance or maybe even a soft spot for this kind of narrative should pick this up. I waited for a rather long time after I discovered Kentucky Route Zero, because you could read that the developers were taking so much time to complete the game. It would not have been the first game to fall short of hype and expectations...However, fear not - even at this point it is well worth the money. Time well spent. I´m still playing it and haven´t had the time to take everything in, let alone decypher it with three acts completed. It may even be quite replayable.Some more superficial remarks:- The minimalistic visuals are carefully composed and very appealing- Audio design is spot on - there is not one tableau or scene in this game where something really seems out of place or overbearingCan video games be art?

												This is the only good walking simulator. It nails all of the literary qualities that are important for games like this. What most of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gone Homes and Life Is Stranges miss is the good storytelling and atmosphere that this game has in spades. It uses visuals and writing good enough for it to overcome the complete lack of gameplay. This might as well be an animated film. They couldn't make me pay $30 for a movie though ;)That said, it pushes gaming backwards just as far as these other walking simulators and, damningly, I bought it three years ago and only one new episode has been released. That's unforgiveable.Good game, but don't buy it yet until they finish it. If ever.			"

												So just for folks that call the game a scam out there, a recent tweet from cardboard computer:""We've had a few concerned emails lately, so we want to be clear that rumors+speculation about Kentucky Route Zero being abandoned are wrong.""Don't forget that it's a really small team, who is working on this title.Besides the long wait (which is annoying, I admit it), it's a wonderful game with a immersive story, great, atmospheric but very simple visuals and a lesson in how to craft a point'n'click adventure in a modern but still classic way.10/10 - would wait again.

												Art house narrative, sad bluegrass, magical realism, and the revival of the career an artist nobody has heard about in 30 years. Stretches the definition of what a ""game"" is in a similar way to how Dear Esther pushes the boundaries of the medium. By the end of an episode I'm left feeling vaguely dislocated from reality. A pretty cool feat.			"

It´s because this game is so much more than all the other ""overwhelmingly positive"" indie games I buy and finish in a few hours. KRZ has characters that you will not remember the names of, except Blue, and neither does it have engaging gameplay or even coherent writing. What it has is a story and experience that sticks with you, I don't know of any game I remember as vividly as KRZ and the fact that it's released across such a long timespan honestly doesn't face me since it either gives me a reson to A) anticipate it and prolong the pleasure or B) play through it again, ever time being as incoherent as the last.

												The Destructoid review above likens KR0 to the feeling of sitting around the campfire telling ghost stories. It's definitely that, but also, like,Have you made friends where you thought there were none to be found?Have you ever stared at the stars and realize how ♥♥♥♥ed we all are, and, in the same moment, realize how insignificant we all are in the universe?Have you ever gone outside, late at night, to watch the city, and just feel everything…slow…down…?That's this game.At least, that's what the first act is like. The second one picks up the pace a little, and the third and fourth - well, they're spooky enough they might as well be a horror game. Not, like, frightening, just unsettling. Still a great atmosphere. There's no anti-aliasing so I originally forced it on in my graphics settings (MSAA, not any of the junky screen-space stuff), but apparently it was an artistic choice by the developer to leave that out. Looks amazing either way.			"

												Now, take this review with a grain of salt because, yes, this game is unfinished and there have been absolutely no signs from the developers as to when the next acts will come out (currently there are only 3 acts out of a presumable 5 available). This is an incredibly unique game unlike any other narrative-driven game out there. The plot and basis of this game is incredibly refreshing in its originality, not only introducing its lore but completely submersing the player in it. At times it can feel hard to follow because all you want to ask is ""What the hell is all this?"", which you may. But at the same time you can just say ""Well alright then"" and dive deeper. The game gives you control over not just one character, but the entire cast of the game, manipulating the dialogue and developing the characters as you see fit. Each character has their own personality and background that could be interpreted in many different ways, and the game allows you to interpret them however you like and expand upon it through the dialogue choices you make. This is very much an exploratory game; a large world with nooks and crannies giving more insight as to where you are. Don't expect the game to point you towards hidden trivia, take the time and find it yourself. And if you get stuck not knowing what to do, eh you'll figure it out. It's a slow-paced game, treat it as such. Alright now down to brass tacks. Is this game worth buying? Yes. When will the rest of the game be released? Hell if I know, go harass the developers if that's your style. Buying episodic games before they're finished is an investment, and I believe that the current 3 acts released is a good sweet spot of available content to allow you to get your money's worth and pray that you get some return.

It's not action packed or have strong mechanics, it's just a cool experience.  However, the game was supposed to be finished by now, but game development is hard and I don't mind waiting.

												The Good: This game is a delightfully weird experience.  If you are a fan of David Lynch, you will probably like this game.  The art and atmosphere are great and the music is downright hypnotic at times.  It is very rare that I listen to the soundtrack of a game, but I find myself listening to songs from KR0 often.   The bad:  Cardboard Computer is a small development company and they are notoriously slow at putting new episodes out.  They tweeted last November that episode 4 is almost done and yet, it is still not here.  I do believe the game is worth buying, but I would suggest picking it up during a sale since it is still incomplete.			"

												So I picked the first Indie game I would immerse my self into and boy was it a great pick. The constant ambient feel you get through your playthrough is deeply calming. I would describe this as an interactive story book where you're free to explore and piece together the story by yourself. You'll meet lots of interesting characters that you will advance through the storyline with whilst exploring the highway on your journey to find the mysterious and infamous Kentucky Route Zero. A peculiar game to say the least but one that is definitely worth your time.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a game. Kentucky Route Zero is also an experience. It is possible to perform in-depth analysis of the many notable references within the game and experience, but I will not do it here. Kentucky Route Zero is divided into five acts, out of which only three have been published at the time of writing. This three-fifths situation does not stop me from preparing this quick review. Kentucky Route Zero is worth it.Many games have the character of a novel or a short story. Kentucky Route Zero is more like poetry, and as poetry it has a story to tell between the lines. The narrative starts when Conway, a truck driver, stops by a darkened gas station (Equus Oils) somewhere in Kentucky to get directions. He needs to make a delivery to an address which he cannot find, and is informed by the old man at the gas station that he needs to take the somewhat mysterious Route Zero to be able to make the delivery. Hence Conway starts his journey through the Kentucky night in search for the Zero.Along the journey, Conway meets several characters with interesting and rich background stories. Examples of these are the cousins Shannon and Weaver Márquez that have lost contact with each other over the years, the young boy Ezra whose parents have disappeared and now lives with his unusual brother Julian, and the motorcycling musicians Johnny and Junebug. During the night, Conway also uncovers more and more details about a complicated story from many years ago involving the three then college students Joseph, Lula and Donald:It’s something like a tragic love triangle, but much more complex. Some kind of tangled, painfully concave love polygon.One of the main themes in Kentucky Route Zero is that of being too late, or to some extent not in phase with the present. It takes its form in the use of old electronic equipment, stepping into abandoned industrial sites, handling bureaucracy and lost love, and visiting museums. It is also reflected in the general gameplay, which is mostly the point-and-click style of old adventure games. The strongest example of this theme is shown in the Lower Depths bar in the most powerful scene in Act III of the game. That scene may actually be the most powerful one I have ever experienced in a computer game. The magic of that scene must be experienced in the game; it cannot possibly be described by me in words.The atmospere in the game fits the story perfectly, both with its, somewhat angular, visual appearance and its almost perfect music score. The changes in the mood and the tone are often subtle but efficient. The writing is excellent, and the way that the character controlled by the player changes over time opens up for good variations in the way the story plays out. However, the last aspect of course also opens up for some confusion along the line.Is the game perfect? No, but I think it is very good.Is the experience perfect? No, but I really like it.I am looking forward to the final two acts of the drama.			"

I myself can´t wait to play more and that´s because it´s incredibly good. I´m not gonna spoil the plot, I think it´s better if you go in blind. Few games inmerse you so deep in their atmosphere. It´s so minimal and simple in the best possible way. It´s a beutiful story told in a different way.

												Have you ever driven down a completely dark stretch of highway in the middle of the night?  The entire world seems to shrink to exactly the size of your headlights illuminating the road.  The nighttime is almost another country, one where it seems anything can happen.Kentucky Route Zero takes this idea and runs with it.  It evokes a sense of magical realism that permeates the game, and coupled with a fantastic, slightly-pixellated-but-not-really art style that reminds me of Sword & Sworcery, launching the game is an immersive experience, one that doesn't let up until the act is over.You play as Conway, a deliveryman working for an antique company trying to find an address.  As you might imagine, getting there isn't easy, and according to several of the characters around it requires travel on the Zero, a conceptual highway.  The destination doesn't really matter in KRZ, though; as ever, it's the journey that's truly breathtaking.Between story beats you can (and I wholeheartedly recommend) just drive around the little bit of Kentucky and explore all of the different sights, abandoned buildings with weird little encounters in them.  These are where the game truly shines, the little vignettes that occur largely through text as you explore different areas.  I wouldn't want to spoil any of them, but let me just say that they're not to be missed.  Every time I finished one I felt this kind of Zen serenity, like I had just read a koan.  Finishing an act is even more overwhelming, usually with something utterly fantastic happening, and I just had to sit for a good five to ten minutes sorting through it in my head.I recommend Kentucky Route Zero, but only if you like a slow-paced, introspective, slightly weird experience,			"

												A breath of fresh air. I don't know why, but this game made me feel like I was being slowly immersed in warm water.

												For the first chapter of this game I was thinking 'wow, this is Southern Gothic like I've never seen in a game before.' I loved its aesthetic, the sound design, the little hints of Lynchian weird, but I was blown away by what it becomes. This is a slow-paced game which oozes with atmosphere and you should stroll through it. There are almost no puzzles, just a linear path you can deviate from slightly and often discover little side stories which put a smile on my face. There are dialogue choices throughout pertaining to past and present, and whether or not they have real impact on the game, KRZ really succeeds at making you FEEL like they do. With each chapter it becomes something entirely new, expanding way beyond its initial setting into some seriously bizarre and utterly original locations, and tackles some profound themes with emotional depth.  In later chapters you will take control of other characters, at times choosing one leg of the journey and forfeiting another, and it's a testament to stellar writing and sound design that character models with no real facial features can be so emotionally evocative. The sentimental scenes don't feal overwrought, the political scenes don't feal preachy, and the meta-narrative doesn't get pretentious. The storytelling here is up there with the best of adventure games and I can't wait for the final chapter.TL;DRSlow-paced, story-rich with dialogue choices and minimal gameplay mechanics. Well worth your money if you want a slow ride through Gothic Americana with added interdimensional trips, socio-economic critique, stunning music and sound design, and characters you'll fall in love with			"

												Lovely game, it's surreality and hauntedness is of the quiet, calm, peaceful sort with a bit of bittersweet curled up inside it.It really is more of a story than a game which mostly works, but there are just enough alternate responses that will make you curious about how things could have gone that are just far enough in that they'd be difficult to revist, so it's mixed. Still, mostly works.Do explore. Most of the extra locations are just color, but they add to the not-quite-a-dream feel.			"

												One playthrough of the first two acts will not be enough for those who want to have more than a peek at the title, and maybe discover all of its layers. There’s bleakness to Act II, but also charm. And most importantly it allows you to interpret it in the manner you see most fit. Right now, I can tell you that by the time all five acts are released, Kentucky Route Zero will have earned its place next to titles such as Limbo, Bastion or To the Moon in the hall of independent games that deserve a spot of their own.

												This is a game I went into with some skepticism as the indie trailer didn't impress me much beyond the ethereal background music, which is hauntingly entrancing. But as I started to play the game and mender through the lives of the characters who you come across (and occassionally play as), I started to get drawn into the claim that the journey is more than the final destination: that is Kentucky Route Zero. From the 80s/90s graphics that reminded me of Another World and Flashback, through to the sublime music that fit the scene every step of the way and the devilish surprises that you notice on repeated playthroughs of the game, so much is more than it seems.This is not a fast paced game. This is not an action-adventure and barely has any puzzle elements at all. The closest games this reminded me of is Home and The Path, where psychology is the game and what choices you make say just as much about you as about the characters you lead on the way to Kentucky Route Zero.It's about as indie as it gets. And just like Home and The Path, I recommend that you buy a season pass and play it; but I also caution you that with only two acts of five released right now it could turn into a game you're not liking at the end.EDIT @ 2014-02-23:With the game development having been stuck on only two acts released since my initial review from six months ago, I must add an additional caution that the game may have fallen into development hell. While I still recommend this game based on what I've played so far, if the game really is cancelled and left as incomplete I will be just as upset as everyone else.			"

												Breathe the Road.Those 3 words right there can summarize Kentucky Route Zero better than any review or description can, but I can try.Kentucky Route Zero is a point n click adventure game without the puzzles. So whats left? The world to explore, interesting characters, and an incredible story. Each inch of this game drips with personality and care that it draws you into its backwards world and makes you hunger for more.The only problem is: right now there isn't more. At the time of writing only 2 out of the promised 5 acts are out, but that's OK, because each act gives you a LARGE map to explore and things to do. AND hidden on their website (Google search this game, I'm sure you'll find it), are 2 side episodes made in between each episode.Kentucky Route Zero is an incredibly crafted game with incredibly detailed sound design, unbelievable writing, and a visual style that looks simple at the first glance, but becomes insanely detailed the closer you look.I highly recommend it to anyone, fans of adventure games or not.

												Absoultely the most unique and interesting game I've ever played, - weird, beautiful, eerie and engrossing. The way the game mixes its story telling and perspective is really unusual and something only a game can do. You start playing as a character and get used to that being 'you' then later shift to playing other characters interacting with 'yourself'. Other examples incude playing as characters describing in the past tense what your characters have done and playing everything through a game within the game! Its hard to explain but works incredibly well. Love that its giving me a Twin Peaks vibe and cannot wait for the last 2 episodes.			"

												KRZ is surreal, poignant, nostalgic, and philosophical without being heavy-handed or pretentious about it. Its characters and world feel as lived-in as people and places from a quiet back-country-Americana town, surrounded by endless stretches of humid wilderness, should feel. The poetic nature of the game's writing, the way it ebbs and flows between the here-and-now, and the fading memories and dreams of the characters' past, their interior thoughts and feelings and being which you subtly shape through dialogue choices, all of it makes something as esoteric as the musings of a retired university researcher on the metaphysical features of computer software and simulated intelligence influenced by the growth of black mold sound completely natural to this world, and completely human. Every character is as complex and changing and permanent as any real person, and while they do a lot of talking (which means you do a lot of reading), we are only ever shown how these people think and feel by the way the remember things, describe experiences, and interact with each other, much like we learn in real life.A lot of time and love obviously went into the evocative quality of the writing, visual, and sound design of KRZ. It is dream-like, it is melancholy, it is hopeful, and vague, and raw, much like reading a poem you don't fully understand yet completely feel, or thinking back on a dream or a memory that you don't remember the details of, but the emotions still linger with you.Play KRZ if you are willing to sit back, to read, and to take it slow.

												I had heard such good things about this game so that made me even more disappointed when I finally played it. There seems to be a fanatic cult following for it but I don't understand why. It is not a very good game. It started out really cool and interesting... BUT then it quickly became a bore. The nuance dies out pretty quickly in this game and before you know it, it just becomes a chore to go anywhere. You play as one of the slowest moving characters of any game ever, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if there were actually cool things to look at, but unfortunately, you get sick of the stark boring environments pretty quickly. They could have made this game so much more. It is just too bad it turned out the way it did. Do NOT buy this game at $24.99, a total rip off. I wouldn't buy this game for anything more than $8.00 (actually I wouldn't but this game at all). It simply isn't worth the asking price. It just ends up a boring game.			"

												This game looks awesome. The graphics are so original, but then the gameplay just sucks and it's no fun at all. It's super confusing and seems to have no comprehensable story. The worst thing is that it plays like an old MS-DOS text-adventure you just listen to completely randomly seeming dialogs (in text form) and you can decide answers but you cant really make out if these answers have any effect or meaning. To me it got so boring after not even an hour of playing that I decided to delete the game. It's just reading endless texts which seem rather pointless and random and you feel like oh please can I move and do something, but when you can do something it's just moving around a bit if you're lucky. Don't buy it unless you love reading pointless♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												We will likely colonize Mars before this game gets close to complete. It's been 5 months since the developers said Act 4 was ""almost done"" and almost two years since the last act was released. I get that they're a tiny studio, but this game is dead in the water, and I really regret spending money on it.			"

												I bought this game on sale ages ago and it lasted me two hours. It clearly states in the description ""The remaining three acts will be released over the coming year"". This is clearly not the case since there hasn't even been an update on episode 3, do not give these scam artists your money and spend it on a better game. Do not waste £20 on a two hour games which probably won't even be finished. As soon as the year is over i will be requesting a refund over false advertisment of this horrible excuse for a game.			"

												One of the most boring, pretentious and pointless ""games"" I have played in over 20 years of gaming. Extremely slow, dull, plodding with no valid content or point. Drags forever, has nothing to say and is a typical highly overrated arty-farty turd.It has some nice songs, which you can listen to on Youtube but for the love of life, save your money, time and sanity and stay away from this pile of hipster dung.

												Wow, I am most surprised at the poor quality of this game.  The idea is there, spooky story telling, smooth animations, and beautiful art, but every ten minutes or so, one of the game's files would run into a fatal error and crash, forcing me to restart my computer.  The game is (at the moment) seperated into two acts with five scenes in each one, there is no saving, if you quit while playing you must restart at the beginning of the scene, so when that fatal error that I was talking about happens, all of your progress in the scene is lost which is very frustrating.  However it's not THAT big of a negative because the scenes only takearound five minutes to complete leading to a combined playtime of about one hour.  Now in my opinion a game plagued with a fatal bug, that is unable to save, and last about an hour... really isn't worth 25 dollars!  This game feels like a free flash game, in fact I am surprised it isn't.  You may notice that when purchasing you are buying the season's pass,  that is because there are three more acts planned to be released... and... oh wait... they were supposed to release Act III eight months ago and they haven't even explaned why the delay.  The developers are flat out gready and unreliable producing one of the most overpriced indie games I have seen on Steam.  I bought Kentucky Route Zero for the story, and yes they nailed the spooky atmosphere, but it really throws you into the middle of something without knowing what the heck is going on.  I have noticed many untied mysteries that are making the game (that I was expecting to be very good and profesional) more and more disapointing.  On the bright side when you are actually playing and not crashing, you can be sure to enjoy excellent sound design, and smoooth animations and art.  Unfortunately that is more or less the only thing you CAN enjoy.  For a free flash game that isn't plagued with a bug I give it 9/10.  For a $25 scam of a game I give it 2.5/10.			"

By Act 3 I was just clicking through dialogue just trying to get to the end of the story.  I quit when at one point (ironically) there is a computer in the game story simulating an old text game like zork.  So here I am clicking through a crappy text game inside a crappy game.

												I can't get into this game, I like games with story, heck I loved day of the tentacle and the telltale games, the dig, there are a bunch of, sadly msotly older, point and click adventures out there that makes you hunger for more, but this game is simply..boring.For example the first guy you meet you can randomly ask him if he likes poetry, that makes no sense at this stage of the conversation, however later one you find out he uses peotry as a password, the longest password in the existance of mankind I guess, nothing you do or say seems to change the outcome either, sure you can give your dog a name and gender, but it has no impact on what is happening, sure you can create your ""own"" story along, but I still have the feeeling that nothing matters.What is worse is that I have the feeling this game is the classic ""you were dead all along"" you can visit a crashsite if you drive were you came from and your character even muses about how ""atleast it wasn't us"" then people disappearing in seconds, the hard cuts that take away all immersion just to potray another titlecard to show you a new act began.The game doesn't have the draw for me, I have the feeling at the end its just going to be a boring cliche ending, because I do not trust the writters to come up with something original and because of that I'm simply not willing to invest more time into it.

												Oh my god.I want to say first off that I really don't like walking simulators...and this game is that.  However...I haven't had a game really tug at my heartstrings quite like this.You see, I'm a big fan of Americana, and ""old timey"" American culture and nostalgia.  It's part of my thing as a fan of history.  I first got into this game by the sunset over Equis Oil, months ago.  My first exposure to this game was some article on Rock Paper Shotgun.  I had it on my Wishlist for awhile.  THen I finally get it, and I finally play it.  Wow!  There's just a lot about the game that works for me on a lot of levels.  The atmosphere, the setting, the music and the narrative really do a number on me when I generally stay far away from this genre.Yeah...I think this game isn't for everyone, but for me the factors were right for me to love this game.  I'd give it a try for the atmosphere if you're someone like me.			"

												KRZ has all the promise of a great game, it just needs to be finished. Perhaps this should really be classified as Early Access, as it's not finished and you can't buy each episode separately? It's been a long time since the last episode was released with no word of when the next one is coming (if it still is). The game (or at least what has been finished thus far) is great. It's stylish and intriguing. It's not action packed, but that's not a bad thing either. If it were a finished game, I'd have no problem recommending it. For now, unless you're made of money or don't mind an unfinished story I can't recommend KRZ.			"

												Edit: Acy IV did come out, and it was excellent. I now feel like V will be, too.It's a pity the last two chapters are extremely unlikely to appear now. I paid full price and only feel slightly put out, and that only because the first three chapter are so very good. Buy it regardless, dim the lights and play it with headphones on.This game has given me some of the best moments in my gaming. It actually manages to capture that dream state where the world is magical and urgent and panicky, and you run in circles after an errand that keeps getting in its own way, and the world sort of makes sense if you don't examine it closely, but isn't your daily world at all. That's the best I can describe the feeling - this game makes you experience it. Every so often some little set piece just takes your breath away, then you look around and realise you were really *gone*: zoned out. It's beautiful.			"

												I'd seen stuff about this game over and over and decided on a free evening to download it and play it.  I sat down alone in my apartment, plugged in some headphones, and started.  That was the beginning of one of the more beautiful adventures I've been on.This game isn't like most games.  It's gameplay entails nothing more than clicking and moving your character(s).  You are a truck driver making his last delivery, with nothing but your dog by your side, and the sounds of the road to accompany you.  The people you meet are each unique, some are nice, some are mysterious, but each has their own personality.  The few hours I spent in this game had me confused, mystified, and uneasy at points.  But I felt a sensation of calm throughout.  Only 3 of the 5 acts are out so far, so I can't speak for how the story has or will change me.  But even if the story ends up disappointing in the end, the real reason to get this game is for the journey.  To drive around Kentucky on a late afternoon and watch the sunset fall, to listen to the cars driving by the highway, to stop in a diner and talk to the waitress, to listen to the sounds of bluegrass bands play soothing and thoughtful music.  And most of all, to explore and experience this myterious world.  This game is a work of art, through and through.I'd highly recommend this game.  It's not a life changing experience, it's not the best game you'll ever play.  Hell, maybe you'll only play it once and never touch it again.  But sit yourself down with headphones for an evening, with a hot cup of tea or coffee, and just experience the calming adventure of Kentucky Route Zero.  There are few people who will be able to tell me it wasn't money well spent just for a beautiful experience.			"

												So this is an interesting one...Kentucky Route Zero is a very abstract, chilling, beautiful, well written, brilliant, emotional, confusing, mesmerizing journey. I wouldn't try to describe the story for two reasons:1. Story is affected by your choices2. It is open to interpretationI have seen this game described as lynch-esque. A statement I will have to agree with. I wouldn't be surprised to find out ""Lost Highway"" has been an inspiration to this game. This is actually more than just a game... It is an experience. Definitely, not for everyone. But if you are looking for one of the most absolutely stunning and breathtaking experinces you can get, get it right away. If you are looking for ""action"" or some mindblowing mechanics, you would probably want to stay away. But if you care for the story, and decide to dive into it, I can promise you, that playing this on my bed at 3 am, in a dark room, is just an experience I can hardly even begin to describe. Some scenes in particular are just beyond breathtaking... they are an experience on their own. Art wise and direction wise, the way the developers chose to emphasize certain things and dialogs, the way the story unfolds in different ways, to me, is not short of brilliant.It plays out in a unique way, which, to me, reminded me of fever dreams I had. When your forehead is boiling at 38 degrees, and you stay at home, sleeping, in a doozy state, as your mind drifts apart, floating in abstract, unclear settings...It is majestic, nostalgic, chilling, mesmerizing, breathtaking, and probably worth your time.The only thing that keeps it from being featured on my Steam profile is the fact that it's not fully released yet, as 2 more chapters are slowly making their way into the game. But I can with a full heart say that at its current state, it is worth it - or at the very least feels worth it, for me.			"

It's about meeting and understanding creative characters in gorgeous places, with flawless sound design. It feels like a dream, a fascinating dream to explore and wonder about.KRZ doesn't require precision or reflection, it only asks for your attention.Give it a try alone at night, with a hot beverage and headphones...

While the game itself doesn't broker many skills nor choices, the creators do a masterful job of generating isolated moments of awe, just like a good story does—moments where I find myself simply staring at the screen and savoring the sounds, music, or stylized graphics. Creative, interesting, and always straddling some invisible line between creepy and sublime.			"

												Understand this first...Kentucky Route Zero is one of the most thrilling games to grace our consciousness. Act I and Act II give a taste... where Act III ups the ante. The series tantalates a true notion of gravitas. We are left in awe of a promise that I would not dare to follow. And here is were the ""season pass"" fails us. To promise a game with no transparency to its progress...lets all give a game the 'benefit of the doubt'. I truely hope this game breaks my now hightened expectiations of a game I payed for to deliver. What a burden to place on the makers. In a hopeful stance, I think this game will actually envigorate and push the envelope to a degree not seen. All that said, I think independents will think twice committing to a massive flow of 'pre-committment'  money before going forward.			"

Can see why people are annoyed about lack of urgency from the developers, but there could be a multitude of reasons fo this. They are a small company (only producing one game so far, I believe) and this game is art, which shouldn't be rushed. So, give it a go and try not to get lost.			"

												An effervescent antidote to gaming's recursive formalism and preoccupation with mechanics. Playful without twee pandering, KR0 never cheapens its surrealism with the merely zany. The game brims with a nuanced and sincere engagement with art and humanity that flies in the face of the self-involvement that seems to define gaming culture in its current adolescent state.(Bonus: it's less pretentious than this review!)

												You've got to walkThat lonesome valleyYou've got to walk it by yourselfThere's no one hereThat can go there with youYou've got to walk it by yourself...Let me get it out of the way that this is a very straightforward adventure game, to the point that I would call it an interactive story, rather than an adventure game.  It is still phenomenal and should not be missed.The Great Recession, from which Boomers and Millenials still bear scars, sets the stage for Kentucky Route Zero.  Conway is a lone truck driver with nothing to his name but his aging dog, working one last delivery for an antique shop.  The delivery goes to an address he cannot find, which requires finding the enigmatic highway, Kentucky Route Zero, which is the only highway that goes *under* the state.  On the way he meets Shannon, a woman whose family has been ruined by the local coal mine closing down.  Together they find the highway.  And well, things get strange.Basic polygonal artwork is used to an incredible effect, combining fog, lighting and basic visual effects to create a dark, gloomy depiction of the deep south.  Music is miniumal and atmospheric, until bluegrass singers add to the mood at perfect moments.  There are no voices other than the singing, and dialog is entirely text based, telling a story combining fantastical Americana with crushing tales of the American Nightmare historical and modern.  A majority of the adult characters are crushed by debt and financial troubles, a recurring theme.The story is five chapters, only three are available and the fourth is now being teased.  The team is only an indie studio of two, and this deserves support.  It is not long, and each chapter will leave you wanting more.  Buy this, turn the lights low, enjoy the journey and think about your life while you do it.			"

												  As of writing this, well I've got 14 minutes on the game, and that's all I can get. The game has a bug where you can't do anything right off the beginning point. Thus, how can I review a game I can't play? Devs haven't chimed in on my discussion thread with a resolution. I wish I could get a refund but probably too late at this point. A game I cannot do anything would be equivalent to a brick, or coaster if I had a physical copy of it. Thanks for that.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!I bought Kentucky Route Zero over a year ago upon hearing that the game will be soon finishing act IV of its V act series of episodic content soon....One year later and they are still making that very same promise.I have not intended to even play this game until it was fully finished, but I bought it during a steam sale thinking that it would be done soon.  That was my mistake, don't make the same one yourself.How does the game play?  No clue, as I said I wanted the FULL EXPERENCE before starting on it.  Because it doesn't matter how good the game is, how well thought out the story is, or how well designed it all is... if it is never finished.  It would be like watching the first two lord of the rings movies and never getting to watch the third movie.  And since they originally promised to have this game finished at the end of 2013.  Well you can do the math. Buy this game if you believe in the lottery.  Because that is what this feels like, buying a lottery ticket and waiting week after week for your number to come up.  Your mind will tell you that it has to eventually right?  That there is only a set amount of actual numbers available in the set and your will have to come up sometime right?  That with enough time and patience you will finally win that jackpot!The fact is it will never happen.   The truth is they already have your money and all they have to do is keep spinning you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to keep you waiting and waiting while they do nothing.  All the while taking money from more and more people who walk in and see everyone else waiting with baited breath for their number to arrive. And to those hopefuls that go check to see if act IV is done and learn that sometime after I've posted this review it has been finished... remember that they took years to finish that fouth act... how long do you think they will take to finish the last act exactly?  And then buy your lottery ticket and join the rest of us in waiting.  (I would get a refund if I could but I bought it before that became a feature).Oh and if you think about complaining in the forum; don't.  The loyal hopefuls will shout you down and developers will ignore you.And Yes; I did leave this play for 10 minutes to write this review.  I was that annoyed that they conned me out of my money. "

												Click click click.... that's all you do. I read someone question if this game was a glorified flash animation, and I believe that to be pretty accurate. I read a lot of reviews celebrating this game and it's writing, but to be honest, it's extremely boring, and the writing isn't great. It may be better written than Call of Duty, but the story is attempts to manufacture mystery by bewildering the player with almost arbitrary dialog. At no point was I drawn in or dying to play on. The incessant prompts for making pointless choices, none of which I care to choose, have frustrated me to the point I had to stop playing the game. The best aspects of this game is the visual style and the music (atmosphere). I'm literally only still playing it because I paid for it.			"

												I love The Walking Dead by Telltale, i love the ""not a game"" game Gone Home, i love Life is Strange. To say it simple, i love games that focus more on characters and are more calm than the mainstream action games. But this game is not calm, it's boring and confusing. Yes it's art but it's just not my cup off tea with dialogues that are more like a poetry contest and a story, that is buried deep down beneath a ton of weird characters, locations and events.And the game needs voice actors...All in all, it has a great artstyle, but the lack of well developed characters and a too confusing story make the currently 4 hour long trip (yes, the 3 currently available acts last only 4 hours in total) not worth the money.Let's hope they turn up the pace and make act 4 and 5 more interesting.Until then, i can't recommend it, sadly.

												I have to agree with some prior reviews, playing this game is like dreaming, it's interesting making so much sense and no sense, so as-a-matter-of-factly that you can't help but continue the story. You craft it and it happpens in the past, present, and future simultaneously. Brilliantly done. I put this down and picked it up to play it WHEN THE TIME SUITED. There is no need to rush through this game at all, in fact it's deliberately fast and slow when it needs to be, but to truely enjoy this game, play it when you feel between things or overwhlemed. It's a calming, intriguing experience. Yeah it has only 3 of the 5 Acts supposedly out, but to be honest, with a game like this, I kind of don't need closure because the experience is in the journey and the state thats achieved with the first 3 Acts. Dreams don't have definitive beginnings or ends, there's really just what you get out of what you did know you experienced, right? Can...wait for the next Acts.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero successfully created a complexed yet fascinating atmosphere. To me, this “Game” is more like an experiment for the theme “Art of games”. It has borrowed and saluted lots of great author’s masterpieces like Borges and Marquez, and insofar I’ve already had a vague feeling about the type of philosophy its team had put into, which reminds me the type Nietzsche and Wittgenstein held and suggested, along with lots of classic philosophical problems like “Xanadu” in Chapter Three related to the problem of free will and lots of skeptical arguments. Whereas this game is great even if you play it without any thoughts and just experiencing the story line. It has a strange, mysterious atmosphere provided by the co-operation of its music, gameplay, plotline, characters and the way it chose to present all of it. If you are a fan of literature or occasionally likes to think some serious philosophical problems… this game is your must-buy. If you heard about this game from some lonesome, nerdy and pathetic friend (who happens to be just like me) and just curious about how this game works, then I seriously suggest you go YouTube first and check it out, the gameplay could be tedious for some type of players who likes straightforward style and spend this extra bucks on a game you don’t like couldn’t do you any favor. Even if you found you like it after finished the whole gameplay… It’s OK! Chapter five hasn’t been published and this game is great for play through several times!Summary: 10/10 for experienced players who enjoys art, literature or philosophy.7~8/10 for players who curious about stuff I mentioned above 2~3/10 for the opposite type of player who I personally think will just reckon this as tedious and boring-as-****. Strongly recommended for the former two types of player to GO BUY IT. You will not regret!			"

												Hi there! I absolutely adore KR0, and I want to lend any of you that are on the fence some clarity on things people are saying, some advice, and lastly, my thoughts. 1. Acts Taking A Long Time To Put Out - Yes, this is a thing that's happening, and we all really hate waiting. However, KR0 is detailed, complex, and very thorough, so I'd imagine it would take a very long time to produce something of its caliber. As well, Cardboard Computer supplies fans with material proving they're working hard on their Twitter, so follow them if you want to stay hyped. 2. Pacing Within Episodes - I'm a really impatient person. That's just who I am. So, when I first played through, there were days when KR0 got on my nerves for being so wordy. What did I do? I closed the game, played something else, and then when I felt more patient and peaceful, I opened it back up and really enjoyed a complete, immersive experience.3. Things I Like - The music is pretty darn great. Three thumbs up out of two. Writing, of course, is poetic and enchanting. Atmosphere blends emotional response with underlying calmness. Characters are lovable as all heck. (Extra: Their names are all quite memorable, which makes things really nice and easy.) Art direction and emotion-based scenery choices are all really tasteful for the kind of story the game is telling. 4. Things I Dislike - I have a natural distaste for point-and-click games. My index finger gets tired, the sound of the clicking gets on my nerves, and it just results in me not being able to play. However, the controller integration is complete, purposeful, and well done, which made *all* the difference. All in all, if you need an atmosphere to hang out in, or if you need escape, enchantment, enlightening, Equus Oils, or giant eagles, then I'd suggest giving this game a look. Get ready to be swept away.			"

												This game is by far one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.It is a mystery game, but not a bit cruel. Even the music blends perfectly in. You don't even miss the voices; it feels perfectly natural to read and click screen messages,I played through chapter 1, 2 and 3 and could not wait for chapter 4 to arrive.Unfortunately, I can't seem to follow the story anymore. Up to chapter 3 there was a complex, but interesting story unfolding. But I haven't yet found the story within chapter 4. It all seems a meaningless bunch of gibberish, and so I could not make my mind up if I should play it any longer. It's a shame, but I have the feeling the great potential of chapter 1 to 3 has just been thrown away. What a pity.			"

												Because this game is a point and click, it pretty much relies entirely on its presentation and its story. The former is great mix of Americana and a sort of modernized 16-bit-ish art style.  The story though--honestly, it isn't good. It isn't coherent. There are some great set pieces, but four acts in, the game keeps adding new plotlines without resolving things that were brought up in any of the previous acts. There is a chance that Act 5 will tie things up, or that a full playthrough would make easier to understand, but at this point I'm not going to hold my breath on it.			"

												Beautiful and haunting adventure: took me four hours to complete all three acts. Be warned that there's a fair bit of clicking involved: hardly much keyboard use. Not being from Kentucky / Appalachia, if there are any local allusions to life / death / whatnot, I'll have to go look those up: otherwise it seems like there's two stories in this (the protagonist, and the love-triange supporting the mold-computer).

												Ignore the casuals who can't deal with the fact that art takes time.This game is a work of art. It's not done yet. There are other things to do while it is being finished.If you appreciate the obscure, the surreal, or the mysterious, buy this game.If you appreciate intricate stories, unique ways of representing ideas that are only possible in the video game medium, and characters with backgrounds deeper than you might first realize, buy this game.This game is about discovering what lies underneath Kentucky. Despite what other say, it will make sense, if you use your head.I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to be amazed.			"

												Okay it is time to call out all of the pretentious fools out there who are claiming this is a ""masterpiece"".I don't believe any of you.  I fully believe that we are caught in the basic trap where just because something is mysterious and ""Lynchian"", that we fall down all over ourseleves trying to claim how great it is.  JI will give the game credit where it's due.  The graphics are beautiful.  The mood it evokes works for a while until you realize it is all one big ""red herring"".The bottom line is this....the game is boring and is a chore to get through.  I am not one of those people who needs everything spelled out and for everything to be wrapped up nicely.  But there is just no sense to be made of the endless dialouge in this game.  It was clearly written to make you think it is more profound than it really is.  I feel no urgency playing through this.  I feel like my decisions mean nothing.  It is just a long slog to get from one scene to the next.Keep it.  Give me a Telltale Game anyday.			"

												An inviting narrative expeirence that you won't be able to find anywhere else...so far. From what i've played, its simple and light on gameplay, but heavy on delivering a strong story that you will always feel engadged in. You can also develop the personalities of your characters, which gives different possibilities to the one road to Route Zero.

												You either love it or hate it. I can't but hate it. I know there must be a lot of people who appreciate this type of game and find it appealing from the get go but for me it has been nothing but grinding of teeth from the start. It's a text adventure with an abstract art to support the ""narrative"". If you enjoy poetry, going to modern art exhibitions and overall being ""in and philosophical"" with art world and have deep thoughts of how colour blue might taste like, this might be for you. In that case I also recommend movies like Mulholland Drive and Norwegian Wood. What comes to my personal tastes, these types of products just make me unreasonably angry. Yes I get the meaning behind symbolic meanings and ""art is in beholders eye"" I just don't agree they are good idea to have. Especially when it comes with cost of being a game.  I guess it comes down to having so few gameplay elements in it and being more of a interactive fiction. I never enjoyed walls of text, especially when I feel like it's absolutely meaningless what you do in the game and are just in for some weird art exhibition.So far game has had few high points, but not nearly enough to survive past what can be described as computer demo-scene art from 90's. /end of rant "

												I'll start by saying the visuals and music are good (mostly)As for gameplay...well there's none. You click to move and choose sialogue choices. However these dialogue choices don't seem to matter at all. Rocks fell on you? Either say: I'm Okay or My leg is stuck. Either choice will have your leg stuck. There are no puzzles either and no exploration.And then there's the story... what story? You are just told random things you need to do because X says to, with no real goal or sense in the matter. It's like someone got high on cocaine then decided to write a script after taking some acid as well.Imagine a visual novel where all your dialogue choices are the same and the story makes no sense and you get this game.

												It's been said before, but this is not a game, but I'll use the word for this review. I do not dispute that many people enjoyed this game - but I want to tell you how the average gamer is going to find this title.  First let me say that for the first act you are intent on solving the mystery of Kentucky Route Zero. Unfortunately by the time you are almost finished the game occasionally someone asks ""so hey, should we figure out the mystery about Kentucky Route Zero?"" That being said,  I've got about 30 offline hours invested.This game is interesting, but not for playable reasons. If you were to fill a bucket with random ideas and random places, then draw them out at random you would get the plot of this game. Let me give you a for instance - without it being actually in the game: 'You stop at a factory. There is a cat. The cat sits by a wall. The wall reminds you of your childhood friend Bob who died while shoveling dung in a chicken house. The walls resemble feathers. ""This here chicken comes from Route Zero, so you should try to find it"". You can't leave yet because a houseboat has a broken VCR. etc etc etc.'At first this game comes off as mysterious and brilliant - but much like the tv show LOST - no one has a clue where the story is supposed to be going, it's just a bunch of random dialog with a few connecting keywords to make you think there is some continuity. This isn't a smart game, it's not particularly entertaining or even visually interesting beyond the opening scene. Why the rave reviews? I don't know. Save yourself some frustration and READ THE DESCRIPTION because that is EXACTLY what you get - partial, unconnected character backstories that have nothing to do with the game play and do not move the story forward - in fact it is safe to say that other than what is in the title, there is no actual story here. I'll say it again for clarity - THE DESCRIPTION BELOW IN ""ABOUT THIS GAME"" IS THE ENTIRE GAMEPLAY and nothing new will be added. Once you have read it, do not expect any additional story. Should you play it? I'd say check it out on youtube and see if you can stomach the no-progress gameplay. If so, sure, spend $3 or $4 on it.  You know the people who go to art galleries and stare at a painting of an orange circle and spout things like ""Oh you can just feel the underlying tension of the artist and his statement that society is nothing more than a futile attempt at sexualizing the earth"" etc etc? Well, those guys made this game.Cheers.			"

												Wasted another 2 hours of my life on this last night. I honestly don't know why I bother - I guess it's just morbid curiosity about why the 4th instalment had taken so long. I can only assume it's down to logistics and/or laziness because the latest episode isn't anywhere near as ambitious as previous instalments. I think it's possible that I didn't see some of the 'scenes' because you're given a choice of what to do, but when one of said choices involves loading VHS tapes into a VCR and reading text descriptions of what is being viewed then I'm not especially compelled to find out what the alternative is. This series represents the absolute height of pretentiousness IMHO and I will only tolerate it because at the very least it respects my time. Roll on the final episode so I can be rid of it forever. Avoid this series at all costs. There are so many better things you could do with your time.			"

												This isn't a game. This is interactive fiction. You make characters walk around and talk to each other, and that is Kentucky Route Zero in its entirety. And it's not just because it's a point-and-click. I've played and enjoyed other PAC games like Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, and the Deponia series. This game just has almost no gameplay at all. Think of it as a reverse Mario game. Instead of lots of gameplay and minimum story, this has bare minimum gameplay and lots of story. If like ""games"" like that, then by all means get this. But if you want something beyond clicking little bubbles to start the next block of text, skip this game.			"

												Unfortunately i will have to vote this one down. The locations are very interesting and in-game atmosphere is pretty good, but that's about it. Starts off very promising and could have been a REALLY good adventure game but:- The writing is not great.- There is no story to this game, just atmosphere. Few very generic side stories.- There is no progression, just random ""happenings"".- Nothing in this game makes any sense and nothing is explained. - Dialogue lacks depth, just random and unrelated text most of the time.I'm not sure what the aim of this game was from the point of the developers or writers. It could have been great if there was a story but there is none. You go to random unrelated locations with random unrelated stories within them that are just way too generic to be interesting. Definitely not worth the 10$ on sale, maybe for 2-3$ it would be worth checking the art. To devs: add a story to the next series, something like True Detective, and you will have a winner here. Also, stop smoking  so much weed. *Game may be a lot of fun for people with high consumption of drugs.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game, but a couple hours in and I'm so very bored.  The artwork is great, and normally I like this sort of game (I played all the way through ""To the Moon"" which is basically an interactive 8-bit story) but it's just so slow and brooding.  Ok, so everyone is dead and the main character is in some sort of purgatory I'm guessing, so what?  What is the point?  Artwork is incredible, ambiance is amazing, story/gameplay... just didn't grab me.			"

												I am aghast at the ""Very Positive"" reviews of this ""game."" I mean, has everybody drunk some Kool-aid or something?It's a ridiculous amount of effort, wrapped in a terrible UI, to work your way through bits of what is really a pathetically simplistic story line. And you're going to end up with... well, not very much. It's like, ""Nothing to see here. Move along.""Really? This was a ""game"" the people literally waited YEARS to have additional ""acts"" developed? Wowwww. That's patience and dedication.Much more than I have to devote to finishing the whole mess! I got really tired somewhere into Act IV.Maybe there's some grand ""payoff"" at the end, but it can't possibly be worth the ""trip"" to get there. Have I mentioned that the interface is TERRIBLE? THIS is what we're calling ""art"" now?Click. Call the elevator.Click.

Absence of ambiental music and sounds and, when music sounds is just horrible.Story line is somewhat discontinous and disconnected, paradoxical and absurd.Every little conversation has several options for answer. Maybe it changes which Act follows but, I don't feel in the willing of repeat the game more than once to 'enjoy' the several branches of the story.			"

												I wish I could give this an ""ok"" recommendation, but giving the yes/no choices I have to go with no. The main reason is the whopping price. To me the game appears something that could be easily made at home with generic text boxes/font. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to get around and where to even go. I would give this a ""yes"" recommendation if it were free and that you understood its a basic looking side scroller game. While I was playing it I was interested in the story, however I personally dont have much time to play games and would rather play something more high-end. I might come back to this game in the future if I had a time or a crappy laptop becuase the story is interesting.			"

												Meh- Art is kinda cool in a way... some people have said they liked the slow, ""magical"" gameplay... It brings back memories of Myst, except there are acually some people characters in this game. Still, the game feels a little lonely and slow for my taste. I don't feel that there are any real decisions in the game. Even the ""choices"" you can make in the dialog pretty much seem like they will lead to the same end result and/or storyline. The gameplay really just revolves around you moving a charactar back and forth to reveal more of the simple story, or the next peice of the path along this route. It's a little interestng. And also wierd. I'm not sure if I'll play past the first act or not, but I'll be taking a break from it.			"

												This game is a huge mess packaged in a nice style.It's like a hipsterish fontdesigner had a stroke, and this stroke got mixed with dementia and written down as the story of this game. It starts storylines, introduces characters and events sometimes randomly and then they abruptly end... or just show up again. Or get mixed with other storylines.  The gameplay feels like never reaching an ♥♥♥♥♥♥, it just keeps starting and after a short time ending the stimulation, never letting you reach full satisfaction. After a while of playing it i just feel like i have to reach the end of the story, just for the sake of it. It just doesn't even feel in the slightest pleasurable anymore. Also the dynamic is not so good... the controls.. just don't work very well with the environment. Everything is too slow, it's sometimes hard to get to places because of how the environment of a level is designed, othertimes the angle of the camera is just a huge nuisance, and usually progressing is exhausting because it's just slow and very inefficient. It feels like you have to work so hard to just get an interesting scrap of the whole story. Not even the Joker would like this incoherent Chaos. 2/10 for effort i guess.			"

												Phenominal Art direction and truly enchanting atmosphere make this game such an enjoyable experience. Of course, that being said, it is definitely more of an experience than a game with controls limited to basically point and click with text dialogue selection. However, the text is masterfully crafted and adds immeasurable depth to the unique visuals and haunting atmosphere created in this game. Don't let the title put you off, this game is a one of a kind experience that leaves players pondering their actions not just in the game, but in life as well. The game feels like a waking dream if you let it and before I forget the music and ambiance are one of a kind. Branch out, take a risk, and enjoy this game. CAN""T WAIT FOR THE 3rd Episode : )			"

												[From a previously-written blog post in February, 2013.  It concerns only the first ""Episode"" and will be updated to include reflection covering the second.]Kentucky Route Zero is a point-and-click adventure game, reminiscent of recent indie success, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. It’s presented in a flat-3D sort of style, and features an ambient-y, hymn-y, bluegrass-y soundtrack.For the hour and a half after I turned out my light and sat down, I was absolutely glued to my monitor. I feel that going into details about this game would do anyone’s experience with it a disservice. Just know that it focuses a bit more on exploration than difficult puzzle solving, and from what I can tell, there’s no ‘wrong answer,’ despite having a lot of choices with some of the dialogue paths. So try to be honest with it and not worry about ‘losing.’ I know for sure that I missed at least some content on my first playthrough, so I’ll definitely be revisiting this first part of the game. I think it’s best to go into this one with as little specific expectations as possible.The first Act of Kentucky Route Zero is a charming, unnerving, and at times stressful experience, and easily my first must-play game for 2013.Also, there’s a tech-demo-turned-‘companion-piece’ available called Limits & Demonstrations floating around. It’s free, and acts as a pretty good introduction to the ‘vibe’ of Kentucky Route Zero, its gameplay, engine, and some of the internal ‘lore’ of the game world. It -might- take 10 minutes to get through, so there’s no reason not to check it out.			"

												UPDATED May 19th, 2014 (YES):Changed my point of view after playing episode 3 and remembering why I fell in love with this game. Minor spoiler: lovely music show. Simple and marvelous. Truly divine gameplay.This game is an adventure/exploration game with simple yet very stilysh graphics, no voiceover but plenty of atmosphere through music and the way it plays. Even if the technical aspects are simple, they exude lots of charm and style that really integrate well with the game´s goal. Your task is to find Route Zero and make a final deliver. During the game you are going to meet several persons and locations using your truck and a onscreen map to guide you. The way the game is drawn makes you feel like you are about to embark on a 60´s wild journey. Several things are stylized  beaultifully. Do no expect violence or quick time events or even puzzles per se. You are about to embark on a mind blowing experience.This game is so unique that you play with the perspective of several different actors playing thorugh scenes. Expect anything to happen on this fabulous world (anything really), expect several wow moments, expect to think about the significance of what is going on the screen. Great game to play alone in a quiet environment at night to enjoy the music and the game´s atmosphere. Whenever I started an episode I couldn´t stop it until its end.The only downside I can tell is that this game is supposed to be released in five episodes however it took more than an entire year between episodes 2 and 3. I would have to warn you that you will be gambling if you buy this game.because we can never know if and when we are going to get all five episodes released.ORIGINAL REVIEW (NO):I would like to start by saying that even though this game looks simple, it has a distinct artistic feeling to it and it is quite fun to play and sometimes you may even think you are high on some kind of drug. This is a point and click episodic game with plenty of atmosphere and no voice over.I cannot recommend this game because you are going to pay for five episodes and only get two of them. I am waiting for episode 3 for more than an year and I have no clue when of even if it is ever going to be released. As I am most likely stuck with an incomplete game, even if the experience is very interesting, I simply cannot recommend it.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero has the best use of atmopshere I've ever seen in a game. While most of the time atmosphere in games is equated to ""spoopy dark hallways"", KY0 uses solid, washed out colors and wide camera angles to make its world seem desolate and distant.This aesthetic lends a lot of emotional weight to the game's story about the mudane lives of people dealing with poverty. The writing is excellent, especially that of the dialogue. All of the conversation is very mellow, but hints very effectively at the unsaid ways the characters feel. The dialogue trees are also done excellently. They're not about checking off little variables and affecting the game later, they allow you to make little decisions about what kind of people the characters are. It's more like being a part of the storytelling than choosing a path.Unlike many other ""story-focused games"", KY0 has a sense of brevity. The pacing is excellent, 3 hours went by faster than a couple minutes of RPG exposition. Nothing feels cliche and every line is well-thought out. I don't think I've ever seen a game be more poigniant.This is usually where I'd say that you shouldn't get this is you're looking for a traditional game, but that's not true. You should at least try it, it's more than just a fun waste of time. The $25 price-point is a little steep, though. As of writing the game is on sale for $12.50, but that's only for a day and a half. Another thing to note is that KY0 has only has 2 of a planned 5 acts completed, and there's no guarantee the next 3 will maintain this level of quality. Still, I definately recommend it.			"

												Interactive late-night thought stimulator, not quite a game of systems, moreso a beautiful example of games in shortform--beat poetry for our usual, super-adorned and over-budgeted epics. Very George Saunders, not as much David Lynch (surreal yet not really grotesque or terrifying on any level), altogether an audiovisual treat of poetry.A sense of curiosity and some openness is all you need; familiarity with strange art and strange situations not required. Playing in the late hours with headphones is recommended, as is driving the mine tram in Act I with the lights off. Looking forward to further Acts.			"

												Three acts in and this continues to get better and stranger.  The game plays like an odd dream, constantly changing shape and presenting you with the mundane in a new situation.  At one point you're told to retune your radio until you hear something that sounds strange because of how almost familiar it is, and that's everything about this game.It's not going to be for everyone: it's slow, and I could see how someone who wasn't buying into it could find it boring or weird for weird's sake, but if you come to it with an open mind and an acceptance that you're not going to understand everything, this is an outstanding piece of fiction and an outstanding game.Act IV can't come soon enough.

												Kentucky Route Zero trancends it's genre, it's not just a Point & Click game, it is an experience. The atmosphere provides a stark and beautiful backdrop for the narrative. The adventure on which you embark is in itself both dreamlike and nightmareish making it hard to stop playing once you've taken the plunge. Not only is this an amazing game and a step that shows us that narrative gameplay is a viable option but it also shows us that episodic gameplay works as well. It's a great system to release a game with. The only painful part is waiting for the next episode but it also gives us more time to be excited about it.TLDR: 9/10; would reccomend, narrative games are sweet and so is episodic content.			"

												  Imagine if a game had the same storytelling skills as Tell Tale mixed with an impossible to re-create indie vibe. That would make the perfect game which just so happens to be a masterpiece called Kentucky Route Zero. Mix the story elements of the newer Tell Tale games like The Walking Dead, put it in a setting that resembles that of the first Alan Wake and add some indie and you get Kentucky Route Zero. With three current acts each an hour long and with the last two on the way, Kentucky Route Zero will be the best 5 hours you'll ever spend in a video game. Can't recommend this game enough. Can't wait to see what's in store in the next two acts and in this indie dev's future. Probably one of the best indie games create to date and a hard one to top. Fantastic			"

												I would definitely recommend this game. The only thing you have to know is that it's not a conventional game. It's more like a surreal interactive storytelling experience. We start the game with the objective of delivering something (we don't know what) to someone (we don't know who). The only problem is that we are lost and that we need to find the ""Zero"". So basically, the desire line of the game is about finding a way. And we soon realize that the objective is not about the delivery anymore, but just about finding ways. And you have to agree to wander off with the people that you meet on the road in order to find your way again. And it gets very strange.This game is interesting because of the advanced narrative, the master storytelling and the unique experience that it provides. It is beautiful visually, yet very simple. The soundtrack creates a warm and dreamy atmosphere. You will definitely get caught in the universe of this game.I'm not a hardcore gamer and when I play to a game, it's not about performance or achievements. It's about storytelling, visuals and characters. I like to be part of something different than my own reality. And this game is all about that, so I was very pleased.I can't wait for the next episodes to come out!PRO:- We meet characters and we feel like we really share an adventure with them.CON:- Our choices never seem to have real consequences on the game, other than building our own perception of what we're doing (which I guess is the point of the game). So far, we have the feeling that we are progressing, but we don't know if it's towards a resolution, because the mystery only gets thicker. And I wonder how it will unfold. The risk with a surreal narrative is that an abstract adventure could lead to an abstract conclusion. But there is no need to speculate as the rest of the game is yet to be released! And I am definitely hooked. 9/10 "

												If you want a ""game"" that really sticks with you months after you've played it you want this game. I can talk up the art style or the pacing or the seriousness with which you'll shape your characters (yeah, you control the personalities of characters...I don't know if this changes the plot but committing to one choice over another will change you) or the occasionally breathtaking sound but I won't.I'll just say that this is one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had and that I've never seen anything else like it, plus we get three more episodes of surprises. If you're a stickler for actual challenge or the dollar/hour ratio or other soulless criteria you might hate this game, so bug off. If you're a fan of unique and personal experiences and burnt out on doing the same-old-same-old in games and just need a mental break, and you don't own this, you have a problem and you need to fix it with Kentucky Route Zero.

It's a story based game with some amazing audio (sounds/music) and a very unique graphics style that is easy to love.

												As a Kentuckian and a patron of the arts, Kentucky Route Zero has quickly become one of my favorite indy games. One part existentialist play, one part art piece, and one part point-and-click adventure, it's incredible how much this one game manages to pack in without being too much to handle. Every part of the game is in-depth and interesting from the conversations, the interactive ""sets"", and the characters themselves. The minimalist art design and the vague, often melancholy/mysterious dialogue compliment each other perfectly giving the game its signature feel which is really undescribable. Upon multiple playthroughs, one finds that the different conversation choices available can drastically change the experience and mood of the game; not from the technical standpoint but more the emotional experience of the player.While not a fast or necessarily exciting game gameplay-wise, various types of interesting and fun gameplay are introduced early on and continue throughout the different acts of KRZ. Examples of these gameplay styles being the character-oriented gameplay, travel gameplay, and perhaps the most fascinating of all, traveling on the Zero. These gameplay styles tie into the story which is exciting in its complexity and immersiveness, new sub-plots are constantly introduced keeping the game fresh. The often loose ends of these sub-plots, mentioned briefly perhaps in a passing conversation, give the characters depth and mystery. I find myself lost within the world of KRZ every time I play and am almost tempted to drive out on the highways featured within the game (highways I know well) to see if I can find the Zero and explore it myself. 10/10The additional ""mini games"" free for download, Limits and Demonstrations and The Entertainment, are both equally as intriguing as KRZ itself. While very fast to play, they provide small pieces of possibly important exposition which can be found referenced within KRZ if the player pays attention. The blending of storytelling throughout various games/time periods is genius. Both of these free games contain the same gameplay mechanics of KRZ so they are easy to jump right into after playing the main game. Definitely worth downloading and playing if you have a few minutes and want to expand your knowledge of the KRZ universe.The script for The Entertainment is available for purchase in paperback for a very low price. I bought it and love having a piece of the KRZ universe that I can hold in my hands and read. Really fascinating.			"

But the production, and in particular the sound design is absolutely incredible. There's some particularly amazing sound design in the mines in the first act, and then while driving in the second act. Also, the old folk songs played by silhouettes invoke an around-the-campfire ambience.Incredible game, through and through. Cannot recommend more.			"

												A staggeringly atmospheric work; an adventure game that's grown up and seen some hard times, that tells you its story in a raspy voice over a tumbler of whiskey. It does things with the genre that I've never seen done before, and does them well. This is not a challenging game, not a game to beat your head against; this is a game to walk through at a slow pace and enjoy. The faint echoes of the banjo blues will keep you company between sessions, gently calling you back to complete the story.			"

												This game isn't really for everyone. I don't even think it's for me, and I usually love this David Lynch kinda stuff.Maybe it's because the game frequently makes use of the most obscure metaphors possible. Check the forums and you'll see threads of people that really understand things while I'm just shaking my head in confusion. That sort of thing generally pisses me off, but it's the mood, sound and tone of KR0 that brings me around. And that's no mean feat because I am not shy about blasting a creator for being a pretentious deluge of pointless information.Ok, if you like David Lynch, The Adventures of Pete and Pete, Oh Brother Where Art Thou or magic realism you gotta get this game.

												Kentucky Route Zero is one of the most haunting gaming experiences I've ever had. It's strange, and makes you feel strange emotions while also making you feel like someone has slipped something very strange in your shirley temple.It's a point and click adventure game at it's core. This works well, because it lets you wade around in it's surreality. Haunting Bluegrass and gorgeous ambient music fill out a strange and wonderful world. The surreal elements of a David Lynch film, and the quiet melancholy of a funeral. Amazing and moving. Play this game.			"

												This game has seen a fair bit of attention, both positive and negative, in the game review community. To address the most negative first, is that the game is ugly and a visual mess. I actually downloaded this game upon sight alone and I must say that the minimalistic, angular style is wonderful. Scenery alone is some of the most striking I've seen in awhile from an indie title. And it all serves the environment and characters of the game, augmenting the surreal world of The Zero. The characters seem at home in a world where ghostly mine music, (literally) endless traffic jams, and giant eagles are as normal as a truck making a delivery. It's a game with a mix of wit, spookiness, and poetry that is unlike anything else I've played. The only negative is that I could not train my brain to not look for puzzles or tricks of other point and click games, but that is wholly a personal perception. I look forward to the next 3 Acts.

												This game is shrouded with mystery. Every second feels like a lucid dream. The art style, atmosphere, ATMOSPHERE, and story, are all incredibly unique and enchanting. I really have no real words to describe the authenticity and charm this game resonates. Gameplay is solid, dialogue is great, every character you meet is engulfed in mystery. NOTE: The only problem i have with this game, is the developers seem to have forgotten their own game exists. I almost gave it a thumbs down because it's been several months and the third act has yet to be seen, after they promised a new act every month or so. But alas, the game in its current state is really, really good, and still worth the experience in my opinion. I just REALLY hope they don't abandon this game, it's too good and i need to know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on in the story.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero plays like a traditional point & click adventure game stripped of puzzles with a focus purely on the exploration and story of an Antiques Dealer trying to complete a delivery, and the only way to make to the mysterious location is to take Route Zero. It may sound like a boring premise but as you progress through the game you realize that Route Zero is no ordinary highway, and the gorgeous visuals and excellent story telling lead you through a satisfying adventure through the human psyche, and the developers Cardboard Computer poke at your brain in the best way. Recommended, although as of this writing short and incomplete becaus only 2/5 acts have been released.			"

												I didn't really know what to expect from this game. I was just attracted to how the game looks (visuals, colors, etc.). Also, I didn't know it was going to be episodic, but it has been wonderful so far. There isn't much ""gameplay"" as all you do is read people's conversations, artricles, and stories. You guide the character (and also in the main map) to areas by point-and-click with your mouse. As simple as this sounds, it doesn't become a chore guiding your character around or just exploring stuff. What captivated me is the overall mood, atmosphere, feel, and pacing of the game. It gives you time to explore surroundings and what people has to say. And once you're immersed, you'll notice all its quirkiness and, at the same time, its spookiness! There's innovative design, rich storytelling, and wonderful music! Another gem in the steam library.			"

												I'm not all too familiar with point-and-click games or stories steeped in magical realism, but Kentucky Route Zero is both, and has made me a fan. A bit highbrow and downright esoteric, KRZ isn't for everyone yet still manages to be enjoyable to most--a bit like Journey (thatgamecompany / PS3), in the sense that its story eludes simple or quick understanding. But also like Journey and other similarly abstruse titles, it's easy to sink into KRZ even if just for the cozy moodiness and particularly the pleasantly haunting soundtrack which draws strongly from old bluegrass tunes.

												I picked up this game because I found the concept rather intriguing.  A secret highway under Kentucky?  I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured what the heck.The world of Kentucky Route Zero is beautiful and mysterious, full of odd characters and dark, derelict places.  The dialogue is all in text form and that seems to help the ambience.  The gameplay is point and click like the old adventure games however there is not much beyond that.  There are no puzzles to solve or minigames as far as I can tell.  It boils down to an interactive story, albeit one that is told very well.Overall I am torn about this.  The art and music are wonderful but the gameplay itself is very shallow.  If the price is right it might be worth checking out.			"

												If you have ever had a vivid summer-sickness dream, then the febrile fog of Kentucky Route Zero will seem familiar, and the ambient sounds of a hot, humid summer night, downright comforting.  There is nothing remotely creepy in the traditional ""scare me senseless"" fashion in this game.  But existentially and ontologically, the game is downright haunting.  It is one of those games that follows you around for days,—not the pretzel-logic plot of the game, but the fabric and texture of it, and the deja vu the spare, yet lush, scenery evokes. Deja vu of what? I don't know ,(or more accurately, I don't remember) . . . .Kentucky Route Zero seems to inhabit the realim of parallel uniiverses and Zen koans.  If you like Kairo, then it's highly likely that you will like KRO.			"

There aren't many traditional puzzles but if you like story games or modern adventures in the vein of Sword & Sworcery it's definitly worth a look.

Unique, beautiful artwork and a wonderful storyline make Kentucky Route Zero one of the most enjoyable indie games I've played in months. Gameplay is smooth, but nothing to write home about, esspecially the awkward functionality of the hub map which gets you to the next bit of story. The arwork and use of shadows to give the illusion of a 3d movement in what are essentially two dimensional evironments is impressive to say the least and it really help imerse the player into the world. As for the story, I will leave that for whomever's reading this to experience themselves, but prepare to be engaged.			"

												This is a point and click mystery adventure game with a really great and unique graphics style. The story line is interesting and drew me in immediately. It's kind of casual, but I don't mind.If you're interested in a cool mystery story alongside some beautiful images, I would recommend this.			"

												Essentially, this is a game about telling a story to yourself. As the plot unfolds your main responsibility is to decide how the characters think, feel, and relate to one another. By deciding who they are, you become invested in them. Also, it's gorgeous.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game. The only thing you have to know is that it's not a conventional game. It's more like a surreal interactive storytelling experience. We start the game with the objective of delivering something (we don't know what) to someone (we don't know who). The only problem is that we are lost and that we need to find the ""Zero"". So basically, the desire line of the game is about finding a way. And we soon realize that the objective is not about the delivery anymore, but just about finding ways. And you have to agree to wander off with the people that you meet on the road in order to find your way again. And it gets very strange.This game is interesting because of the advanced narrative, the master storytelling and the unique experience that it provides. It is beautiful visually, yet very simple. The soundtrack creates a warm and dreamy atmosphere. You will definitely get caught in the universe of this game.I'm not a hardcore gamer and when I play to a game, it's not about performance or achievements. It's about storytelling, visuals and characters. I like to be part of something different than my own reality. And this game is all about that, so I was very pleased.I can't wait for the next episodes to come out!PRO:- We meet characters and we feel like we really share an adventure with them.CON:- Our choices never seem to have real consequences on the game, other than building our own perception of what we're doing (which I guess is the point of the game). So far, we have the feeling that we are progressing, but we don't know if it's towards a resolution, because the mystery only gets thicker. And I wonder how it will unfold. The risk with a surreal narrative is that an abstract adventure could lead to an abstract conclusion. But there is no need to speculate as the rest of the game is yet to be released! And I am definitely hooked. 9/10 "

												There is not a single bad thing I can said about Kentucky Route Zero. The art style of this game is so perfect it's almost unreal. The sound design is perfect for each area and sets the mood so well. The story always leave you wanting more and asking questions in the good way. If you don't own Kentucky Route Zero you are missing out on one of games greatest story ever told. Game of the Year awards are shallow and dumb but I've never played a game that earned more then this game. Buy it,play it, experience it.GOTY 2013.			"

												The eternal night of Kentucky Route Zero is reminiscent of the absurdest world building of Douglas Adams. Its stylized visuals are a unique mixture of vector graphics and low-fi polygonal models. Unique is the word; KRZ betrays no single mentor in the medium. It acts as if by impulse. It is never tuned to the same frequency for long, but yet it is consistently brilliant in its execution.			"

												It's rare that you find such a beautifully-conceived work of art here in the world of gaming, but when you do, it's an incredible experience.  This has the feel of a haunting work of literature, and will leave you pondering the meaning of every detail.  This could be dutifully analyzed in an English class and a drama class, as it conveys a narrative through exposition, dialogue, and prose.  I don't want to say too much about it, folks.  Just play it.  Experience it, savor it...it's an atypical piece that is somehow nostalgic yet unfamiliar, grave yet absurd, and tangible yet unreal.  As you can see, this game has caused me to spout poetic praise! So it's not for everyone--heady magical realism is not your typical ""game"" material, as I alluded to before.  If you don't find those playwrights and authors interesting, than this program might not be your cup of tea.  But if you're a fan....don't miss this game!			"

												A hauntingly beautiful jaunt across a landscape that shows only what you need and hides what you need to imagine for yourself. I recommend that you experience this with headphones or a great sound system, in a dark room, with the lights turned off. There's nothing scary, it's just better that way.By the way, this isn't really a game per se, it's more like an idle indie movie that you click on. If you seek puzzles the likes of which Monkey Island offers, this is nothing close. Characters are closer to templates that you build backstories for through dialogue choices, and the real value in the game is interpreting what that means as the world unfurls around them.Given the above, it's totally okay to think it's overpriced, but do make sure it's on your list for the sales season.

You shouldn't come to Zero expecting a whole lot of action or adventure; it's very point-and-click and a little heavy on the reading. But what Zero lacks in the excitement department it makes up for in a unique art style, amazing music, and surreal story that really grabs you and holds you in.It's not exactly finished, with three of the five parts released, but I'm fairly confident that each one flows nicely together and tells a story worth experiencing, at least once.

												I will give this game a guarded recommendation, because although I like it (so far) it seems like way too long between chapters.Kentucky Route Zero is beautiful, surreal, moody, and atmospheric to the max.  More a story than a game, it's about exploration and thoughtful consideration of events as they unfold. Creepy moments serve to keep you interested, which is important because there are no puzzles, no conflict and only the barest thread of a narrative. That means it's not everybody's cup of tea.The only tension is whether your decisions and dialogue choices have really made any difference. For example, I think one of my decisions caused my character to develop a limp when he otherwise might not have. Who knows, I'll have to play it again.So to sum up: beautiful game/story, not for everyone, well worth the sale price, concerned how long between chapters.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero has the best use of atmopshere I've ever seen in a game. While most of the time atmosphere in games is equated to ""spoopy dark hallways"", KY0 uses solid, washed out colors and wide camera angles to make its world seem desolate and distant.This aesthetic lends a lot of emotional weight to the game's story about the mudane lives of people dealing with poverty. The writing is excellent, especially that of the dialogue. All of the conversation is very mellow, but hints very effectively at the unsaid ways the characters feel. The dialogue trees are also done excellently. They're not about checking off little variables and affecting the game later, they allow you to make little decisions about what kind of people the characters are. It's more like being a part of the storytelling than choosing a path.Unlike many other ""story-focused games"", KY0 has a sense of brevity. The pacing is excellent, 3 hours went by faster than a couple minutes of RPG exposition. Nothing feels cliche and every line is well-thought out. I don't think I've ever seen a game be more poigniant.This is usually where I'd say that you shouldn't get this is you're looking for a traditional game, but that's not true. You should at least try it, it's more than just a fun waste of time. The $25 price-point is a little steep, though. As of writing the game is on sale for $12.50, but that's only for a day and a half. Another thing to note is that KY0 has only has 2 of a planned 5 acts completed, and there's no guarantee the next 3 will maintain this level of quality. Still, I definately recommend it.			"

												Interactive late-night thought stimulator, not quite a game of systems, moreso a beautiful example of games in shortform--beat poetry for our usual, super-adorned and over-budgeted epics. Very George Saunders, not as much David Lynch (surreal yet not really grotesque or terrifying on any level), altogether an audiovisual treat of poetry.A sense of curiosity and some openness is all you need; familiarity with strange art and strange situations not required. Playing in the late hours with headphones is recommended, as is driving the mine tram in Act I with the lights off. Looking forward to further Acts.			"

												This is a 5 part series of point and click adventure style games, of which, 2 have been released. The game has a wonderful artistic style and appeals to me in a way to keep me going throughout. I had one minor graphical glitch however, regarding the v-sync, where if v-sync was turned off, the game does not scroll properly, making navigating screens difficult. I recommend leaving the v-sync on for this reason.The game is not terribly long if you don't want to navigate away from the main storyline. The majority of the side stories are all self-guided/discovered and typically 100% reading. Spend some time traveling around and finding things. It adds to the story. I would recommend this game on the graphical fidelity alone, but it is well written too. Play!			"

												A beautifully intriguing game. I hope that one day the game is finished, as so far there are only two episodes. The story is catching and mysterious, the atmosphere even more so. It is a point and click adventure with a lot of reading, but nothing overwhelming or boring. I do however think that the game is a bit expensive - I got mine on sale - also considering that the game isn't finished. The game is a little bit buggy as well, but there are ways to work around them if you look in the game's forums here on Steam. A lovely game all in all. Highly recommended.			"

The appeal of the game for me has always been to explore a haunting dreamlike southern gothic story filled with enigmatic characters and visuals like nothing I've seen anywhere else.

												David Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"" meets the Lucas Arts classic ""Full Throttle"" meets Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"" meets an ingenous DIY play texture with a rich and carefully plotted story. This game MUST be played with headphones, in the dark, with utter concentration. ""Kentucky Route Zero"" is not taxing in the twitchy way you might experience a FPS, it's an engrossing and whole body experience; by the time you're done with the story's third act, you'll be exhaling cold, damp cave air. A wonderful game that — for enjoyment — requires attention to details and an open mind. What sets this one apart, is that KR-0 will not provide you with obvious feedback. There's no health bar, for example. The 2D map (a central interface in the first part of the story) is somewhat unreliable and appears, at times, to be working against you. And, well, things get sort of meta-exploratory from there. Open mind, I said. Oh, and Junebug, Junebug, Junebug.			"

												A hauntingly beautiful jaunt across a landscape that shows only what you need and hides what you need to imagine for yourself. I recommend that you experience this with headphones or a great sound system, in a dark room, with the lights turned off. There's nothing scary, it's just better that way.By the way, this isn't really a game per se, it's more like an idle indie movie that you click on. If you seek puzzles the likes of which Monkey Island offers, this is nothing close. Characters are closer to templates that you build backstories for through dialogue choices, and the real value in the game is interpreting what that means as the world unfurls around them.Given the above, it's totally okay to think it's overpriced, but do make sure it's on your list for the sales season.

												This game is worth playing just for the stunning graphics and atmospheric soundtrack alone. But the gameplay is also worthwhile. KRZ is a winding point-and-click adventure that plays out like an interactive fiction, full of mystery and intrigue. The game has a very melancholy tone, that might also be described as nostalgic or maybe even spiritual. The writing is superb. The characters in KRZ all have their own background story that reveals itself gradually throughout the episodes. If you want to take a journey inside yourself and simultaneously venture into another world that exists above and beyond you current reality, while still not being that different from reality at all, then this game will be a treat for you. Traveling the Zero itself reminds me of the cult film Donnie Darko, which is also a surreal story involving alternate realities - so if you like that movie, chances are you'll love this game. The downside of this game is that the episodes are somewhat slow to be released - there are still two unreleased episodes in the works, and we will probably still be waiting a while for those. Overall, KRZ is unlike any other game I have ever played - it's refreshing, engaging, and oddly comforting. And I recommend it to everyone who enjoys an odd mystery. EDIT: I just realized while reading another review that you can also access the full songs from the soundtrack to this game within the install folder. It's included with the purchase of the game, which is great.			"

												Do you like Kentucky? Neither do I. Luckily for both of this gem of a game (Okay. Digital Experience, you Pedant) is like what would happen if Cormac McCarthy and Gabriel Garcia Marquez got together to write a play inspired by Twin Peaks. Currently not complete (At the time of writing 3/5 parts are released, and don't forget to grab the supplemental stuff from Cardboard Computer's site) this game is still worth every penny. The striking visual imagery and smartly literate writing let you immerse yourself into this play/game with a the same satisfaction of settling into the bath with a good book.

												It's hard to talk about KRZ without spoiling the experience. The experience, however, is second to none. It's short, Act I is about an hour and a half long, and that's what I've played so far plus a brief portion of Act II. The attention to detail is impecable and you'll stumble across something and wonder how it wasn't obvious it was there the entire time. It's a point and click, and it's exploration driven but it's not about exploring the game as much as it is about exploring who you are within the game.Again, it's hard to explain about spoiling the magic, so lets just say the game progresses in a way unlike any other story driven game I've played and it makes you feel not just an observer of the game, but an integral part of the story. This is one of the rare titles that has been around for a while but the deepest I've seen it discounted is 50% and that alone intrigued me to pick it up without knowing more than it's critically aclaimed. Up to this point I can say I'm not disappointed with my purchase and I can only see it becoming more worth it as the game unfolds.Finally, this is a game richer than a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. You will have to pace yourself :)			"

Unique, beautiful artwork and a wonderful storyline make Kentucky Route Zero one of the most enjoyable indie games I've played in months. Gameplay is smooth, but nothing to write home about, esspecially the awkward functionality of the hub map which gets you to the next bit of story. The arwork and use of shadows to give the illusion of a 3d movement in what are essentially two dimensional evironments is impressive to say the least and it really help imerse the player into the world. As for the story, I will leave that for whomever's reading this to experience themselves, but prepare to be engaged.			"

												We're only three acts in, but I feel compelled to write a review about Kentucky Route Zero regardless. It's an adventure game, of course, but it eschews the puzzle-solving component of most of those games to instead provide an atmospheric, choose-your-own-adventure style of storytelling.  It's gloriously weird and wonderful.To me, which makes the game so appealing, there is this enduring creepiness about everything in the game; the fact that the day always seems to stand at the edge of dusk contributes to that fact.  This creepiness lies on a balance teetering toward understanding, pushes you on to learn more about the Zero, and continue onward.Anyway, despite this somewhat pretentious-sounding rambling, Cardboard Computer has a winner here.

The game has a haunting, lush vibe that reminded me of better episodes of Twin Peaks. Artistic? The game is just lovely. But that doesn't really do it justice...The graphics are indie/lofi, but done so well that it actually enhances the feel of the game. The music is perfect, and kicks in at just the right times. Route Zero is lonely and mysterious, but never grim or frightening. Dark in the sense of obscure, perhaps, but not in terms of tone or theme.Really enjoyed it, can't wait for the last episode, hope for more.			"

												This game isn't really for everyone. I don't even think it's for me, and I usually love this David Lynch kinda stuff.Maybe it's because the game frequently makes use of the most obscure metaphors possible. Check the forums and you'll see threads of people that really understand things while I'm just shaking my head in confusion. That sort of thing generally pisses me off, but it's the mood, sound and tone of KR0 that brings me around. And that's no mean feat because I am not shy about blasting a creator for being a pretentious deluge of pointless information.Ok, if you like David Lynch, The Adventures of Pete and Pete, Oh Brother Where Art Thou or magic realism you gotta get this game.

												A staggeringly atmospheric work; an adventure game that's grown up and seen some hard times, that tells you its story in a raspy voice over a tumbler of whiskey. It does things with the genre that I've never seen done before, and does them well. This is not a challenging game, not a game to beat your head against; this is a game to walk through at a slow pace and enjoy. The faint echoes of the banjo blues will keep you company between sessions, gently calling you back to complete the story.			"

												One of the few works of true fiction, rather than genre fiction, to be found in gaming. Come for the magic realism, stay for the writing, art and innovative direction of scenes. Unlike other narrative driven games like To The Moon, the limited gameplay content is never frustrating, with the simple experience of progression being more than enough to keep you hooked.It is closer to an interactive graphic novel than it is to most games, similar in tone to books like The Underwater Welder. Similarly it is the visual construction of the scenes that are the most impressive, rather than pixel or polygon count.			"

												Kentucky is now on my top-list of favourite games. A mysterious ""Lynchian"" world that I can't wait to dig-in further.The art direction has a unique, fascinating, style. Crafted using simple 3D assets and glorified with a smart usage of lighting, camera depths and ""layers"".The story is driven with smart-written dialogs that invite you to wonder what are the motivations and backstories of each of those characters.<Chapter I> Great introduction to the main character, and his dog. Sometimes wondering if this is all ""real"" or part of a ""dream"", you keep moving forward in this sort of ""ghost story"". Maybe none of the previous guesses is right, and the main character is just high on LSD. But something odd is going on, and you want to know what is it.<Chapter II> The story keeps growing up your interest. The Museum and Forest scenes are brilliant, both visually and script-wise. The fact that these scenes are built from the point of view of other characters, adds an unbelievable depth to the personality of your main character.<Chapter III> The worst chapter so far. It's sort of boring, as you never understand where are you leading to. Or what's your objective. Too much text, too few awesome visuals. I hope this is just the prelude for an amazing Chapter IV. Where I'll be able to understand what happened in the 3rd. Get back on my excitement for this game.			"

												""Kentucky Route Zero"". There's nothing difficult about it, and it doesn't take that long, but it reads like a book, it's extremely relaxing, I'm savoring it. The best part is it has had some of the most amazing bluegrass music performances woven into the story. Out of nowhere, a bluegrass band will pop into the shadows and play an entire song for you, part of the story. I highly recommend it if that's your type of thing.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is something special. It's more of an experience than a game. It conveys a certain dreamlike atmosphere and puts you in a certain state of mind unlike any other game I've played. It's very peaceful, though at the same time carrying a subtle undercurrent of social commentary on topics like crushing debt, home forclosure, and alcoholism. It's chock full of literary references (detailed here[superlevel.de] and here[superlevel.de]), most of which sailed right over my head, but it's still a fantastic experience for the atmosphere and writing alone. The interesting and rich characters you meet, the crickets chirping into the night, the music, it's all just absolutely beautiful. It's not for everyone - it's definitely deliberately paced, and there isn't really any action or puzzles to speak of. If you dislike games like Gone Home or Dear Esther solely because they're ""not games"" (regardless of content) then this probably isn't for you. But if you can keep an open mind, you'll be treated to an experience unlike any other.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a lot like being home. The environments have a pseudo-surrealist/realist feel to them much like the of Twin Peaks if you are familiar to the popular cult show. It has a unique style that scratches an itch that few things can satisify. So, just on how well this game conveys tone and world building alone makes it recomendable.It's a simple adventure game that follows the likes of Telltale's the walking dead, it isn't so much about puzzle solving but about the relationship of the characters and how much involvement you decide as a player to invest in the story. But instead, you don't just control the actions of one character you often switch to many different character's perspective and you get a sense of being not just a passive reader, a recipient, of a story but as a writer or an actor too. It's a nice feeling, because everyone is likable and there is a lot of heart and love in the backstories of the characters however simple they may seem. They're just good folk. You can tell the developers of this game have a passion for play writting style because a lot of the scenes come off as stage directions which give the exchanges a unique feel.I feel we are on the brink of redefining what the term video games mean. Of course video games really well describes what the first iteration of games look like, things like pacman or space invaders where there are clearly expressed winstates and scoreboards. But, as the medium has matured we have gotten narrative focused games like Bioshock or even something like Metal of Honor/Call of Duty, where it is implied but not really that winining the game is by finishing all the narative content. And, now we are even in more obscure territory with things like Kentucky Route Zero or Dear Esther and Proteus, where the process of calling them 'games' seems almost silly. This could be the start of something, maybe a new medium, or a change of definition. In any case KR0 is a good example of the expanding definition of this genre of ""non-games"" that has suddenly gained popularity.			"

												I will be frank - I loved this game, but I am still unsure exactly how I should describe the experience.Atmospheric? Certainly. The game has a haunting, lush vibe that reminded me of better episodes of Twin Peaks. Artistic? The game is just lovely. But that doesn't really do it justice...The graphics are indie/lofi, but done so well that it actually enhances the feel of the game. The music is perfect, and kicks in at just the right times. Route Zero is lonely and mysterious, but never grim or frightening. Dark in the sense of obscure, perhaps, but not in terms of tone or theme.Really enjoyed it, can't wait for the last episode, hope for more.			"

Cinematic, literary, and 5 years ahead of its time, it is unique insofar as it is written by actual writers. Give it a couple years and this will be the seminal text in a new genre of literary study.

												Kentucky Route Zero has the best use of atmopshere I've ever seen in a game. While most of the time atmosphere in games is equated to ""spoopy dark hallways"", KY0 uses solid, washed out colors and wide camera angles to make its world seem desolate and distant.This aesthetic lends a lot of emotional weight to the game's story about the mudane lives of people dealing with poverty. The writing is excellent, especially that of the dialogue. All of the conversation is very mellow, but hints very effectively at the unsaid ways the characters feel. The dialogue trees are also done excellently. They're not about checking off little variables and affecting the game later, they allow you to make little decisions about what kind of people the characters are. It's more like being a part of the storytelling than choosing a path.Unlike many other ""story-focused games"", KY0 has a sense of brevity. The pacing is excellent, 3 hours went by faster than a couple minutes of RPG exposition. Nothing feels cliche and every line is well-thought out. I don't think I've ever seen a game be more poigniant.This is usually where I'd say that you shouldn't get this is you're looking for a traditional game, but that's not true. You should at least try it, it's more than just a fun waste of time. The $25 price-point is a little steep, though. As of writing the game is on sale for $12.50, but that's only for a day and a half. Another thing to note is that KY0 has only has 2 of a planned 5 acts completed, and there's no guarantee the next 3 will maintain this level of quality. Still, I definately recommend it.			"

												Interactive late-night thought stimulator, not quite a game of systems, moreso a beautiful example of games in shortform--beat poetry for our usual, super-adorned and over-budgeted epics. Very George Saunders, not as much David Lynch (surreal yet not really grotesque or terrifying on any level), altogether an audiovisual treat of poetry.A sense of curiosity and some openness is all you need; familiarity with strange art and strange situations not required.

												I will give this game a guarded recommendation, because although I like it (so far) it seems like way too long between chapters.Kentucky Route Zero is beautiful, surreal, moody, and atmospheric to the max.  More a story than a game, it's about exploration and thoughtful consideration of events as they unfold. Creepy moments serve to keep you interested, which is important because there are no puzzles, no conflict and only the barest thread of a narrative. That means it's not everybody's cup of tea.The only tension is whether your decisions and dialogue choices have really made any difference. For example, I think one of my decisions caused my character to develop a limp when he otherwise might not have. Who knows, I'll have to play it again.So to sum up: beautiful game/story, not for everyone, well worth the sale price, concerned how long between chapters.			"

												This little point and click adventure game has some of the most amazing style I've seen. The music, the artwork and the pacing of the story are all brilliant. This type of game will not provide challenging gameplay for anyone, and if that's a dealbreaker this game is not for you. If you liked The Walking Dead, or the Wadjet Eye adventure games, you will like this. And in terms of style and atmosphere, this is in a league of its own.			"

												If you want a ""game"" that really sticks with you months after you've played it you want this game. I can talk up the art style or the pacing or the seriousness with which you'll shape your characters (yeah, you control the personalities of characters...I don't know if this changes the plot but committing to one choice over another will change you) or the occasionally breathtaking sound but I won't.I'll just say that this is one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had and that I've never seen anything else like it, plus we get three more episodes of surprises. If you're a stickler for actual challenge or the dollar/hour ratio or other soulless criteria you might hate this game, so bug off. If you're a fan of unique and personal experiences and burnt out on doing the same-old-same-old in games and just need a mental break, and you don't own this, you have a problem and you need to fix it with Kentucky Route Zero.

												This experience is strangely magical, gorgeously designed, and very well-written. Though less of a game and more of an interactive experience similar to Gone Home, you take in the story and the art direction as an experience. This game doesn't really feature much of any kind of play, doesn't feature puzzles or twitch-style action. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the odd story that's KY:0.Unfortunately the game hasn't ended yet / been fully released yet.			"

												 It's strange how sometimes playing a game relates so deeply with your current situation that it feels as though it was made specifically for you at that moment. You get a pit in your stomach and when you stop playing you see the world in a whole new light. Perspective changes and you just feel as though a weight has been lifted off of you when you turn your attention away from the screen after that last pivotal plot point. Personally I am going through an extended transition from previous Military experience, then school, and now a professional career with a family, life can be pretty confusing. That confusion has nothing on Kentucky Route Zero by developer Cardboard Computer. There are words that can describe the game: surreal, strange, odd, uncanny, bizarre. You can describe the things that happen in the story by sequence, but completing the ideas as to how or why these things happen is impossible. The game itself isn't so much a game as a series of events that captures you and allows you to shape the adventure and it's contents as a concept of your own design. The events are all going to happen regardless of whether or not you make certain choices, the only thing that may change are dialogue options and responses. You even begin to have conversations with yourself through multiple characters gradually. This is interesting because now both sides of the conversation have different possibilities, and somehow the conversations seem less mechanical even if they are with yourself. Going back to describing the game, there are words to describe it, but each of those words seem to have connotations that don't fully encompass the ideas portrayed. The feeling is fuller, than those words can describe. It's very odd, and I don't want to give any of it away as a spoiler. Things that are strange and unbelievable happen and the characters seem to take it with a grain of salt. Things like traveling on an inter-dimensional highway with arbitrary markers made of everyday items, replacing a leg with a metal skeleton prosthesis (and not reacting), taking a shot with a skeleton with a tape recorder, flying on a giant eagle that moves houses daily. These are all taken by the characters as something completely acceptable if a bit odd. No explanation of why these things are happening, just that they do.  There is no time or place to explore why these things happen, so taking them with stride is forced on the player as well as the characters. You can only move forward and there are no places to take breaks to look for answers. So you derive the answers from events as they move along, and accept what doesn't make sense, and just move along. Eventually events in the story that didn't make sense are after the fact, and become a part of the plot. So even surreal happenings can become important regardless of how illogical or insane they seem at first. The entire interface is a point and click adventure, but there are only so many things you can point and click on and they are all labeled for convenience and to keep the story moving at a reasonable pace. This doesn't detract from the experience, as the game itself is surreal enough to keep you entertained. If anything it keeps things interesting as you always want to move forward to see what strange happenings are next. The strange is the spectacle. And the glass through which you look is your own mind. The experience is engrossing. You'll like this game if: You enjoy M.C. Escher and Picasso, and want to play a game designed by them. Strictly for those though that enjoy being told a story, and not necessarily molding it.

												A staggeringly atmospheric work; an adventure game that's grown up and seen some hard times, that tells you its story in a raspy voice over a tumbler of whiskey. It does things with the genre that I've never seen done before, and does them well. This is not a challenging game, not a game to beat your head against; this is a game to walk through at a slow pace and enjoy. The faint echoes of the banjo blues will keep you company between sessions, gently calling you back to complete the story.			"

												This game isn't really for everyone. I don't even think it's for me, and I usually love this David Lynch kinda stuff.Maybe it's because the game frequently makes use of the most obscure metaphors possible. Check the forums and you'll see threads of people that really understand things while I'm just shaking my head in confusion. That sort of thing generally pisses me off, but it's the mood, sound and tone of KR0 that brings me around. And that's no mean feat because I am not shy about blasting a creator for being a pretentious deluge of pointless information.Ok, if you like David Lynch, The Adventures of Pete and Pete, Oh Brother Where Art Thou or magic realism you gotta get this game.

												Kentucky Route Zero is one of the most haunting gaming experiences I've ever had. It's strange, and makes you feel strange emotions while also making you feel like someone has slipped something very strange in your shirley temple.It's a point and click adventure game at it's core. This works well, because it lets you wade around in it's surreality. Haunting Bluegrass and gorgeous ambient music fill out a strange and wonderful world. The surreal elements of a David Lynch film, and the quiet melancholy of a funeral. Amazing and moving. Play this game.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero is a lot like being home. The environments have a pseudo-surrealist/realist feel to them much like the of Twin Peaks if you are familiar to the popular cult show. It has a unique style that scratches an itch that few things can satisify. So, just on how well this game conveys tone and world building alone makes it recomendable.It's a simple adventure game that follows the likes of Telltale's the walking dead, it isn't so much about puzzle solving but about the relationship of the characters and how much involvement you decide as a player to invest in the story. But instead, you don't just control the actions of one character you often switch to many different character's perspective and you get a sense of being not just a passive reader, a recipient, of a story but as a writer or an actor too. It's a nice feeling, because everyone is likable and there is a lot of heart and love in the backstories of the characters however simple they may seem. They're just good folk. You can tell the developers of this game have a passion for play writting style because a lot of the scenes come off as stage directions which give the exchanges a unique feel.I feel we are on the brink of redefining what the term video games mean. Of course video games really well describes what the first iteration of games look like, things like pacman or space invaders where there are clearly expressed winstates and scoreboards. But, as the medium has matured we have gotten narrative focused games like Bioshock or even something like Metal of Honor/Call of Duty, where it is implied but not really that winining the game is by finishing all the narative content. And, now we are even in more obscure territory with things like Kentucky Route Zero or Dear Esther and Proteus, where the process of calling them 'games' seems almost silly. This could be the start of something, maybe a new medium, or a change of definition. In any case KR0 is a good example of the expanding definition of this genre of ""non-games"" that has suddenly gained popularity.			"

												Experience on Linux so far:+ Solid.The game:Hm. I don't exactly know what genre to put it in, because it deviates quite a lot from the normal point-and-click adventures. You direct the narration and progress the story line using dialogs of your choosing. Although some critisize the game for the fact that dialog choices do not (seemlingly) affect the outcome. What dialogs I choose matters to me, my mindset as a player, which is good enough for me. The artwork is beautiful and unique, the story and dialogs are engaging and sometimes emotional in the most subtle of ways. You may not know why, but sometimes you get a discomforting or straight out creepy feeling as you guide the main characters through the game. Likewise, some scenes are very endearing.With proper voice actors (the game has no voice acting, only text dialogs) this game would have been gold.The game is released in three acts (2 are out so far) and I have to deduct points from the overall score because the releases have been few and far in between. I recommend you wait until all acts are released before you purchase, I was very unhappy with the waiting time for act 2 and act 3.I'm not sure I like this trend started by that very famous game title based on a comic book about zombies, but the game is worth a buy.Score:3/5			"

												It's hard to talk about KRZ without spoiling the experience. The experience, however, is second to none. It's short, Act I is about an hour and a half long, and that's what I've played so far plus a brief portion of Act II. The attention to detail is impecable and you'll stumble across something and wonder how it wasn't obvious it was there the entire time. It's a point and click, and it's exploration driven but it's not about exploring the game as much as it is about exploring who you are within the game.Again, it's hard to explain about spoiling the magic, so lets just say the game progresses in a way unlike any other story driven game I've played and it makes you feel not just an observer of the game, but an integral part of the story. This is one of the rare titles that has been around for a while but the deepest I've seen it discounted is 50% and that alone intrigued me to pick it up without knowing more than it's critically aclaimed. Up to this point I can say I'm not disappointed with my purchase and I can only see it becoming more worth it as the game unfolds.Finally, this is a game richer than a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.

KR0 is a game where you shape people's pasts and motivations, and it works marvelously despite it being ""linear"". So many games allow you to make choices without really feeling like your experience is unique or that your character, well, has character. KR0 is the anthithesis of that.My Conway named his dog Blue, had lost his mentor, and explored the highways of Kentucky before continuing on his journey. He heard singing in a church and decided not to disturb the people inside. But that's only my Conway, and yours could be different.Even though there are only two acts out as of now, I'd recommend jumping right in anyway. It's worth it.			"

Of course, that being said, it is definitely more of an experience than a game with controls limited to basically point and click with text dialogue selection. However, the text is masterfully crafted and adds immeasurable depth to the unique visuals and haunting atmosphere created in this game. Don't let the title put you off, this game is a one of a kind experience that leaves players pondering their actions not just in the game, but in life as well. The game feels like a waking dream if you let it and before I forget the music and ambiance are one of a kind. Branch out, take a risk, and enjoy this game. CAN""T WAIT FOR THE 3rd Episode : )			"

												This game makes me feel this.. special tingle. I only get that feeling when I read a good book of short stories. And the mood? Outstanding. It is so damn ODD. Makes me think of Neil Gaiman's American Gods. I know it's not a short story, but still. Wait, there's a short story with Shadow in Smoke and Mirrors, I think.. Or was it in some anthology? Anyway. Very nice. High five. Fistbump. Asspats and bear hugs. Third floor - Bears. I'm halfway through the second chapter and it's not let me down so far. I will tell you how it was when I'm done.			"

												Kentucky Route Zero has been and is an experience that I greatly recommend. In a way I suppose I could describe it as one of the most meaning works I have been exposed to in the last few years and even after finishing the latest episode, it still haunts me. Think Undertale but instead of a dagger in your heart, it's a semi-automatic rifle that unloads an entire ammo-clip into your mind whenever you finish reading a sentence. Poetic without being pretentious and sombre without feeling draggy, KRZ is the most well-rounded work I've seen that spans across various discplines in the arts and probably will see in a long time.10/10, tailor made for philosophy junkies and can incur an existential crisis.

												Kentucky Route Zero is a bit different.-A large part of it is reading meandering prose. -It's deliberately paced on the slow side. -There isn't a whole lot of 'gameplay' other than very straightforward point-and-click.   If I didn't value the game's unconventional narrative, or excellent characterisation, or awesome synergy between great visual and sound design, then these could be negative criticisms but instead each of the above contributes to the game's unique aesthetic; a wonderful sense of dreamlike wandering. The events of this game play out like a dream also, getting increasingly disconnected, esoteric and more surreal. The divergence in the narrative dependent on your choices only adds to its warrenous feel as you begin to explore the americana present in the Zero and try to get to grips with how far the rabbit hole goes.Like a half-remembered dream Kentucky Route Zero somehow holds together as more than the sum of its parts and leaves me wishing more games were half as experimental.

												Sometimes when you're flying through space you end up meeting a robot. Sometimes that robot is wearing a dress and rides a motorcycle with another robot. Sometimes that robot plays the keytar and likes to sing in dive bars. Sometimes that robot knows the entire history and future of the world in which you live. Sometimes that robot is Lieutenant Commander Data. These scientificially observed facts are called Scalzi's laws of robotics. A robot can only be one of those four things. Kentucky Route Zero is a game that explores what it might mean for the laws of robotics to be slightly relaxed (not unlike how Star Trek slightly relaxes the intergalactic speed limit), allowing a robot to be multiple types of robot at the same time. That's right, in Kentucky Route Zero, Lieutenant Commander Data puts on a dress, picks up a keytar and plans your destiny from his dive bar. This is a wonderful game that really makes you think about the universe and doesn't contain any disturbing skeletons.			"

												I don't really know how to describe this game except that it probably isn't quite what you're expecting, in a good way. I believe it's been classified as an interactive narrative rather than a game. Interaction is based around moving the main character within the scenes and opening dialogue with others. The dialogue will change based on which response you choose, however you cannot truly alter the outcomes of each segment.The strong points within this story are the art direction and audio by far, it's quite fantastic. I feel the largest drawback with this game as it continues development is the absence of puzzles, even simple ones. I think there was just one in the very beginning, you had to retrieve an item for an old man. This allowed interaction between the main character and the environment, which is almost completely missing now.I can't really describe the experience of this, for most I suspect it will mystify and be quite eerie....maybe even sad at points. I enjoy that it's designed that way because there are so few games or interactive narratives that are. If you were to ask me what to expect from this, I don't know what to say....you're in for a great surprise.			"

												This interactive story is very engaging. The plot is elusive, but not for lack of substance, but rather a poetic metering of details. The delivery of the story focuses on imagery and character interaction, and to some extent on the characters themselves. Very abstract, but it really gets to you. I live right in the middle of the setting of the game, and the overmap represents the region very well (in an abstract way, it is not a true map but the regions are as familiar as home). This makes the descriptions of the different truck stops much more immediate to me, but they are well-crafted on their own.I'm a big fan of this game, definitely recommend it.I finished playing Act III. The mood of this game is so intense! I'm somewhere between 'deeply unsettled' and 'terrified'. I absolutely recommend playing the free interquels you can find on the developer's site kentuckyroutezero.com . They add context to the game's plot and characters, but The Entertainment especially is also a very interesting experience on its own. I know some people have complaints about the slow development schedule, but Cardboard Computer isn't a big dev like Telltale. A game that I'm so enthralled with like Zero is hard to wait for, but Act III blew me away and I'm willing to wait for that kind of quality.The third interquel came out recently and it is just as avant-garde as the second. It takes the form of a phone number, and has already revealed many secrets. It even inspired me to take a trip to my local state park.			"

												While I've only completed Act II so far, I can safely say that Kentucky Route Zero is one of the most ethereal, engaging experiences I've ever had with digital media. It's hard to call it a game, even in the more non-traditional indie sense. It really is an experiential piece of interactive art, with a delightfully rich, simple though avant-garde art style, an incredible sense of moody, mythical presence, and fantastically engaging dialogue. Play it if you want to experience a game unlike any other, and if you value story and character development over points and explosions.			"

												Easily one of the most amazing and affecting games ever.  Some people claim it's ""not a game"" because it doesn't have puzzles like a traditional adventure game, but that sells this game short.  The makers definitely don't care what your pre-concieved notions of a ""game"" might be, but the interactivity is very high but in ways I've never seen before.  You don't so much choose what's going to happen as you craft the characters past while going on this bizarre, amazing journey with them.  The visuals are stark and striking.  The regular soundtrack is equally stark, but subdued.  Where it stands out are the bluegrass songs that suddenly appear out of the blue, like the band playing in the shadows of the foreground in the first act, or the melancholy lone banjo in the forest of the second act.  The third act, in addition to an excellent bluegrass song includes a stunning and unique interactive song that really blew me away.  GET THIS GAME.			"

												This is a game with a tired and sleepless tone, feeling every bit as nostalgic and vaguely tragic as the memories of a dream that fade away just after waking too early in the morning.  It's like being on the road at night, listening to the hollow drone of cars driving on the freeway, making small talk with an old man at a gas station while you warm up a pre-packaged egg sandwich in the microwave.  You start your car and pull onto the road more out of habit and instinct than desire or necessity, and immediately forget the details of your conversation.As a work of storytelling, it discusses subjects that many storytellers are reticent to approach:  it's a game about getting old; it's a game about trying to forget old demons; it's a game about surviving the long recession of the late 2000s; it's a game about the contradictions of working class culture in America; it's a game about accidental relationships.  No other game that I've played has come this close to talking about our lives in such an honest way.  Don't let yourself pass it by.			"

												Picked this up largely on a whim, since its OST and visual design struck a chord with me, and everything about it has been above and beyond all expectations.I went into it expecting a point-and-click with some nice art direction and relaxing ambient music. What I got was a enchanting piece of (semi-interactive) theatre filled with nuance and detail; a surreal world filled with intertwining stories and characters, each with something memorable to bring to the fore. Every time a new act has been released, it's been played at 2am with the lights off. I've just completely lost myself in it for a few hours at a time, and it's constantly been on my mind at some level since I first played it in 2013.It's slow-paced and very much non-traditional - it doesn't feature much of the pixel-hunting and puzzle-solving you might expect from a typical adventure game - but the dialogue, worldbuilding, themes and atmosphere carry this game effortlessly. Even something as simple as the movement mechanics are constantly played with to make different sections of the story distinct. Exploration and uncovering the myriad secrets is heavily recommended.Note that the final act has yet to be released, and if previous experience is any indication, it will be a long, long while before it is. However, said experience leaves me with no doubt that it will be worth the wait. If you do check it out, be sure to play the free ""Interval"" content the developers have also produced. They add much to the mood and lore of the game.			"

												Bizarre and surreal. SCORE: 65/100.This is not The Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us, and neither is it Broken Age or Grim Fandango. It is its own thing, and it does a medoicre job at that. It starts off rather mundanely, but steadily gets weirder and more abstract as it goes. Time and space come in to play in odd ways and you will often be confused, sometimes irritatingly so.This is a strange game, and I'm unsure if it will ever get its fifth act, since it took years for Act IV of a game that looks like it would take a few weeks to make.Act IV was SUPER SLOW and I couldn't even finish it. Just mind-numbingly boring and slow. Changed my review from ""Yes"" to ""No"" for recommendation.			"

												I definitely liked the unique art/atmosphere, plus it answers the age-old question of what a more surreal version of Zork would look like. Definitely not for everyone, as it has a slow pace, lacks an exciting plot, has no puzzles, and (I think) doesn't let you affect the narrative in any significant way. In fact, I felt bored for parts of Act III and/or Act IV, perhaps because I insisted on playing through all the Acts in one sitting. On the whole, though, I liked it a lot as a strange, extended mood piece. Hopefully Act V will be interesting, when it comes out.Total playing time for Acts I through IV was six hours. There might be some reply value, but I'm not sure. "

												One of my favorite games on Steam. It pushes the boundaries in point and click text adventure genre.Kentucky Route Zero is special. It's surrealistic and it's not an easy plot to grasp like most games. However, for fans of the genre and people who generally like beautiful fantasy stories, this is it. I got the game on Humble Monthly and I didn't knew what it was, I played it without any information and it was such a surprise...Visually gorgeous, a festa to the eyes, and a delight to the ears, each episode is artistically unique. A lot of thought has been put into details, and this makes it a game for you NOT to rush through and get over it.

												Kentucky Route Zero is a bit different.-A large part of it is reading meandering prose. -It's deliberately paced on the slow side. -There isn't a whole lot of 'gameplay' other than very straightforward point-and-click.   If I didn't value the game's unconventional narrative, or excellent characterisation, or awesome synergy between great visual and sound design, then these could be negative criticisms but instead each of the above contributes to the game's unique aesthetic; a wonderful sense of dreamlike wandering. The events of this game play out like a dream also, getting increasingly disconnected, esoteric and more surreal. The divergence in the narrative dependent on your choices only adds to its warrenous feel as you begin to explore the americana present in the Zero and try to get to grips with how far the rabbit hole goes.Like a half-remembered dream Kentucky Route Zero somehow holds together as more than the sum of its parts and leaves me wishing more games were half as experimental.

												Kentucky Route Zero has been and is an experience that I greatly recommend. In a way I suppose I could describe it as one of the most meaning works I have been exposed to in the last few years and even after finishing the latest episode, it still haunts me. Think Undertale but instead of a dagger in your heart, it's a semi-automatic rifle that unloads an entire ammo-clip into your mind whenever you finish reading a sentence. Poetic without being pretentious and sombre without feeling draggy, KRZ is the most well-rounded work I've seen that spans across various discplines in the arts and probably will see in a long time.10/10, tailor made for philosophy junkies and can incur an existential crisis.

												This is what I would call a ""bedtime game"", something slow and relaxed that you can safely start up if you just want to unwind late at night. It's hard to describe what makes it so good, but the atmosphere and dialogue just feel oddly profound. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes an atmospheric, story-driven experience.			"

												Driving at night; there's something surreal about the whole experience, isn't there? You're just tired enough that the things you see in the corner of your eye take on their own, strange, liminal existence - right where your headlights touch the road, that infinitely thin border between light and dark, wakefulness and dreaming.That's basically what this game evokes. Play at night, in the dark, cup of coffee in hand, listening to the rain drumming on your window for the best effect.			"

												Picked this up largely on a whim, since its OST and visual design struck a chord with me, and everything about it has been above and beyond all expectations.I went into it expecting a point-and-click with some nice art direction and relaxing ambient music. What I got was a enchanting piece of (semi-interactive) theatre filled with nuance and detail; a surreal world filled with intertwining stories and characters, each with something memorable to bring to the fore. Every time a new act has been released, it's been played at 2am with the lights off. I've just completely lost myself in it for a few hours at a time, and it's constantly been on my mind at some level since I first played it in 2013.It's slow-paced and very much non-traditional - it doesn't feature much of the pixel-hunting and puzzle-solving you might expect from a typical adventure game - but the dialogue, worldbuilding, themes and atmosphere carry this game effortlessly. Even something as simple as the movement mechanics are constantly played with to make different sections of the story distinct. Exploration and uncovering the myriad secrets is heavily recommended.Note that the final act has yet to be released, and if previous experience is any indication, it will be a long, long while before it is. However, said experience leaves me with no doubt that it will be worth the wait. If you do check it out, be sure to play the free ""Interval"" content the developers have also produced. They add much to the mood and lore of the game.			"

												I definitely liked the unique art/atmosphere, plus it answers the age-old question of what a more surreal version of Zork would look like. Definitely not for everyone, as it has a slow pace, lacks an exciting plot, has no puzzles, and (I think) doesn't let you affect the narrative in any significant way. In fact, I felt bored for parts of Act III and/or Act IV, perhaps because I insisted on playing through all the Acts in one sitting. On the whole, though, I liked it a lot as a strange, extended mood piece. Hopefully Act V will be interesting, when it comes out.Total playing time for Acts I through IV was six hours. There might be some reply value, but I'm not sure. "

												One of my favorite games on Steam. It pushes the boundaries in point and click text adventure genre.Kentucky Route Zero is special. It's surrealistic and it's not an easy plot to grasp like most games. However, for fans of the genre and people who generally like beautiful fantasy stories, this is it. I got the game on Humble Monthly and I didn't knew what it was, I played it without any information and it was such a surprise...Visually gorgeous, a festa to the eyes, and a delight to the ears, each episode is artistically unique. A lot of thought has been put into details, and this makes it a game for you NOT to rush through and get over it. And if you start playing this and you're not sure about it, please try to hold on until episode 3. The concert... omg!

												Bizarre and surreal. SCORE: 65/100.This is not The Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us, and neither is it Broken Age or Grim Fandango. It is its own thing, and it does a medoicre job at that. It starts off rather mundanely, but steadily gets weirder and more abstract as it goes. Time and space come in to play in odd ways and you will often be confused, sometimes irritatingly so.This is a strange game, and I'm unsure if it will ever get its fifth act, since it took years for Act IV of a game that looks like it would take a few weeks to make.Act IV was SUPER SLOW and I couldn't even finish it. Just mind-numbingly boring and slow. Changed my review from ""Yes"" to ""No"" for recommendation.			"

												It is late, and you should be going to bed. But you don't want to. Not yet. You don't have anything important to do, or anything at all, really. But you refuse the gentle beckoning of sleep, your act of continued consciousness a sort of indifferent defiance of human frailty. In those dim hours, the time where nothing is significant and yet everything is important - this game should be played.In light of the recent influx of negative reviews, I felt I should update this review with my own opinion on the matter. I purchased the game shortly after Act Two was released. Was the wait between Act Two and Act Three longer than I would have liked? Yes. But when it was released, I was instantly impressed by how much more impressive the act was than the previous one, in every concievable way, and I had though Acts One and Two had been incredible experiences.Besides, the best way to play this game is with at least a six month gap between Acts. Hazy, half-recalled memories of what happened before... that, my friend, is the heart of Kentucky Route Zero.			"

												KRZ is a triumph of storytelling and aesthetics. The game falls more on the “interactive fiction” side of the spectrum, as dialogue options serve more to set the tone than to affect outcomes. But this technique is where the game shines - you are allowed to sculpt the histories, intentions, and emotions of the characters. The prose is deft and economical, dancing between playful, philosophical, tender, and unsettling. The pacing is slow and methodical – think a Lynch film – which rewards patience with moments of serene beauty and oppressive sadness.Aesthetically, the game is a slam dunk – gorgeous visuals, minimal design, creative camera work. The music is possibly my favorite part of the game, perfectly augmenting the scenes with a diverse sonic palette, ranging from ambient, musique concrete, bluegrass, and dream pop (whisperwave?).Most impressively, KRZ is alludes to a wide variety of influences, yet somehow pieces them together into a cohesive world. The list is monstrous: southern-gothic fiction, theatrical set design, avant-garde visual art and film, field recordings, magical realism, early text-based adventure games, etc. Yet they are pieced together into a unique arrangement that is greater than the sum of its parts.I think KRZ is a masterpiece.

												I don't know if Kentucky Route Zero will be entirely satisfactory. I think currently it gets lumped in with narrative focused games and while that's not entirely inaccurate it also reminds me of late night short foreign movies and performance art and those weird sometimes mesmerising, sometimes grating and repulsive works of art that tend to inspire some pretty strong but not very positive reactions.I think this experience suited me, it wasn't what I expected but then it also wasn't like I had particular expectations beyond a certain kind of atmosphere and maybe some unique visual story telling tools.There is a book called 'The Night Circus' by Erin Morgenstern and its greatest feature is the rich way it references all the senses in a room so often. The book took joy in evoking a moment and location and visual style, it adored whimsy and art and sumptuous beauty. It had an intriguing story and reasonably compelling characters but I believe it was the style of evoking scenes that made it either greatly loved or merely 'pretty good/okay' in people's eyes.Something about that style of experience only appealing to certain people with the inclination for that kind of storytelling makes me think that KR0 is similar? Not in the style of storytelling but in its being not everyone's cup of tea. For some people it's going to make some dissapointing choices with plot and characters that are going to be difficult for them to feel satisfied by despite whatever tonal sense it makes.I'm not saying 'people will cry if there's not happy ending' I guess I'm more saying I don't mind if there's no pay off for some things (good or bad) but other people will (not unreasonably) feel cheated or dissapointed if there is no pay off for what was their focus of the game. The thing that brought me joy about this game may be different to what brings you joy.Kentucky Route Zero is more of an open ended road trip. It reminds me of American Gods if they'd never made it to the climactic ending and had instead simply travelled onwards meeting the local deities. In Kentucky route zero you don't meet God's but everyday people kind of caught in 'moments', usually trapped by some kind of debt or poverty. Mostly you don't save people and you're pretty passive other then deciding when to stop and when to go. I'm ok with this though, something about the humid black atmostphere just kind of works for me.You should check it out.			"

												I cannot recommend Kentucky Route Zero enough. There's only so much to be said without spoiling the experience, so if you like great stories and immersive atmospheres, I encourage you to give this a shot. The characters, environments, and music create a great, creepy, intriguing atmosphere that has always left me wanting more. If point-n-clicks aren't your thing, $25 is probably steep. It has gone on sale for at least half that, so you might wait if you're on the fence.			"

												An absolutely wonderful game. While the gameplay is pretty minimal and consists mostly of walking, examining objects and talking to NPCs, the story and the atmosphere are unlike anything you've experienced before. You know how during a dream you often see familiar everyday stuff mixed with surreal weirdness? Well, Kentucky Route Zero is exactly like that, except for the fact that during a dream you're usually not aware of the weirdness, and in this game it is right before your eyes and makes the game incredibly engrossing to play.The game is mostly a linear story-driven experience with a number of optional locations to visit, some of which appear as fully realized scenes, some as text adventures. During the game you get to make choices that change the narrative in subtle ways (like, for example, defining the main character's past in one of the dialogues), and even if the consequences of those choices aren't always immediately apparent, they become more and more meaningful the longer you play. Don't expect to cause any major changes (at least not in the first two Acts), but it's still nice to be able to personalize your playthrough and connect with the characters better.The art style is gorgeous as you can probably see from the screenshots. It's one of those games where you can take a screenshot at any moment and it will serve great as a wallpaper. The game has a stylized ""aliased"" look and it's a big part of the game's charm, but if you despise jaggies with passion you can force anti-aliasing in your graphics card drivers.The soundtrack is incredibly beautiful, both the ambient music and the songs by The Bedquilt Ramblers. It's the one of the main reasons Kentucky Route Zero is so atmospheric and you won't be able to get some of these tunes out of your head for weeks.As of today four Acts have been released, all of them fantastic as far as I'm concerned. I do wish the developers would release them at a quicker pace, but if they require more time to maintain this level of quality then I can live with it. Even if the final Act takes another 2 years I feel like I've already gotten my money's worth.			"

The atmosphere is unique and engaging, and works with the sparse game mechanics. It paints a compelling, dream-like picture of decaying Appalachia with surreal and humorous events, as well as sparse but effective music choices.
