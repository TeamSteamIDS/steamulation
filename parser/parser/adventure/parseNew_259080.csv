												TROUBLESHOOTING HELP: CLICK READ MOREThis mod is AMAZING. ALL of my 145 hours of JC2 playtime is from the beta tests alone, and I only participated in a couple of them! For a mod, the sync is amazing (compared to SA-MP), and servers support thousands of players, yet it doesn't feel packed.Personally I love racing, and that's pretty much everything I do in this game. There's competition (shoutout to billman87), it's actually challenging and skill-based, while still keeping the craziness of Just Cause.IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME:Check the troubleshooting page in the wiki: http://wiki.jc-mp.com/TroubleshootingCheck the troubleshooting forums: http://www.jc-mp.com/forums/index.php/board,316.0.htmlGoogle your problem (error code etc)Join the IRC chat and ask (AND WAIT!!!): http://www.jc-mp.com/chat/ "

												You'll obviously need to own Just Cause 2 before you can play this. Even at full price, you're still getting a huge bang for your buck. This free mod will provide you with dozens of hours of rich entertainment.When it was in beta, the test servers got thousands of players on at the same time. Now, the game's considerably downsized to a fraction of what it used to be. Far from dead, but far from it's prime. So, we need you - to help grow the community. There are plenty of servers which offer unique twists to the gameplay -*servers where you can build your own content with the data (buildings, models etc) contained within the game*servers to go absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in *servers where you practice Air traffic control*servers where you must join a faction and battle with your enemies to take over the world*servers where you must survive, Day-Z styleand much more.So, if you own JC2, it's almost an obligation to install this 30mb FREE mod. I already have 100+ hours of gameplay with this, and I'm not a particularly hardcore gamer most of the time.			"

												HOW TO: DING DONG DOUBLE NOSCOPE WARSStep 1: Gather 3 other people.Step 2: Go to the giant♥♥♥♥♥bridge in the mountains.Step 3: Go in teams of 2 to either end of the bridge.Step 4: Two people should spawn in buses, preferrably the Ding Dong Double.Step 5: The other two people jump on top of the two Ding Dongs, sniper rifles in hands. Step 6: The buses progress on different lanes at normal paces towards each other.  Step 7: The two snipers on top of the buses begin shooting at each other as the buses speed towards each other (REMEMBER: NOSCOPES ONLY.  SCOPERS ARE JOKERS)Step 8: The two Ding Dongs collide with each other in a blaze of glory (to the sound of Through The Fire And The Flames if possible).  From this point onwards, ANYTHING GOES.Thus continues the battle until either someone's Ding Song or Sniper dies.  Oh and you can also fly tractors off blimps into the sunset if that's your style.

												Just Cause 2 Multiplayer is revolutionary. No other game offers the same level of insane chaos this game can muster.From the moment it began as a mod after being backward engineered by Trix it was obvious to many that the potential was huge. During the beta tests Just Cause 2 Multiplayer gained a cult following and developed a keen audience eager to play and experiment with others in a massively diverse and interesting game world.Personally I have played Just Cause 2 Multiplayer in so many different ways it's astounding that it really is just one game. I've played with friends experimenting with the grapple and laughed my head off. I've arranged Destruction Derby that were so successful the developers made a gamemode out of it. I've participated in some of the biggest, most insane mass racing, skydiving and faction wars I've ever witnessed in a game. I've performed solo and combination stunts with friends while co-ordinating over voice chat. I've went on a kill spee with my trusty sniper rifle and noscpoe killed hundred of enemies (other players at the airport).It truely is an amazing game with almost no limitations: the biggest is probably your imagination.If you thought Just Cause 2 was good then you're gonna be blown away by the multiplayer with 100+ players on a server. It's something special.			"

												Just Cause 2 is an amazing game with great assets and a beautiful world. So by extension, the multiplayer mod carries all of those things over with the ability to play with others. However, the mod suffers from one huge problem.A complete lack of decent, fun, substantive servers.It's not a flaw in the mod itself, but when it comes down to it virtually every server is nothing more than chaotic free-roam madness, explosions and random deathmatch-ing. These can be fun for a while, or a laugh with some friends, but not really anything to sink your teeth into.But then I came across 'Real Life Server'. I highly suggest anyone who is new to the game, or has played before and had their fill of chaotic freeroaming to check the server out. It takes all the great assets, objects, scenery, vehicles and weapons from the base game and it turns it into something else; something substantive, with progression, factions, ranks, personal vehicles,  territory, captures, realism. An arsenal of custom features and mechanics that can be seen nowhere else, and a dedicated playerbase with tens of thousands of hours between them. For me, and many others, the entire mod lives or dies with this server - the only server which has taken everything Just Cause 2 had to offer and turned it into something truly unique and interesting. I wholeheartedly reccomend anybody checking out the mod tries it out. It is truly the only server in this mod with any worthwhile content.			"

												I've never laughed so hard in a game before.  The boost animation itself makes this game worth checking out. Use the boost in a speed boat and you literally can find yourself flying through the air for 10 seconds.  Then abandon ship and deply your chute while you watch your boat become a missle into the nearest tree :)  A good pvp game on super full servers, but otherwise a nice exploration/mess around type of game.

												First 2 minutes on a server with 924 players: I spawn mid-air and slowly parachute myself down to a safe and isolated part of an island below. Shortly after trying to get my bearings straight, I noticed a player controlled helichopter flying towards me in the distance. As I anticipate its approach, I spot a flying boat in the background. Anyway, I soon grapple onto the helichopter and swung myself up, kick the player out of the cockpit and into the ocean. Within 5 seconds of assuming control the helichopter was completely annihilated by another player in a military grade transport plane. Fortunately for me, I jumped out before death can catch up with me. But my excitement was short lived thanks to a drive-by.Would I recommend? Absolutely!			"

												Chaos is the name of the game. As of writing this up, Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod is still in BETA, but it is also released to the public. Get your key at: http://www.jc-mp.com/Right now there is no story, no structure, no rhyme or reason, other than pure chaos. If you don't want to just run around mindlessly, hopping in vehicles, flying around, blowing stuff up, shooting random strangers, and seeing all hell break loose in front of your eyes, then stay away. For everyone else, come join the fun! As of now, I only see 1 server. But it is listed as X/3000 players. Yes, it would seem up to 3,000 people can be on this server at a time. I mean, how stupid would it be with just 64 players? Panau is big. I mean REAL BIG! Luckily, you can transport to different places at will with easy commands. /tp + the name of an area will instantly teleport you. For example: /tp airport2 will take you to a military airport, where you can steal some airplanes. That is if you don't get mowed down by other players first. There also other commands, like /fp which will actually allow you to play in a first person mode. And oddly, it works pretty well.  Sadly, the community for the beta is pure garbage. The chat box will be flooded with spam pretty much 99% of the time. So ignore it like a normal person would. Don't expect any questions to be answered within the game. This mod of course piggybacks off of Just Cause 2, and the download is extremely small, racking in at under 20mb. Just make sure you have Just Cause 2 installed first.As of now there are no real gameplay modes, other than the ability to join races. Everything else is just one gigantic and enormous free for all. See you all in game!This is just a small impression, and not an actual review. I will be doing a full review after the mod is officially out of beta.			"

												The firetruck is the best vechicle, it is as strong as a tank, but it has a siren and can drift at 700Km/h making the tanks cannon redundant. (Also tanks dont handle as well as the firetruck when exceeding the speed of sound).The best vechicle to win a race in is the Moped, preferably the Mosca 2000, it can corner just as well going 500Km/h as it can doing 20km/h. But if you ♥♥♥♥ up you will die.The best way to win the airplane race at the Mile High Club is to not enter the airplane race at the Mile High Club.Go to the bridge and ram double decker busses head on and hope that someone doesnt try to land a 747 at the same time.

												This is Just Cause 2, but multiplayer.With added features.Like boost that sends you flying across the map, skins that make you look badass, vehicles spawning anywhere, anytime, flying planes and jets (and cars and boats), intense PvP action, breath taking Mile High Club gun fights, International Panau Airport World War 3, factions war, races, demolition derby, skydiving, destruction, mad fun, so much more!!!Do you like Just Cause 2? Do you like MMOs? Massively like 1000+ players in one Panau Island? If yes, then IT'S TIME TO DROP BY AND JOIN THE MADNESS.Do you like flying things? Yes? Then YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. GET READY TO SEE STUFF FLYING AT 99999M/PH!!!Do you like fun loving moderators? Yes? Then ONCE AGAIN THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THAT. WATCH THE MODERATORS DO BADASS STUFF LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW!Do you like lag? If not, unfortunately this mod is not for you. :(But it's worth the lag, really. This is so crazy fun, everyone should try it.By the way, play in jman's server, he is a former JC2-MP beta test moderator. Most of the moderators and developers play in that server. :D			"

												Glad to have been a small part of this project :) Funnest multiplayer (let alone mod) I have ever played, recommend it to everyone!There are many things you can do in this mod:Take part in races, derbies, teleport anywhere on the map, spawn any vehicle at any time (and also purchase any weapon or accessory) fly any vehicle (e.g fly a boat to the MHC!) walk on water, boost all over the place, build anything you desire, do epic stunts, use a TONNE of easter egg commands (such as /jesus, allows you to walk/drive on water) and CAUSE MAYHEM.

												With this mod it is possible to play the enormous world of Just Cause 2 together with thousands of other players. Have fun playing races or discovering new places. Already 5000+ players played together in 1 server. Fun times guaranteed!There are a lot of commands and extras such as playing with different characters and using extreme vehicle boosts to fly across the map in your vehicle of choice like a superhero. Everything is posible in Just Cause 2 Multiplayer!			"

Just Cause 2: Multiplayer ModBasically, this is just a Mod for you to play Multiplayer with strangers and friends. For what I played for in the past, it seems rather stable on my end, with little problems here and there, like connectivity issues. Other than that, it's rather safe to use.Want to spread chaos with your friends? Now you can!Races, Plane Races, DeathMatches? Yep!My Final Verdict?I never figured to leave a final rating on this review, especially just for a Mod. I guess a solid 9/10 of a Mod?Also, take note: There are some spoiled brats in the past who bragged about their Alienware Laptops playing this game on Ultra settings, I've met these children several times, and can be rather annoying to deal with.

												By far one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had. Of course, as an administrator of Jman100's server, I may be slightly biased.One of my favorite things about it is how casual and relaxed it can be when you're not killing people or performing stunts. Depending on the server, you can usually just roam around and explore Panau at your leisure. To be honest, I use the game as more of a chat room than a game these days. Overall, if you're into unique multiplayer experiences, or Just Cause in general, this is a must-have.			"

Though, it mightn't be as long these days because idk where the Nerd³ Servers are, those were amazing. Servers now are still quite awesome though.AI - Other players. Looking for a fight? Or dodge missiles? Go to the airport. Wanna have a rally? Go to the dish thing. There's a place for everything. Yes, even the Mile High Club. That's the Deathmatch area. Anyway, some players are calm and wanna just drive or♥♥♥♥♥♥around, or some are killing beasts. Anyone up for a road trip? xD 10/10Experience - You'll have the time of your life. Hours will fly by. Five hours will seem like five seconds. It's beautiful. 10/10Graphics - Same as Just Cause 2, except there are more explosions. >:3 8/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Same as Just Cause 2, except this doesn't have any horrible voice acting so it's an AUTOMATIC 10! Hehe. 10/10Controls - Once you get the hang of it, you'll never forget it. Q is boost for planes (you can go to 500km/h) and L Shift is boost for cars, B is buy menu. C is aim. It's cool! 10/10Overall - 9.5/10*Note, to play this game, you MUST own Just Cause 2. That's all.*Edit, good ♥♥♥♥ing lord I forgot to add in the graphics section.			"

												This is pretty much the best thing that's happened to just cause 2. The multiplayer is really fun but the novelty of just flying around spawning vehicles did eventually wear off for me. BUT THEN I found a survival server, which changes the gameplay sooo much for the better in my opinion, you have the usual health, hunger and thirst bars that you have to keep an eye on. There is a good, functional inventory system with a variety of items to find. You have to find lockpicks to unlock cars for the first time. All of this is awesome because it really adds value to certain aspects of the game, because you don't allways have a vehicle or a gun with ammunition.  Really recommend getting Just Cause 2 in order to get this mod which of course is free haha, and definatly check out survival servers because they are a load of fun with friends.			"

However next gen GTA V might rise and stomp this game but who knows, I'll keep playing this because it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Even though it's from 2010, the graphics look better then most games released today.Honestly if your a Just Cause 2 player and you don't have this, just uninstaill the game and go put yourself in prison, because it's a crime to ignore this mod.Thank you the devs of this mod, thank you.

												  #_# The multiplayer mod is terrific. The graphics are beyond good and are rendered pretty good. The unlimited possibilities in multiplayer mode allows for so much gameplay and the use of different types of vehicles in different terrains. The physics aren't to shabby and are actually pretty fun to watch your motorcycle fall from a cliff, plunge in an ocean,  or ram into the side of a building. You can practically drive a boat through land with boost of course. There isn't much storyline to the mod though but I have yet to get bored of the mod. Better than Just Cause 2 in my opinion. I'd recommend this game to those that want to screw around and ride fast through amazing sceneries. It's a favorite pastime of mine.8/10 "

												Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod is not anything special but it's a nice addition to the original game. As far as i know the only goal in the mod is to drive or fly around and kill other players, so obviously don't expect GTA5.The multiplayer mod is not worth getting the original game for but If you already own Just Cause 2 it doesn't hurt to try it at least once.

												Very fun. In my opinion much more fun than the singleplayer. I think that everyone finds spawning vehicles and flying with them at incredible speeds fun(except people with motion sickness).You can do so many things. Like mini games! There are many different types of mini games that you can play with your friends and compete!Overall - I think the multiplayer ""mod"" for JC2 is great!			"

												When I first saw this game I thought that it would be a cool game to play if I had nothing else to do and I thought; Hey the graphics are nice, so why not? So I bought the game and it just sat in my library for about 6 months and I didn't touch it. Then my friend bought it and I decided that I would give the game a try. It blew my mind, the graphics were beyond what I thought was possible for this game and just the feel of the game makes me feel like the Devs actually put time and effort into the game. Now I know that I only have a couple hrs (at the time of the review) and I probably shouldn't be able to judge, but the game is just way too good to not write a review. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.

I have been part of the JC2 beta tests ever since they started doing public tests for people who owned Just Cause 2, and it has been such a blast to help out in testing and finalizing this big project. I hope that everybody who was part of developing this mod make it big in what they want to do...because all of them are friendly and very smart. Good job guys, in adding new life to a game that was not very well known in the general gaming community. Once this project is out, and finalized...

												Only now am I realizing how much time I've sunk into this. Just Cause 2: MP Mod is just that. A multiplayer mod for Just Cause 2. Now you can play with other people in Panau. Some servers have objectives, others don't. Gone are the missions, and all you're left with is a world to explore and wreak havoc on with other people. Here are a few reasons why you should get the MP mod.1. You're playing Just Cause 2 with other people. Honestly, if that isn't a good point, I don't know what is.2. It's free.3. The download size is like 30 MB (other than the space JC2 takes up). It won't take up much space and it's awesome.4. Some servers have some great stuff. AKA Boosts, which can make your vehicle go insanely fast, making boats fly and driving too much fun. Also, some servers have buy menus, where you can choose whatever item you want, whatever character model, which provides endless possiblities. Also, racing, manhunt matches, and teleporting to places in the map.The MP mod is everything you love about JC2 but with people playing with you. The only ""problems"" with this is that it crashes like no tomorrow. It could be 5 minutes after launching the game, it could be 50. Crashes WILL happen, and the risk is heightened by boosting into walls and♥♥♥♥♥♥ which I do a lot of. Also, the chats in the big servers are plagued with people arguing about alienware, so don't expect having a fun conversation. But seriously, if you have JC2, and you want to play it with friends, download this. This is basically an open-world romp you can play with friends until GTA Online comes out for the PC. "

												Alright, played an hour of the mod, here are my impressions:Just Cause 2, the base game, is extremely fun and huge and beautiful, everything a sandbox game should be. The multiplayer mod is all those things as well - however...There are no NPCs. That means no civilians to hassle or cops to hassle you. At first I was annoyed by this (what's the point of a sandbox destruction game if there is no one to stop you?) but I realized that in the bigger servers, other players function just as well as civilians and cops. The server I was in had over a thousand people, and the max capacity of the server was apparently 10,000 - but who knows if that's really possible. Anyway, some of those 1,000 people will be jerks and try to kill you for no reason, some will just want to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up with you. Still, lack of NPCs might hurt long-term enjoyment of the game and will definitely make private/smaller servers feel like you're in a very empty world.There are no missions/quests. You can still run around the country blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and working towards 100%ing the map, but the story mode has been completely extricated from the game. This, plus the previous point, means its strictly a sandbox game now. Make your own fun. That sorta thing. If you played minecraft for ten minutes, said 'what's the point?' and uninstalled, you probably won't like this and that's fine!That being said - if you're the type of person who can make their own fun, you'll love this. Lots of racing ranging from the serious to wacky (I finished 17th in a 25-man limousine race). PvP and car hijacking from other players enabled. I was cruising along in my tank when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grappling hooked on top and yelled ""GOGOGO"" and then I drove us into a river. when we swam to the shore, he shot me right in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ face.""Why?"" I asked.""we ride together we die together""get this ♥♥♥♥ing game RIGHT NOW "

												Easily the best mod I've ever used for a game ever. Turns an amazingly fun game, into an unbeleivable experience with a 1000+ people per server. The servers never lag, and the sync across systems is absolutely beautiful. I've participated in all but one of the tests, and they were all amazing. Can't wait to spend more weekends with the beloved Just Cause 2 MP.			"

												I recommend this game. You can get basically everything you want from shop and adding the grappling hook is even more better, you can grapple to every object you want and then activate parachute and fly away. You can enjoy multiplay madness in all situations (in jungle, at mountains, at desert, at sea, at islands...). You can customize your player and add any color to your name and your vehicle. You can enjoy with other players around the world.And you can invite all of your friends in and have fun.Worth every euro.			"

												Its a great multiplayer experience! insane and simply hilarious! and i know it will only get better as newer updates are released(2013)/////////////////////////////Its now 2015, long has passed (yes long... in internet years) since the glorious days of jc2mp, dnt take me wrong game still exists and a new update is being worked on. but unfortunately like with all games player base is getting smaller and smaller has time goes by! to talk about jc2 mp you have to talk about servers, there are plenty of servers (most are pointless... and they are open...justcause!) (BUT) some of them over completely unique characteristics and game-play.Ill list the ones that are/were more memorable for me.Servers:.Jmans Build Server 192.99.6.155:7777 Once the most populated server, jmans server is mixture of building server and freeroam with alot of activities. Small events sometimes would occur were players were put togheter, like huge derbys per example!.Survival District 134.255.219.236:7435Unique server i saw it developed since the first days! its a game based on the new ""survival"" trend, pretty well toughtout, honestly was my first ever survival type game ive played and had lots of fun here! hundreds of hours spent here looking for loot, spying, making friends & enemies, raiding bases & clans! this server was brutal to new players but became a bit more easier and noob friendly has it progressed. today its one of the most popular server with a small community of players.Battle for Panau - 3 way faction war 167.114.73.3:7777 - Its still online but its pretty dead...SIMPLY THA BEST! Another unique server, spent hundreds or thousands of hours here perhaps :) A brutal action and strategy game, were the main goal is to capture enemy bases and finally their stronghold. a game were teamplay and strategy were more important then skill most times, unfortunately has been dead for many months, its a brutal game has i said before, not easy to learn which turned off many of the jc2mp new comers. today sad to say that has 0 players.Dreadmullet Racing server (now dead!)A server only dedicated to racing made by the one and only DreadMullet, even included a map editor! this server was so much fun had one of the most memorable events here, who knew just cause 2 mp could be a great racing game! skill is most important here, vehicle handling can be hard wich games the gameplay so much fun for me, unfortunately same prob has i posted above, many new commers were turned off by the difficulty level (or maybe lack of patience?)Sure u can race on everyfreeroam server in the game, but its not the same... racing in freeroam is frustrating most times, ppl just giveup after the first crash or after 2or3 checkpoints.this game will always be 10/10 for me ;) not matter if its dead or thriving, the momments spent here were memorable the devs did a great job, and the server scripters aswell. this game is about total freedom and its about what great things modders can make.

												I've been a fan of the main game Just Cause 2 and knew about the multiplayer mod for a while however only recently have I played it.Only very few hours in, I'm enjoying every minute of it. Great way to kill some time, especially if you have a bunch of friends on the same server. I thought there might be issues with latency but for the servers I have connected to so far (Australian servers), it has been great.Not all servers are the same, some are barebones with very few plugins etc on them for the game (derby, nametags, teleporting and a few others). Others can have race modes, stores (to buy weapons/vehicles/skins etc, some times these cost in-game money, sometimes they are completely free) and other funny things like boost modes for cars etc.			"

												Get this if you want to add in 100+ hours of EPIC gameplay on multiple type of servers, with each server having different objectives. Great gameplay, you can literally do anything and everything on different servers, right from surviving to ATC to ""Zombies"" mode with planes to Free Roam to Killing to random♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its an addition if you really dig multipleyer games. May not have a BIG community like other open world multiplayer games, but a few servers do have a STRONG and BIG and ACTIVE community visiting daily and spending countless hours. You can literally keep driving the entire map, find epic places to click photos(psst. screenshots) or go on a spree and keep killing. Its a fun game, with so many modes, you'd surely find something you love.			"

												There are no words. I can't say how much a love this game...Lets just say it like this.Grand Theft Auto V is crap Assassin's Creed is crap Payday is crap Batman arkham games are crap, all is crap.No words for a 2008 game. Its just incredibal what TPS games like: Assassin's Creed & Grand Theft Auto missed.The mod is relesed just about 4 days and all the gamers play it.I still didn't say anything about Watch_Dogs, now Watch_Dogs is a diffrent story, its like Assassin's Creed and Grand Theft Auto together, but more of that later.Anyway, Just Cause 2:Multiplayer Mod, what they did to it? they took the R.I.P out of the name. respawned Just Cause 2 into the gaming life, just that you'll know that ""Multiplayer Mod"" is unofficial, and the hole gaming world is after it.Thanks Steam for making a sale to this game, 3 bucks are so worth it.My rate? 7.5/10			"

												If you want mayhem, absolute, grade-A, high-purity mayhem, this is THE game :-) I have over 800hrs now on this mod, and I'm still not bored. There's just so much to do - fly boats across an airport, race around the inside of a satellite dish in tractors at 500km/h, shoot the crap out of anything that moves, go rallying around Panau's huge road network, shoot up oil rigs, etc, etc. There are some great scripts on here too: you want to do 700km/h in a golf cart? You got it, thanks to the boost script. Fancy aerial battles over snow-capped mountains with a full jet HUD? Got that too :-)This mod is free. Just Cause 2 (a great game in its own right) costs peanuts these days. Just get both and throw your social life out the window :-) If you like games like Serious Sam (particularly the early instalments), you'll love this mod. If you like The Witcher, you may find it hard to take this game as unseriously as is required :-)			"

												Just cause 2 singleplayer, Was a mad romp of explosions flight and death in a massive sandbox.This mod, unleashes everything that the singleplayer game offered, with the combined awesomeness of being able to shoot down your buddies, Team up to take down opposing teams or just generally ♥♥♥♥ around, Best of all. Its free!If you own Just Cause 2, You are doing a dis-service to yourself by not at least trying this.			"

												This is some of the most fun I've had in a game.  As long as you have an imagination, you can laugh for hours.  Largest playable area I've ever seen with very little negative space, even in the mountains there are Base camps and roads everywhere. Snow, Desert, Mountains, Beach and even the Ocean floor has models. Control Mapping is a bit crappy ( can't seperate certain keys, others invert when in a vehicle ) but it's not to bad. Hopefully the Mod fixes that down the road.  Small price for what all the game has in it.The Multi Mod is an amazing new addition to a great game missed by many (self included )			"

												This is a really awesome mod for Just Cause 2. There are alot of different server where you can do things such as road tripping, assaulting bases, free roaming and much more. The big difference between this mod and the standard is that instead of playing alone which you have to do in the standard game you can play with either random people or people that you already know or get to know in Panau. Another cool thing about this mod is that you can host your own server and run others and your own scripts on it, which can make your or others server very uniqe.And also, if you are planning on getting this mod or if you already have it, and you enjoy playing in a group of players i'd recommend that you join the group called ""UlarBoys"". It's a military group only with good and serious players. Currently there is 56 members but we are hopng to expand. We use ts3 and we usually play during 16:00-19:00 gmt 0. Send me a message if you want more info about the group or how to join us.			"

""train"" your faction members to battle with the army vehicles and battle other factions... all up to you.they are busy with inventing more stuff or adjusting some smal problems. but heyits worth buying (the just cause 2 game of course) and this is free with it (for now atleast)and if you find your favorite server, then you will experience what im talking about...    :)have fun everyone			"

												This is what GTA multiplayer always should have been. BUT BEWARE, you will get bored if you just play on freeroam servers. Servers with progressive gameplay (earning money, property, ranks) is where the real fun is at. One of them is the Real Life Server. Takes a while to get into, but it offers something no other game has right now.			"

												Not too sure where to start, but then again writing reviews about something that you personally found amazing is hard to be balanced on.For a mod, the player sync is almost perfect, sometimes your internet may mess it up, but they can help that.I will certainly be hosting a server with their availablility to host other servers.Only thing I have against it, is the fact that EVERYONE IS LITTERALLY HOSTILE... But even then, driving in Convoys with friends or Faction members, fighting and totally immersing into this amazing world is all you'll need.The Moderators are very helpful and funny.

												This is what GTA multiplayer always should have been. BUT BEWARE, you will get bored if you just play on freeroam servers. Servers with progressive gameplay (earning money, property, ranks) is where the real fun is at. One of them is the Real Life Server. Takes a while to get into, but it offers something no other game has right now.			"

												This is a really awesome mod for Just Cause 2. There are alot of different server where you can do things such as road tripping, assaulting bases, free roaming and much more. The big difference between this mod and the standard is that instead of playing alone which you have to do in the standard game you can play with either random people or people that you already know or get to know in Panau. Another cool thing about this mod is that you can host your own server and run others and your own scripts on it, which can make your or others server very uniqe.And also, if you are planning on getting this mod or if you already have it, and you enjoy playing in a group of players i'd recommend that you join the group called ""UlarBoys"". It's a military group only with good and serious players. Currently there is 56 members but we are hopng to expand. We use ts3 and we usually play during 16:00-19:00 gmt 0. Send me a message if you want more info about the group or how to join us.			"

												its epic, especialy with friends, or handy mods what makes it even more fun,just a server with 500+ players and its chaos,or a server with factions option, make your own faction. ""train"" your faction members to battle with the army vehicles and battle other factions... all up to you.they are busy with inventing more stuff or adjusting some smal problems. but heyits worth buying (the just cause 2 game of course) and this is free with it (for now atleast)and if you find your favorite server, then you will experience what im talking about...    :)have fun everyone			"

With thousands of player around the globe, in-game facility and of course, madness intact between each games!A lot of LOL moments are inside the mod, for example, boosting your car until it flies high, and I mean, REAL HIGH! (Just keep holding the button to boost, and you'll see.) :DIf you're a fan of open world multiplayer games, download this thing!If you're a fan of warping between players, download this thing!If you're a fan of chaos, download this thing!And of course, buy the game (Just Cause 2) first! :)MY RATING: 9.5/10 (Because of glitches) :)			"

Pros Fun way to blow stuff up with your friends . It's a blaze to fly a jet while your friends hangs from the bottom with their grappling hook .Cons In some servers other players can teleport right at your feet , and rocket launcher the hell outta you which spoils the fun . Again , on most servers you need to kill people or capture villages and so to collect cash for buying yourself weapons , vehicles etc. which is not fun at all =(  Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												If you own Just Cause 2 and liked it, there's no excuse for you to not try this. The word madness doesn't do it justice. The basic free roam with no game modes is enough to keep you entertained with the countless pvp encounters. There are currently only a few modes, but after it's full release there will be a variety of player created modes and servers to play on.			"

												This mod is by far one of the most unique I've seen, starting out as a small project then became official DLC that allows over 5000 players wreck havoc and hell across the world.Sadly though the servers aren't as packed with players as they used to be as the most amount of players you'll find now at most will probably be 50-60, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this ambitious mod.If you enjoyed the base game and its multiplayer, get the third game!

												This is easily one of the most awesome online experiences available on Steam. This isn't due to the game being well-constructed for a multiplayer experience, as this game is a mod allowing a single player game to be played in groups. This isn't an MMO, this isn't a team-based game, and when playing the multiplayer mod I honestly feel there is no set of objectives to fulfill and no real purpose.And this is EXACTLY where this mod shines.You don't need to have a purpose to mess around driving like crazy with some friends, moving from vehicle to vehicle at 100 MPH, or falling from 4500 feet up and landing by using a hookshot instead of a parachute.  As an open world multiplayer experience, Just Cause 2 Multiplayer is wonderful for just how crazy dumb it can get, in all the best of ways.This is especially true in instances that have such things as buying vehicles for free and the boost function. To sum it up : I flew a boat into the stratosphere. This is awesome.			"

												I was quite excited to play JC2: MP as soon as I bought JC2.. It is an aweful shame is crashes every 10 minutes and that the community is so toxic. I understand that depends what kind of server you go on, but it seems that there are 10x more servers than actual players, which sucks :/oh, and it likes to kill my JC2 game each time I crash. Great fun!			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of purchasing! It is so much fun when playing with friends and just as good on your own. The grappling hook is one of the best features of the game and allows for easy travel as well as some awesome stunts. All of this, however, would be no where near as good if there was not the option of scripts to mod the game to your will. You can travel at insanely high speeds, make Rico look like a male stripper or spawn in any vehicle, weapon or outfit that you desire and much, much more. It amazes me how this is a community made game, not made by the actual publishers of JC2. Truly spectacular. However, it is not perfect as there are some issues of lag, different players seeing different things and other minor bugs but in the grand scale of things, dont matter in the slightest. In conclusion: I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as it provides hours of fun and some great laughs as well. Well worth the buy!			"

												This mod is the best thing to happen to Just Cause 2. It is way better than GTA Online. Servers hold thousands of players, there's organized races, a currency system, and factions. You can do everything that you could do in just cause 2 but with friends. The admins and mods are really cool. When this was in beta and they were testing things out they gave everyone on the server $10,000 for putting up with bugs. If you don't have just cause 2 yet you need to buy it just so you can experience this.			"

												Share the stupid fun of grappling your way around the world with your friends! There's no real objective right now except messing around, but that's always been the appeal of JC2 anyway. Spawning vehicles and boosting them to a ridiculous speed is  a recommended new diversion (boats especially). Also it's a free bit of DLC - if you've got JC2 you've no reason to pass this one up.

Anything Just Cause 2 can do, JC2: MP can do better! The only let down to the game is that it’s attracted a mass amount of racist and homophobic people using the chat function which ruins the game a bit for me.			"

												What's not to like? This is a free mod for Just Cause 2 that allows you to play against other players on the island paradise of Panau. Besides driving, flying and essentially crashing into things at stop speed, you can create factions, buy weapons and vehicles just like in single-player story mode. If you enjoyed playing the Single-player I'm sure you'll enjoy this mod. Tethering your grappling hook from a plane to a truck while your friends are sitting in the truck will provide a great laugh. I almost forgot the ""Boost"" that every vehicle have that when things are going too slow. This causes vehicles to propel into the sky or whatever happens to be in the way.The only gripe is that the game play might be a bit lagging due to the amount of players and chaos happening.Peace.

												In terms of how brilliant this mod is, it's up there with the best gaming experiences created on existing foundations or based on unique and inspiring ideas over the past several years. Think Minecraft, DayZ, and even the likes of GoldenEye: Source, and Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod sits snuggly in-between. It's honestly one of the greatest modern-day multiplayer experiences that can be had on a computer right now.Given how cheap the base game is during Steam sales, and its compatibility - with a high level of optimisation, there's no excuses not to try this out if you haven't already.Shoot people, blow them up, drive cars off cliffs, launch boats into planes - the choice is yours. Be a lone wolf, a freedom fighter, or join a faction and try to take control of the fictional island Panau. It's your world.5/5			"

At the time of writing, JC2 is $3, so pick it up, and hop on a server. The amount of fun you can have here, you can link a plane to a scooter, and crash an dump truck into a limo, it's just very fun. The normal game's pretty okay too, but don't get it, and not get this.			"

												If you need one reason to buy Just Cause 2, this is it. From all out gun battles in the middle of the forest to dog fights high above the clouds to races out on the water, the JC2 mod is one of the best third person games I've played in a while. The one major downside to this game is that there is no passive mode and a ton of asshats. Tons of them. No seriously, let me just play the ♥♥♥♥ing game without getting shot or blown up every five seconds. Please? ;_;8.5/10			"

												What's not to like? This is a free mod for Just Cause 2 that allows you to play against other players on the island paradise of Panau. Besides driving, flying and essentially crashing into things at stop speed, you can create factions, buy weapons and vehicles just like in single-player story mode. If you enjoyed playing the Single-player I'm sure you'll enjoy this mod. Tethering your grappling hook from a plane to a truck while your friends are sitting in the truck will provide a great laugh. I almost forgot the ""Boost"" that every vehicle have that when things are going too slow. This causes vehicles to propel into the sky or whatever happens to be in the way.The only gripe is that the game play might be a bit lagging due to the amount of players and chaos happening.Peace.

Spawning vehicles and boosting them to a ridiculous speed is  a recommended new diversion (boats especially). Also it's a free bit of DLC - if you've got JC2 you've no reason to pass this one up.

So, check it out if you want to see some odd extra features and play with your friends on free servers.

												This mod is the best thing to happen to Just Cause 2. It is way better than GTA Online. Servers hold thousands of players, there's organized races, a currency system, and factions. You can do everything that you could do in just cause 2 but with friends. The admins and mods are really cool. When this was in beta and they were testing things out they gave everyone on the server $10,000 for putting up with bugs. If you don't have just cause 2 yet you need to buy it just so you can experience this.			"

												I played a decent bit of this a while ago and loved it.Not sure what is up with it now, but I cannot seem to have it loaded for longer than a few minutes before it unexpectedly crashes on me.JC2 runs great, JC2 MP is not working for me.I will come back after some updates, but it is a shame, I really enjoy the MP Mod***Edit***There are issues with my better rig and the crimson drivers, but before that I had found that the problems in this review were from Raptr and Steam community causing crashes.But it seems this game is really made for Nvidia cards, and the mod team doesn't have AMD cards at all.I am not saying this is a bad game, and I do still say you should install it... but it is really a shame that AMD users should expect some issues even right after installing.**EDIT AGAIN**Playing this on an older card with outdated drivers, and I have logged more hours on MP than the actual game.A must play for JC2 fans!

Connecting vehicles together with the grappling hook, flying to the outer space with your tank, doing roadtrips from point A to B, Murdering everyone with your fellow factionmates, racing/derbying for grand price and after that buying vehicles to drive off mountains. There's just so many things you can do.Multiplayer sync is great and very playable even with closer to 1000 players online at the same time. All of the in-game mechanisms work great.

												After several years of hype and anticipation the Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod has finally been unleashed to the public. After playing this mod even for a few minutes you will realize why this won Mod DB's mod of 2013. It's simply astonishing watching literally hundreds of players messing around the Islands of Panau at once. The options are simply limitless. Wanna race around the map with your friends? Fight to the end in a deathmatch? Or even just try to blow your mates out of the air in a plane or attack helicopter? It can all be done. Unfortunetely, it all comes at a price of lag and frequent crashes yet hopefully this will be fixed with future patches and updates. For any fan of Just Cause 2 this is a no-brainer, so go out and go play with your friends for a multiplayer experience like no other. Welcome to the jungle. Panau has fun and games.			"

												Grow a beard, go to the top of the highest mountain you can find, and fly your boat off into the sunset, almost like that one time in 1976, excluding the Goat, 15 casualties, and intoxicated Norwegian man yelling ""JEG ER DEN EVIGE WARRIOIR AV HJEMLANDET OG JEG VIL SLOSS MOT ONDSKAPEN AV MED DENNE TRESLEIV"" at the top of his lungs.

												If you loved exploring and/or exploding the vast world of Just Cause 2, then quite frankly you will love this mod. I will admit that the majority of the servers have a very similar playstyle which consists mostly of ""Go around and shoot stuff n'♥♥♥♥♥♥..with your friends!"" Though I suppose that can be very enjoyable in itself, the main fun I've had with this game are the servers that bring something special to the table:There's a server where you can choose one of the three factions from the orignal singleplayer storyline and fight a massive battle to claim the island of Panau. There's a roleplay server where you can choose a civilian job such as a pilot, taxi, merchant, etc., join one of the three gang factions OR the Enforcers/Government faction, collaborate with one of said factions to complete missions and objectives, and, of course, roleplay. There's a server that's dedicated to having all types of races on many different set tracks all over Panau (and, in fact, is one of the least laggiest servers I've yet to play on). There's a server in development (http://www.jc-mp.com/forums/index.php/topic,4859.0.html) where you have to find resources and fight others to survive (I haven't actaully played on this one but it looks pretty cool). Granted, most of these servers are among the spotlighted ones on the serverlist, but I do believe they certainly deserve to be there. My main complaint is that this is (normally) very laggy. I can easily get 40-60 FPS in the original JC2, but in this I have to turn down all of the graphical settings yet sometimes I struggle to even get 30. This can make already awkward, what with the way hits register and things, combat even more cumbersome. That said, I would still most definitely recommend playing this mod, or at least giving it a try, rather than leaving it in the dust with the rest of the un-installed tid bits in your Steam library.

												I can play this multiplayer hours. Yes, there were times when the samp was as popular. But after all this time, did not go so quality multiplayer modifications.I advise everyone to try.Such freedom of play, with a huge open-world long gone.The main thing that gives multiplayer learn all of its functions, if you want, create your own server with a unique gameplay. Or take existing scripts and combine them.			"

												It’s still stupidly fun! Spawning the largest aircraft and hoping to keep it in flight, zooming around in sports cars with people attached to your roof, among other things. Anything Just Cause 2 can do, JC2: MP can do better! The only let down to the game is that it’s attracted a mass amount of racist and homophobic people using the chat function which ruins the game a bit for me.			"

												Share the stupid fun of grappling your way around the world with your friends! There's no real objective right now except messing around, but that's always been the appeal of JC2 anyway. Spawning vehicles and boosting them to a ridiculous speed is  a recommended new diversion (boats especially). Also it's a free bit of DLC - if you've got JC2 you've no reason to pass this one up.

												Wow I can't believe I just spent 83 minutes playing this! Time flows fast when you're playing such an amazing game! It really manages to bring the original game experience into multiplayer almost flawlessly. If you own Just Cause 2, then you've probably already given it a try, if you haven't, do it now! However if you don't own Just Cause 2, I'd suggest buying it, it's really worth it, specially with this amazing mod. I've been to only one server, despite being filled with hundreds of players (though not actually full, since it can hold up to a thousand) there's a very low lag which you can live with, its only slightly annoying during PVP fights (which thrust me, you will get involved in them a LOT), but other than that, it's gorgeous. Btw, get ready to go into some damn anarchy 'cause that's all I found.tl;dr - PLAY IT!			"

												Just Cause 2 measures your success with a currency called Chaos. Once you've exhausted yourself playing the normal game after about 250 hours, you can jump over to this thing and be a part of more chaos than you've ever seen in single player. Janky as all hell, probably dependent on quality of the servers now that it's out of beta, but infinitely moddable with scripting itself, it's great.

Fly a boat at the speed of sound into the twin towers.Take over the airport by running people over in a bus while your friend offers air support from his heli.Have an old-fashioned duel and mix it up by detonating the explosives you set there earlier.Use a tank as a torpedo.The possibilities are endless.

Fell in love with it as soon as I realized I could fly a boat through the air at 700KM/H... The amount of chaos you can perform on the campaign is multiplied ten-fold on multiplayer. It got so ridiculous I clipped into the wall of the airport after flying a garbage barge at the speed of light into the airport hanger. (Basically, it's awesome.)			"

Some feature just added in server like clock, derby, and skydive but all i want is a robbery feature that would be great. And I really like this game because it's fun but its need some fixes of bugs and add like gta v feature, changing characters, customize car, customize weps, and robbery.			"

A slight problem and only a slight problem is using the grapple hook when your friend attaches a car to another car the car that is attached does not move  but instead stays were it is. That is only a slight problem that i have which can probabely be fixed quite easily :)			"

												The mayhem of Just Cause 2's sandbox world, shared with hundreds (sometimes *thousands*) of players simultaneously? Yes please!This free add-on for Just Cause 2 turns the originally single-player only game into a massive multiplayer slugfest. Able to handle hundreds (or even thousands) of players simultaneously in the same game world, the mod thrusts players into a madcap symphony of combat and destruction.Parachute into the Panau International Airport and marvel at the aerial acrobatics of would-be pilots and the antics of those on the ground who would foil their lofty plans. Jump into a race at the racetrack, or join the fray in a demolition derby in the iconic communication dish. Use the infamous grappling hook to throw a monkey wrench into the works.Summon weapons and vehicles to add your own mischief to the mix, and choose from a variety of character models & skins to customize your appearance.Extendable via Lua scripts on both the client and server, this mod brings an incredible multiplayer experience to a game nobody thought would ever have multiplayer at all. It's a technological marvel and a real blast to play!			"

However, it is missing one thing. Being able to fly 2 jets into eachother while tied to sportscars with a war going on top of their hoods.This is what this mod adds.Well, it adds a hell of a lot more than that, sure.

												Hilarious but hollow.This is a game that tires you of it very quickly. Playing alone, I don't bother with it for more than 10 minutes at a time. But with friends, the fun never ends, which is definitely a plus being that there is a lot of fun to be had.You have a massive 400 square kilometer map full of vehicles to spawn and players to shoot and parachutes to glide on and planes to fly (and boats too, if you can boost...) and explosions galore. It's prone to crashing occasionally, but it's to be expected, fresh out of beta with servers hosting 1000+ players at a time.If you have Just Cause 2, the choice should be obvious. Try the game. You won't regret it.			"

												The first time I logged into the beta server all those months ago I was greeted with a flaming passenger jet hurtling past my screen. The lag was terrible, shots wouldn't hit anything and the rocket launcher was insanely overpowered. Yet, despite all this I had the most fun I'd had in a game for ages.In the subsequent beta tests the lag became far less noticable and in the prerelease version it was down to no more than internet speed. One should approach this game as something akin to Planetside 2; but as one constant battlefield, with no commander and the ability to spawn a Hercules Jet whenever you want. This game is the embodiment of chaos, and I loved every second of it.			"

												Do you have an Alenware PC? If so, enjoy your 5 septillion FPS. Everyone else not running on a potato/toaster/shoe, enjoy ~100 FPS, or ~60 under load. Quite an enjoyable experience, although with the release players per server are down. This has the positive effect of reducing lag and increasing hit accuracy, but at the same time finding anyone at all in the continent-sized map can be a chore, and with no AI filling the streets it can feel more lonely than singleplayer at times. (This can be a benefit, as when you finally do encounter someone they'll be far less likely to shoot on sight, if only for the world to not feel completely alone.) The fact that the JC-MP team was able to create something this amazing from a singleplayer game is an impressive feat, and the 3+ year waiting time was worth it. If you already own Just Cause 2 you have nothing to lose by trying it, it's free and absolutely tiny. I hadn't even finished closing the install dialog before it finished installing on my then-modest 1.5 Mb/S download speed.			"

												Do you have an Alenware PC? If so, enjoy your 5 septillion FPS. Everyone else not running on a potato/toaster/shoe, enjoy ~100 FPS, or ~60 under load. Quite an enjoyable experience, although with the release players per server are down. This has the positive effect of reducing lag and increasing hit accuracy, but at the same time finding anyone at all in the continent-sized map can be a chore, and with no AI filling the streets it can feel more lonely than singleplayer at times. (This can be a benefit, as when you finally do encounter someone they'll be far less likely to shoot on sight, if only for the world to not feel completely alone.) The fact that the JC-MP team was able to create something this amazing from a singleplayer game is an impressive feat, and the 3+ year waiting time was worth it. If you already own Just Cause 2 you have nothing to lose by trying it, it's free and absolutely tiny. I hadn't even finished closing the install dialog before it finished installing on my then-modest 1.5 Mb/S download speed.			"

												Never had so much fun playing a multuplayer game with friends. So many fun things that you can do with your friends. A slight problem and only a slight problem is using the grapple hook when your friend attaches a car to another car the car that is attached does not move  but instead stays were it is. That is only a slight problem that i have which can probabely be fixed quite easily :)			"

												The mayhem of Just Cause 2's sandbox world, shared with hundreds (sometimes *thousands*) of players simultaneously? Yes please!This free add-on for Just Cause 2 turns the originally single-player only game into a massive multiplayer slugfest. Able to handle hundreds (or even thousands) of players simultaneously in the same game world, the mod thrusts players into a madcap symphony of combat and destruction.Parachute into the Panau International Airport and marvel at the aerial acrobatics of would-be pilots and the antics of those on the ground who would foil their lofty plans. Jump into a race at the racetrack, or join the fray in a demolition derby in the iconic communication dish. Use the infamous grappling hook to throw a monkey wrench into the works.Summon weapons and vehicles to add your own mischief to the mix, and choose from a variety of character models & skins to customize your appearance.Extendable via Lua scripts on both the client and server, this mod brings an incredible multiplayer experience to a game nobody thought would ever have multiplayer at all. It's a technological marvel and a real blast to play!			"

												This mod is extremely fun, but needs lots of improvemend. It's so fun becuase of the possibilities. Jump on your friend' plane, crash your vechicles, have dogfights and so much more. You can spawn many vechicles, and in most servers they are free. If you play it alone, it might bore you after a few minutes. I play this, but I'm not sure if I would pay more the €5. It's a good thing it's free to play, the biggest downside is the lag. No matter what ping.			"

												Sejauh ini.The best multiplayer game ever!!!Game ini bener - bener sempat bikin gua ketagihan!!Multiplayer ini sebenernya mod, jadi servernya banyak dan pada setiap server punya cara main berbeda.Server favorit gua adalah ""SURVIVAL DISTRICT""Server itu bener-bener ajaib.dengan game ini lu bisa main game survival!! bertahan hidup antar sesama user!!kalian bisa bekerja sama dengan orang lain, mencari suplai makanan, minuman, peluru, dll!!kalian bisa buat markas disini!!Kalian harus coba game ini! dengan peta yang bener-bener luas, kalian ga akan nyeselmain game ini!! walaupun, gua cuma suka multiplayernya aja...hehe10/10			"

												Honestly this game is really fun. The amount of multiplayer servers there are is awesome. The MP mod is what makes this game fun. My favorite has to be Faction!! I didnt really play the single player but its a good game overall.			"

												Just Cause 2 allows an individual to break away from the shackles of story and responibilities and just shoot/drive/soar/destroy... repeat to thier hearts content. JC2-MM allows you to bring a friend and turns whats left of your sanity off while you fly in a boat over an airship while firing rockets.			"

												All i can say is that this mod is amazing (and the game itself). a long time ago i got just cause 2 for the xbox 360 on my birthday, i was very happy and instantly tried to join my freinds game.it OBVIOUSLY didn't work (as everyone else but me knew at the time :/ ) so after i heard about that i could only play singleplayer, i personally dont really like to play on my own as i find it boring, i was quite upset. but i just got this game and i am very pleased how people can make a originally singleplayer game multiplayer. There are so many possiblilities of what to do with your freinds totally reccomend it!!! :)			"

												All i can say is that this mod is amazing (and the game itself). a long time ago i got just cause 2 for the xbox 360 on my birthday, i was very happy and instantly tried to join my freinds game.it OBVIOUSLY didn't work (as everyone else but me knew at the time :/ ) so after i heard about that i could only play singleplayer, i personally dont really like to play on my own as i find it boring, i was quite upset. but i just got this game and i am very pleased how people can make a originally singleplayer game multiplayer. There are so many possiblilities of what to do with your freinds totally reccomend it!!! :)			"

												Just Cause 2 allows an individual to break away from the shackles of story and responibilities and just shoot/drive/soar/destroy... repeat to thier hearts content. JC2-MM allows you to bring a friend and turns whats left of your sanity off while you fly in a boat over an airship while firing rockets.			"

												Never have I ever played a game so complete with a rich and in depth storyline.You start off as a lowly man who, through the power of friendship, becomes a barge spawning God. After learning this, we slowly watch the main character go through many moral dilemmas, learning who deserves the magical gift of a barge and who is not worthy.He then learns how to change his form to disguise himself, to help protect his identity from those who wish to destroy he who weilds many barges.A wonderful story about love, friendship, and the power of boats on land.10/10 would barge again			"

												As if singleplayer wasn't chaotic enough, now you have dozens of more people destroying the world of Just Cause 2. But what makes it so much better? Well, apart from the constant crashes, the unfriendly community, there's just a whole world waiting to be explored and shot at. You can see if you play this game you'll get a rare case of EXPLOSIONZ and maybe a little bit of EXPLOSIONZ and rarely EXPLOSIONZ. GET DIS NOAW (aswell as Just Cause 2 singleplayer, cuz that's just as fun).			"

This mod makes JC2 into multiplayer (as you guessed). It allows 200+ Players to be flying and parachooting around Panau all at once.For a FREE Mod this is just unbelievabla dn with JC2 only costing a few pounds in the often sales its stupid not to try it.

												It's janky, it's broken, and my god does it crash a lot, but there is something special about this game. It's pure Anarchy in video game form. No sense, no logic; just a pure chaotic wasteland of explosions and random acts of violence. It's a work of art with a giant tear straight down the middle. If you have a few friends and are willing to look past it's flaws, Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod is an unmissable experience.			"

												If you own Just Cause 2, you really should try out this mod. And if you don't own Just Cause 2, you really should consider grabbing it! It's on sale frequently and even when it's not on sale it's absolutely worth it.Both the Singleplayer and the Multiplayer are an absolute blast. In multiplayer it's just pure, complete chaos, and it's absolutely brilliant. Have you ever fantasized about spawning a boat in mid air, then proceed to accelerate up to 700 km/h and fly through the air while telling gravity to suck it? No? Well, either way you still can!My favorite part of this mod is letting me pretend I'm a icecream salesman driving a Tuk Tuk-Laa vehicle fitted with a booster to make it go ridiculously fast. So fast, that I usually end up blowing the thing up within a minute. But that's okay, because it takes me just 2 seconds to spawn a new one and carry on!What I'm trying to say is: Get this game, and this mod. You will not regret it.			"

												This mod is really only good if you can join a server with friends. Playing alone is about as interesting as watching grass grow. You may as well play the base game if you are going to do that. There are far to many kids in the servers that try to ruin your good time. If you happend to mistype where you want to teleport to and it shows up in chat, the lonely hearts club starts showing up there like it is a free buffet of smarties for a bunch of fat kids and they just won't give you a break until you move on to soemwhere else. The game will dump you for no reason and has a reporting system, so hope hopefully the developers pay attention to that. Once you get dumped a couple times in a row the game will run smooth.My advice is get some freinds, get on Teamspeak or whatever you have and have laugh because it can be alot of fun. "

												My own experience overall;      It can be fun sometimes, but it gets incredibly booring after exploring the whole map. It doesn't have things like missions to do, if you expect ""cooperative"" gameplay. There's more exploring experience than actual gameplay.       There's a little community, you can actually find some people to play, and maybe make them your friends. Anyway, the community is 50/50 (idiots & friendly).       From my own experience I'd rather to not play it too often, due of its lack content. Is it fun to give it a try for a few good hours.                                       PROS:               Different mods               Even a potato can run it               Fun with friends                                       NEGATIVES:               Gets booring fast               After exploring the whole map, you'll see that there's not soo much to do.   I was a bit skeptical about giving it Positive or Negative.

												Everyone knows Just Cause 2. Attack a base 1, 2. Shoot down a Helicopter 3, 4. See a custzene 5, 6. Bam! Nothing changed. The fun moments definitely come from messing stuff up. Like hooking a motorcycle to a plane and then singing ""I came in like a wrecking ball"" with a horrible voice while smashing it into crowds of people. Or hooking up a bus to a plane and abducting it, then dumping it on the giant Zeppelin. Or... you get the idea.This is that. On drugs. With cheats for everyone. With everyone. And I'm talking servers with 100+ population. It runs great even with dozens of players in one area (usually airport) and is just so much fun.			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												So here is what I'm thinking, If i can fly with a boat while my friend attaching from behind with a school bus, This mode ( That some how better then the game) Is the best mode/ Game i ever play in my whole life, And the flying boat is just a small thing, You can race do crazy stuff( Flying with a boat xD)  and get money by killing noobs i cant beleive how stupid the guy who made JC2 withont thinking about that mode him self, THIS is the best reason why should you buy JC2 ( where else you can fly with a boat while play a multiplayer).

												Original game is a pile of SHIIIIIIIIT.But the multiplayer mod which got some awards, is freakin' awesome.Server environments are so perfect that can accept over 3000 players without lags.I think dat JC2's map was developed to use in multiplayer mod, not in the original one.We can enjoy beautiful sights of the map with many players and ride various vehicles.I love this mod.BEST MULTIPLAYER MOD EVEEEEEEEEERRRRR.Can I buy just a multiplayer mod only, Square Enix?
