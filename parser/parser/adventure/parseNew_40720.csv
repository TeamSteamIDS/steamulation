												I'm writing a review for this now because I know the 3rd is coming sometime next year. I absolutely love EVERYTHING that Amanita games comes out with. Despite how short this game is, every minute is a fantastic experience. Everything is so charming and so much heart is put into everything they do. Definitely recommend everything from Amanita.			"

												Most of what makes this game great is its style. It is a very simple point and click adventure game with no dialogue and its puzzle are mostly just a small roadblock to getting to the next area and seeing the new scenery. You can play the first Samorost here for free: http://amanita-design.net/samorost-1/That should give you some idea of the style (though the second game is longer, rather more polished and with more sensible puzzles). The demo for Samorost2 is here: http://amanita-design.net/samorost-2/ "

Short version: 73%Samorost 2 has astonishing art style and fun puzzle/adventure mechanics, but it is too short even for the budget price range.Long version:Amanita Design, in a sense, is a one–trick pony company that makes surreal, textless, and speechless point ‘n’ click puzzle games. Luckily, said trick is a seemingly endless imagination, reflected in each of their products; Samorost 2 (the sequel to their first game which is freely available on their web page[amanita-design.net]) being no exception. This incredibly short room-by-room type point ‘n’ click game has an almost childishly simple story: the protagonist’s dog gets kidnapped, and he travels to another asteroid to save his pet. But Samorost 2 isn’t really about the plot; the real content is the creativity. There is more of it present in the alien landscapes (and all the little details they are filled with) than in many large-budget AAA titles. And Samorost 2 manages to present it all under an hour, leading to a really concentrated experience. Sure, it has its price too, but if you like games a little more on the artistic side, then Amanita delivers yet again.			"

												Highly recommend this Point & Click adventure!It is short, sweet and nasty and from the makers of Machinarium and Botanicula. Nice sound and at minimum (if you know it all) about 30mins, but took me well over an hour, even with the occassional cheating, I must admit.I found Machinarium easier than this one, but it hasn't got such a sad ending than the former.You got no hints as in Machinarium and this time you are a little dwarf on your mission to save your dog from alien abuse.Some people rightly complain that too often objects seem to fall out of thin air rather than having an understandable mechanism behind it (unlike Machinarium and the first half of Samorost2).Intelligent game, not only for kids - but a must buy for the own kids. Funny and witty and not too expensive for showing support to an Indie Game. - If people spend big Dollars on cheap Multiplayer Map Shooters (which act as nothing but cash cows for the big brands).

Samorost 1 is free-to-play at the developer's website, HERE[amanita-design.net], along with several other short adventures.I really love games by Amanita, with Botanicula currently being by favorite.  They're quirky, they're cute, and they're fun to figure out.The Samorost games contain my favorite character, the space gnome, but be aware that the first two are very short, and among the first created by the company.  (See the full rundown of release dates on Amanita's wiki HERE[en.wikipedia.org].)  The earliest titles were made to be browser-based flash games, which is why the Samorost 2 playing area takes up a smallish area of the screen (if you have your destop set at 1920x1080, anyway.)The game will open up full-screen with a black background, but if you hit the Esc button, it will play windowed.  Gameplay itself consists of finding clickable areas, then figuring out the correct sequence -- and sometimes timing -- to allow you to progress.There are seven levels to complete, and as you start each one, you will be given a level code so that you can return to that area if you need to turn off the game, or just feel like revisiting.  You can find the walkthrough HERE[samorost2.blogspot.com], and the level codes are the first thing you'll see, so no worries if you don't want spoilers. ;)In closing, Samorost 2 is a short, fun romp through one of Amanita's earliest games.  I personally would not pay full price for the game unless I was buying directly from the developers in order to support them, and recommend getting it on sale.  Definitely looking forward to Samorost 3!			"

												Samorost 2 is short. It's going to resonate differently with each individual. I personally found nothing particularly fantastic about it. The original Samorost sets itself apart by using close-up photographs of various objects, mostly forestial, to create the illusion of large landscapes. Samorost 2 relies more on a traditional hand-drawn approach, and struggles to be as visually interesting as the first game, which is available for free on the Amanita Design website.Samorost 2's music, as usual for an Amanita game, is top-notch, and one of its highlights.There are only a handful of puzzles in the game, and the design is problematic in certain areas. For example, the point-and-click interface allows you to click anywhere on the screen to interact with any object - yet for certain objects, it requires your little hero character to be standing in a certain area, making it easy to dismiss something as non-interactive when in fact you were just incorrectly positioned.And the very last puzzle of the game is a frustrating chore - it's a timing-based puzzle, already something I don't care for, and if you get it wrong, which is highly likely as it takes a bit of trial-and-error to figure out, you have to grind out the game's previous puzzle to get back into the situation needed to try your luck again. The previous puzzle involves collecting animal farts. Of the 90 minutes I played the game, I spent maybe 30 minutes collecting animal farts. That kind of pisses me off.So I can't really recommend the game. It's not exciting, challenging, or visually appealing enough to merit even a short playthrough, and spending money on it seems silly. It should have been a free flash release. Skip this and play the excellent Machinarium.4/10			"

												Mission impossible for a space gnome to rescue his dog and return home. Amazing sound effect and genius level design + unusual graphics make this 30 minute point and click advanture game quite fun and entertaining. I heard there is a Samorost 1 and Samorost 3 so I will keep my eyes out for them so I can play them in the future as this little short game is wonderfully excecuted.The price however seems quite high for just 20-40 minutes of enjoyment so this game will lose a lot player from this.For this game sometime you have to throw common logic out of the window and make space gnome logic in order to solve some puzzles.7.5/10 for short and quick fun.

												Samorost 2 is pretty cool. People will go on and on about it, out-snobbing each other with cries of BURRR THIS IS A FLASH GAME IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON NEWGROUNDS, REAL GAMES FOR HARDCORE GAMERS ONLY PLEASE!!!!, but ignore them. They're dumb.I love the way Amanita Design makes their games - a lot of love clearly went into the worldbuilding. You're a little man in his PJs exploring floating mushrooms that have been uprooted from the ground and left in space! Your spaceship is made out of a discarded can of weenies! There's a sewage tank and the water stains look like a pastoral farmscape! So many little beautiful details that are worth the price of admission alone.I'm not so much a fan of the puzzle-solving. Most of the puzzles are fine and are nice little breaks from the art, but sometimes they are a bit of a pain when trying to decipher context clues in a small Flash window. (FYI, this game was released ten years ago and it holds up well, though it's hard to see things sometimes.) Sometimes, there's areas that you need to click on that weren't clickable before and the game doesn't bother to tell you whether or not they're activated. It's not a perfect system, but it's fine.Samorost 2 is uneven but overall fine. If you want something with more difficulty, check out their games Machinarium and Botanicula. There will be a sequel for this one coming out very soon, too.			"

												Samorost was originally released in 2003 and it is still available on Amanita Design's website. This is the only game in the series that is available as a free game. Samorost 2, released 6 years later, continues the journey of our gnome-like protagonist who sets out to retrieve his stolen dog from aliens.Although very short, Samorost is a great point-and-click adventure game which has a very unique artwork. The gameplay is very simple - we look for clickable objects on every screen and try to solve the puzzles that represent obstacles before Gnome could proceed any further to reach his goal. I really like the game's surrealistic world with its unique creatures - above all, Gnome itself, who lives on an asteroid full of plants.The game was designed in flash, hence the use of macromedia player when the game is launched. Also, the game omits any achievements or additional challenges. While the game offers the ""play again"" option you do not click on it because there are things you haven't seen in the game's roughly 2-hour long journey - you start again to see how very well it is designed (albeit everything in it is minimalistic) and to listen to its great accompanying ambient music.It is a tad bit expensive for 5 euros, however, if it is on sale it is a great purchase. I look forward to seeing how Amanita continued the adventure in the 3rd episode.			"

												Samorost 2 is a point-and-click adventure game that is worth playing because of its level design, music and puzzles. On the other hand, the plot isn't intriguing (you're a sort of Little Prince living in a tiny planet and your mission is to rescue your dog, given that it was kidnapped by some aliens that stopped by to catch some fruits) and the game is too short (I bet you won't take longer than two hours to beat it). Besides that, Samorost 2 may be remembered mainly because of its atmosphere: both the classy soundtrack and the environment overgrown with wild roots and strange creatures are moving and unique. So, if you're into point-and-click games and feel like enjoying some art work, even though for a couple of hours, this game will surely be a hell of a ride for you.			"

With that kind of life-span the $5 price tag isn't exactly reasonable.  However, that being said, this is a dev team worth supporting.  So if you consider the fact that you're supporting a job well-done, as well as likely jobs well-done in the future, it doesn't feel like such a rip-off.

												A fun little game by the people at Amanita Design, I’m getting to be quite a fan of Amanita Designs work and after Machinarium I started looking into their games a little further. After a little digging I found this.The first one can actually be played online for free, if you are interested. It’s a lot like this one, just a different story to it.It’s a fun little point and click adventure game with a very interesting art style to it, this weird and wonderful kind of thing is what these developers do best, and they never fail to impress me.Storyline wise this little series isn’t the greatest or most griping, but the gameplay itself and that sense of wonder and wanting to explore is what makes these little games interesting. It’s fun to play around with and see what things do. The puzzles are fun and unique and in general I would say these aren’t my favourite Amanita Design games but I still appreciate them.			"

												The first Samorost game is free, browser-based and available on the Amanita Design website - http://amanita-design.net/samorost-1/ - whether you enjoy this or not should be a reasonable (though not watertight) indicator of how you'll feel about 2.In Samorost 2 you guide a space gnome on an adventure through various environments/scences, solving puzzles, all in hopes of rescuing his dog. And that's more-or-less all there is to it.Samorost 2 is a short game and I have criticised other games for being too short/simplistic to be worth it.. but I can't bring myself to do that here. Everything about this game is just too damn charming to me. The artwork is gorgeous, the music is relaxing and I enjoy the quirky atmosphere, creatures and puzzles enough to justify it.Another valid point, though, is that there's very little guidance - this will appeal to some and not to others. For the most part, I quite like working out what it is I have to do in a scene (even if that involves mousing over everything to find out what I can interact with first ;), but I appreciate that not everyone feels the same way - preferring a clear objective.So while I do definitely recommend Samorost 2, it's worth keeping in mind that it's a short game with little direction in each scene, making it not worth it for some.

												The whole world inhabited by the main character is so overwhelmingly immersive and charming that I hope there are many more installments to come.This one is short and sweet. If you haven't played the third one already, start here. The puzzles aren't too tough. You just need to use common sense most of the time. But most importantly of all you must be observant. Samorost makes it a joy to explore. Watch as the fragile blooms shudder at the mere passing of your cursor. It's a tiny detail, but it helps make you feel as if you are really interacting with these bizarre living worlds.In this game, you must rescue your dog from a small group of greedy something or others and return home. Like I said, it's a really simple game all in all. But I'm so overly confident that people of all ages will enjoy it, and I know that the vast majority will go on to play the third one - which is even better. As pretentious as it sounds, this game is in truth a piece of art. 9/10			"

The puzzles can't be figured out short of pixel-hunting or guide-checking. For this style of game, check out Machinarium (by the same guys, Amanita Design), which I highly recommend.Pros:+ visuals+ music+ story (it's cute, and well communicated without words)Cons:- too many timing-based puzzles- non-intuitive interface- final puzzle is annoyingly punishingI did enjoy my play-through, though I admit that I needed the guide to get through it (I don't have the patience any more).

												The only correct word to describe this game is ""Charming."" In this age of advanced graphics and immense budgets, it is difficult to find a game that is atmospheric enough to immerse you in its world or setting as well as Samorost 2 does without the aid of state-of-the-art 2010's cuputing technology (That is not to devalue such games; there are masterpieces among them). I must begin by stating that,  although, for all intents and purposes, it is a ""G-rated"" game,  it is NOT just for children. In theory it is suitable for them, but young children would become frustrated by it's difficulty.  In hindsight, it probably isn't suitable for children, as it does contain a man who smokes wild, touch-sensitive mushrooms. So there. Not a children's game. You can play it. No-one will laugh at you.  I rarely play point-and-click adventure games, but I must concede that this one is making me re-consider the credibility of the medium as a  whole. As you can see from the screenshots, the game's visuals are comprised mostly of backgrounds created from stitched-together phoographic elements with meticulously hand-drawn aimated elements in the foreground. The game is not wholly 2-Dimensional, however, as certain interactions will cause the characters to move further away or closer. This art style in combination with the varied and highly atmospheric ambient music gives the game an excellent ""feel"" when played for the first time, and the clarinet in particular is put to good use in portraying the mood of the characters.The puzzles are challenging but not impossible, and most require you to think ""outside the box,"" with a few involving the need for careful timing or requiring you to complete steps in a certain order which, although often unclear to begin with, will have real consequences, causing you to have to repeat an often difficult section if you fail to execute the steps in order or in time. The solutions are often amusing, and the cut-scenes that follow equally so. However, I must admit to consulting the walkthrough occasionally. Mostly this was due to my own inability to see a solution, but sometimes it was because it is not clear what can be interacted with and what cannot. This leads me to my one real complaint: The fact that it is not always clear what can be interacted with and what cannot results in same ""pixel-searching"" on the part of the player, whereby one clicks systematically on every object visible on the screen before proceeding to click on every five-millimetre-square section of screen-space boustrophedonically starting in the top-left corner, regardless of whether or not it contains an object or not.What surprises me the most is that both this game and it's prequel managed to be so art-like, atmospheric and high in quality, despite being made so long ago and utilising only the capabilities of Adobe Flash Player.To summarise:+Unique appearance +Excellent soundscape+Amusing solutions to some puzzles+As much as it pains me to say so, the characters and story can be described accurately as ""cute""+Happy ending+Price (I bought the Amanita package on sale, but even even at $5.00 for 2-3hrs per play it's still better value than a rollercoaster or a movie. And it can be re-used.)-Some pixel-searching-Small game-window size on high-resoluton screens-Every time you start the game you are reminded of the unwelcome but necessary presence or Adobe Flash Player on your computer  http://www.orison.biz/blogs/chall3ng3r/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/flash_update1.png  -at one point you have to push a baby animal off a branch (It hurts inside) -it's way easier to think of criticisms than praiseDisregard those Pros and Cons and take my word for it: If you have any appreciation for subtlety of design, art or music, you will enjoy this game. It is good in the same way that the French short films series ""Minuscule"" is good.			"

												The first two Samorosts were my favorite games growing up. I played them countless times and never tired of them. They still hold up incredibly well, probably because of their innovatively designed (sometimes mildly disturbing) backgrounds and the puzzles that feel fresh every time I experience them. Even when I know exactly what to do after my thousandth play, I'm excited to push slugs around and mix questionable drinks for intergalactic cab drivers.			"

												Gorgeous game. Way too short for the price.You can get through this game in about an hour, and it's a cute enjoyable hour, but it's still only an hour. $5 is way too much for it, especially when you can pick up something like Binding of Isaac, VVVVVV, or Plants vs Zombies for the same price. $0.99 would be more reasonable. There's really no replay value beyond the first playthrough, since you already know all the puzzles. You might play through it again to show it to a friend, or just enjoy the animation, but it's still a hard sell for how little there is to this game.  I do recommend Samorost 2, because the art is really cute, and the creativity of the creatures and puzzles is commendable, but get it on sale.			"

PROS:+ great art style+ atmosphere+ cute simple story+ nice soundtrackCONS:- really short game time- very linear- not that many or difficult puzzles- flash gameComment:This game is very weird but in a good way. The cool art style feels original even though the graphics are in flash. The puzzles feel okay but there is a small amount of them and they are not at all difficult. This contributes to a very short game that could pass up as a free flash game but as a paid normal game it seems too short. There are no options except for volume and a place for putting the level code. Also the 1 resolution creates a huge black border around the game itself. This makes the game feel cheap. So while I liked the game it does not feel like a whole experience. I recommend it, but get it on sale.			"

												Its actually really short, if you're good at point and click puzzles, it'll be no longer than an hour or so. I actually kind of got a tad fustrated playing it because it wasn't very obvious on where I was supposed to click on...So i ended up clicking all around each level desperatley trying to find where to click...And I actually need to see some let's plays/playthroughs just to figure some of it out. It's not as fun or even long as Machinarium, but it is still very cute and charming for its simplicity and beautiful design. I'd say pick it up if its on discount..Simply due to the horrendously small length of time you'll invest into it.			"

												Samorost 2 has good visuals, charming characters and nice music but it’s not a title I can recommend in good faith. The game clocks in at just under an hour long, it is indeed short, very short. It’s so short that most of the game is seen in the Store page screenshots! Throughout Samorost 2 It's not very obvious what your goal is or what you are meant to do and you will often find yourself just clicking parts of the environment until something happens. Ignoring the length of the game my biggest critique is the timing puzzles and I felt it dragged down the experience to an already short game.Recommended at $1, but not a 5. The Shivah by Wadjet Eye Games offers a better overall package at the same price point while also being a short game.3 out of 5.			"

I spent most of its duration getting frustrated or questioning the solutions to the ""puzzles"" and did not enjoy any part of this game aside from maybe the background art style. I might have been less harsh or said it had potential if this was a free online flash game and someone's first project. But this is lacking in far too many areas to cost any money.

												I made the mistake of playing the (demo) first chapter of Samorost2 on their website, which isn't exactly necessary since the first Samorost (which is free on their site) gives you all the insight you need on how it'll look and play. I say mistake because having read ""only first chapter is free"" made me think there were going to be a lot more afterwards.... well there wasn't. It ended way too quickly and me being a cheapskate felt it wasn't worth the price (yes... even the half off price I got it for). But if you're a fan of the first, a fan of point and click, and can get it discounted, it was a very enjoyable experience! I love the different art style of realistic textures, the music didn't get repetative when I got stuck in areas, and it's got an easy to follow plot-- in all, short, but sweet.To be honest though, it will end up being pretty forgetable, sorry Amanita Design :(			"

												Samorost 2 have good visuals, sounds and music, both very closer to Machinarium.But i can't recommend it because this game have too many negative points... a lot of them.The first thing you notice is that you can't change resolution - you have to play it on a very tinny window. Being a Flash game, you can zoom in the image - and it's good - but you have to do it at every single new clip loaded. No Steam working layer, also.The puzzles doesn't make much sense, so you have to pixel-hunt on your tinny screen, or bother yourself zooming every new screen. You'll fight to find the point to click many times, mostly places you need to enter or walking by, because they're not so visible, and considering the puzzles doesn't make much sense, it's always a waste of time and patience.The game is very, very short. Not even 2 hours.And part of this time you'll just watch your character slowly walking from a place to another, and since sometimes you have to do the same things more than once, it's very annoying. Also, you have not a save system, any of them. Instead, you receive codes every new level, and you can enter these codes if you want to play it later. If you don't realize the purpose of these codes to memorize them or take note, you'll have to play again from beginning, and considering what i said about slowly walking, you know what does it mean.Finally, you don't have any real support from Amanita Design (developer). They're not present at Steam forums, and never patch their games to fix, improve or adapt them to continue to sell them. Although the asked price is low, it's not worth by any aspect, maybe for 1 dollar or so, and if you really like P&C games or the art style.			"

												Really interesting to look at and hear. Unpleasant to interact with. It's unclear what you can interact with. At some points, even if you know you can interact with something, you won't know what part of it to click on. This becomes bad especially towards the end. A simple effort to make it more obvious what can be clicked on without making players resort to pixel hunting would've made me recommend this, but I can't because of this issue.			"

												I do not like Samorost 2 at all.  On the plus side, the artwork is beautiful.  But, that's pretty much it.  On the negative side, the puzzles are completely arbitrary and obscure:  you enter a scene and have no idea what the puzzle IS, let alone how to  solve it.  In addition, the game defaults to a resolution that makes it tiny on my 1920x1200 screen.  On every single level, I have to right-click and tell it to Zoom so that it's visible.  Plus, not all of a level necessarily fits on the screen.  You have to know to scroll over to the side to see anything that's over there.  Right now, this game sells for almost $5.  That's ridiculous for the shortness of it.  But, even if it were free, it wouldn't be worth it.  Definitely Not Recommended.			"

												I have absolutely no idea what this game is.  I got it in one of those indie bundle things.  One of the first such indie bundle things, actually.  The deal was that you got five (or so) games and you could set your price.  So fine, that's a deal.  I paid £0.01.  True to their word, I got the games.  Then the guy who was selling these games had the nerve to publically condemn people who paid 1 cent/1 pence whatever.  Well, ♥♥♥♥ you.  If you didn't want people giving such a low amount, SET A MINIMUM PRICE, YOU♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I never bought another indie bundle.  Probably for the best because I didn't even ♥♥♥♥ing play this particular game.  Ooh, but I did get  World of Goo in that bundle.  That was the only game really worth playing.Pwninator score: 0/10			"

												This is a cute little story of a man (?) trying to rescue his dog from aliens and then get back home.  I'd originally purchased this game as a 3-pack with Machinarium, and I'm glad I did.  I'm not sure if I'd have bought this on its own, though it did get me over an hour of point&click gametime.  It was short, but still very satisfying.  The point&click gameplay is very simple, with most puzzles being solved on the same screen, though there were a few that required 2-screen thinking.  The graphics are aesthetically pleasing and stylistic, which is another reason that attracted me.  If I'm going to be staring at a screen for an hour trying to figure out what I should click on, I'd like it to be good looking :)  Also, this game also has no text or language.  Great use of imagery and intuition to solve the puzzles!Any point&click fans would enjoy this game, though I recommend it be purchased with the other games by the same developer.  Might as well get the most bang for your buck, and these games are fun, so it's totally worth it.			"

												Samorost 2 is another lovely Amanita Design point and click style adventure game. You play a man/alien who lives on a meteorite, and are tasked with rescuing your pet from other aliens. The game features some absolutely gorgeous levels, and has the characteristic Amanita aesthetic and some gorgeous music. The puzzles you will solve are not too difficult, and this game will only net you an hour or two of playtime. It is well worth the price if you enjoy this style of game, and absolutely worth grabbing the Amanita bundle that is so often featured in Steam sales, and also includes Botanicula and Machinarium. Recommended if you enjoy point and click games.			"

												Those that were captivated by Amanita Design's Machinarium and left wanting more, will be pleased by this equally charming effort. All the atmosphere and quirky humour is here in Samorost 2, thanks in no small part to the continued contribution of composer Tomas Dvorak.Samorost 2 is quite short, but oh so sweet. It's simple tale of a space gnome looking for his dog isn't quite as deeply involving as Machinarium's robot love story, but it's certainly no less charming for that. The experience can be somewhat lengthened by going to Amanita Design's website and playing Samorost Part 1 completely free of charge.Lovely stuff. 9/10			"

 Decided to replay this game as Samorost 3 was just released. If anyone is interested, you can also play the original Samorost game on Amanita Design's website. It's about 30 minutes long. Right away, I would like to mention that this game is pretty much a demo. It's only about an hour long (quicker if you don't struggle with any of the puzzles) but I still think it's worth a look. It's a great introduction to Amanita Design's games. (Side note, they are absolutely incredible. I highly recommend Machinarium and Botanicula.) The artwork is really nice, the music (by Tomáš Dvořák aka Floex) is really relaxing, and the story is cute. My only gripes are the resolution and that a couple puzzles consisted of repeated clicking instead of some sort of thinking. Final score of 6.5/10. It's a decent little experience, but it is an old and short game, so even $5.49 CAD is pushing it. Definitely pick it up on a sale.			"

Samorost 2 is every bit as charming as when it was first released about a decade ago, with beautifully designed environments and rich audio.However, it has not aged terribly well. It plays in a tiny window surrounded by black borders and its low-resolution graphics will have you hunt the pixels more often than you'd like. It is also extremely short and has no replay value. You should only get this title on sale or as part of a better bundle.If you are a newcomer to Amanita Design's truly original work, I suggest you start with Machinarium for a more rewarding and complete experience.

												Samorost2 is a short and very basic adventure experience for fans of the peculiar artwork of Amanita Designs. Both graphics and sound design is phenomenal for a flash game and there is enough content for about an hour of strange escapism. I would rather recommend Machinarium due to the latter being more polished but if you want more you can't really go wrong with Samorost2 either.			"

												This is indeed a short game (about an hour to complete), but that can be a good thing for many people. The art style and music are delightful and will be familiar to those who have tried the more recent Machinarium. I was surprised to learn that Samorost 2 was released in 2005, as it has more in common with recent adventure games than it does with classic point-and-click games. A couple complaints: (1) the (thankfully rare) timing puzzles are annoying and tedious, and (2) the interface for selecting objects/environments is wonky at times. These are relatively minor issues, though, and the game is worth playing.			"

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|+|Samorost 2 is a cute little adventure game made in flash player. It has a nice art style and an overall good atmosphere. It is quite short, can be easily played through in less than an hour on the first try. Its price tag is high for a game like this, but I got it on sale for about $1, which is more than a fair price for the experience.Otherwise, it has some problems with the puzzles, especially with all the pixel-hunting that is going on. Sometimes there are things in the background that does not seem any special, still, they have an important role in completing the current scene. Most of the time there is a need to search for points which can be activated throughout the area and given that the background images are not the best in quality this can be frustrating. Animated objects can be easily distinguished.In the end, S2 is still worthwhile due to its unique style.MY OPINION: 7.0/10 (FAIR)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 8/10Gameplay: 6/10Sound: 7/10Replay Value: 5/10			"

												Started as a free flash web-browser game in 2003, the ""Samorost "" was a fun little, point and click adventure game with gimmicky puzzles. ""Samorost 2"" the award winning sequel definetly surpassed the first. Samorost 2 is pretty much the same as the first, but much more improved, better grahpics, harder puzzles and an awesome soundtrack by Tomas Dvorak. However, the puzzles are much much harder... which can easily frustrate some not-so-patient gamers, you need to squint and try to click on every tiny detail in some stages.. which kind of damages the beautiful graphic experience. There is no inventory or lots of gathering like in most adventure games, instead you solve puzzles at every stage and proceed to an another. Collage-esque graphics are rare in video games, but Jakub Dvorsky definetly knows how to make some very lovely and astonishing backgrounds and artistic graphics in general. If you are looking for a challenging, lovely and a bit weird experience. Samorost2 is a great choice.			"

												Samorost 2 a fun little point and click adventure game that is all about traveling out into space after some aliens that took your dog. It is a fairly short game, only taking me about an hour to complete (and that's with me struggle at some areas). It is visually really unique with a dark but cartoonish feel to it. One problem I had with it was it doesn't fit on a normal 1080p monitor, it was scaled down pretty small but, for a $5  indie game released in 2009 can't expect much else. The sounds  and sounds track fit very well with the mood and really added to the game play. I was happy how well everything fit together to be the silliness that this game was. I'm not quite sure if there is any sort of story to the game besides just being a little adventure game. I can't be sure mostly because I have never played the first game the company that made this game, Amanita Design, has also released a third part of this series back in March. While this game was fun I cannot recommend it at it's $5 price tag and would wait for a steam sale where it will surely drop down. TL;DRFun: 10/10Visuals: 8/10Sound: 9/10Difficult: 9/10Should I buy this at full price? No wait till its like $2Overall very fun game and would recommend! "

												I'm generally a fan of Amanita's games but this one didn't sit well. The puzzles are off, mostly involving scouring the screen and clicking for the sake of hoping something works. I don't remember the first game doing that (the free flash one) nor the superlative Machinarium, which is a really ♥♥♥♥ing good game that you should definitely buy if you haven't already.Unfortunately, this one commits many cardinal sins and while the music is great and the cutesy-bland-magical-realism atmosphere (that's how I'm coining it) is incredibly lovely, it just doesn't save Samorost 2 from feeling undernourished.The last puzzle is infuriating too. It leaves a poor taste at the worst possible time.			"

The puzzles are way more simpler than those from Machinarium or Botanicula, obviuosly, but it is a very enjoyable game and it has the two ingredients that make every Amanita game beautiful: impressive graphics and delightul music.

												Samorost 2 is gorgeously whimsical. From the character designs and animations to the landscapes that range from what appears to be grunge sewers to a Lewis Carrol like forest. The narrative, to rescue your stolen dog, is formulaic at the beginning but the 2nd half of the game, the struggle to return home, leads the story away from the classic archetypes into it's own moments of brilliance. The best thing about Samorost 2 is that it also doesn't have ridiculous puzzles, as with so many flash or adventure ""point n click"" games. Samorost makes sense, which was refreshingly original.It isn't long which is the biggest flaw, but a game that wants you to keep playing, is always easy to recommend. "

												While I enjoyed Machinarium a lot, Samorost 1 and 2 is clearly one of the first games of Amanita Design, where they experimented and learned, and didn't know yet how to make an enjoyable game. It's extremely short and most of the puzzles involve a *lot* of pixel hunting. There's logic in them, but they are completely unobvious you have to constantly mouse-over everything on the screen. If you're stuck, there's no help (like in Machinarium). It's not a bad game, but keep in mind it's one hour long and you'll most probably need to find an online guide. Can't recommend. Play Amanita's later games, they are much better.			"

Samorost 2 is every bit as charming as when it was first released about a decade ago, with beautifully designed environments and rich audio.However, it has not aged terribly well. It plays in a tiny window surrounded by black borders and its low-resolution graphics will have you hunt the pixels more often than you'd like. It is also extremely short and has no replay value. You should only get this title on sale or as part of a better bundle.If you are a newcomer to Amanita Design's truly original work, I suggest you start with Machinarium for a more rewarding and complete experience.
