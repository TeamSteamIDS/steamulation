												Brutal Legend combines two of my favourite things in life, Video Games & Metal. This is the game that introduced me to what is now my favourite video game company, Double Fine. In every Double Fine game you can feel the love Tim & the crew shove into every single game they create (did that sound weird?). Brutal Legend puts players in the shoes of Eddie Riggs (preformed by Jack Black) and sends him to a land which is every metal head’s dream. The open world is filled with creatures, buildings, allies and enemies all heavily (see what I did there) inspired by Metal artwork and music throughout the years. To travel through this open world, you get a badass car named the Druid Plow, and this is where the Metal kicks in full gear. The soundtrack is incredible and easily one of best parts of this game, I still hope Double Fine releases a licensed soundtrack that I can throw money at. There is absolutely no way to describe how great it feels to cruise through this Metal world, listening to a flawless and kickass soundtrack.  Without this game, I would’ve never been introduced to one of my now favourite bands, Manowar. The soundtrack includes Rob Zombie, Judas Priest, Scorpions, Tenacious D (of course), and many more fantastic bands. The voice cast is top notch as well, featuring many metal cameos such as Rob Halford and Lemmy but also having great actors such as Jennifer Hale and Tim Curry, you know Double Fine’s voice acting director is good when you can understand every word Lemmy and Ozzy speak. As with all Double Fine games, the dialogue can be very hilarious, the bigger the metal fan you are, the more you will laugh as this is the game is filled with references to the culture. This game received a lot of negative reviews about the gameplay, centering around the RTS aspects, which is funny since the RTS feature was the first part of the game developed. A simple way to describe the gameplay is “God Of War” style with RTS elements. The RTS factor only comes in during boss battles and multiplayer, where you control a large army fighting another while still being in third person rather than the usual RTS top down view. The RTS portions have a bit of a learning curve, but it’s not difficult or tedious, it feels great to lead an army AND fight alongside them. Overall if you are a metal head, Brutal Legend will feel like a game made especially for you. If you aren’t this is still an incredible game, an epic tale filled with adventure, comedy, great characters and decapitations. Brutal Legend is a game you must experience.			"

												What do you do when you are on the game’s store page? You buy it, install it and play it. Once you initiate the third process, you won’t need convincing on keeping on doing it.  The game is entertaining, detailed even where you don’t expect it, the npc’s are loveable, the open world big enough to lose yourself in it. What was a surprise that made me skeptic at first but turned out to be another enjoyable feature was the “casual” RTS, where from the protagonists third person that turns into a flying demon you command your various troops to take out towers and ultimately, the stage, by implementing your tactics. I wasn’t a fan of metal when I started playing this game, but because of it, I have all the metal songs from this game in my playlist.

You are Eddie Riggs, the best roadie in the world, which means you are the one responsible for the stage glamour, but no one will know it. As things get out of control, you find your way into the past, into the age of metal, where people are used against their will by a tyrant which servers Doviculus, the demon responsible for the taint that corrupts all what metal stands for. Since Eddie is good at making things work and gives people purpose, a revolution is started. There will be many great characters that you’ll meet along the way, many of which are based on real life metal stars.  There is always a romantic sub plot where you might find some clichés, but they are the best kind. Since the story takes place in an open world, you can expect a lot of variation in locations and types of allies and enemies. There are a lot of sidequests and neither are the fetch types, more like ambushing, hunting, racing, keeping the bikers away while a headbanger charms a girl, shooting from a ramped car, placing markers for the guy with no aim to shoot rockets, that sort of stuff. Once I had to clear a cave so that a family of bats could go back in, which earned me kisses and an apology from a bat for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on my head. There are solos to find, serpents to free and legends to learn. It’s the kind of open world that never fills empty.

In the RTS missions, you’ll use your solos and your cunning, for doing things like melting your enemies faces and send the invisible forces to attack the stage while the shooters and the pyromans defend your stage.  The Deuce(your car) is fun to drive, but the controls may prove to be difficult at first, which makes it even more fun.  You can raise relics, which include Motorfoges, where you will  upgrade your attack, the Deuce, change outfits, enhance your weapons and buy stones to place on a mountain. If you’re a fan of the RTS system in the game, you can expect a good time in the multiplayer. 


I'll never forget you guys!

I found many of my favorite gaming moments here. While people find some faults in this game, everyone finds the way to play this game and others don’t recognize those faults at all. The end was emotional satisfying, sneaking away, yet finding yourself surrounded by friends that simply ask you to never forget them at which point you’d likely say that you won’t, then driving into the sunset while your girlfriend watches smiling and dropping a tear.  You can free roam afterwards to see what more this game has to offer. I’m not done with it and I don’t want to, not until I hear of a sequel at least. In the end, I find Brütal Legend to do everything right.  "

												I grew up listening to hard rock and metal. So when I started playing Brütal Legend, I wondered how the hell this game fell under my radar for so long. Thankfully Double Fine decided to port this game to the PC otherwise I likely would have never had the pleasure to experience this treasure.There's so much great music to listen to while driving ""The Deuce."" Songs from Black Sabbath, Mötley Crüe, Testament, Megadeth, Slayer, Skid Row, and so many more artists are in the mix. The music is great enough to overlook even a bad game. But this is not a bad game. Brütal Legend is a fantastically fun game. The story is epic taking the role as a roadie to save the world from the forces of evil. The open world action/adventure gameplay works amazingly well with guitar solos and cooperative special moves.The only thing I had a hard time with was the stage battles. They combine 3rd person hack 'n slash action with RTS elements and require some serious multitasking. I struggled to command my troops and purchase stage upgrades in real time, all while simultaneously trying to fight off hordes of enemies. I eventually got through them, although sometimes painfully. Despite being difficult, the stage battles were still fun and blended well with the metal based story and themes. Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, and Lita Ford are in this! Did I mention Ozzy? YES OZZY!If you are a metal head, this game is a must. Even if you aren't, the game is a must.			"

Short version: 72%Brütal Legend is awesome and metal. Brütal Legend is also a mediocre and forgettable open world/hack & slash/strategy game. A prime example why Steam needs a “meh” button for the reviews.Long version:Brütal Legend is a tribute to metal. Not cash-in whiny pop metal, but real, classic, early seventies, head-banging, engine-worshipping, leather-winged heavy metal. It is a temple for bands like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, or Motörhead– just to name a few from the in-game soundtrack.This game is so metal that its cast has such names as Jack Black as the protagonist, Rob Halford as the first main boss, and Ozzy Osbourne as the shopkeeper. This game is so metal that the entire landscape is never-ending scenery of heavy metal album covers. This game is probably as metal as metal you can get without dipping your computer in molten steel.Brütal Legend is also incredibly mediocre. It wants to combine three genres: GTA style open world exploration/driving, hack & slash brawling, and real-time strategy. The problem is that it isn’t remotely good in any of those.The brawling is dumb, although fun: you mindlessly mash two buttons and hope that the enemy runs out of health faster than you do.The RTS part consists of spawning an endless stream of units until one army reaches the end of the battlefield to wreck the opponent’s production stage. To be frank, it is downright boring.Still, the driving takes the cake. The controls are worse than you can imagine (worse than Borderlands could ever be), and when you have to race on narrow platforms over bottomless pits… get yourself a pack of Xanax.I wouldn’t call Brütal Legend bad… the soundtrack and most of the plot about leading a metal-fuelled revolution against the demon-like oppressors can easily entertain you from start to finish, but you will always have the feeling that the game mechanics could have been a lot better.

												So I felt it is time for me to make a review of one of my personal favorite games of all time and too post why and the problems i have with the game. Possibly some hope in here that they make another too kick even more metal♥♥♥♥♥ In the vast lands of Brütal Legend made from the metal bones of Ormagöden the firey metal god. You are the man to change it all but take none of the credit you are the Roadie. Born in a wrong time this roadie knew he was meant (destined even) for something better, something Metal and Full of Gore. Venture through a land built of every punk teen's wet dream and true man's vision.The Pros:- It's got a Metal as♥♥♥♥♥♥of story worth playing experiencing fight demons, slay the puss, and of course ROCK- A great wide landscape to venture through slaying all those who oppose you in your conquest- You Weild an Axe and guitar with far more powers than you and I can comprehend with plenty of other powers found along your journey- The land vast and all has plenty of quests to rock you some upgrades found in the motor forge- A great lore (in my opinion) that can be greatly expanded on and just enjoy- The God damn soundtrack is Bloody EPIC to put softly full of rocking tunes for you to rock out to on your journey- JACK BLACK!!!!!! nuf said- The strategy aspect is well done providing a differing touch on the game to make it a unique experienceThe Cons:- The multiplayer is kind of just a port of the game's strategy which is nice just not that boom your looking for counting no one plays it i know of- the strategy aspect all though well done just feels like an unecessary element put in the game and that kind of sucksHonestly those are the only cons i can think of. I'm sure you will think of plenty if its not your cup of tea but to me this is my mona lisa, MY masterpiece. No matter how you look at it though it is a good buy, plenty of hours ahead of banging your head and your mom yelling at you that its too violent. Hope you enjoy and please leave your hate down below I always love reading stupidity. :^)			"

												I played this game for a few hrs, and I was not feeling. I was confused when i got to the part where you had to battle by recruiting units,  and gain fans to upgrade your stage. So i mostly just roamed around completing side missions and gather the collectables until I stopped  playing.A few months went by and decided to give the game another shot. I started from scratch to go back and see if this time I understood the battle mechanics a bit better. 2nd time was the charm, I had a better understanding of the battle system and started to enjoy the game a lot more. After that i was way more into the game. It made me want to complete the game and do all the achievements (Because i am lame like that) Very nice game. Good music, good story, very likeable characters. The side missions do get a bit boring because they are repetative and not really that challenging (Even on Brutal difficulty) You'll finish the game pretty quickly if you don't bother looking for collectables or do the side missions. You aren't missing much if you just go right through the story, although the racing and animal hunting side missions have some funny dialogue.			"

												Brütal Legend is a game for metalheads.  Yoü play metal, yoü listen to metal, yoü ARE the metal.  I don't think any other game has managed to so completely immerse the player in a concept and create süch a rich game world.  The art direction at Doüble Fine is simply amazing.The game itself is rather üniqüe, combining an open world third-person action game with real time strategy.  Ünfortünately düring the original release, EA's advertising glossed over the RTS aspect, leading many players who were expecting a straight action game to be confüsed and disappointed.  Controlling troops from a third-person perspective may not be as flexible as a normal RTS and it does take some getting üsed to, büt it works well for what its intended for in the game.The müsic in the game and the long list of big name voice actors really help draw yoü into the game.  Even thoügh I don't particülarly like most of the bands that are featüred in the game, the müsic fits so well that I can enjoy it anyway.  Brütal Legend even has the most perfectly placed song I've ever heard in a game düring one of the cütscenes, thoügh I can't stand listening to it oütside the game.One problem some people may have is that Jack Black plays the main character.  I can assüre yoü that it is not a problem.  Eddie Rigg's character is Jack Black playing Jack Black, büt written by Doüble Fine so there is none of Jack Black's classic stüpidity.  Ünless yoü cringe at the soünd of Jack Black's voice, I think yoü'll be able to enjoy the game jüst fine.My only disappointments are that the story felt like it ended rather süddenly when I thoüght it was only halfway throügh, the side missions get rather repetitive, and Doüble Fine doesn't have the fünds to make a seqüel.  Hopefülly that will come in the fütüre.To süm üp: play this game!  Everyone needs more metal in their lives.			"

												Brutal Legend is a mash up of a couple different genres, Action Adventure Open World RTS...yes, that many...I'll start out with the graphics, it is a nice art style however the graphics really show the three years difference, even on higher resolutions the game doesn't look as crisp as others. There is hardly any customization in the options menu to try get a bit more beef out the graphics which is almost a must for PC ports.The actual game play is nicely done though, as I said to begin with, there are four different genres mashed up here, Action Adventure is done very well, the hack and slash mechanics are basic, but the addition of guitar solos brings a whole new way of playing, allowing you to buff up your characters or deal damage to your foes.  The open world aspect is also done very well, the world seems huge, there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy throughout the story, however these aren't crucial for story or game progress elements, and they are purely there as additional things to do.  Finally, the RTS element, throughout the course of the game, you will take part in a number of grand scale battles, in which you have to manage your resources (fans in this case) and build an army in which you command using basic squad game controls, so follow, defend and attack. To me this seemed like the worst of the four though, it seemed a little clunky and out of place, I would much rather have played it without the strategy side. The sound track and music in Brutal Legend is obviously going to be amazing. The game features 107 metal tracks from 75 different bands, ranging from Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Kiss to Tenacious D as well as many more.  The main character is also voiced and based on Jack Black which also adds the comical side of things in too. There isn't much difficulty in playing Brutal Legends, as long as you get to grips with the basics of the RTS elements, you won't find yourself having too many issues. The hack and slash parts are too easy at times, so the only challenge comes from the RTS, which is a shame, because I would of liked to have got a little more stuck into the combat and maybe the addition of extra combos.The game length is very respectable, I normally try to complete as many of the side missions I can in these types of games, so it took me almost thirty five hours to complete it fully, so it is a pretty chunky game, time wise. I had a few minor technical issues, even though the game was running at a smooth 60 fps most of the time, it almost felt as if I was still playing at 30, not sure whether that was an issue with my rig or not though, I turned on v-sync and that seemed to make a little better, but not by much. I also wanted to play in windowed mode for a while because I had the wiki page open on my second screen, and this gave me numerous issues with the cursor in game, I would all of a sudden just get my desktop background because my mouse had wandered off screen into my task bar, or I would start to get hover-over tooltips for other shortcuts on my windows task bar randomly, all small issues that could of quite easily of been fixed. My final recommendation for Brutal Legend is definitely give it a try, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I did have a lot of fun playing it, I mean, I did plunge thirty five hours of my life playing it...there is plenty of content and even just the sound track is worth some of your time, you can get the game at regular price for £10,99, but expect this to drop to as low as £2 in sales, and then you have yourself a real bargain.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Brütal LegendDeveloper:  Double Fine ProductionsPublisher:  Double Fine ProductionsGenre:  Action-Adventure with RTS elements.General ImpressionI’ve enjoyed playing Brütal Legend since it was launched originally on the consoles back in 2009. It’s safe to say that I was ecstatic over its well deserved release onto PCs in 2013. It is a game unique in both its hybrid genre and storyline. But that is to be expected from this developer, which gave us many other cult classics. From a graphical point of view, the game has aged very well and it’s still rocking (pun intended) a stellar musical score and general sound effects. It features a vast, beautifully crafted open world in which you may cause mayhem on your own, or in the multiplayer mode included. Having both Trading Cards and Achievements as well as great price tag (even outside seasonal Sales), I really had to focus hard on finding even a single con. The control scheme has been ported well enough to the PC, but a controller would still be preferred to a mouse and keyboard layout. All in all, Brütal Legend is a worthy addition to any gamer’s collection!Strong Points + Excellent story and setting.+ Pleasant graphics and superb soundtrack.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Control scheme takes some time getting used to.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

****4 out of 5One of the coolest games around. Brutal Legend combines Heavy Metal, Rock, Hack and Slash and RTS all in a massive and gorgeous apocalyptic open world.Featuring a 20+ hour storyline and plenty to do after. Brutal Legend is definitely a gem in Double Fine's crown.Loses points sadly due to requiring a controller to play, the keyboard and mouse is...do-able, but when it takes you three hours to do a simple racing mission, it's arguably not worth it.

												Burtal Legend:Well.... THIS GAME ROCKS!! LITERALLY!I have to admit that at first I though this is another little kids game, but once you play it you really cant stop. The gameplay is really fun and it has a great story and all, but the best part of the game is, of course, the music. The music of this game is actually the whole point of the game, that you're a rock legend that needs to fight the evil with the power of Rock N' Roll and Metal (OZZY!!!).The Soundtrack of this game, the songs and bands, so many bands that I love like DragonForce and Black Sabbath.. Oh man... To all the rock and metal music lovers among us - This game is highly recommended!!!			"

												Silly humor is something you'll most certainly find in Brutal Legend; Especially if you like Jack Black.Enjoying the oldies Rock and Metal bands will likely increase your overall enjoyment of the game, or even, who knows, find yourself some new musical tastes you didn't know existed.The game itself is a nice mix of hack 'n slash, attempting something original like typical Strategy Games Team-Management features to some degree, in certain battles - in which you can hover the battlefield ordering your troops to move to X, or even attack Y.Awesome game if you enjoy an extensive world to explore and a crazy amount of silliness~			"

												Brütal Legend has everything going for it, a cool world inspired by Metal and  Hard Rock albums, fun characters with really fun dialouge, and an excellent soundtrack. Then the gameplay comes in and ruins it all.The basic hack and slash gameplay is honestly fine, it's nothing special but works, the car customizing is pretty good and I enjoy driving around the world in my pimped out Metal car.But it's when the infamous RTS segements comes in, they are just plain horrible, they are clunky to control and offer zero tactics, all you can do is spam out enemies and bombrush them at the enemy, the worst part is that the RTS segements becomes the main thing in this game, and that ruined the whole game for me.If you can overcome the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RTS segements and controls then there is a fun game for you here, but for me this is easily the worst game made from Tim Schafer and Double Fine, and if they ever revisits this series I hope they either greatly improves on the RTS mechanics or just scrap them all together.Edit: This is no longer the worst game made by Double Fine since they went and made Spacebase DF9 and Broken Age, so count yourself lucky Brutal Legend			"

A bit about the game and developers.Brütal Legend is an action game developed by Double Fine studios. They are the same studio that made The Cave (amazing game!), Iron Brigade, Stacking, Costume Quest, Psychonauts and couple of more others. I should mention that Brütal Legend also has couple of very good rock artists. Jack Black and Ozzy Osbourn. Honestly, I love to listen to rock-metal, but I ain't fan of Ozzy's music, and I've heard a lot of better artists than Jack, but Jack is definitely one of my favorite actors. I mean, that guy is funny! And he's an amazing voice actor in this game!About Gameplay.Brütal Legend is an action game in which all you do is hit, slash, run over and burn your enemies. Now, a lot of people find this type of game very amusing, but to me that's just too simple. Luckily, this game comes with another approach, that suits me a bit better! A strategy one! You are able to take the game into a semi-top down view, build your units and send them to where ever you'd like them to go. But I'll talk more about that later!So, in Brütal Legend you play as a roadie (sorry if I misspelled it!) who died on a stage. The roadie, Eddie, gets brought back to life by the power of Ormagöden. But he got back into a Heavy Metal world, not the normal one. In that world, your job is to fight demons, and goths, using nothing but the power of true rock!When it comes to fighting, controls are quite easy to master. Managing an army is a bit harder, but still quite easy to remember and use in combat. And remember, 10 is always better than 1. So use those units wisely! In the game there are various relics that you can find. Some give you special powers, and others lets you resurrect a ""metal shop"". Inside of it you find Guardian of Metal (Ozzy!), who can then upgrade your car, change your character's look, give you different weapons and so on and on. The only sad thing about the game is that Eddie can't jump. He can do a lot of things, but jumping ain't one of them.The story of this game is very good, and very fun to follow. Jack's humor is a huge extra to the game! There's also a lot of swearing and bad language in the game which aren't really appropriate for children. But you can always just disable that and turn on that ""BEEEEEEP"" sound if someone swears, and that will definitely make the game A LOT more funny!Now, let's head over to the multiplayer view of this game. I haven't tried out the online multiplayer, because I was sure I'd get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked instantly. So I did a test run with AI's, and it's AMAZING! You can chose one of three factions (demons, goths or metal heads) and fight the others. This is a full strategy game, where you spawn units, send them to battle and so on and on. Now, earlier i said ""semi top down"". I said that because you can only see where your character currently is. So if you want to see more of the ""map"", you have to fly (yes, FLY!) to the different location. I really had a lot of fun playing against the AI!Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking, the game looks pretty good. It looks like a cartoon, with the characters so realistic, that you are instantly able to recognize them. Songs are also pretty good, there's a lot of metal and rock. Though, you have to unlock them, so first 3-5 hours of gameplay are quite repeatable, and annoying..Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Metal oriented game!- Lots of famous people are inside of it.- Very funny!- Nice customization.Cons:- On beginning the music is repeatable.- Map works quite weird with mouse.Final grade: 7/10Extra info:  The game is very fun and enjoyable, but songs should have been much easier to acquire. I really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys easy games where you do nothing else except just kill creatures with two different buttons (like Darksiders, but this is better!)Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] "

												Brutal Legend is an open world hack n' slash staring Jack Black as Eddie Riggs, set in a fantasy world of a heavy metal album cover come to life. I felt captivated by the story from start to finish, more than I enjoyed the game and its pretty rare for me to say such a thing. As a game, the combat was just there, other games do it better, but nothing does the unique atmosphere better than Brutal Legend.The story is simple, you're a downtrodden roadie working for an ungrateful emo band that costs you your life. From there, you're transported to a fantastic land made of metal and stone. Where mammoths have chrome tusks and spiders made of steel. Its a fresh take on any fantasy world. Nighttime turns into a gorgeous meteorological phenomenon, either with electric blue moons or asteroid showers. The land is getting oppressed by a demon lord and you need to band together, gather troops and lead an uprising to defeat him!The characters are straight out of the late 70s early 80s heavy metal scene. Everyone is wearing spikes and black. Men have big muscles, washboard abs, long flowing hair and the ladies are always petite with enough mascara to blot out the sun. All the characters have big eyes and I think that helps them convey emotion much better. Its a wonderfully acted game, from the voice acting to the animations.There's a lot of humor, charm and goofiness that I enjoyed. I'm not one that likes comedy in games, but it hit the mark for me. Its not all comedy, the game takes itself serious when it has to be. The cameos also helped. Seeing Lemmy from Motorhead as my healer throughout the game. Having Ozzy Osbourne upgrade my car's weapons was a lot of fun. Tim Curry as the supreme villain. With all the famous voices incredible performances, there were plenty of great lesser known talent doing a fantastic job voice acting. All the characters no matter how big or small all have personality and charm, even if none of them have last names.Halfway through the game, the emo starts to bleed into this world of metal and the new characters are all gothed up. Crazy haired ""kids"" with striped shirts, Victorian dressed women in white dresses carrying umbrellas. While they feel more Tim Burton than heavy metal, they're still beautiful as villains. What 80s metal head doesn't want to axe crimson clad, metal teethed nurses?For a hack n' slash, its pretty simple, you've got an axe to melee, and another axe for magic. You can use the latter to perform guitar solos that you'll unlock different songs at shrines. These solos go in a mini game that's like a quick, horizontal Guitar Hero. Since you're leading an uprising, you'll be commanding troops and its easy enough. One button to have them follow you, another to stay, another to attack a highlighted object and one to attack what's in front of you. I think this adds a sort of uniqueness to the game. You'll rarely be fighting alone, you've always got a crew with you.One of the first things you do is liberate headbanger grunts with giant necks. Then get ranged laser weapons for the razer girls from ""General Lionwhyte's pleasure tower."" The names alone play up what the game is going for. That era when fantasies were cool, imaginative, 80s, death, skulls and weren't dominated by elves or magic. In this world, the guitar is magic. Your solos can melt faces, heal your companions and summon vehicles.There are double team maneuvers with allies that can keep things interesting. You're forced to ride giant speakers, getting carried by roadies to keep away flocks of seagulls. Ride on the back of a Lemmy's motorcycle to stun enemies. Headbang with your grunts. Another mission has you trying to circle a Kiss beast in a ring of fire. While I can't say it was fun, it still switched up the game play.Eddie can't jump or even run, you'll need to hop into your classic, customizable hotrod named Deuce. There are mandatory driving segments here and there throughout the game to keep the game play diverse, but when you're outside of a mission, you don't have to use it, but its far better than walking. I just wish the driving was better. The steering in particular. Its not a bad in earlier parts in the game or when you're in the big open world, but later on, some of the mandatory segments are just painful to play. You're in a car, essentially off roading with trees everywhere, the slightest turn can send you off course into a tree. Some of the segments are pretty narrow and start to drag the game down.Nothing drags the game down more than when Eddie Riggs sprouts wings and it becomes what most people call a real time strategy, but I call it a MOBA. Its a struggle, you as their champion sprout wings and command your army against an opponent commanding theirs. This is a lot different than just hacking n' slashing with troops at your side. You can fly and even still drop down to the ground to fight or perform guitar solos to buff your troops. You need to buy the troops with fans. Both champions have a stage or a gateway as their home base and you buy troops with fans. You get fans by performing a metal solo atop of a fan stream where a tower of a merchandise booth is then built over top of it. Its okay once you get the hang of it. I feel like this was a tacked on multiplayer facet of the game. I can't imagine some 80s metal head getting through these segments, but there's always an easy difficulty.The more booths you have, the more funds get generated to buy troops. In this particular arena, there are six fan streams. Two by each stage, and one in each of two equal paths. So the arena is in a circle and that's fine too. Now these troops have specific talents, like a rock, paper, scissors sort of thing. Roadies take out buildings like merchandise booths and stages. Bouncers take out mounted enemies like those on horses and steel horses. Its easy to understand with the descriptions.I'd say these MOBA / RTS are 5% of the game and they're just there for diversity. Plus you can't lead an uprising without having your army fight another can you? With that said, I grew to hate these painful battles. I'm no fan of MOBAs, but these just felt like a chore of a tug of war. I'd take a tower over there, but lose a tower. These battles took far too long. Death in the MOBAs merely respawns you. Outside of the battles, death sends you back to the previous checkpoint, which might have been a while ago.A lot of love went into making this game. Well love and money. It feels like no expense spared getting the big names, making an incredible, immersive world with fantastic art design. There are little details that really make it an unforgettable experience. Even Jack Black performing a live action introduction of him finding the menu in a record jacket.There are details in game like the wildlife. Porcupines, giant horned elk stampeding down a mountain and the ability to run them all down with your car. If not use your car's flame thrower to incinerate them. Hey this is an open world game that lets you be in control. You'll find plenty of side missions, but I didn't tackle any of them until after the main story was over and done with.While its not a home run for its game play or in game fun, but its so good because of its art style, story and portrayal of these characters that the incredible soundtrack is almost an afterthought for me. Its there on missions with you, and in a cassette deck of the Deuce, but I was paying attention to the character's delivery that I found myself tuning out the heavy metal. I never thought I'd pay attention to Jack Black.			"

												A fun RPG built for metal heads.The game is pretty great, you get transported to a world of metal album covers and proceed to build an army against the forces of metal (Which as it turns out are just the variants of metal) All while jamming to some good tracks and getting some humourous dialogue.The art style of the game is rather unique, all the enemies and most of the characters seem to really pop and have a distinct feel (even the ones that are a copy paste manage to have a different enough style) The big battle mechanics feel clumsy at first but if you can get the hang of them and know the strengths and weaknesses of what you are up against you'll manage fine.The unfortunate thing about this game is that it hasn't really aged well. Modern cards cause elements of the game to act quite buggy and no matter what you do you can't seem to make the game perform better, couple that with the game not being terribly clear on what your goal is sometimes and you can get rather frustrated really quick.Id still recommend it but only if you happen to be a big fan of metal.

												This game is awesome. And so metal. Sooooo metal. The mix of free-roam, tactical skirmishes, strategic battles, hack&slash, and music works amazingly well. A huge surprise was that the characters were actually interesting and the story well worth playing through, unlike most games of this type (more like the games it draws from, because there are no other games like this).This gets a recommandation without hesitation from me. My only regret is how long it took me to start playing it.			"

												Brütal Legend is an incredible mix of RPG and STR, where you lead the armies of Rock and Metal against an overwhelming menace bent on conquering the whole of a lovingly crafted fantasy world.While the gameplay is sometime clunky and the difficulty curve pretty steep (with certain missions being insanely more difficult than the rest), the quality of the world design and the awesomeness of the soundtrack quite make up for it.Perhaps best of it all the game doesn't take itself seriously, succeeding in the challenge of offering both an epic story, served by an incredibly charismatic cast of characters, and light take on the clichés of Fantasy Metal, whitout ever being boring or disrespectful of its material and inspirations.All in all, Brütal Legend is a very good game offering a unique and fresh adventure, quite welcome in today's RPGs landscape dominated by the High-Fantasy genre.

												Brutal Legend is a combination of adventure and action games and only Single PLAYER aswell.Financial intelligence behind the game is Tim Schafer, who was inspired by his youth musical tastes, and the game's protagonist is roadien Eddie Riggs, played by Jack Black, who whirled into a fantasy world with a blend of Norwegian mythology and heavy rock, where Riggs have to save an oppressed people from the power of the Red ""Demon"" who summoned him in the world where the adventure begins. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that can tap into the magical powers of the world, and a customizable advanced sports car (hot rod).I like the way the game has an amazing tribute to metal delivers a hugely entertaining gaming experience despite missing a few chords.

												Definitely a sleeper hit.While the aesthetic is not for everyone, it is nonetheless a fun and enjoyable experience. Tim Schafer and the team has successfully captured the essence of metal culture and molded it into the Age of Metal which the game is set in. The soundtrack is a huge plus, backed up by appropriate battle sounds such as machine gun fire or weapon hits.It is not your everyday beat-em-up either; the game contains elements of real-time strategy and driving games. If this sounds overwhelming to you, don't worry, because the gameplay itself is refined and enjoyable.Metal or non-metal fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up this game. At least buy it when there's a discount.You know i'm born to loseAnd gambling's for foolsBut that's the way i like it, babyI don't wanna live foreverR.I.P Lemmy 2016.			"

												Fan of metal music? Rock music? BOTH? Well you're in luck! This game combines these genres, in their widest and most well-selected form (107 songs from 75 bands, aside from the game's own soundtrack), with a fantastic game based around the world of rock and metal music! This game is worth playing for the music alone, but the storyline, setting, and gameplay are also fantastic. I'm not going to sit here and tell you why, it's an experience.. so go experience it for yourself!Features characters based on and voiced by musicians like Jack Black & Kyle Gass (Tenacious D), Lemmy Kilmister (Motörhead), Ozzy Osbourne (like you don't know who that is), and many more!EDIT: Also look at my hours played.. I really mean the things I wrote up there!			"

												An underrated game when it released on consoles back then - it stars Eddie Rigs (played by Jack Black) , a roadie feeling out of place in the future where modern rock has overtaken classic, after an accident on set, Eddie Rigs is then sent back into the ""Rock Ages"" as a savior of Mankind.The game starts you out in a Cathedral, after Eddie awakens - a robed creature starts chasing you around until you pick up the legendary axe (the weapon you will be using throughout the entire game as your melee/close range) and the game introduces you to what are basic Brawler/Beat-em-Up style controls and also introduces you to your now beefed up Super-Guitar (which servers as your primary projectile weapon). You meet another of the main characters that go by the name of Ophelia, and from there on your fight your way down what appears to be a tower made of skulls until you're able to build a vehicle and escape from that area.Visually, the game looks okay, it has an unique art style to it that I enjoyed seeing and it has really cool looking sights all around the overworld, but ultimately it's a bit repetitive. Some areas just look a little bit too ""samey"" for me, this is somewhat alleviated thanks to the fact that these areas are pretty much modeled after their Area Boss' style of Rock - for example, Lyonwhite (the first major boss) has a more ""glam"" type rock, while the later boss, and major antagonist, Doviculous has a more ""satanic"" design that's modeled after him, which I appreciate. The game also has a pretty colorful cast that's also pretty fun to see as you met them along. The story itself though, is fairly cliche'd, but in a good way I believe, a lot of the things that occur in the game you can pretty much see coming miles away, which is what disappointed me the most about it.The world is pretty expansive, as far as open world games are and there's a multitude of things to do outside the game's story. You can go around destroying Stone Idols (around 100+) that serve as the main collectibles, there are songs around that give you additional buffs after you play them (your guitar can play these songs in a style very similar to that of Zelda OoT's Ocarina) and finding these Garage Doors that serve as your upgrades store (where you meet ""The Rock God"" Ozzy Osbourne there no doubt.). On that store, you can purchase things like upgrades for your moveset, upgrades for your vehicle, skins for your weapons and a bunch more stuff.Outside of the overworld and the basic combat, the game also features a more RTS-like gameplay element to it. On certain major conflicts in the story, the game shifts to an RTS style of game that often serves as the conclusions to the 3 major bosses in the game aswell as the main Multiplayer component to the game - the only difference being that you yourself can drop down in your vehicle or from flight (yes your character gains wings during these events too!) and help out your troops. Sadly though, I felt this was the game's weakest parts personally, mostly because just rushing down your opponents are often the best way to break through the enemy defenses and constantly down their troops close to where they spawn and you yourself taking care of the few that make it through. You spawn more troops as you ""appeal"" to fans (or fan geysers) and gain more points, similar to resources in other RTS games, and are able to build and fix, or summon higher classes of troops to do a variety of things - like healers, heavy hitters, grunts, etc - so the RTS elements here are very bare bones. Ultimately, this felt more like an afterthought to add padding to an already short game. As it stands, this is still one of my favourite games this generation for a good number of reasons, mainly for the music and Jack Black's stellar performance, even though the gameplay is very basic brawler, with added RTS elements to add padding to an already short game.Solid B+ "

												Heavy metal, women, more heavy metal, gore, battles, booze. your guitar shoots electricity and can summon a giant burning zepelin to crush them demons, summon your all migthy beast (car or animal) and ride them, f**king enemies up, more heavy metal, wield an axe that you may upgrade (with the rest of the stuff) to be a holy soul eating fu**, more heavy metal, swearing, teach the future chick who will kill you to french kiss, did i mention heavy metal?PROS:-SOUNDTRACK: Great soundtrack(the heavy metal songs and the overworld ones, very relaxing), actually a lot of ppl listens to heavy metal because of this game( like me)-VOICE ACTING: Fu**ing great! It has JB( Jack black, Leader of the band Tenacious D with Kyle, actor in films like King Kong 2005 , The Pick of Destiny and voice actor of Kung Fu Panda, as Po) as Eddie Riggs, Kyle Gas( partner of Jack black) as the Cannoner and the random bat dad guy, Ozzy Osbrown( or something) as the keeper of secrets, Lemmy Kilmister as Kill Master, etc...-GAMEPLAY: Good hack-n-slash game with an axe to hack and a guitar to shoot electricity because that rocks! You may summon your car (druidplower) and ♥♥♥♥ your enemies. The main missions are good, but a good propotion of them is to escort the Tour bus with your car and the battle Stages, that i will talk later. The side missions are also good, but some repetitive. There are the Ambush, Race, Hunting record and Cannon defence + the unique ones, but of there are only one each.-COLLECTIBLES: Yes, there are dragons to free, with the gods of metal reward you with tribute and for every 10 dragons a upgrade (Health, regen, etc), Legends, to look the past and how was everything created, artwork, the Metal Songs, that add more songs to your soundtrack. and fairies, that give you tribute if you catch them.-METAL FORGE: It is were you go and purchase upgrades for your car, axe and guitar + paintjobs(for the druidplower or your jacket), purchase cool moves and get some statues + Ozzy is in there...yes...-STORY: The story is amazing, simple, but amazing, with a very good twist at the end( after the secondlast battle), tho it leaves you wanting a Brütal Legend 2( tho i doubt there will be).It is a 10-15 hour game, at least for me.DLC( included in the game and only in the PC version): Adds some skins for Eddie Riggs, your car, axe, guitar, and statues+ 1 new weapon and a new ram for your car+ an eye that points you in the direction of a collectible, helps a lot.CONS:-GAMEPLAY: There's another part of the gameplay, it is the RTS one. In the Stages( battles) you can create units by getting fans from merchandise booths in fan gysers, and basicly your objective is to destroy the enemy Stage. It feels like it is out of place fot this type of game, but it is fun non-the less, gets repititive tho.-MULTIPLAYER is dead, tho there are those 2 random persons from the forum who decided to do some achivements, the multiplayer is dead, tho it doesn't suprise me, as it is only the RTS part of the game, and as i said, it is out of place for this type of game and has a rly poor ranking that it also feels out of place. Only good thing is that it let's you try the other 2 factions (Tainted coil, my favourite, and the other one).-BUGS: Yes, there are bugs, not a lot of them, but some, some haves you stuck between invisible walls.-DIFFICULTY: It is easy even on Brütal( Tho the final Stage battle took me 3 tries, and with them i found the trick to beat it). Ofc you will need to get upgrades for your axe, guitar( tho for the final hours of gameplay you should have it upgraded to the max upgrade) and the Dragons for health upgrades and whatnot( if you don't get those ofc it will be hard).Conclusion: Heavy metal will never die, 9/10.

												->You'll like this game if you either:   -Like Heavy Metal   -Remotely like Jack Black   -Want to go around in a hellish car listening to some great tunes   -Always dreamed of using your guitar to fight against demons   -You want to feel like a true Metal Hero |m|   -Want to hear the voice acting of Lemmy (may he rest in peace).   -Just want to have fun inside a crazy story that just seems weird to anyone who doesn't like Heavy Metal.->Some good things about this game:    The music, the environments, the characters, the Stage-battles (I think it's a brillant way of mixing heavy metal with RTS) and (again) the music.->Some not-so-good things about it:    The development of the story and the motivations of the characters sometimes don't feel quite right. The overall combat system is not good. The handling of the car is not great, but you get used to it. The mini cutscenes for secondary missions are very (very) repetitive.-> some things to consider:   It's better to buy this game if it's on sale, your teenager-it-is-not-just-a-phase-self will appreciate it. Don't expect a sequel (saldy). Even though the games has many secondary missions and collectibles you can just pass them and collect them while listening to the gigantic soundtrack the game has to offer. I haven't really tried the online multiplayer, but judging from the singleplayer gameplay I think it's awesome. The graphics have aged well, I believe.			"

												I wish I would've played this sooner!  I started it a long time ago, but it got lost in the backlog of steam sales and humble bundles, now the multiplayer portion seems pretty much dead.  it is a shame too, because it is really fun.  The campaign really grew on me too.  It was an action game with a unique storyline and Brutal mode lived up to the name in my opinion.  Money well spent.			"

												This game is verry different from most other games in a positive way.It has not the best graphics, the longest play time or the best gameplay (even if it's not bad in these points, too).What makes this game so good is the story, the voice acting and the metal theme. The developers managed to bring the best of metal together with a deep story. What they created is a grate game with a lot of humor.You play as Edie Riggs(Jack Black) and meet the ""Guardian of Metal"", Ozzy Osbourne himself (that alone makes this game unique). Another thing that this game mastered is the combination of RPG, tactical battles and open world driving. Yes, driving. You can drive from one quest to the next in a big, beautiful hot rod. Dont forget to roadkill the little demonic creatures on the road. The only bad thing about this game is that its over too soon. I enjoyed every single minute of it and that is something that I can not say about many games.If you dont like metal, dont worry, you will like metal after you started this game.I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions or feedback just comment on this.			"

-Quick Review-Brütal Legend is an action, hack and slash game that pulls to the hard rock or metal stereotype subculture. I personally enjoyed one play through for the game.Imagine a world that heavy metal music describes… Skulls, demons, fire, explosions, and hot girls… Brutal legend projects those images into a video game (and quite accurately I might add). Unfortunately that doesn’t necessarily mean the combat in the game was transferred so well, I felt like I was grinding a lot to get through the game. There wasn’t a very fluid sense of progression in the game, and at times I was just trying to count down how many more enemies I’d need to decapitate before the game would be complete.I don’t recommend this game for anyone except people that really like metal music and metal themes (So that you may be revitalized from the combat by listening to excellent music!). As a note about the humor; the humor in the game is quite good which should be expected since Jack Black is voicing the main character and Ozzy Osbourne’s mumbling just got me to smile every time.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You play as the main character “Eddie”, a roadie. I don’t want to get into too much detail because the story was my favorite part of this game, and giving away any of it would take away from your enjoyment if you actually get the game. I’ll just say that the story was pretty good, it didn’t always make logical sense (*cough cough* Legends that I found *cough cough* ), but in the end it was presented very well.Game Play: This is where the game takes the biggest hit, the combat gets old really fast you have a choice between using electric lightning and death, or beating people to death with an axe. Regardless of the fighting style or the weapon you prefer, you will hack your way through (literally) the hoards of hell.It would be nice if they dropped orb, experience points, gold/money, or gave some sort of gain. Ultimately you will get nothing for murdering them. Why murder them? Because if you don’t; they’ll murder you, or your friends and you’ll fail the quest.Additionally the game switches to a “command and conquer” style at various points, and that’s actually where I found myself enjoying the game. Maybe it’s because they let me have wings… I am a sucker for wings… Anyway, you direct your troops and destroy your enemy’s stage. That does get old but it’s more of a strategy game at that point; and I like strategy games.Multi-player:  The online Multiplayer community is kind of dead; not that I can blame it. All you can do for multiplayer is the battles, so directing your troops against someone else’s. I need some of the achievements for multiplayer that I can’t get against the AI on offline mode, so I posted on the forums and hopefully will get a majority of them completed… but I’m not holding my breath; the achievements don’t strike me as very… swift. Achievements: Simple break down for achievements: 1) Achievements for beating the game 2) Achievements for doing all the things in the open world 3) Achievements you get for doing Battles and playing against other human players 4) Achievements you get for beating the game again [on harder difficulties and getting things you didn’t notice or need to restart to do]My response to these achievements is mostly apathetic; I wasn’t impressed and was just looking forward to finishing as much as possible so I could play something that I enjoyed.Price: The price for Brütal Legend is $14.99, I plugged 27 hours into the game, with an intent to play through a few more times (so I expect the game to make it to about 35-40 hours), that’s a fair price for the time, however I didn’t find myself enjoying the game, unless you know you like games like this you should probably put your money into a game that will give better satisfaction.Actually I would prefer to buy the soundtrack as a standalone instead of the game itself. Currently (summer 2014 steam sale) the game is on sale, if you’re really itching for a new game and you think you might like this one, go for it that’s a fair price in my book. Conclusion:Pro’s: I enjoyed the story, the music is great, I understood the subculture humor and references, Jack Black, Ozzy Osbourne.Con’s: The combat is grindy and boring, I really hate driving cars (this game forced me learn how to do use it effectively though…), low sense of progression.It’s annoying that I need to either recommend or not recommend the game because to by honest my opinion falls right in-between both of them. I’m not recommending though just because the game was so grindy.Once again though, if you meet the following description you should overrule my opinion and try it out yourself: A) You like Metal Music, B) You like hack and Slash Games, C) You don’t care about achievements, D) You’re not a perfectionist for world completion, E) You want a game to play for about 10-20 hours.

												Brutal Legend is a different game: it's an homage to metal with great music (as expected \m/), fantastic characters with really good voice acting, cameos (Jack Black, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford, etc) and many references to the genre itself. It's creative, innovative and funny!The art style and integration of metal into a video game worked splendid.Just be aware that this is more a RTS than a 3rd person action game. I knew about the whole RTS thing and I was not disappointed (even though I'm not a big RTS player). The mix of styles could've been a disaster but, to our happiness, it was well implemented.The side quests are fun but do get repetitive quite fast. There are also many collectibles and upgrades to get and extras to unlock. This all gives a little of replay value to the game, if you like that.This is a fantastic game that I recommend everyone to get, even if you're not a metal fan.However, the real question remains unanswered: why can't Eddie jump?➡️️Final Rating: 8/10			"

												Brutal Legend is.... Fun + Metal in one wrapper that doesn't take itself seriously. This is both good and bad. Bad in that it wants to combine open world exploration, hack & slash, RPG, driving, and some odd strategy layer. The problem is that it isn’t GOOD at anything. This game isn't innovative or original in terms of game mechanics, and the controls vary between clunky and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ depending on what you are doing. On the flip side, the game doesn't try to do anything but be fun and humorous. The plot is funny as hell and the character models, script, even the landscape refuse to even try being serious. Which becomes awkward because combat can become painfully difficult at odd times. As for being metal, this game will ring so true to that concept it becomes impossible to conceive of something that could do a better job. The music, the customization options, character models, landscape, everything hearkens back to the era of real heavy metal. I mean, hell ""King LionWhyte"" has so much ""big hair"" that it would have made Dee Snider jealous in the 80s and he uses it to fly! lol :) Honestly I'd say this game was built on ""Sex, drugs, and rock n roll"" since the landscape, and surprisingly deep in game mythology, were obviously made by people on some good drugs and rock n roll is the heart of this game. But the sex part hasn't shown its head yet sadly :/ lol. The easiest thing that could have been done to make this game MORE fun was to offer an in game ""god"" mode so you can just relax and enjoy the hilarity. I'm a notoriously cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to buying games and this title was a gift. But just 4.5 hours in, I would totally shell out the full asking price of $15. Catch it on sale? Definitely worth it.tl : drFunny and fun but mediocre game mechanics... get a trainer with god mode and love the lolz and music			"

												This game, in my opinion, is the symbolism of how metal survived since its creation. Metal vs New Wave, Metal vs Grunge, Metal vs Emo Rock, and always, Metal will triumph. Pretty much how Jack Black's very own Tenacious D has written the song The Metal. The story is amazingly written incorporating everything connected with Heavy Metal. Oh, and if you love puns, this one's great.Gameplay wise, it took me quite a while to really grasp the elements especially the RTS-esque battles in which I suck by the way, so it is a very subjective matter for me. Combat is challenging and you can expect to die a couple of times. The controls are good, and the open world environments are within the concept of a Heavy Metal world. And of course, the music and sound effects, sometimes you wouldn't want to get out of the car just so you can finish a song that is playing. Old and new metal artists are available for you to drive with, including Megadeth, Mastodon, Anthrax, etc.This game is very enjoyable and you can expect to have a very good time head bangin',killing demons, emos, and 80's glam-style enemies, road tripping and just about anything you can do in this game. Highly recommended especially if you enjoy the metal music genre.			"

												Damn, I would love to love this game. Seriously. The music kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Jack Black kicks♥♥♥♥♥ The visuals are stunning - as if they'd built the whole game using every single rock and metal album cover and made the world out of it.However mechanics-wise, it's terrible. The game begins as a sub-par-to-decent third person brawler (with a guitar as a ranged weapon, brilliant!). But somewhere along the line, it becomes some kind of a racing sim. Huh, ok. And then it settles on being a kind of RTS, and a terrible one at that. You need to physically move your character near the units you need to move and there's no visual cue whatsoever to tell you what units, exactly, will be affected by your commands, meaning you end up selecting either too few, or too many.That game had a LOT of potential but it's the designer team had too many cool ideas and ended up implementing none of them properly.

												Brutal Legend can be the greatest tribute ever made to the Heavy Metal music genre. The landscape, the characters, the history, the gameplay and of course the soundtrack merges brilliantly to deliver a game that is a must play for fans of the genre.Although the RTS can be annoying at some times, it is easy to get the hang of it. The playability on the controller is infinitely simpler than on the PC, so I strongly recommend you take out the dust of your joypad for this one.To summarize, ♥♥♥♥ING EPIC!!!PS.: As many have stated, yes, you can ride a mammoth.

Graphics: Despite being a game that's almost 7 years old, they still hold up and look great. The design of the characters, vehicles, weapons and the surround world all fit perfectly together. Great effects throughout.Soundtrack:  In my opinion, it's the best video game soundtrack ever. Over 100 different songs from 75 bands (according to Wikipedia) in all different subgenres of metal. It's just fantastic.Controls: I played the game using an Xbox controller and found the controls very easy and intuitive. Whether it's fighting or commanding troops, the control scheme is easy and doesn't require a lot of unnecessary movement. The only issue I had was sometimes during battle I couldn't pull up my song list unless I hit the RT button multiple times in a row.Gameplay: The game was not quite what I expected. I thought this was going to be an action-adventure game where you solely control Eddie and fight with him. That's partly true. I did not realize the RTS-like elements of controlling and directing your crew throughout the game. It works well and is quite enjoyable, I just didn't realize it was part of the game. I will say that at times the combat feels repetitive and the RTS parts of the game all feel identical for the most part, but never to the point that it becomes unenjoyable.Story: The voice acting in this game is incredible. All of the actors do a fantastic job, especially Jack Black. The story is fun and has a few twists and turns that keep you guessing. I really enjoyed all of the different characters introduced throughout the game, especially the metal legends. I would say this is an absolute must play game if you're a fan of metal, but even if you're not I would still highly recommend it. It's another fantastic example of what makes Double Fine such a great studio.			"

												Ho. Lee.♥♥♥♥♥♥It happens rarely enough that I can bring myself to play a primarily single-player game, and even rarer for me to play a single player game where, when I finish the story, just WISH for the story to be a few ten hours longer!This very game is a testament to the glory of Metal music, and still manages to be an enjoyable video game in itself. I will say that a few percent of the game feel wrong, maybe not flashed out enough, but the rest of it is so BLOODY EXCELLENT that it makes you want to delve back into it multiple times to just experience it. I did get the 100% achievement, and it didn't even feel like a grind, because instead I had a great excuse to spend a few more hours in the Age Of Metal. If you are a fan of Metal music, consider this game a solid 9/10. If you are not, you probably shouldn't bother, but it's still a solid 7/10 even under an objective point of view. If Metal makes up most of your live, like me: THIS GAME IS A ♥♥♥♥IN' CHURCH TO OUR GODS, AND YA BETTER WORSHIP 'EM OR THEY'LL GUT YA!In all honesty, please don't makes us wait for Brütal Legend 2 for a decade, dear Double Fine. You may never be able to replace the legendary Kill Master, though. He will be missed for as long as Metalheads are alive.			"

												In Sum: Awesome soundtrack and voice performances, mostly fun gameplay with some odd controls and a poorly-realized RTS system tacked on.  The coolness overcomes the flaws mostly. 4.2/5-----Jack Black.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Lemmy.  Rob Halford.  If those names mean anything to you, then you know why you have to play this game.  You'll know what you're in for when you see the opening scene.Brutal Legend is a Heavy Metal fantasy game made by Tim Schafer, creator of classics like Full Throttle and Psychonauts.  The game takes place in a fantasy world inspired by metal albums, with many references to metal bands and of course, one of the best soundtracks ever put in a game.  The music alone is like a primer on heavy metal.  The story follows a roadie named Eddie Riggs, who is frustrated by the state of modern music.  The band he's touring with sucks and sounds more like a boy band than rockers.  When their stupid antics result in an accident that kills the roadie, he wakes up in a horrific-but-awesome other world, a world where rock and roll has actual power.  There is an interesting plot with some fascinating characters along the way.  The game is worth it for the performances.  Jack Black plays Eddie, while his Tenacious D partner Kyle Gass has a small role.  Ozzy, Lita Ford, and Lemmy have important roles, as well, but the biggest performances are provided by Judas Priest's Rob Halford and Tim Curry.  Veteran gaming actress Jennifer Hale also does a great role here.  The world never becomes fully realistic due to its fantastical nature, but it never stops being awesome.  This is a game where you can go to a Stonehenge made out of swords, play a guitar riff to summon a Deuce, then drive over to a clone of Mt Rushmore with Ozzy's head while listening to awesome music.  The gameplay itself has some issue, and part of the issue is that the game merges several genres, and not all that well.  The camera is unreliable, for one thing.  But the biggest issue is that the game starts out as an action game, then turns into a odd perspective on an RTS.  That's right, the game is a real-time strategy except instead of being top down, it's viewed from behind a character.  The game also borrows a bit from Guitar Hero and to a smaller extent, RPGs.  At times, it plays like a GTA-style game.  It is a fusion of many different gaming styles, but they don't really fit together.  The RTS system is especially frustrating.  It really is a case of a game's world and immersion compensating for flawed design.  But the greatness of the game in the end makes up for the problems, and it's a great game to play through.			"

 A must have to metal fans!  So I have just stumbled across this game at a steam sale. At first, it was catchy to the eye, then something deep inside me started to ring a bell, and I have just suddenly remembered: ""Oh! This is that game with Jack Black! Yes.Jack F**king Black.I love him as an actor, and a singer/songwriter, so it was inevitable to buy this game, and daamn, I have just made a reeally good choice. The main menu is genius, with live acting in a Vinyl/CD market, searching for that one specific vinyl... I have just cried out of laughter even in the menu, so I had high expectations for the game. And damn those guys they have fullfilled my expectations completely.In a nutshell the game is taking place in a fantasy world, in which we are fighting for the glory of true heavy metal, with such famous characters as:Ozzy OsbourneLemmy Kilmister Lita Ford[/olist] The game is full with Humor, I have just burst out in laughter in every 3 mins or so, but Jack Black's name have just guaranteed that from the beginning. The Soundtrack is F**KING AMAZING!  Some of the bands playing this game's soundtrack:Children of BodomMotörheadOzzy OsbourneMastodonIn FlamesTenacious D (what a surprise)Seriously Guys, the only negative thing is that the camera is a bit sloppy, and the vehicle handling is a bit har, but aside from these things it's a must have to metal fans! 9/10 	 "

												Just Finished this game last night, and all I could say was Hmm that was Pretty Good!Brutal Legends is a Humorous Adventure Action game with the theme of Metal, I Myself is a Huge fan of Metal and the Soundtrack is Friggin Awesome. Lotsa Licensed Music which are really good plus Eddie Riggs Voiced by Jack black and he was pretty damn good at it, Remy Kilmister, Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford were awesome although Lita Ford's character did not offer much but overall was pretty good. The Intro for this game was so Hype! They Introduced Eddie Riggs and his Job as a Roadie and the really Bad music at this time of age wanting to go back to the past, then one of the band members does a dumb stunt and Eddie Riggs had to save him but perished. His blood reached his belt and summoned a metal demon which brought him to another world then with the Help of ""Children of the Grave"" by Black Sabbath's Intro the Hype of the game was at maximum level and what showed afterwards was not a let down as well.The Gameplay was pretty suprising really, it was like an RTS Action game but it was really damn fun and the Enemies were not so easy it would be a breeze, the whole game was balanced out making sure you're not so overpowered it's easy so the game offered some challenge as well or at least that's what I got from the maximum Difficulty. The Story was pretty interesting, making a revoloution to go against the emperor of demons and taking them down after Eddie Riggs was shown. The Story was interesting enough to keep playing and the Characters even though they were fictional they were very believable because they felt like they are similiar personalities from normal metalheads which easily made you understand them even the headbangers were believable despite their look xDStory 7/10Sound 10/10Gameplay 8/10 Overall 8/10An Awesome game to sit your♥♥♥♥♥if you're a Metal fan, this game made me want a sequel but sadly the 2nd game was cancelled, oh well. I Recommend this game even if you're not really that into metal I'm sure it will help you love metal.			"

												I think this game is Jack Blacks wet dream transformed into code. As weird as it may sound, that is not by default a bad thing.  Also, Ozzy Osbourne is an immortal guardian of metal that spawns from lava. You go arround, summoning thunder from an ""axe"", and smacking people, animals, demons, and an occasional flying leech with an actual axe. What could possibly go wrong?			"

												The most f*ing metal game you'll ever play. Do you really need more than that?Seriously?Well, okay. The game is a bit of a mix between open world adventure and strategy game, all played in 3rd person mode, so if you don't like mixed games or specially dislike some of those parts you might not like the game. Otherwise, is a fantastic piece of art.			"

												You don't have to be a metal fan to like this game. This game is about a world where metal makes up the basic laws of the universe. And as it turns out, this is a pretty interesting aspect by itself.This game is about Eddie Riggs, who is the hero in the story. You explore the world, get new skills and fight in metal fights. You act both as the coordinator in battles as well as a front-line fighter in these battles. It is advisable to look up the different strengths and weaknesses of your units in a wiki to see when you should build which types of units.A lot of fun (and a lot of metal).			"

												Brutal Legend is a really cool game with an original concept and fantastic aesthetics. The visuals are beautiful, the music kicks♥♥♥♥♥ and the gameplay is a genre-blending fusion that feels like it was designed top-down to answer the question ""What if the the hero was a roadie?""Despite being really cool in concept, though, I found the actual gameplay to be lackluster. Exploring the open world is fun, but the combat is button-mashy and the stage battles are just confusing. It's the kind of game that's fun to watch someone else play, but when you play it for yourself, it's like, meh.Ultimately, it's a kick♥♥♥♥♥original concept with beautiful visuals but otherwise mediocre execution. It's not BAD, and it is very cheap (it's been on sale multiple times at 90% off), but it's also not a short game, and there are a plethora of other, better games competing for your time.			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #30: Brutal LegendBrutal Legend is an unapologetic love letter to hard rock and heavy metal music.  If you are a fan of this kind of music, that alone is enough for me to recommend this game.  But as it happens, Brutal Legend also happens to be pretty fun.The story in Brutal Legend is pretty damn silly.  It's not meant to be taken seriously.  But if tongue-in-cheek humor is not what you are looking for, then you should look elsewhere because Brutal Legend brings it in spades.The gameplay is a mix of combat and exploration.  The beginning is fairly combat heavy, but as I wrapped up my first hour of play I started to get a sense for more of an open world feel to the game.  Combat itself is fast paced.  You start with a huge axe for melee attacks, but you also get a guitar which shoots lightning (don't ask, just go with it).  But the game will also build on these basic attacks and unlock combination attacks and ""guitar solos"".Along with the combat and exploration, the game also features vehicles.  It was a lot of fun the first time I hopped in a vehicle and started mowing over enemies.  I also did a boss fight entirely in vehicle, which offhand I can't remember ever doing that in a game before.I didn't find the gameplay terribly difficult, at least at the beginning.  I played on normal difficulty and did not find it to be much of a challenge.  But it's always hard to judge from the first hour of the game, as it's not unusual for the difficulty to ramp up as the game goes along.The art is pretty solid.  The environments were pretty varied, but it's the character design that really stands out.  And as you would expect for a game playing homage to rock and metal, the soundtrack is magnificent.  I love that Brutal Legend has a real soundtrack and not just some generic guitar riffs.  It's a great mix of rock and metal.I had way too much fun with Brutal Legend not to recommend this.  Unless you just hate music, I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

												Great game, great music, still works well, supports 1440p res I played at (probably 4k no prob), looks surprisingly good for a 2006 game...The side quests can get a little repetetive, but they are fully optional. It has a lot of funny moments.It joined 3 types of gameplay, driving a car, RTS and hack and slash.It doesn't take itself seriously, or the metal culture either, it's a pretty light game, is enough for 10 - 20 hours, depending how many side quests you want to do.If you think that everyone who does not like to listen to METAL should DIE, than you need to play this game.If you like Jack Black, you need to play this game.Gameplay:

												After Psychonauts (which I personally loved) Double Fine amazed us again with this awesome title. Brütal Legend!!! In my opinion a game that every Metalhead should play. Many hours of action and some simple strategy gameplay, which I found exciting and interesting of course. Starring Jack Black (As Eddie Riggs), with the guidance of various Metal Gods (for example : Rob Halford) and with an long and marvelous Metal playlist you will have lots of fun. The game amazed meI give this game 9/10 "

												Brütal Legend is not only very funny and has an amazing soundtrack, it also has one of the best facial animations I've seen.The voice acting is also top notch – No surprise there, considering that the voice actors include Jack Black and several Metal Legends.Sadly, the gameplay is only mediocre. Even the strategy part, while unique 'cause of its third person controls, is very tedious.But even if you are only slightly interested in Metal, you should try this game out. It is simply fun.			"

												There are no words to describe Ozzy Osbourne explaining to Jack Black how to please the Gods of Metal. This is a landmark in this history of mankind 11/10.The voice acting is priceless. The whole game feels the exact way it should: metal. No need to mention the sound track. The story is awesome, the jokes are right on spot. Apart from the regular ""hack'n'slash"" in a quasi-open-world scenario, you'll find yourself busy with guitar-hero-like mechanics, racing, side quests and some other minigames (which unfortunately get old after a short while). The main point of the game seem to be the Stage Battles, which acts like some sort of RTS: you train units (metäääääl), give them orders, send them to destroy the enemy's stage, and of course, you lead the charge. Or you sit there playing your guitar, buffing your units. There are just so many funny things to do in a single Stage Battle, you can hardly get bored, seriously.The achievements are fun and relatively easy (except the Cönquerer). If you have Linux and need ""Six Degrees of Schafer"", write down here and I'll be glad to help. Linux only.If you are a mëtalheäd and you don't buy this, the Gods of Metal will be disappointed.			"

												Despite of me being a fan of Jack Black, I was afraid this game will be a miss after I saw the trailers. Thats how it normally goes after someone from movie/music industry attempts to create a game. I was wrong.The game contains amazing humour, amazing soundtrack, interesting story and it very successfully blends managment with being METAL!The ambience is amazing, and the game quite successfully sidetracks you into doing side missions to unlock different METAL upgrades for your axe, guitar or VEHICLE OF DOOM. Although side missions get repetative, they kept me entertained and made me ask for more.The story is a bit short, as it could be completed in several of hours if you disregarded all of the side quests, but as far as the overall game goes, I can't really compare it with anything I know. Pure Jack Black style.\m/			"

												This game is epic in terms of music and concept. Where else would you find Jack Black, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy and Lita Ford together? NOWHERE!! The soundtrack is awesome and you would find yourself singing and banging your head along the game if you are fan of metal. The humor is Jack Black-ish if you catch my drift. Really funny.But even if I love so much the concept, the game itself has its issues. The POV and the motion of the camera is... weird. Not very comfortable and not easy to control, at least on pc. Other than that, I loved it.			"

												Not a fan of metal music? This game will make you one. Brütal Legend is an open world action adventure strategy game with melee combat and RPG elements all rolled into one. You play Eddie Riggs, a roadie transported into a metal world divided by war. When I say metal world, I mean metal world. Everything from creature and character design to the smallest of details is in some way inspired by heavy metal music. The best part about it is that you don't have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate the world and just have a good time mowing down everything you can with the Druid Plow, while listening to over 100 licensed metal tunes, of course.  Combat is centered around two weapons; an axe for melee and guitar for ranged combat. Both can be upgraded with cosmetic and weapon effect changes. Vehicular combat is also present with multiple possibilities ranging from the classic minigun mount to minelaying.   I can't say that the RTS elements work in its favor however, I feel the game would have been better off without. There's not enough depth in the strategic battles where Eddie sprouts wings, controls unit spawning and sending them into battle. Compared to the fast action paced face melting combos you were doing less than a minute ago, the slow RTS battles feel tedious and boring.  The characters all feel unique and genuine in their own way, the story feels right even though it may be just a little bit generic. The main quest line is fun to follow trough but side quests can get repetitive, mostly consisting of ambushes and the occasional defense against 5 waves of attackers. These are just bad attempts at prolonging the experience offered by the game.  Overall this is a terrific game set in an cool world with an awesome soundtrack. It has its small little problems, but the goods far outweigh them. There's about 15 hours of gameplay here to complete everything there is to offer and to top it off a multiplayer mode that matches you against other players in RTS battles.			"

												 Legendary roadie, Eddie Riggs (Jack Black), has an accident at a gig and wakes up in Heavy Metal-land. Which sucks because Heavy Metal-land is under the oppressive ruler-ship of the ultimate poser, Whitesnake!...or somebody. Eddie teams-up with Lars to lead the headbangers to freedom. Let's Rock! (Or we could just drive around, see the sites and listen to some music.) I have a very limited interest in Heavy Metal, So that aspect can only bring me so far. The world that is created and it's backstory are quite good and the various characters are fun as well. The story would be right at home on contemporary movie screens.The main missions are mostly over-the-shoulder RTS type battles. I found these battles to be kind of hard and not very fun. Until I stopped trying to play them like an RTS, then they just weren't so hard. I avoided playing them for as long as possible by doing other stuff. There are collectables to be found, Jumps to make and side missions to do. Unfortunately there are only 5 different kinds of side missions; Hunting, Racing and 3 types of fighting. So not much variety there.  I even went after achievements to delay having to play a stage battle. I went with a mouse+keyboard+controller scheme. For me, Walking around and fighting will almost always be m+k and I much prefer a controller for driving (and of course playing solos). This made things a little messy as I had to relearn some things depending on what I was using. But I got it down for the last couple of battles.Interesting concept and groundwork, But not much else. A marginal recommendation. "

												Brutal Legend is better than it’s ever been, both as a single-player open-world game unlike any you’ve ever played and as one of the best unique takes on real-time strategy.It’s like a frantic, crazy rock festival: you might have lost your shoes, you might have fuzzy recollections of vomiting, but you can’t wait to go back right in, as soon as possible. That’s what Brutal Legend’s all about. The characters are lovable and the soundtrack is simply phenomenal.If only the developers had had the strength to break free from their original vision and concentrate on what's really good in Brütal Legend. A lot fewer stage battles and a lot more reckless driving and action-packed smashing of heads. In any case, this title is an absolute must-have for anyone who can tolerate the curious RTS design decisions.			"

												I really enjoyed playing Brutal Legend because it's a charming and fun experience. Being a fan of rock and metal makes it a lot better. Jack Black does a fenomonal job as lead character and overall I had a great time playing.I liked:- The way you can walk around and just discover things- The music and the humour! + the feel of the game and the surroundings- The gameplay is not stale but varies with driving levels, RTS, quests and moreI disliked:- The driving is hard (IMO). When you bump into something the boost you recieve when taking off makes you go all over the place and drive into something else.			"

												This game is a mix of third person Zeldaesque adventure and isometric real-time strategy.The strategy sections suck. Really, they're bad. But that's not why you should play this game.You should play this game for its incredible world and atmosphere. The world is built on key elements like ""noise"" and ""pain"" and ""blood"". It has its own heavy-metal mythos. It drips with a kind of weird mix of humor and melancholy.If you can just play the game as an experience, instead of fixating on the bits of the game that were never quite finished or the poor attempt to shoehorn RTS gameplay into an otherwise sound adventure game, you will have the feels.

												Gameplay-wise it's not exceptional - average, really -  and I found the story mode rather short. However, the game makes up for that in other ways.It's a game where a hot-rod built by titans races a taxi driven by a demon in a field of exhaust pipe cacti.It's a game where half-naked amazons ride fire-breathing sabertooth gorillas into battle against gangs of emo zombies.It's a game where you play literally face-melting riffs against a spider composed of chromed engine parts.It's a game where every scene and landscape looks like it belongs on the cover of a 70s or 80s heavy metal album, the story feels like it came from the song lyrics of said album, roadies are ninjas (it makes sense in the context), and there are cliffs built out of giant loudpeakers.Yes, it's that kind of game - set in a delightfully insane world, full of tongue-in-cheek humor, quirky characters, and (how else) plenty of METAL.It's the most f***ing metal game you'll ever play, and you'll love every minute of it.Bring on the impalement!

												Nice open world, main plot line with a couple of twists, a buncha side quests would make a nice game alone. But this one also has awesome world and character design, legendary performers cast for voice acting, and what is I am most grateful for — huge playlist of wide spectrum metal songs. I somehow missed huge amount of classic metal earlier in my life and now I think of no better way to catch up than “Brütal Legend”. Some of strategic combats were frustratingly tough for me though.

												A total gem by one of gaming's master humorists: Tim Schafer.The game is nearly flawless with the only complaint I have being that there isn't MORE of it!An excellent soundtrack that will please both Heavy Metal diehards as well as newcomers to the musical genre. It serves as an easy intro to a musical scene that might otherwise prove exclusionary to those who don't immediately ""get it"". Trust me by the end of this game, and probably long before you will understand what Heavy Metal is all about.Tim Schafer is able to bring the more humorous and satirical elements of the musical genre to the forefront without once compromising it's soul. Let's examine closer though the actual game and it's facets:GAMEPLAY: While the bulk of the game is played as an action-adventure, there is a noticeable portion that is a real-time strategy meta-game, which has thrown some people off. Luckily one game-mode compliments the other and if you play around with it you should succeed.The main action-adventure portions has you controlling the main character, Eddie Riggs, as he uses a battle axe to cleave through enemies, and a guitar that allows you to perform magical attacks and perform short ""solos"" which are quick time rythymn events to unlock special moves or summon a hot rod you can use to zip across the very large landscape.  You can upgrade your various weapons and hot rod by collecting fire tributes through various missions in underground garages. This has every aspect of an action adventure game you could possibly want, a HUGE open world, side missions, collectables that unlock new songs and background story, and lots of enemies to fight.The real-time strategy missions utilize a similar control scheme but focuses you more on controlling large groups of your army you recruit. The gimmick is a little confusing at first and involves building merch booths on fan geysers to collect enough points to purchase more units to send into battle, but once you get the hang of it becomes quite enjoyable and rather intense. Aside from the army control, Eddie can also use his guitar solos to buff his soldiers or do combo-attacks with each of the select unit types for special damage. The units include Headbangers (Infantry), Razor Girls (Ranged), Thunderhog (Medic), Headsplitters (Ranged Vehicle), Bouncers (Anti-Vehicle Infantry), Roadie (Building Demolition), Fire Barons (Anti-Infantry Vehicle) Metal Beasts (Short Range Anti-Infantry), and Rock Crusher (Ranged Assault Vehicle) all of which have a double-team ability with Eddie.GRAPHICS: The game just looks great, it doesn't go for super realistic but has a very stylized look that at all times makes you think of Heavy Metal Album covers. The design of the world is deliberately gothic and looks like if H.R. Giger did paints of Norse Mythology. The skyscapes look breathtaking and the world is chock full of delicious eye candy that makes you just stop and take it all in. Truly exceptional!MUSIC: There's not much more to say, this is a Metalhead's wet dream. There are 20 original songs made for the primary campaign and 107 full length heavy metal songs that can be unlocked and played in-game through the Hot Rod's radio.VOICE ACTING: The main character Eddie is voiced by Jack Black and he does an amazing job of providing life to this character and making him truly enjoyable to watch and play as. The rest of the cast is all-star for Heavy Metal fans: Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford, Lemmy Kilmister, and Rob Halford, plus other known names like Tim Curry and Jennifer Hale round out the amazing vocal talents this game has.STORY: The story is a lot of fun to experience, and while certainly not the best out there, it carries a lot of power and keeps you interested through-out. I only wished we got more of the story involving Succoria. By the time the game ends I felt ready to keep going!All in all there's no reason not to play this game, if you enjoy good humor, awesome metal music, or just plain ole' fun action gameplay, this game will satisfy!

												THERE IS NO STOPPING METALThis game left me speechless so many times but I will try to muster some words for this review.Where do I begin? Oh yeah, WITH THE GENERAL ♥♥♥♥ING INSANITY THIS GAME DELIVERSSeriously, I cannot think of a more, pure, unadultered Bad♥♥♥♥♥game. Nothing really tops this game on the ""hardcore"" scale.-------------------------------Enough chatter, time for the game.The game is surprisingly well-made, and no wonder since Double Fine, the dev team, made some perfect classic action games like Psychonauts. They had the experience and you can see it in-game.I have to say the best thing about this game is the audio. MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING METAL. Apart from the astonishing soundtrack, the voice acting is godly and it features sacred metal beasts like Jack Black and Ozzy Osbourne, to name a few. Solid, solid voice acting and music. Your ears will experience ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game.JUST LISTEN


YouTube™ Video: Full Brütal Legend OST 

			Views: 170,311		

			Brütal Legend (2009) was developed by Double Fine and published by Electronic Arts. The soundtrack was composed by Peter McConnell. Tracklist: 1. The Chosen Roadie (0:00) 2.		

A very, very, very strong point about this game is its story. I won't even go into detail as to not spoil it, but it's absolutely GREAT. Characters are very well portrayed. Cartoonish elements and humor are abundant, giving this game a one-of-a-kind flavour. One of the best cutscenes in the gaming industry. I don't even know if you can skip cutscenes or not, but no one is complaining! I never felt the need to skip a single cutscene!Game-mechanics wise, I must say it's pretty good. It has visceral combat, a progression system, customisation, free-roam, missions, metal solos. Double Fine did a great job and the game is just fun to play, though I must say the game itself is not the center of attraction here, like many hack-n-slash action games.Game graphics are just great. Some eye-candy moments throughout the games, but the character animations and expressions are the best. The universe is 100% awesome.-------------------------------The game delivers a moral, and that's the passion for metal, which I was not a big fan when I first stepped in and now, well, let's say I had a change of heart.THE HEART OF METAL♥♥♥♥ING BRUTAL GAME AND YOU SHOULD KEEP AN EYE FOR IT8/10			"

												The game is funny, has a great voice cast (including metal legends Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy Kilmister) and has a great soundtrack (even though I'm not that much of a metal fan).So, why do I not recommend it? The fighting and driving are ok, nothing to write home about, but I can live with that. What I can't live with are the RTS mechanics. I'm not a RTS fan, so that obviously is a factor here, but even so I could have managed, if the mechanics weren't as lacking as they are.The game is fun until you get thrown into one RTS battle after another, which I just hated and which is the sole reason why I stopped and most likely never will continue.If you don't mind the RTS parts of the game: GET IT! It's a good game in all parts but the RTS.			"

												awesome game. badass soundtrack, simple and fun combat and open world with lots of sidequests to do (most of them can get pretty boring very fast but they can still provide some fun). Boss fights are made in a unique stagefight style that transforms the game from hack n slash to hack n slash strategy game. you summon troops and control them to capture geisers that provide points (fans) for your troops to ultimately destroy enemy stage. Overall, it's one hell (literally) of a fun game and i highly recommend it!			"

Took the guitar and went on journey:WingBrutal Legend, woah man, where to start...First of all - if you are a fan of rock/metal music or/and RTS/Action games - don't think, just get it.Story is about Eddie Riggs, Roadie, who is teleported into other world after blood spills on his belt, and from there... his journey begins... he meets Ophalia, Lars and Lita, they are trying to liberate humanity but they need an army (Let's just mention that Eddie finds Ophalia when he is trying to escape from the Temple of Ormagöden ), and here's where our Hero comes in handy with his Guitar - In normal world it makes noises, in this world it shoots frickin' Lightning Bolts and Fireballs!About Music... Oh man... It's pure metal, with over 300 tracks on the playlist (+ around 25 to find in world), unfortunately, OST contains only 12, 12 out of over 300 great tracks!Characters are memorable, unique, every one of them is awesome!And the true magic of this game... It has no HUD, you can open map, but there's no mini-map, health bar, etc. Just you, Deuce, your car, few homies, great music and majestic world!One more thing if you don't like vulgar language and gore - both of them can be reduced to minimum and you're even asked for that in the beginning of the gameSUMMARYGameplay - 9/10 - It's great, action-tactic packed game, if you can get it on promotion (1,5€/$), JUST GET IT!Audio - 20/10 - Come on, what were you expecting, THERE'S OVER 300 TRACKS IN GAME! MAAAAAAN!Graphics - 8/10 - Nice, pretty, bloodyDifficulty - 6/10 (On Normal difficulty) - If you're casual to RTS games, or you suck at them... well... you'll have a hard time playing this oneOVERALL - 9/10 - It's one of those games when where you start to play, you just can't stop, something is pushing you further and further, until you reach the end of the game, music is GREAT, gameplay is GREAT, world is AWESOME, characters are GREAT - If I should describe this game with one word, it would be AWESOME!

												Brütal Legend is Jack Black's open world, Metal Apocalypse, video game. His finger prints are definitely all over it which I was glad to see. He plays the main character who is a roadie, wielding his guitar as a ranged weapon and his literal axe as his melee weapon. It was a very entertaining game, I loved the voice acting and cut scenes. His humor comes through in a great way and in my opinion was the shining feature of the game.There were some different styles of gameplay incorporated. In the main campaign there are some battles that turn into an RTS type of showdown. I was surprised by this at first but it actually played pretty well. I do have my problems with some of the gameplay though. The traversal was something that just didn't really feel all that great to me. The handling of the car wasn't so good and you would have to drive it in narrow places at times and that became very frustrating. I also thought they could have done a better job of incorporating combos in the hand to hand combat, it just didn't have that type of connected feeling where you could string together a bunch of attacks and counters.Those beefs aside I did enjoy many different features in the game. You play guitar riffs, in a way that I thought was reminiscent of Ocarina of Time, to accomplish different tasks. You can pump up your army in the RTS mode, summon your car, or melt the faces off of your foes with a wicked solo. They also have a pretty sick upgrading system for your character and car that is introduced and run by someone that you might find familiar.There were some really cool little legends that you can listen too that sound like some kind of Metal Mythology. I thought this was a nice touch and it gives some background to the strange land you find yourself wondering. All in all it was a very Jack Black game, and I totally enjoyed it and was glad to have given it a shot. It didn't strike me when it first released as something for me, but the almighty power of the Steam Summer sale made me reconsider. It proved itself to me as a legit video game and not just some celebrity endorsed junk.For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blogHttp://www.SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com& follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews			"

												Pros:- great story- great voice acting- fun creative world- I enjoyed the soundtrack even though I'm not a heavy metal fan; the variety of songs (over 100) really gave me an appreciation for the genreCons:- game play is all over the place: beat-em-up, driving, collecting, action RTS: you'll problably find something you like but if there is one of these you hate, it may make you not want to finishing the game- the action RTS is the supposed innovation in this gameplay; it's quirky and fun, especially if you play all the different factions but at its core it is _very_ chaotic and there will be many battles where you're not sure why you won or lost. I can't help but think this would have been a better game without the action RTS element.			"

												Wanna trick your friends into playing RTS? Gift them a copy of brutal legend. What begins as a comedy starring Jack Black transforms into an endearing an homage to the Metal. The whole rock ecosystem, from headbangers, to roadies, to hairmetal palatials, to the corporate owners take part in glorious rock battle. A phenomenal soundtrack as you cruise in your metal car through one of the better open worlds to come out of 2009, All of the dialogue is filled with nuggets of comedy and leaves players finding new lines through multiple playthroughs. The game ages well and plays smooth. The controls are relatively tight, and easy to manage, and even translate well into RTS with this cross breed. Playing cooperatively against the AI is enjoyable with friends. The amount of effort behind the multiplayer show the commitment the development team had for the project. While the online community is small for multiplayer, the brutal AI is a worthy adversary. This game is definitely a unique gem to add to your collection.bought during Winter Sale 2016BRUTALLY ENJOYABLE			"

												I wish that Jack Black was in more games. Brütal Legend is an open world, action RPG from Double Fine Productions. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI think the obvious answer to this is Jack Black.If you’re a fan of Tenacious D, this game is pretty much Tenacious D: The Game.The soundtrack is fantastic. Whether you’re cruising around in the Deuce or just wandering around seeing the sights, the blend of well known metal music and original composition is glorious.There is a satisfyingly ample amount of items for you to unlock in the “Motor Forge”. Their are weapon upgrades for the Deuce, weapon upgrades for your character, and additional attacks to use. There are also purely cosmetic items to acquire, however, like paint jobs, new clothes, and giant stone heads.There is a large array of enemies for you to hack to pieces as well as indigenous fauna for you to harass. All the designs are brilliant and very much metal influenced.The story is great, the dialogue is funny, and the game never takes itself to seriously. This is a trait which we don’t see enough these days.The map is surprisingly big and makes for a good amount of exploration.The BadI’ve got nothing here, sorry.The MehThere’s no DLC, so, once the game is over, it’s over. This makes me a sad panda.Verdict: YeaIf you’re a fan of jack Black, Tenacious D, or metal music, then BL is very much the game for you. You can pick it up in the Steam Store at your earliest convenience. It is money that you won’t regret spending. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												It's late, I should go to bed. Why do I care so much to write a review on a game that no one plays anymore?Because it was that amazing that it deserves every ounce of love I can show online.There are games that are different and new, Games that makes the word, ""unique"" come to your head. Hell I wish I had a better vocabulary but thesarus.com is too far away and the melatonin is kicking in.I'll try and stream line this.You like metal, or rock music in general? That should be enough.What about the game play?Well it's like dynasty warriors met with Age of Empires and they had better art work and imagination then a college full of  diehard 21st century artists.The onle real problem with this game is the storymode is too short even though the world is MASSIVE,Not only is it BIG but BEAUTIFUL! They really put effort into everything in this game world I explored everyinch of it becuase it was literal art. It makes the 150+ collectables fun. Yeah let me start a new line and retype that.IT MAKES COLLECTIBLES FUN. You could literally do more productive things than collect things that just add up towards some achievement that no one will apperciate but yourself. But when you do it in Burtal Legend, you're doing it to a soundtrack that even now beats out Grand Theft Auto 5's. It's gory with Limbs flying off and literal face melting, this was probably Jack Blacks last best thing he did...before Goosebumbs...Anyway, for  $15 you're gonna have a good time. If you like metal you're gonna have a good time,if you like button mashing while commanding troops to flank and control the battlefield like the genius I know your are you're gonna have a good time. If you like Jack Black and Lita Ford you're gonna a have good time.You're gonna have good time, take it from someone who doesn't write reviews very often on steam.			"

												Do you want to melt the faces of emo posers with an electric guitar? What about with Ozzy, Lemmy, and Rob Halford backing you up? All with the most kick♥♥♥♥♥arranged and original soundtrack playing at the same time?Brutal Legend is a game mortals are not yet worthy of. Hilarious and witty writing, tight and satisfying combat and even RTS/tower defense mechanics, all in a world that is a manifestation of every and all things traditional heavy metal and a satorization of its watered-down derivative genres. At the Steam price, this game is a steal. A decently long campaign and fun multiplayer versus mode, you should buy this game just to ride around in your car to the classic 70's and 80's metal soundtrack alone.			"

												Pros:- great story- great voice acting- fun creative world- I enjoyed the soundtrack even though I'm not a heavy metal fan; the variety of songs (over 100) really gave me an appreciation for the genreCons:- game play is all over the place: beat-em-up, driving, collecting, action RTS: you'll problably find something you like but if there is one of these you hate, it may make you not want to finishing the game- the action RTS is the supposed innovation in this gameplay; it's quirky and fun, especially if you play all the different factions but at its core it is _very_ chaotic and there will be many battles where you're not sure why you won or lost. I can't help but think this would have been a better game without the action RTS element.			"

												If you are bored with frequently occurring game models, then this one is for you! It is just different in a postive way. The plot is a mix of comedy and serious, metal stuff. Oh, about metal - you can find here a lot of good tracks, from classic heavy metal to black metal. It's really cool to ride through metal world and listen to some good music.About mechanics, they are also great. In theory you have sandbox, but many missions are about delivering stuff, racing, attacking groups of enemies, defending certain places. You are not obliged to do side missions, but I'd suggest doing it for gaining Fire Tributes for upgrading your vehicle (Deuce).Whole world is not ""rigid"", if you know what I mean. You can change many parts of environment and improve the look of your character and his weapon. There are a lot of different guitars (yeah, that's the weapon!), clothes etc.This game reminded me the reason for which I love metal. :)			"

												I wish that Jack Black was in more games. Brütal Legend is an open world, action RPG from Double Fine Productions. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI think the obvious answer to this is Jack Black.If you’re a fan of Tenacious D, this game is pretty much Tenacious D: The Game.The soundtrack is fantastic. Whether you’re cruising around in the Deuce or just wandering around seeing the sights, the blend of well known metal music and original composition is glorious.There is a satisfyingly ample amount of items for you to unlock in the “Motor Forge”. Their are weapon upgrades for the Deuce, weapon upgrades for your character, and additional attacks to use. There are also purely cosmetic items to acquire, however, like paint jobs, new clothes, and giant stone heads.There is a large array of enemies for you to hack to pieces as well as indigenous fauna for you to harass. All the designs are brilliant and very much metal influenced.The story is great, the dialogue is funny, and the game never takes itself to seriously. This is a trait which we don’t see enough these days.The map is surprisingly big and makes for a good amount of exploration.The BadI’ve got nothing here, sorry.The MehThere’s no DLC, so, once the game is over, it’s over. This makes me a sad panda.Verdict: YeaIf you’re a fan of jack Black, Tenacious D, or metal music, then BL is very much the game for you. You can pick it up in the Steam Store at your earliest convenience. It is money that you won’t regret spending. As always, thanks for reading.			"

There is a lot of metal music in the game and a lot of references to metal bands.

A solid third-person brawler with RTS and RPG elements, it tops off its winning formula with a killer soundtrack comprised of 70's metal and 80's hair band tunes that will be running through your head for hours after a play session.

												This game has everything a metal enthusiast's heart desires, but it doesn't stop there. From the trailers I have seen back when it came out in 2009 I expected a funny, metal infused comedy put into a videogame, but I got so much more than that. You would think that Jack Black and the all-star cast of voice actors is enough to sell the game but nuh-uh, there's more. The hilarious, epic and sometimes cheesy story works on so many levels if you ever had long hair, wore band shirts and maybe branched out to some make-up for the ultimate concert look. I never knew you could build up such a perfect metaphor for all the scenes and subgenres of Metal, yet it's no caricature and can stand perfectly on its own as a serious, comedic approach to the world of Metal music.Your ears will be spoiled with a fine selection of shredding guitars from Classic Rock over Hair Metal to Black Metal. In the first hours into the game I thought it was all about Classic and Glam Rock, but when I heard Carcass pop up I creamed my jeans and will definitely go through my old records, since my mouth is watering for Metal again!This game left me stunned after it ended and this is probably the only downside of it. It has an end.10 out of 10 metal horns!			"

												This should have been my favourite game ever: Jack Black uses the power of metal to battle demons, set against a bad♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack. Unfortunately, the world wasn't particularly interesting once you drove around a few times (and you will drive around more than a few... dozen times). Also, the gameplay itself reeked of a creator unable to decide what game they were making: Hack and slash? RTS? Tower defence? Open world vehicular combat?I loved the lore, and loved the idea, so this is almost heart-breaking, but I'd say play for a few hours and if it doesn't grab you, just watch all the cutscenes on Youtube.

												As I finished this game, I was left wondering why this game wasn't better received. Sure, the strategy mechanics are a little clunky in the stage battles and the combo mechanics aren't deep enough to sustain 100+ hours played. But the aesthetic is amazing, the story is great and it's amazing fun. A fun mix of open world brawler and strategy-lite, it doesn't overstay its welcome. The game is over well before the mechanics prove to be tiresome and while it's not the biggest game, the ride you do get is immensely entertaining.			"

												I've played Brutal Legend alot because it's so fun driving around hitting creatures with the car or killing them with my guitar and at the same time listen to awesome music! I think they succeded to make a game very much like Jack Blacks personality with The D in the background on some sidequests as well as Ozzy as the gaurdian of Metal and many others! The gameplay itself has alot of metal with awesome solos like swords hitting the ground or the skill to melt faces around you, and that's just some of them. When it comes to the sidequests many of them are much alike, but they aren't less fun because of that, though the best thing in this game must be Eddies comments during the game as well as the other characters comments when killing someone and in the cutscenes. This is something that makes the game very much enjoyable! Another important thing to mention is that this is a game that you can play for a very long time and some achievements are actually hard to achieve like the one were you need to play with someone who has the achievement by playing with someone else with the same achievement, a very annoying concept I must say. Well, this game is GREAT! I had alot of fun and I think the story was very interesting and made the roadie a star for a change, though I won't spoil anything! Good day.			"

												Fun and goofy, the game is worth playing. However, its controls are terrible, and the driving mechanics are rage-inducing. I can't even begin to think about the number of driving escort missions I failed multiple times in a row just because I was stuck on geometry and had to spend a minute or more trying to maneuver my way around so I could *maybe* get back on the path.The game felt short, and after the final boss fight, I felt happy to see what the next area would be like, only to find myself watching the end credits. I felt like the game ended abruptly, either because they ran out of time, or because they're saving stuff for Brütal Legends 2. Either way, if it's on sale, give it a try.			"

												Being a Tim Schafer fanboy my review of this game is almost certainly biased, but I must say it was freaking excellent. As with other Double Fine games I found it difficult to adjust to the controls and felt like I had to fight them and the camera a fair bit, but it pays off entirely once you get the hang of it because the sheer manic fun of the game just makes it so worthwhile. An engaging storyline, clever comedy, star appeal, excellent graphic design, and even an awesome soundtrack. I've never been into rock or metal much, but this game has left me with an open mind about this sort of music and have been on something of a rock and metal musical quest ever since playing Brutal Legend. Kudos Tim Schafer, kudos. 9 out of 10, would head bang.			"

												First, if you're a heavy metal/metal/rock fan you should just go and buy this already. This is one of the best action games I've played for quite some time and HELL IT HAS JACK BLACK IN IT! If you're wondering about the soundtrack well, it's what you expect, Man O War, Omen, Black Sabbath, Anvil, Brocas Helm, Children of Bodom, Cradle of Filth, Dark Tranquility, Dimmu Borgir, Megadeth amongst many others, as you can see it's a pretty good line up. NOW BEWARE, the controls may feel abit clunky at first because this is a  Xbox 360 port and a very bad one if you ask me, after a while I eventually got used to the controls. It is an open world game with side quests and mini-quests that along with the main storyline mission may provide you around +18 hours of gameplay. The voice acting is quite good and it features tons of ""metal legends"" themselves in the game. Overall I would say that it's a quite good game considering how old it is but I find it sad that Double Fine didn't do a better job in porting the game to PC, that said I'm sure that some people will find the game worth the full price and I strongly recommend those to pick it up.

												hello ladies and gentlemen,this is my review of Brütal Legend,the game was released on october of 2009 for the xbox 360 and the ps3,and in this year of 2013 double fine announced a pc port of the game via steam,but unfortunatelly the game didn't receive much attention because of its genres,which are Action-adventure and Real-time strategy,but let's talk about the game itself,the voice acting is very good,i personally find it flawless,the graphics are great,i simply loved the soundtrack,which is almost only heavy metal musics from lots of bands,107 tracks from 75 different bands,all the characters are memorable and lovable,also,the main character was voiced and modeled after Jack Black,the game's humor is good,i have to admit i had some good laughs with this game,the controls answer very well,the story is not something that great,its told slowly during the game,the game has a fair difficulty too,killing the enemies is very satisfying,but it can get a little repetitive,the world is really big,which you can explore while not doing a mission,there's also a multiplayer,which is quite fair,and can get really challenging,with a good number of maps,the AI is good,but if an AI is sent somewhere,for example,if it finds an enemy,its gonna go attack him,forgeting its original  command of going to a certain place.there are other two little problems,this one is probably because i'm not very good,but its about the racing side-missions,sometimes the game throws some curves that are quite hard to take,since the car can get really quick,it gets harder to do curves,you are gonna understand me better when you start using it,but that's just a little thing we all can ignore,but about the other one,it's fletus,the character you race against,when the player is pushed by fletus,it looks like it's a moving wall,not a car.in the end,the game is very good,though it has some flaws,but its not something that will ruin your experience,in the end,this game gets my rating of 9.2/10.00			"

And who wouldn't want to be pulled into an alternate dimension where everything runs on badass music?...... Actually, don't answer that.Lastly, the story. It's believeable and a very compelling one.

												 I thought this game looked interesting when it first came out on consoles but, I didn't end up buying it. Then I saw it on sale on steam and I figured I would give it a try. I am not a huge metal fan. Before I played this game I was into some metal but, I never really heard of a lot of these classic metal bands. This game changed all of that, as soon as I began playing I got into the metal theme and music. The game is about a roadie named  Eddie Riggs (Jack Black) who is transported to a metal themed world after a terrible accident at a concert. This game features a Stellar sound track and cast, as well as a unique concept. The game play is a mix between some basic hack n slash, drive/shoot mechanics and some RTS elements. I am one of the people that didn't enjoy the RTS elements of the game, wich require you to play guitar solos to build fan booths on predetermined points used to spawn allies. You also get demon wings during these sections that allow you to move across the battlefield and command your army. The first time was fun but, after that it became tedious and somewhat frustrating. Though I do appreciate the unique use of RTS elements. However, this didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the game because I liked the other elements of the game enough to force myself to get through the RTS sections. All in all I enjoyed the game and I couldn't be happier with my purchase if only to introduce me to some kick a$$ metal that I had missed out on for the first 21 years of my life. If you appreciate unique ideas, good music, good humor, and a strong cast, then I would recommend this game. If you have doubts then wait until it's on sell, at that point you can't go wrong.  \m/ Rock on!			"

MOTION SICKNESS WARNING: You'll use a (kickin' rad) vehicle to get around Brutal Legend's sizeable sand box world, but due to its Heavy Metal theme, terrain is very uneven and makes steady smooth driving difficult. You'll be accelerating and decelerating at different rates, and this gave me a lot of nausea. If fast-moving games give you the same problem, then Brutal Legend may have the same effect.That aside, Brutal Legend is more an experience rather than a game. Set in an intricately-designed landscape inspired by metal album covers, you step into the shoes of Jack Black/Eddie Riggs as you headbang your way through your foes in defense of all things Metal and righteous. As you progress through the main campaign, you will recruit hearty groups of warriors to your cause, adding to an army that will help you rock your way to victory.However, the gameplay is lacking. There are three main ""mini-games"" that Brutal Legend will keep bringing you back to: Third-Person Hack&Slash Action, Real-Time Strategy, and Driving. Main Campaign missions will typically focus on one of these  aspects, but frankly I never felt engaged enough with any of them.With Hack&Slash Action, I just waded in and mashed the attack buttons, occasionally circling to avoid getting hit and letting my health regen. Fights are chaotic masses of blood and special effects, making it hard for me to know what I did beyond haphazard slashing, or what can or did kill me and what I could've done to avoid that. With Real-Time Strategy, I spammed unit-building and just charged en masse to whatever needed killing the most. That's my own single-mindedness at fault more than anything, but the unit-selection wheel was hard to manage with the mouse which led me to my less-involved approach. Finally, with Driving, in addition to my nausea, control of my vehicle didn't feel smooth and made it even less enjoyable for me.Also, there is a multiplayer option that focuses on the RTS aspect of Brutal Legend. I tried it once, but the same objections I had for the gameplay earlier apply here as well. Also, odds are good that you'll be facing a lot of players with much more RTS experience, so try out AI opponents first.Overall, I actually do still recommend this game; despite my grievances, I did still enjoy the well-designed setting, and the story, and Jack Black as Eddie Riggs is a very relatable protagonist. However, I recommend this only as an interactive open-world movie that you only need to go through once, and only to fans of heavy metal and/or Jack Black, and also if said fans aren't prone to motion sickness.Note for OCD Collectors: Brutal Legend also has a lot of ""collectibles"" in the game, and fortunately once you finish the main campaign...  you can get an item that acts as a collectible compass. It won't mark them out for you explicitly on the map, but it will save you a few hours of squinting and searching.  "

												This game is pretty cool, especially for those who love metal.They have put in various songs in this game that really rule, and Jack Black really fits the voice of the main character.You play solos to spawn a car, buff teammates or other things.There are elements of ""hack and slash"" and also basic RTS elements in this game, mostly when you fight a kind of boss, they put in some kind of RTS setup. Here you get wings and fly around the small battlefield to command units to do this and that and gather resources.However this part I don't like, it was fun the first time, but the second time it got boring and you will see it many times more.Will I recommend this game?Tough question, because they put in this RTS element in many of the main fights, it almost made me say no. But that may only be my own personal opinion.There are other things in this game which makes it worth to buy, I enjoyed it because of the metal theme, where you also meet some metal gods in-game. And there is a lot of fun comments from the characters that made me laugh.So this game was fun for me. I recommend this game because of these things, but also be a little bit sceptical and do some research before you buy it. "

												This game starts with you saving the life of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ band of rap metal (they die later).After sacrificing yourself, you are teleported to an era that's very well designed. You can get lost in the design of the mountains and the structures around the land and you can enjoy a ride with good metal music in the background.The enemies are very good designed and the voice acting is great. There's no enemy or ally that annoys you with their voice and they are all useful.The battle system it's 3D Zelda based and you can unlock stuff the same way Link does it. Play the guitar to summon your car, to activate structures, to call a zeppelin on fire that insta-kill everyone around you when it crashes. It's good.The only bad thing it's the lack of jumping. You are driving the car on the highway. You see the end of the road and in an attempt to not die you jump of the car because it's too late to stop it. You see yourself in a branch and there is a gap between you and the highway. You move and you fall to your death. You may ask ""How the ♥♥♥♥ did you manage to get in that situation?"", but I ask ""How the ♥♥♥♥ I can get to the other side without dying?"". You say jumping, but the game doesn't know what is that. You are dead.			"

												Brutal Legend combines Metal, Open World, Hack and Slash and RTS.-And that is a lot of things to combine. I had a blast playing this game at the start, but in the end ultimately ended up really disliking how this game is done, and how lazy the developers have been in multiple parts.First off, the combination of Hack and Slash and RTS is a pretty bad idea, and this game really shows you why. While it could have ended up being okay, Brutal Legend ultimately fails at delivering. The Hack n' Slash was really fun, but once I progressed further in the main story, I would suddenly have to deal with all the bs the RTS sections bring with them. The camera angle is not fit for this kind of thing in the game making these sections very unenjoyable, and makes them feel like a drag and an unnecessary addition.Later on you get wings to help you during these RTS sections, but there is one problem: They are given to you so you can travel to help your teammates, and so they end up only giving no real help, just more things to do.The side missions are repetitive, and after a while you will have the same lines stuck in your head, for they repeat the same sentences each side mission. None of the side missions really even add anything new to the table, if I remember correctly they had 2-3 different side missions which you can do.Car controls are very bad, and after a while might give some motion sickness. At least my friend felt like puking. The handling is awful and is painful to watch.This could have been great if they just made this your average hack and slash game. What this game needed was more side missions, different voice lines when entering them and more things to do in the world. Not real time strategy boss fights.			"

There is some RTS invovled in this game as well as it's small Open World Adventure. If you like heavy metal you will definitely like this game (i'm not a fan but i still enjoyed) although the game seemed to drag out at times and some parts felt like fillers to the story. I haven't completed this game as the gameplay isn't very enjoyable. Like when there was an army battle it was like 20 v 3 waves of 20 so it wasn't really fun, i prefer mass numbers where the troops are weak not small numbers wher everyone is strong.

												Absolutely love this game. Played it a while back on Xbox 360 and it was one of my favorite games so I had to pick it up. I got it in a Humble Bundle for $6 so you can't really beat that. I had trouble getting it to start at first as it would just go to a black screen and after many google searches and no avail, I restarted my computer and the game works fine. So anyone that has trouble with this game just restart your computer and see if it works for you. Thanks Double Fine for making a great game.			"

												Brutal Legend is a great game, with a wonderful setting, but with noticeable flaws in the gameplay and execution.The game has much trouble in communicating the player the type of experience it really is. You start with a clear idean that this is an open world adventure game, only to be surprised (in a bad way) that it is actually an ""action RTS"", with a pretty rough control scheme and some ""pointy edges"" in the game design.Its flaws are impossible to ignore, but there is so much charm, and so much passion put into this game, that you almost forget they even exist. The idea is pioneer, to make a game homage to the rock n'roll, especifically the heavy metal culture. It is wonderful, you feel immersed in a sort of ""Alice in Metal Land""and it feels amazing.The voice acting and stars are also superb, with each cameo being better than the last one. Many of its good elements are rushed and could be fleshed out into something even more exciting, but don't let stop you from buying this game. Although you will have some trouble with the mouse and keyboard controls, and will face inevitable disapointment with your ""open world adventure""expectations, this game is worth a shot for its concept alone!Overrall, I would rate it a 6.5/10, but don't get fooled: this game is a MUST for any metal fan, and a good deal for any gamer who enjoys clever humor and original experiences. If there is a sale, do not pass it out!			"

												Highly recommended!Brutal Legend is really one of the more unique gaming experiences you can have. A must own for any heavy metal fan, there's a lot to be found for everyone. The visuals are unique and do a great job of conveying the atmosphere of old heavy metal album covers. The voice acting is extremely well done and the story is quite enjoyable. While some seem to find the forced stage battles (a sort of Real Time Strategy mode) a deal breaker, others may find a fun break in the hack and slash action.  Overall I'd say give it a try, you should know within the first hour or so if the game is for you! \m/			"

												This is my 2nd time playing this title (1st one was on XBOX360) and yeah, it is the same enjoyable game.Fisrt things first: This game is freaking B-A-Utiful! Everywhere you look it is an awesome oldschool metal album cover. Everything is so perfectly designed that it's hard not to love it if you are even a slightly casual metal fan. from corroded stone HUGE sword-like monolith to a HUGE amplifier cliff with winged microphone like birds. It's so much to see that this is too small to be an spoiler. And yes: this game tourism spots are HUGE!Now, characters are lovable in design and the dialogue is clever (yet sometimes mission NPCs dialogues are too repetitive). Yes, it is one metal joke after another in character design as in dialogue, but it is almost heaven for me. Besides, it has Ozzy and Lemmy in it. How can you not love it?Soundtrack is perfect. Period.The only not-so-enjoyable part are the RTS part... it feels so lacking that it almost hurt. It's not as right as the rest of the game, but you can take that burden quite fair.I do recommend this game if you like Hack n' Slash and metal. How not to?			"

It's a third person hack n' slash, and admittedly it's competitors do it better on the combat front (DMC, GoW, Darksiders etc.) but Brutal Legend has awesome writing and if you're a metalhead there are so many in-jokes and such. Basically if you love Metalocalypse, metal, third person hack n' slashers, and Jack Black this game will be right up your alley. Seriously, Ozzy is in it, Lemmy (RIP) is in it. It's just great.

												Not really much of a game, as it does not feel like much, yet it is enjoyable. Perhaps I like this game not for the story or the gameplay but the atmoshere it has with all of it's focus on rock and roll. Having said that it is hard to play again when it hardly compells you with weak multiplayer and gameplay. However if you need some lyrical madness that will hopefully last you 10 hours or so this is your kind of game. Just don't expect challenging interesting gameplay, that develops (or much multiplaying involved).			"

												\../ Awesome game for Metal fans. Game is filled with humor, has an interesting story, great voiceacting, great soundtrack/music and fun characters. Some fun mechanics like using people that are part of bands/concerts as units to attack enemies, melting people's faces with guitar sounds, also metal themed weaponised car. Only flaws with this game i think is the controls. This is not designed well for keyboards, so you'll have tough time using one. And controlling a car in missions where you must avoid stuff is really really annoying.			"

												An absolutely unique introduction to the world of Heavy Metal music, the creators want to take your hand and share with you their love for the genre of music. The game mechanics are honestly just garbage, a  poor mix of irrelevant hack and slash, and awkward RTS  - BUT that doesn't matter, because it's a rich experience in the way that it introduces you to a real culture outside of the game, and showers you with treasures from it. Going into the game I had never heard a single song from the it's rich soundtrack, now I love almsot every song and have been encouraged to search for more. This game is sort of like traveling to a new place, having an ear-opening experience and growing your tastes and experience as a person. The gameplay isn't really fun, but it won't matter when your having mind blown by the soundtrack.			"

												I'll spoil my review right now: Get this game. Get it now. But only if... You love metal or love music. You love amazing vibrant art styles that ring out so powerfully from almost every other game ever made you'll be in awe the first time (and quite a few times after) you see it. From classic, classic metal visions of twisted earths with massive beasts with huge metal jaws, covered in spikes to sly slinky monsters that slither through black water towards you. This covers almost every genre of 'Metal' that exists.This game is just pure briliance, and what else can you expect from Tim Schafer, creator of Psychonauts? (Well, except him being a complete jerk.) Jack Black alone makes the game worth playing, but expect to run in to many, MANY 'Rock Gods' on your journey. Like... Well, I won't ruin it. But if you're a fan of Black Sabbath...The game isn't as perfect as I say it is, so I've got a few things to complain about so let me point out the major flaws.This is the big one: The game transitions from being primarily a hack n' slash to a... RTS esque battling system. You still control Eddie (voice by Jack Black, duh.) and can still run around on foot (or drive around in car) and kick♥♥♥♥♥ But you'll also be responsible for taking control points, commanding units and making sure you keep your resources up. Don't worry, it's NO WHERE near as complicated as most RTS games, but the change takes time to get used to.A few of the later 'battles' can become very frustrating due to how some enemies work and how you are positioned to them. Mostly since you start with almost nothing and the enemies can start out full pelt. Especially on higher difficulties.In fact, all I really have to complain about is the combat... But unfortunately, since that's what the gameplay is... It's a big one. This game has done almost everything perfectly. The music, the visuals, the cameos, the voice acting, the 'solos' you learn and the story. The animated cutscenes you have to seek out yourself to learn the backround are gorgeous, the scenery is pure eye candy. It's truly a fantastic game. Unfortunately, the combat itself will ruin the game for a lot of people. If you can adapt to it, (It's seriously not as bad as you think, but I have to be fair.) this game will be somewhere on your top games of all time.Summary/TL;DR: I am in love with this game. It's gorgeous, in fact, some of it made me tear up a little.. But, it's flawed. It really is. Play this game if you want one of the greatest (top 5 easily) stylizations that's ever been in a video game and most likely ever will. Play this if you want FANTASTIC voice work. (For gadzooks, it has Tim Curry!) Play this if you want a great value for your money and to be sucked in to an amazing world that left me depressed for a full week after I finished it... Because there was no more, and most likely never will be. I give this game an 3.75 out of 5. "

												I played this previously on the Xbox 360 and beat it with all of it's DLC.Despite what critics say, this was one of my favorite games I've ever played, Why?Because the story is well written, the music they chose for it, along with choosing when to play it, couldn't have been more perfect to make every moment all that much more memorable. The cast is great, really good acting, and you can tell everyone had fun being part of this. When you DO finally see the true Antagonist named ""Diviculous"" All you will think is ""SMMMMMASHIIIING!"" Because he's voiced by the same guy who did Nigel Thornbury in The Wild Thornburry's Cartoon. It makes it all that much more comedic though. Parts of this game are just Bad**s, and other parts are so dumb its hilarious. Some of people who worked as cast in this are, Jack Black, Kyle Gass, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, Lemmy Killmister, Kath Soucie, Dino Andrade and Jennifer Hale.This game was one of those masterpeices fully based around music and an original story based around metal and rock music. The actual gameplay varies based on what youre doing, it is a free roaming adventure, but also during ""Stage Battles"" it changes to being a Real Time Stratedgy the only game to play anything similar to this is Smite, but it plays in its own unique way honestly. There is multiplayer capabilitys for stage battles. During Stage battles (and in story) there are 3 different factions, Ironheade ""With an E on it so people know we're serious"", Drowning Doom (the emo/goth faction and only female lead faction), and the Tainted Coil (.....there's no way to describe them other than Bondage would be their thing...and more). If you're a Metal fan/Rocker I HIGHHHHLY recommend this, it's funny, it's awsome, it's inspiring, it's emotional, you will spend at least 20 hours in the story not including time to finish EVERYTHING, the game is GREAT!!! 10/10!!!

												This game is just another title from Double Fine. And we all know that that means...There are three qualities to this game that make it worthy of the hype it has gotten. For Simplicity's sake, I'll label them.It's true to the source material.This is suprising since the source material is just Metal. Metal songs, and metal cover art, and that's it. Now drive around the land that the game takes place in, and tell me that you can't take a screenshot of ANY LANDMARK, slap a random cover title on it, and tell someone that it's a real CD cover. This is quite spectacular, but it's nothing for Double Fine. They seem to specialize in surreal locations that others couldn't imagine existing. They made Psychonauts, after all. They also use metal instruments for all background songs. ALL OF THEM. (Sadly, you won't hear it that often because you're too busy listening to the 107+ metal songs on the radio in your car) If you are a hardcore Metal fan, you won't be disappointed.Characters applenty.As a Double Fine game, it makes sense that every character has lines for any situation that they can get into in game. Your allies sees Eddie play a song? Compliments come in. They see Eddie take off? They can say that your wings look cool, or tell you not to leave them, depending on the circumstances. Also, the commentary is hilarious. The guy that takes the case though, is Eddie Riggs, the main character, who is voiced by Jack Black (the voice behind Po in Kung Fu Panda, among others). He takes the cake by staying true to the character of a Metal Roadie thrusted into the world of Brutal Legends, all the while showing off his incredible comedy skills.Real Time Strategy goes fast paced.Now, when have you heard strategy and intense being used together. At all? It's incredibly rare, and hard to pull off, but Brutal Legends did it. They made a Strategy game that's more than amassing troops and sending them at the enemy base before they reach yours (Although that still works). With nuke solos, powerful double teams, and various other nasty tricks to pull, the RTS element of the game, the Multiplayer Stage Battles, is incredible, capable of turning the tables with the right move, and mixing hack and slash into there so you can join the fun of killing your enemy's troops over and over again! And with three different factions, each with their own playstyle and strategies to pull off, you can enjoy it again and again.If you kile RTS games, Metal, or the works of Double Fine, this is a game that won't disapoint. If you have an aversion to any of these, then run now, and never come back.			"

												(Disclaimer: This is a completely un-ironic and non-satirical review. Most of my other reviews are silly and are supposed to be funny, but this is a 100% true account of this video game.)I know that at the time of me writing this review, it says that I have barely any hours put into this game. This is true for the PC, as I just bought it on sale. However, already having 150+ hours on console, I feel that I can effectively write a review of this game. Brutal Legend has been, since I bought it in early 2010, one of my favorite video games of all time. I do not say this lightly; this game has touched me personally and changed me. This game introduced me largely to what i am today.First, a little backstory. I was blessed with a very musical family. Me, my brother, and my father all play instruments, and I have been around guitars and hard rock ranging from ACDC to Metallica from a young age. My parents are both fans of metal, and so from a young age, I listened to music like Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, and Dragonforce, just to name a few. One of the earliest band shirts I ever remember wearing was an Iron Maiden shirt in first grade.Video game have also been a medium for my family for years; we've had consoles ranging from the Saturn to the Dreamcast to the N64 to the PS1 to the original Xbox, and we still have a plethora of consoles to this day. I have always been a fan of video games, and luckily my parents don't mind what kind I play; in fact, some of my fondest memories were of playing Halo 2 system link with my parents in their room and me and my older brother in the living room (my father drilled a hole in our wall to make this possible).Anyways, shortly after the game came out (about February 2010) we went to Best Buy. I had some money left over from my birthday in January (I believe I just turned 11, and was in fifth grade), and I wanted to get a video game. The choice came down to Red Faction: Guerrilla or Brutal Legend. After carefully reading the backs, I decided I had to choose: destruction, or heavy metal? I ended up buying Brutal Legend; however, I did buy Red Faction a few months later.So I went home, and it being a weekend, I played the game for hours. I beat the game in a few days, but continued to play it for much longer. I believe that the last time I've played, I had every tab, and I know I had every upgrade. I beat the game on Brutal at one point. I believed this game was pure perfection. When I was younger, as I've said, I only really listened to some baby metal; this game showed me the wonders of different subgenres. I've come a long way over the years, all thanks to this game. I started out with bands like Dethklok, and now I listen to all different types of metal, with my favorite being Atmospheric Black Metal along the lines of Summoning and Drudkh. This game was the reason for all of this.Another amazing aspect of the game was simply the detail in the characters and the world. I found the game mesmerizing as a child, and believed it was hilarious; not just in the dialogue, but the depiction of the stereotypes. I remember laughing with my father as he expressed amazement at the fact that Lemmy, Ozzy, and Halford were in the game. I remember thinking it was the funniest thing as I reamed goth people in a car while blaring speed metal. I remember the depictions of Hair Metal kids as sellouts, and loving it. Understanding the references may not be hard, but for a fifth grader, it was liberating, finally being able to understand comedy.As for the gameplay itself, the game isn't that amazing. Basic combat and the clunky RTS elements make it a bit awkward, but the game more than makes up for it in sentimental value and world design. I eagerly, and relatively naively await the day that Double Fine announces Brutal Legend 2, despite the fact that it probably won't even happen. When it does, it will be among one of the games that I have preordered, a list that as of now only consists of Bioshock 2 (a severe disappointment in my eyes) and Dark Souls 2.In conclusion, Brutal Legend is an amazing game that has a special place in my heart. This review may not be too helpful, as I recognize the fact that it's all sweaty fanboy-ism, but I felt that I had to let other people in on a personal experience I've had with the game. If you are a fan of heavy metal, play this game. If you aren't a fan of heavy metal, still play this game, because the amount of detail and the humor are still enjoyable. Plus, maybe it could broaden your musical tastes and FORCE you to like metal! In any case, I cannot recommend this game enough. I have had more enjoyment with this game and hold it in higher esteem than any other, except perhaps Dark Souls. This game changed me as a human being, for better or for worse, and while it may not touch you in the same way that it touched a cringy antisocial preteen (THAT SENTENCE SHOULD NEVER COME OUT OF ANYONE'S MOUTH), you may still find some enjoyment in it. Hell, if you buy it on sale, you pretty much just spent three bucks on ""Drive Around and Kill♥♥♥♥♥♥While Metal Plays Simulator"". If you can't find enjoyment in that, I feel sorry for you.			"

												Seriously underrated game. A lot of people hate on this game for it seeming to be low quality, non- interesting story line, or just not fun to play. For me this game was one of the most fun experiences i've ever had playing a game before. The music is amazing, the gameplay is interesting and always throwing new things at you, and it isnt too large that it takes forever to complete. I bought this game a long time ago and never played it, but after logging in and completing the whole campaign in one go, I can safely say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. So if you get this game as a gift or as a humble bundle I highly reccomend playing it all the way through. And if youre just reading reviews to consider buying it, DO!			"

												This is my 2nd time playing this title (1st one was on XBOX360) and yeah, it is the same enjoyable game.Fisrt things first: This game is freaking B-A-Utiful! Everywhere you look it is an awesome oldschool metal album cover. Everything is so perfectly designed that it's hard not to love it if you are even a slightly casual metal fan. from corroded stone HUGE sword-like monolith to a HUGE amplifier cliff with winged microphone like birds. It's so much to see that this is too small to be an spoiler. And yes: this game tourism spots are HUGE!Now, characters are lovable in design and the dialogue is clever (yet sometimes mission NPCs dialogues are too repetitive). Yes, it is one metal joke after another in character design as in dialogue, but it is almost heaven for me. Besides, it has Ozzy and Lemmy in it. How can you not love it?Soundtrack is perfect. Period.The only not-so-enjoyable part are the RTS part... it feels so lacking that it almost hurt. It's not as right as the rest of the game, but you can take that burden quite fair.I do recommend this game if you like Hack n' Slash and metal. How not to?			"

												A game brimming with heart and style, lacking not in quality but in an identity and proper marketing.  Graphics and art style hold up today with every landscape, monster and toon serving as a gorgeous tribute to its subject matter.  Animation does get buggy at times, but seldom enough to rip you from the experience.The music and soundtrack for this game is exceptional for enthusiasts.  A solid variety of tunes from various genres of metal are sure to appease all but the most discerning of music palettes.  Voice acting is top notch for the most part, at least when it comes to the big name VAs.Story holds your attention.  It's not going to reverberate in your mind when you're done playing the game, but isn't so awful that it gets in the way of your enjoyment.  The humor and dialogue holds up alright, but again, won't win any awards.  Your love of the writing will likely be based on your love of Jack Black or the various musicians/actors who cameoed in this game.Where the game still falls short to this day is its attempt to make a console friendly RTS.  Controls are streamlined enough to only allow for the broadest of unit management.  Keyboard and mouse controls do help, but little effort was made to properly port this title to PC (game still uses a controller friendly radial menu for Solos and army building for instance).  This can sadly make some of the RTS segments feel like a grind compared to the action portion of the title, especially if you're struggling to get through a segment to advance the game.The action controls also sadly suffer in the PC port.  Having to hold a lock button down in order to dodge feels wrong, and not allowing the player to remap it as a toggle switch discourages its use entirely.  Futzing with the radial menu for solos will require adapation to feel natural.  Thankfully, mouse control for camera does alleviate some of the control issues with the previous game.  The driving also feels better in the PC port compared to the console.Online community has largely left this game, but the campaign and single player experience is certainly worth the buy in.  The map is impressive in size and hides all sorts of secret goodies that will have you hunting around for a good deal of hours if you're the completionist type.  Driving is a thrill and just cruising around the map while a favorite song plays on the radio can hold your interest.  Side missions give you lots to do, but it can get very samey very quickly (So many Ironheade sneak attack missions are the exact same setup).  The game gives you plenty of fire tributes (in game currency used to purchase upgrades), so you can thankfully cherry pick those mini games that appeal to you, or simply harvest them from the collectibles.Sadly, because the online community has left, you're opportunities to play as the other factions within the game are limited principally to AI skirmishes.  Bugs do creep up from time to time.  Minor visual bugs can take you out of a cutscene, but haven't yet cropped up during gameplay.  Game has crashed to desktop on me once, but no progress was lost due to rigorous auto-save system and being fortunate enough to not be on a mission.  Moving in and out of the map and menus can also be an inconsistent experience (sometimes pausing the game, sometimes not).Despite my issues with the game overall, it's still very playable.  It is both a tribute to metal while itself being a work of visual and auditory art.  If metal music or culture are of any interest to you or if you ever wanted to try a game that's a chunky blend of God of War, Grand Theft Auto and Dawn of War, this game is worth a purchase.  Those seeking a competitive RTS experience should look elsewhere.			"

It's a third person hack n' slash, and admittedly it's competitors do it better on the combat front (DMC, GoW, Darksiders etc.) but Brutal Legend has awesome writing and if you're a metalhead there are so many in-jokes and such. Basically if you love Metalocalypse, metal, third person hack n' slashers, and Jack Black this game will be right up your alley. Seriously, Ozzy is in it, Lemmy (RIP) is in it. It's just great. Plus when it goes on sale it's 2 bucks.			"

												Best $1 game I played ever. It's like a combination of  The Lord of Rings and Metal lol. Even though it's mainly an action game, it gets to RTS(not really) at some point where you can flying around and produce/command your troops  from above. The entire story-line surprises me since by a look of it I thought it might be a few hours long to get to the end, where it in fact took a longer trip with more fun adventures. For the side quests I love the racing game the most, the upgrades for all the equipment and cars are aweeeeeesome, it's also funny to see the the metal of god brings something new to say everytime when you visit. I never thought someone could come up with such crazy ideas and put all the fun stuff together to make a game full of chaos, post apocalyptic and metal. Even though it's a one-time fun to play, it totally worths the money and will bring you lots of fun.			"

												A crazy and unique open-world, action, adventure, and real-time strategy game.  That's right... it even has RTS game-play that was modeled after the amazing Sega Genesis classic Herzog Zwei.  There is quite a bit of depth to the RTS with lots of different unit types and the ability to control where each group of units go on the battlefield.  Some of the RTS battles were very difficult and I had to replay them a couple of times, and each time could be a half hour or more.  I changed the difficulty level to “gentle” so I could get past some of them.  In addition to the RTS battles, there are missions to rescue people, escort the tour bus, and racing sequences.  There are also lots of side missions.  The story is fairly complex and interesting and is told with a lot of humor.  If you like Heavy Metal music it has a great soundtrack and cameo appearances from several famous band members.  Overall it is a fun and unique experience that should not be missed.			"

												This is a third-person, open world, hack and slash adventure. You play as Eddie Riggs, a Roadie who gets killed in an accident on stage, but is transported to a magical world of Heavy Metal. It is a blast to play and the characters and humor are excellent. So is the soundtrack. You unlock over 100 songs and while I’m not a metalhead, I thought the music was one of the best things about the game. I’m thinking of picking up a few CD from the best bands included here, especially Angel Witch.Apparently Double Fine is thinking about a sequel to this game. I will have to crowdfund that one.			"

												This game is just another title from Double Fine. And we all know that that means...There are three qualities to this game that make it worthy of the hype it has gotten. For Simplicity's sake, I'll label them.It's true to the source material.This is suprising since the source material is just Metal. Metal songs, and metal cover art, and that's it. Now drive around the land that the game takes place in, and tell me that you can't take a screenshot of ANY LANDMARK, slap a random cover title on it, and tell someone that it's a real CD cover. This is quite spectacular, but it's nothing for Double Fine. They seem to specialize in surreal locations that others couldn't imagine existing. They made Psychonauts, after all. They also use metal instruments for all background songs. ALL OF THEM. (Sadly, you won't hear it that often because you're too busy listening to the 107+ metal songs on the radio in your car) If you are a hardcore Metal fan, you won't be disappointed.Characters applenty.As a Double Fine game, it makes sense that every character has lines for any situation that they can get into in game. Your allies sees Eddie play a song? Compliments come in. They see Eddie take off? They can say that your wings look cool, or tell you not to leave them, depending on the circumstances. Also, the commentary is hilarious. The guy that takes the case though, is Eddie Riggs, the main character, who is voiced by Jack Black (the voice behind Po in Kung Fu Panda, among others). He takes the cake by staying true to the character of a Metal Roadie thrusted into the world of Brutal Legends, all the while showing off his incredible comedy skills.Real Time Strategy goes fast paced.Now, when have you heard strategy and intense being used together. At all? It's incredibly rare, and hard to pull off, but Brutal Legends did it. They made a Strategy game that's more than amassing troops and sending them at the enemy base before they reach yours (Although that still works). With nuke solos, powerful double teams, and various other nasty tricks to pull, the RTS element of the game, the Multiplayer Stage Battles, is incredible, capable of turning the tables with the right move, and mixing hack and slash into there so you can join the fun of killing your enemy's troops over and over again! And with three different factions, each with their own playstyle and strategies to pull off, you can enjoy it again and again.If you kile RTS games, Metal, or the works of Double Fine, this is a game that won't disapoint. If you have an aversion to any of these, then run now, and never come back.			"

												A crazy and unique open-world, action, adventure, and real-time strategy game.  That's right... it even has RTS game-play that was modeled after the amazing Sega Genesis classic Herzog Zwei.  There is quite a bit of depth to the RTS with lots of different unit types and the ability to control where each group of units go on the battlefield.  Some of the RTS battles were very difficult and I had to replay them a couple of times, and each time could be a half hour or more.  I changed the difficulty level to “gentle” so I could get past some of them.  In addition to the RTS battles, there are missions to rescue people, escort the tour bus, and racing sequences.  There are also lots of side missions.  The story is fairly complex and interesting and is told with a lot of humor.  If you like Heavy Metal music it has a great soundtrack and cameo appearances from several famous band members.  Overall it is a fun and unique experience that should not be missed.			"

												Brutal Legend is an EPIC experience for EVERY metal head or upcoming metal head! The Overworld is designed with Badassness in mind. The creatures are straight from the sick depths of hell. From Spiders made of steel that spin guitar string as web, to a MIGHTY HEXTADON that shakes the earth below him! Be able to tame these creatures with the SHOCKING melodies from your LOVE GIVER Tenacious D guitar. The lore of the land is METAL (literally).Buy upgrades from the Guardian of Metal (Ozzy Osborne), Heal your team with the smooth bass strums from The Killmaster (Lemmy Kilmister), Burn you enemies with the fiery touch of the Fire Baron (Rob Halford), and ride the beasts with Rima the Leader of the Zaulia (Lita Ford).+10 points for best Jack Black role. +10 for Metal gods being involved. +10 Best Metal Soundtrack. +10 for DLC already added.Cons:Few graphic glitches (Mostly LionWhyte's Crazy Hair and Ophilia's hair at the end)A couple of holes in the world that will get you stuck (not really easy to get to)Light Becon for map doesn't always point to the right placeEven with that 50/10, Would slay metal armies (free serpants, find legends, unbury metal, and murder hell beasts in the name of Ormagöden!!) again			"

												Awesome, just awesome. To be honest the gameplay itself isn't very original and the combat is repetitive to say the least, but these are not the things you love Brutal Legend for. The main feature is the sound and dialogs and believe me they are great. Yeah, the humor is somewhat simple and yeah the plot makes as much sense as in porn movie but this game gives you the mood, gives you the sense... Hell, it gives you the SPIRIT of heavy metal. I've been enjoying every single moment of Brutal Legend. It's worth every f******g cent I paid for it. Oh, and one more thing. If you won't be making ""horns"" with your index and little finger while playing Brutal Legend, you are stale and heartless person. : )			"

												Okay it IS a console conversion so the graphics aren't exactly super Hi Res and the control system is a bit of a pig to get used to if you are using mouse and Keyboard. However, if you like the Jack Black sense of humour and taste in music this diverse hack n slash is ROCKENNNNNNN. It's on sale right now and you'd be foolish not to grab it. PURE fun. *edit* Special thanks to Total Biscuit for drawing my attention to this one (The Cynical Brit)			"

												Ok, I've played this game all the way through a few times.  And let me tell you, that is an acheivment in itself.  There are very few games that I can complete at all, let alone more then once.  Brutal Legend paints a great world, with fun and interseting characters.  I can honestly say that this game got me into metal.  There are a few rough edges in the gameplay department though.  If you play this, do it for the story, characters, and music.  The gameplay is passable enough to get you through to the end.			"

 Brutal Legend Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. If you don't already own this game, then you are missing out BIG TIME.Brutal Legend was released on the 26th Feburary 2013 and i am loving this game so far, In this game it has everything a human wants  in a ,Film Music, Entertainment , Comedy, Action and lots more. This game is superb, It is controller supported so i recommend you play with a controller and the driving, the killing is all fantastic.Pros:- Humorous.- Good Driving.- Good actions.- Easy to play.- Liking the single-player.Cons : - The combat is weak.- Freedom of the explorable open world largely wasted.- The action is often floaty.Despite its weaknesses, Brütal Legend pulls it off. It’s the ultimate tribute act, with metal in its soul and a heart as warm as a stage light. It may not have much in the way of polish, especially years after release, but it does have personality – not enough to hide its flaws, but plenty to temporarily bury them under a landslide of rock. I would definitely recommend Brutal Legend and i will give this game a 9/10 because the Weak Combat just didn't impress me that much but this game is FANTASTIC and definitely worth buying.			"

												For starters i am going to ignore the controls and will bring them up a little further down. Ignoring the controls the game is brilliant one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard in a game, classic jack black humour amazing scenery and atmosphere i truly felt like i was in a mystical place of rock and roll.the whole commands and conqure esqe parts of the games are okay but occure way to often its a major part of the game and i felt like it should not of beeni felt like it belongs along side the other side missions with the occasional one being a main mission because of these moments having crazy difficulty spikes i have gotten stuck in the game.another reason is because of the controls, these have got to be in my opinion some of the worst controls i have ever come across in a port since saints row 2 pc port, both the keyboard controls and the controller controls while the button layout are decent the fluidity and stiffness of them drive me crazy and really suck me out of the game a lot ofthe time mainly in the RTS moments. That being said, i have a feeling that the ps3 or 360 versions controlls are a lot of fluid. I do reccomend this game, but just not on PC			"

												That's right, the game hasn't even been released yet and I'm already writing a review for it. What's up with that ? For starters, Brutal Legend is a game that has to be experienced. It's an open world action adventure with a few RTS elements added to it (more on that in a bit). Think of any open world game, add a heavy metal flavour to this world, throw some heavy metal music in there as well and voila, you pretty much have Brutal Legend.It's charming, looks great and above all, it's fun. Except for one thing... Which brings me back to the RTS part. There are a few missions where you have to build an army and engage your enemies in combat, RTS style. And even though it works - it's perfectly playable - it just... It just isn't any fun. It's more of a chore when I think about it. This part is the only negative thing I can think of.But, don't let that keep you from buying it. Brutal Legend, like most of the Double Fine games, is one brilliant game. Do yourself a favor and just buy it already.[Rating: 84/100]			"

												Brutal Legend really shines with its artistically creative designs and ambition. But it's majorly let down by its janky performance, and the fact that instead of one cohesive game it's more like 10 different gameplay types none of which work especially well or are especially fun or addictive. Also that weird full throttle manchild fantasy thing is kinda hit or miss.			"

Play it. The gameplay is relatively non-conventional, however i see how the gameplay ties in with the storyline (teamwork).Don't read the next part unless you've played the game. ... i'm warning you.It's amazing how well put together it is and at the same time how empty it feels in some cases. (IN HINDSIGHT) It feels like a game that ran out of development time.There are lots of areas and props which feel like they were meant for something more than just occupying space.The gameplay could use more features (refinement).The ending... while awesome... leaves ""loose strings"" which i hope will be tied up in a dlc/sequel. If you've read this and haven't played the game... don't get discouraged. it's a great game.			"

So many celebrities can be named in the game, Ozzie Osbourne or Kyle Gus are just a few of them, but the list can go on, I highly doubt I will be able to enumerate even half of the good aspects the game has in one quick review.The OST is flawless, with over 100 tracks, the soundtrack is one of the strongest points of the game.The second best point can only be the graphics, which offer divine views, panoramas and ambiances (combined with the soundtrack is just heaven, you could just randomly roam around listening and vieweing for hours), not to mention that the characters are quite well done as well.A good storyline, with lots of twists and teachings, humor and drama, mainly focusing on the rock culture, great concepts, filled with ideas, mainly parodies you could say, of combinations between mytical creatures/objects and rock related elements.The gameplay is quite nice, combining Hack and Slash with RTS in an interesting way, quite unique in my opinion, but it can become difficult on the hardest settings if you haven't mastered the RTS spirit, not to mention against real players.The limitation of the world are one of the negative aspects, it's true you can roam free as much as you want, but you can easily get stuck on hills or branches, because most of the world is stuck itself, not dynamic. Anyways, climbing certain hills or going through certain (original) shortcuts can be impossible and result with you hovering in mid-air without any other way out than restarting from a checkpoint, so in conclusion you do not have freedom of going too sandboxish in the game, due to the many invisible walls.Multiplayer...*sigh*...I can't really say much about it, I am probably not dedicated to it, either not skilled or maybe the matchmaking is faulty, but the few games I played, every time I was finished in a matter of minutes...but I can oversee that, since I played it only for the singleplayer, can't foresee too much fun in a multiplayer game, but in a co-op (if they would have implement such a thing) would have been warmly welcomed.In conclusion, I highly recommend the game because it simply rocks!

												Edit: Double Fine, if you ever consider doing Brutal Legend 2, make a Campaign for the Tainted Coil faction, or for that Motorfreaks faction you never finished!Brutal Legend is an Open World Action-Adventure-Hack 'n' Slash-Real Time Strategy Mix, and a pretty damn good one too.You take the role of Eddie Riggs, a Roadie for many super awesome Heavy Metal bands, who ends up being the Roadie for a terrible modern pop tween fake metal band. Because of their carelessness, Eddie ends up dieing on stage. As he dies, his blood awakens the almighty Metal Beast which takes him back in time into the Age Of Metal to fulfill his prophecy of saving humanity from slavery and demons, while teaching them how to harness the power of Metal.All aspects of the game are fairly well done and enjoyable (though this is not the most popular opinion). As you do missions, you unlock more combat moves, guitar solos (summon your car, buff friendlies, etc...), side missions (a good variety of them), vehicle customization (did someone say mounted machine guns?), etc... There's a lot of collectables, hidden secrets, legends, and lore to be discovered. Lots of Metal references and Humor, you'll laugh a lot.The game comes with full controller support as well, and is the recommended device for play.And the best thing about the game, the soundtrack, which you should check out for yourself ;) Have fun!All in all, the best, if not perfect tribute to Rock 'n' Roll and Heavy Metal!

												I did not just buy this for the TF2 promo's, I also bought it because it is the most metal game ever made and I will tell you why.For one, this game has the best soundtrack ever compiled for one game. You may enjoy that one Kpop song right before your sprite fighting game, but for real, unbridled power and sheer metal, this is the place to start. From Black Sabbath to DragonForce everything is on here (Except metallica and Iron Maiden, they wanted more money.)The Single player mode like Zelda, only with Hotrods instead of horses, Ozzy Osbourne instead of great fairies and the world is based on Metal Album covers. The Multiplayer is perhaps the only RTS game designed for a controller that actually works, and it works like a bat outta hell. If that wasn't enough, the voice cast is stellar and it is blast from begin to end. Granted that they finally allow you to play the whole game when the BETA is over.			"

												Rock Step aside , THIS IS METAL !!! 666Pros1.Awesone casts and crews , from a famous actor like Jack Black to well known singers in an old school  70' Heavy metal scene like Lemmy,  Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne.2.Cool in - game music (soundtrack) included many types of metal songs from Heavy metal  to Blackend Death metal , from Thrash metal to Symphonic Black metal.3.NO POSER METAL - wanna be  music  like  Metalcore , Deathcore and Screamo here !!! None.4.Unique art direction , like 'Tim burton' style.5.Featuring an  RTS system with many units to choose.6.A Lot of collectable items and secrets.7.Good Storyline.8.Guitar SOLOs !!!!!Cons1.Poor PC optimization  , The graphic didnt look 'Sharp' , I imagined how awesome it will be if the color is vividly cool like Borderlands 2 2.Why Dont they let us use that 'wing' in free roaming :l3.No pure 'Death metal' music , either Death metal or something more advance like Brutal Death metal.4.Default songs are mostly Heavy and Thrash metal , in order to acquire those 'cool / rare' types  such as Black metal  , You need to find some relics / collectable items. 5.Bad Guiding system , no waypoint , just the destination marker.You will surely ENJOY  this game , IF you are a Metalhead , just like me (for 9 years ). Even if you are not,  but ready to dive deep down into a fantasy world with hellish music in the background. Go for it !8.5 / 10666   'Devil's horn'   666			"

												I probably liked this game more than most.  I have a soft spot for Jack Black and used to love metal music so this game was right up my  alley.  There are plenty of cameos, music references, and Jack Black quotes.  As for actual gameplay, I think they put their eggs in too many baskets.  Seemed like the developers were trying to make 3 games instead of one and each ""mode"" seems a little lacking.  Good story, incredible soundtrack, and one of the best game intros in recent memory!

			Views: 28		

			StëämPünk Böb looks into what could be the manliest game ever made.		

This game is AWESOME, but it's also very unfocused. It's an action game, but also has elements of rhythm games, driving, action RTS... there's just so much here that it's not well developed anywhere. On the other hand, this game has SO much style... it's hard to HATE it, even when it feels like it wastes its potential by not doing anything WELL.Probably worth getting on SALE, but possibly not at full price.

												I like Jack Black, I like metal and rock, and I like hack and slashing. Seems a perfect match right? This game was a little misleading in the beginning as it appears at first glance as a hack and slash. In reality that is only a minor part of the game as later you need to manage a resource in an army vs army style fights which was disappointing. The story is a mix of humor and sadness as it progresses around the game island. The game also has a nice selection of customizable skins for the car and Eddie with upgrades for the melee, guitar, and car. The music selection is great.			"

												Play as a time traveling bard cast into a medieval world, where demonic overlords rule over humanity. Lead the uprising against the human colaborators, and then against the plague of the undead, while slowly gearing to a final confrontation with the demonic emperor himself.Oh, and the bard has a guitar that sets people on fire, the humans are all Old-school metalheads, the devils are pure gore-metal inspired BDSM wearing fleshy-badassess, the Undead are depressed black Metal fans, with the best Tim Burton-esque gothic imagiry this side of gaming. Wage war in a both complex AND shallow RTS system with crazy units and a whole-lot of ""what is the counter system in this game???!' that makes increasingly less sense! Enjoy driving around listening to songs and being dissapointed when the journey ends because you want to listent to solo, but it just keeps giving and giving! Enjoy mashing two buttons and occassionaly running away crying because you are almost dead, and then coming back with vengence. RINSE AND REPEAT! and then, prepare to ignore all the problems of the game, because of the amazing soundtrack, amazing ladnscapes, AND ♥♥♥♥ING LEMMY KILMISTER! AND ♥♥♥♥ING ROB HALFORD!

												Best first thirty minutes game experience I've ever had, seriously - absolutely insane and hilarious. The beginning is pure fireworks in every respect. Unfortunatelly, the rest of the game does not quite live up to it, even though it's full of heavy metal madness - wonderfully primitive - just the way it has to be: Nice metal references and clichés that are exaggerated to such extend that you don't even care about them and just bang your head. Flaws: repetitiveness, lame side quests. Impressive: I'd never have believed that a genre-mix of 3rd-person-axe-wielding, guitar-powered magic-devastation, hotrod-racing and epic-battle-command would work out that smoothly. Great job! Anyway, it's a good game and a lot of fun - as soon as you've unchecked all Motörhead-tracks from the playlist, that is :PUh, I almost forgot: Controller is highly recommended - xbox-controller works great.

												Brütal Legend is not a game - it's an EPIC game. In all caps.The story is hilarious and plays with common cliches. The soundtrack is absolutely superb and so is the voice-acting. The graphics are not state-of-the-art anymore, but this hardly matters since this game is all about chrome and metal anyway. So as long as the bump-mapping is okay: you are cool. Also I truly believe hair-animation was originally invented by some dude that played Brütal and it's only purpose was to allow more realistic head-banging.The game itself hardly sticks with any genre. It takes whatever floats the boat and is the most fun. Meaning it is a road-racing, story-driven, strategic, exploration, adventure, 3rd-person fighting game with RPG elements and Ozzy Osbourne. Also you cast magic spells using an interface that basically looks like Guitar hero.Personally I'm not a big Metal fan. So I may be missing a few puns, but since the focus is on more classic material (even though Metal never gets ""classic"" it simply becomes more ""epic"") even an ""outsider"" like me can enjoy it very much and will recognize many of the characters.The game may be less fun for kids that have not been around in the 19XXies, folks that are dead-serious about their Metal, and people having a favorite activity in bird-watching. (unless it's bird-watching with Metal music)For anybody else: I highly recommend it!			"

There are parts of the game that are buggy, yes, but you'd be hard-pressed to find more games that have writing that is as good and as hilarious, and the various nods to the history of Heavy Metal through characters, jokes, and the massive soundtrack only add to the truly incredible experience.

												No matter how many times I play. I will never get tired of this game. I love metal, I live for metal, and this game not only makes one hell of a fun story, it creates a legend of metal, a huge open world made by the metal gods. When you are done you can still ride about with great music in your awesome deuce. If you love metal you love this game. Plus, Ozzy Osbourne pimps your ride, and Lemmy heals your friends with bass solos. I just love it.			"

												I quite love this game. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is mostly okay, but the artstyle, writing and everything else are just phenomenal - especially voice acting and the music collection. If you are a fan of Metal or Rock, you will love this game, since every aspect of the game is just so well made that everything in the game is literally Metal. The only bad part of the game is the RTS-esque gameplay, which comes up a few times and this is a major downside in my opinion. It's not too often and it's not the main part of the gameplay, but it's in there and after all you do it for a few times and it takes it's time. My guess, around 7-10 times, but I could be wrong. Anything else is just really, seriously.It is flawed, it is not perfect, but it's really original in its presentation - both sound and visuals. This game is not for everyone, but you can have a lot of fun with it.			"

												Jack Black? CheckMany legendary rockstar apearances? CheckDecent combat and combos? CheckOne of the best soundtracks that any game has ever had? M**HERf**KING CHECK!!Honestly if youre a fan of Jack Black, his work as a musician or actor this game will please you from beginning to end. But being very very frank. What made this a very good game for me was not the great voice acting, or the massive world, or all the side missions that bring depth and color to this game, the great world that was created, or even the beautiful Ophelia... What makes this amazing is the most beautiful compilation of Rock ever to grace any game, even surpassing Ukelele Hero. Brütal Legend is a MUST buy for any fans of Jack Black, good Rock or heavy metal and a somewhat ludicrous story mixed in with humor. Pros: Story, world, characters, music, humorCons: Combat gets a bit dull after a while (mixing it up with combos and special attacks changes this obviously.)8/10			"

												*Single Player only - I haven't tried multiplayer*Oh Double Fine, how I love you. This game is based around heavy metal, with a wonderful landscape inspired by it and a soundtrack with 20 original compositions and around 80 licensed tracks, and voice actors including Ozzy Osbourne and Jack Black. This game starts off as more of a Hack and Slash, with bits of rhythm and exciting driving sections. Later, a lot more of the game becomes RTS, which on easier difficulties you can win with just brute force over strategy, helpful for those who aren't great at the genre. The teams are also based on metal genres, as well as a wide, interesting variety of different classes for each one, as well as the ability to fight in the fight yourself at anytime. Only real problem with this game is its length, which can be fixed by making a sequel. PLEASE TIM, PLEEEEASE!			"

												This game...has flaws.And it still manages to be one of my favourite games of all time,so much that i played about a 100 hours on the original xbox360 version,and pre-ordered it when it came out on pc.You play as Eddie Riggs the worlds greatest roadie,stuck with the lamest ""metal"" band in existence.After a hilariously awesome beginning cutscene you are brought to a world that seems to be made of album covers.You begin the game slaying your enemies via axe and guitar,but soon you get a car(an awesome hot-rod to be more precise),and later down the line you fight the enemy bosses in a combination action/rts elements.The best part of the game is it's setting.Hands-down it is the most creative world I have ever seen in a sandbox game,and the music(about 90 licensed songs of Heavy Metals greatest,and an excellent original score) just fits it perfectly.The combat is simple but satisfying,and your axe and guitar are customisable.Your hot-rod will also become a fiery machine of death.Missions are varied especially at the beginning,the humor is spot-on,the voice acting is...when you got Jack Black,Rob Halford,Lemmy and Ozzy you know you are doing something right.Now the rts part is where the game suffers a bit.It's hard to really get the hang of it and play beyond just sending out troops randomly,but after a while you'll get used to it.If you like Metal music play this.If you like interesting games play this.Trust me,it is worthy of it's price.Also if possible play with a controller.The pc controls are just fine but still i liked the controller more.

												Jack Black. Heavy Metal. Great art design. Solid, but ""seen it before"" gameplay. I can't expand much more. the soundtrack is fantastic if you like your metal, the voice acting accompanied with the writing is humorous, and laced with tongue-in-cheek comedy. You'll find yourself grinning right from the opening cut scene, and the cutscenes throughout. Though you may pass on the item collecting in-game, at the very least the game has a truly excellent and individual art design to warrant you giving it at least one look.If I were to price it: 15-25 dollars.

												This is an awesome tongue in cheek tribute to all that is Heavy Metal. In typical Double-Fine tradition the world is presented in an inventive manner, with a cast of interesting characters, voiced by an excellent line up. Pros- Awesome Metal soundtrack (and official score for that matter)- Good sense of humour- Fantastic selection of voice actors and Heavy Metal cameos - World is fun to explore - Reasonably good pacing (teaching and unlocking most abilities at a good rate)Cons- RTS sections may put you off if you are expecting purely hack-and-slash.- It's not really obvious how much damage you are inflicting or is being done to your units (there are some visual hints, but in the heat of the RTS sections I wasn't really picking up on these)- (RTS) Tanking isn't really an option, so most unit upgrading/advancing feels pointless (even on hardest difficulty)I've had a blast playing this. I'd recommend this for Heavy Metal fans in particular for the soundtrack and whimsical take on the genre(s).  :)			"

												I love so much about this game I have to say buy it.  I grew up listening to metal in the 80's and worked as a roadie in the 90's, so it's a moral imperative that I recommend this game.  I love the humor, the music, and the brutal mayhem of the game, but that said, who the F**** programmed the car driving?  For such a  major part of the game, the driving mechanic nearly sinks it.  Between the laggy controls and the questionnable collision physics, it often turns driving missions into a stinking mess.  As one of the few people to actually like the idiosyncracies of the Mako from Mass Effect, I can forgive a lot about in-game vehicles.  But wow, this is....brutal.			"

												This game gets two thumbs up, not just one. If you do not wish to read a long, detailed review, know this; Brutal Legend is absolutely brilliant. It has a good story, fast paced gameplay, which combines action and some Real-Time Strategy elements, is semi-open world (more on this later) and has the most rocking soundtrack of any game in living memory. So, what do you get if you purchase Brutal Legend. Firstly, you will find a crisp video introduction featuring Jack Black, introducing you to a record of such rarity, he forgot where it is. When he stumble upon and opens it, you are presented with the best menu system in any game. It is quality, and marks the start of what will become a quality game. After starting the game, you are thrust into the main story. Make no mistake, this game is story driven. It will present you with the illusion of choice, but, really, there is little need to play many of the side quests except to earn Favour of the Gods points, which you can spend on upgrades to your car. The story is suitably epic. I will not spoil anything suffice to say that you are a Roadie for a modern tween-metal band, just getting on with your thing, thinking back to the glory days of metal, when an accident calls you to action. After the carnage has cleared, you awake in a new land, one in which you can harness the power of metal to slay the bad guys. After this, you are tasked with freeing a people, helping with an uprising and vanquishing the oppressors of this world. The characters are excellent, many voiced by prolific figures in rock and metal - Jack Black, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, etc. Each character is designed to be the cliche, but this is no bad thing. It adds to the humour of the game.Your character, Eddie Riggs, is armed with a giant axe and a giant axe (this time of the guitar type). With one, you can bash the living daylights out of your opponents, with the other, you can call lightning strikes, small explosions or play solos. The solos are a great game dynamic. Use them to summon your car, raise relics that are used for varying purposes, or simply melt the faces off large groups of enemies. You also use them to capture fans in the RTS parts of the game.This is where the game gets unique. Rather than simply bashing your way through hordes of enemies, you get presented with a battleground at various point in the game. You and your crew build a stage, as does the enemy. This is your base, if you will, and you must protect it. Geysers in the ground spew forth ghostly fans, which you have to capture to boost your fan points. These you can spend to upgrade your stage, your fighters and actually buy your units. The battles are fast paces and frantic, but very enjoyable, at least for a time. Luckilly, this part of the game is not overused. When it is used, it is in the right places, and builds tension. However, for me, there was perhaps one or two too many of these RTS bits. When the rest of the game tries hard to vary what it is doing, these are always a little bit samey, which is a shame. At least the setting changes each time.I completed the game in a single sitting or about 7 hours. I played some of the secondary missions, but not all - I am not a completionist. However, for completionists, you will be happy to know that the main story is only about 50% of the game - there is still plenty to do. For the age of the game, the graphics are amazing. It easily holds up with today's games, mainly due to the art style, which is phenominal. It really is a good looking game.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed. I bought the game a long time ago and never played it, but thought, ""hey, I may as well give it a go"". Thank goodness I did, as it is now one of my favourite games of all time. It is humourous, with its tounge firmly in its cheek, but hell does it rock. Buy this! Buy this now!!!!!!			"

												Brütal Legend is not a game - it's an EPIC game. In all caps.The story is hilarious and plays with common cliches. The soundtrack is absolutely superb and so is the voice-acting. The graphics are not state-of-the-art anymore, but this hardly matters since this game is all about chrome and metal anyway. So as long as the bump-mapping is okay: you are cool. Also I truly believe hair-animation was originally invented by some dude that played Brütal and it's only purpose was to allow more realistic head-banging.The game itself hardly sticks with any genre. It takes whatever floats the boat and is the most fun. Meaning it is a road-racing, story-driven, strategic, exploration, adventure, 3rd-person fighting game with RPG elements and Ozzy Osbourne. Also you cast magic spells using an interface that basically looks like Guitar hero.Personally I'm not a big Metal fan. So I may be missing a few puns, but since the focus is on more classic material (even though Metal never gets ""classic"" it simply becomes more ""epic"") even an ""outsider"" like me can enjoy it very much and will recognize many of the characters.The game may be less fun for kids that have not been around in the 19XXies, folks that are dead-serious about their Metal, and people having a favorite activity in bird-watching. (unless it's bird-watching with Metal music)For anybody else: I highly recommend it!			"

It's simply awesome. Hack and slash game with a main character voiced by Jack Black. Game revolves around heavy metal and a world intertwined with it after a freak ""accident"". The game is simply hilarious and that alone is worth it with all of its satire, caricature (see the headbangers in the screenshots, working in a mine, without tools, simply by using their thick, empty heads), and the like.

												You want to know what's better then Jack Black, Metal, and Metal Legends? nothing. Brutal Legend is a hack n slash, RTS, and Racing game all in one, and it works. You play as Eddie Riggs (Jack Black) a roadie who was sent ""back in time"" where humans are enslaved by demons and it is your job to free them, WITH METAL. No really, everything in this game is metal, the world, weapons, hell even Metal Legends like Ozzy Osbourne and Rob Halford are in it. The soundtrack (like it should be) is great, nothing beats killing demons while Painkiller is blasting in the background. Story is alright but they really want you to explore to get everything, so if you just go through it without exploring you will miss a lot. Anyway, you need to buy this game, like right now.			"

Lead the uprising against the human colaborators, and then against the plague of the undead, while slowly gearing to a final confrontation with the demonic emperor himself.Oh, and the bard has a guitar that sets people on fire, the humans are all Old-school metalheads, the devils are pure gore-metal inspired BDSM wearing fleshy-badassess, the Undead are depressed black Metal fans, with the best Tim Burton-esque gothic imagiry this side of gaming. Wage war in a both complex AND shallow RTS system with crazy units and a whole-lot of ""what is the counter system in this game???!' that makes increasingly less sense! Enjoy driving around listening to songs and being dissapointed when the journey ends because you want to listent to solo, but it just keeps giving and giving! Enjoy mashing two buttons and occassionaly running away crying because you are almost dead, and then coming back with vengence.

												(Four horns for the metal; two for the game itself)This is fantastic game for metal heads, primarily, for all the in-jokes and chuckle-worthy self awareness. Black's dialogue and delivery is priceless as is the fantastic writing by Mr. Schafer himself. The PC version is more than 'just a port', looking and moving far superior to the console editions. The controls are fantastic, specifically with a gamepad. The only issue I have with the game, really, is that combat can be far too simplistic and frantic to be as fun as one might imagine it would be. Also, once the game introduces RTS elements in the form of squads and minions, it goes from 'true metal' to 'nu-metal' in terms enjoyment. That being said, there is a great story here with an enjoyable cast of characters and satirical achetypes. The game overall is great fun, and exploration and a joy. It's a shame that it couldn't decide if it was an adventure game, beat 'em up or a strategy game.			"

												Overview: Brütal Legend is a quirky third person game that mixes open world, action combat, and strategy into a Heavy Metal themed world.  You play as Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled to look like Jack Black, whos mission it is to liberate humanity from oppression.  The best word to describe this game is unique, the mesh of different gameplay styles and the manifestation of Heavy Metal into a video game really sets this game apart.  Pros: The coolest thing about this game is the Heavy Metal theme.  The world is literally Heavy Metal brought to life.  Trees are made of metal, spiders spin metal guitar strings, and giant engine parts strew the land.  The environment is well crafted and looks great.  The game has a good sense of humor and you will find yourself laughing at the characters and the situations that arise.  The story is decent and you can find things to do between story missions.  Cons: The first thing you will notice is that the combat is lacking.  It does not flow smoothly between enemies and the provided combos don't seem to do much.  Even though the Heavy Metal theme is the games best aspect, it is also a draw back.  If you do not like Heavy Metal, this game probably isn't for you.  All the music is metal and the characters embody all that is metal.  The mixing of action combat with strategy might be difficult for people to progress through the game.  The strategy portion is the most difficult aspect of the gameplay and requires more effort and planning.  For people who have experience in one genre but not the other, they will probably have a hard time.  That being said, the action combat is actually really easy.  Even playing on the hardest difficulty, I breezed through most of the game.  Lastly, the game is a little short, with the story lasting about 14 hours unless you are spending a lot time on side missions.  Conclusion: Brütal Legend is a unique experience that will keep you laughing at its quirkiness.  It's not a game for everyone, but if you like Heavy Metal and the idea of a world themed after it, you may enjoy this.  If you're looking for something with non-traditional gameplay and not expecting a masterpiece, give this a try.Score: 8.3 / 10			"

												Ok, honestly I was hoping for an hour or two of low-brow entertainment for my money.  To say my expectations were low isn't an understatement.  However, I found an incredibly fun action game, with a well told story.  The voice acting was exceptional all the way around, and the music is a solid sample from all over the genre.  The game took all of the outrageous sillyness in the basic concept is stride and embraced it in a way that had me smiling at the jokes rather than groaning.I lost a weekend to this game and enjoyed every minute of it.  It's a bit easy compared to other action titles, but the story is good enough that it doesn't matter.  This game is one of those that I wouldn't have been upset to pay full price for, so the current price is completely worth it.  If you have even the slightest interest, don't pass this up!			"

												With Jack Black headlining the game and guest appearances by some of the biggest names in metal, Brutal Legend is a musical cocktail full of blood, gore, and a healthy dose of BDSM.  Armed with an axe, a guitar, and an army of metalheads, face the time lost to history, where music held power in the physical plane and humanity was on the brink of extinction.--Pros:1.  Entirely metal and versatile soundtrack.2.  Guest appearances from Lemmy Kilmister, Ozzy Osbourne, and many other metal figureheads.3.  Jack Black branded humor at most turns.4.  Smooth, fluid combat and a very well written story.5.  Frequently hilarious dialogue.6.  Ability to censor gore and curses, if you so wish.  Don't, the game is so much better without the censorship.Cons:1.  Somewhat blocky and dated graphics.2.  Poor hair animation.3.  Vehicle-based escort missions are relatively common.4.  Multiplayer community is nonexistant.5.  Some characters are excessively sexualized.--All in all, this is a fantastic game, and I highly reccommend it to anyone that appreciates a well-made and original game that actually has some replay value.

												*Single Player only - I haven't tried multiplayer*Oh Double Fine, how I love you. This game is based around heavy metal, with a wonderful landscape inspired by it and a soundtrack with 20 original compositions and around 80 licensed tracks, and voice actors including Ozzy Osbourne and Jack Black. This game starts off as more of a Hack and Slash, with bits of rhythm and exciting driving sections. Later, a lot more of the game becomes RTS, which on easier difficulties you can win with just brute force over strategy, helpful for those who aren't great at the genre. The teams are also based on metal genres, as well as a wide, interesting variety of different classes for each one, as well as the ability to fight in the fight yourself at anytime. Only real problem with this game is its length, which can be fixed by making a sequel. PLEASE TIM, PLEEEEASE!			"

												This game...has flaws.And it still manages to be one of my favourite games of all time,so much that i played about a 100 hours on the original xbox360 version,and pre-ordered it when it came out on pc.You play as Eddie Riggs the worlds greatest roadie,stuck with the lamest ""metal"" band in existence.After a hilariously awesome beginning cutscene you are brought to a world that seems to be made of album covers.You begin the game slaying your enemies via axe and guitar,but soon you get a car(an awesome hot-rod to be more precise),and later down the line you fight the enemy bosses in a combination action/rts elements.The best part of the game is it's setting.Hands-down it is the most creative world I have ever seen in a sandbox game,and the music(about 90 licensed songs of Heavy Metals greatest,and an excellent original score) just fits it perfectly.The combat is simple but satisfying,and your axe and guitar are customisable.Your hot-rod will also become a fiery machine of death.Missions are varied especially at the beginning,the humor is spot-on,the voice acting is...when you got Jack Black,Rob Halford,Lemmy and Ozzy you know you are doing something right.Now the rts part is where the game suffers a bit.It's hard to really get the hang of it and play beyond just sending out troops randomly,but after a while you'll get used to it.If you like Metal music play this.If you like interesting games play this.Trust me,it is worthy of it's price.Also if possible play with a controller.The pc controls are just fine but still i liked the controller more.

You'll find yourself grinning right from the opening cut scene, and the cutscenes throughout. Though you may pass on the item collecting in-game, at the very least the game has a truly excellent and individual art design to warrant you giving it at least one look.If I were to price it: 15-25 dollars.

												Very underrated game imho.The story is very fun and entertaining in my opinion, even if you are not a Heavy Metal Fan (but it helps being one). I think the writers did a good job of combining a great string of original ideas with classic heavy metal lore. Only downside is that the main story is a bit short for my taste (i must confess, i could not get enough of it), linear and the climax was a bit disappointing. They clearly tried too hard to set the story up for a sequel, which probably will never be developed.The gameplay itself is fun, although a slightly repetitive. You basically have 3 kinds of missions: Hack'n'Slay-style main missions, exciting driving missions and the battlefield missions which were a great new idea, but didn't fulfill their potential despite being fun aswell. The optional side missions lack variety and proper incentive (besides some points to buy power-ups and clothes / car kits your really get nothing from them)... they could have done a better job including side missions into the story, like getting 4-5 minor storylines into the game. As I said, it's very linear. Some people may consider it a weak spot, but i think it's cool that you can choose to simply beat the bejeezus out of everyone with the standard moves or get and use all special moves to maximize your efficiency. I personally found the specials generally useless and there was no tactical aspect to the game... it's more of an arcade-style gameplay. Controls are ok on PC, but you clearly notice this game was made primarily for consoles and ""dumbed down"" for a broader audience. Too bad they failed at promoting it accordingly.Graphics are appropriate for their time and serve their purpose. Don't expect any fireworks... this game is about fun and originality, not cutting edge technology. The Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and really helps you immerse into the game world. Voice acting is also tremendous with tons of cool guest appearances (i.e. Kyle Gass of Tenacious D and Lemmy from Motörhead). Level design is absolutely off the hook although you can beat the game by essentially giving your enemies the Diablo 2-barbarian-treatment  all the time (charge head-on - kill everything in sight with brute force - move on). Bottom line: This game is a one-trick-pony, but that one trick is really really awesome. It's not worth a release-date pricetag, but a solid and fun game. If you want about 20-30 hours of straightforward fun and a short, yet entertaining story to fill some ""time off"" from the games you usually play, you'll have a good time with BL. If you are someone that prefers showing off his/her skills, looting/practicing for multiplayer games or spend hours getting every achievement, i recommend sticking to some MMORPG or FPS.			"

The storyline in the game is funny, Jack Black voices the main character, the main menu is very funny the firs ttime you see it.The only gripe I have with this game is that it is so damn short. The main story takes you about 7/8 hours to finish. I only took 9 because I spent so much time doing sidemissions. If you can pick this one up in a sale I'd say you should get it. For less than 5 dollar/euro this game is a steal and worth the giggles.			"

												Rock Step aside , THIS IS METAL !!! 666Pros1.Awesone casts and crews , from a famous actor like Jack Black to well known singers in an old school  70' Heavy metal scene like Lemmy,  Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne.2.Cool in - game music (soundtrack) included many types of metal songs from Heavy metal  to Blackend Death metal , from Thrash metal to Symphonic Black metal.3.NO POSER METAL - wanna be  music  like  Metalcore , Deathcore and Screamo here !!! None.4.Unique art direction , like 'Tim burton' style.5.Featuring an  RTS system with many units to choose.6.A Lot of collectable items and secrets.7.Good Storyline.8.Guitar SOLOs !!!!!Cons1.Poor PC optimization  , The graphic didnt look 'Sharp' , I imagined how awesome it will be if the color is vividly cool like Borderlands 2 2.Why Dont they let us use that 'wing' in free roaming :l3.No pure 'Death metal' music , either Death metal or something more advance like Brutal Death metal.4.Default songs are mostly Heavy and Thrash metal , in order to acquire those 'cool / rare' types  such as Black metal  , You need to find some relics / collectable items. 5.Bad Guiding system , no waypoint , just the destination marker.You will surely ENJOY  this game , IF you are a Metalhead , just like me (for 9 years ). Even if you are not,  but ready to dive deep down into a fantasy world with hellish music in the background. Go for it !8.5 / 10666   'Devil's horn'   666			"

												I probably liked this game more than most.  I have a soft spot for Jack Black and used to love metal music so this game was right up my  alley.  There are plenty of cameos, music references, and Jack Black quotes.  As for actual gameplay, I think they put their eggs in too many baskets.  Seemed like the developers were trying to make 3 games instead of one and each ""mode"" seems a little lacking.  Good story, incredible soundtrack, and one of the best game intros in recent memory!

Do missions to earn fire tributes, to upgrade your car and weapons. Summon troops to fight by your side and free the opressed humans in the demon-infested world. Did I mention the whole thing is voiced by Jack Black?			"

												Jack Black? CheckMany legendary rockstar apearances? CheckDecent combat and combos? CheckOne of the best soundtracks that any game has ever had? M**HERf**KING CHECK!!Honestly if youre a fan of Jack Black, his work as a musician or actor this game will please you from beginning to end. But being very very frank. What made this a very good game for me was not the great voice acting, or the massive world, or all the side missions that bring depth and color to this game, the great world that was created, or even the beautiful Ophelia... What makes this amazing is the most beautiful compilation of Rock ever to grace any game, even surpassing Ukelele Hero. Brütal Legend is a MUST buy for any fans of Jack Black, good Rock or heavy metal and a somewhat ludicrous story mixed in with humor. Pros: Story, world, characters, music, humorCons: Combat gets a bit dull after a while (mixing it up with combos and special attacks changes this obviously.)8/10			"

												This is an awesome tongue in cheek tribute to all that is Heavy Metal. In typical Double-Fine tradition the world is presented in an inventive manner, with a cast of interesting characters, voiced by an excellent line up. Pros- Awesome Metal soundtrack (and official score for that matter)- Good sense of humour- Fantastic selection of voice actors and Heavy Metal cameos - World is fun to explore - Reasonably good pacing (teaching and unlocking most abilities at a good rate)Cons- RTS sections may put you off if you are expecting purely hack-and-slash.- It's not really obvious how much damage you are inflicting or is being done to your units (there are some visual hints, but in the heat of the RTS sections I wasn't really picking up on these)- (RTS) Tanking isn't really an option, so most unit upgrading/advancing feels pointless (even on hardest difficulty)I've had a blast playing this. I'd recommend this for Heavy Metal fans in particular for the soundtrack and whimsical take on the genre(s).  :)			"

												I quite love this game. The graphics are decent, the gameplay is mostly okay, but the artstyle, writing and everything else are just phenomenal - especially voice acting and the music collection. If you are a fan of Metal or Rock, you will love this game, since every aspect of the game is just so well made that everything in the game is literally Metal. The only bad part of the game is the RTS-esque gameplay, which comes up a few times and this is a major downside in my opinion. It's not too often and it's not the main part of the gameplay, but it's in there and after all you do it for a few times and it takes it's time. My guess, around 7-10 times, but I could be wrong. Anything else is just really, seriously.It is flawed, it is not perfect, but it's really original in its presentation - both sound and visuals. This game is not for everyone, but you can have a lot of fun with it.			"

If you can learn to zerg rush the RTS bits, you will have a great time with Brutal Legend. Otherwise they just become a bore when all you really want to do is drive around the map in a car running over things and listening to metal.The most fun I had was just driving round and collecting new songs/solos.

												OK so when Double Team made this game I was pretty excited. I heard a lot of things before this came out, and I heard even more after it was released. As a metal fan, I had to own this game someday.Unfortunately it was only till a couple of weeks ago that I was first able to play it. I knew this was a game to enjoy because of the cameo's and references, and because I didn't expect any news-breaking gameplay I wasn't in a rush to get it.I must tell you: I was NOT dissapointed.First of all, when you buy this as an appreciator of either old classic rock (Menowar, Judast Priest, Black Sabbath, etc.) or just plain metal (Megadeth, 3 Inches of Blood, Children of Bodom and almost too many more) you will enjoy it. When I saw Ozzy Osbourne almost my whole life flashed by because of his pure awesomeness. And of course Rob Halford as Lionwhite, Lemmy as The Kill Master and more. But even smaller cameo's like Tim Curry (Rocky Horror Show), Metalocalypse-writer and actor Brian Posehn and Jack Black's sidekick Kile Gas.And last but not least; Jack Black... In real life almost such a hero as in Brutal Legend (except saving the earth as a Roady by preforming awesome solo's and creating whole stages and merchandise booths by pure awesomeness). Second comes gameplay. Yes, un purpose. Because if you are more interested in the works of Tim schafer and Double Fine you will find this game probably dissapointing (unless you are actually interested in the 'fun themes' of Double Fine). Yes, the humor does return in this game, even in a large amount! But gameplay wise this is certainly not news-breaking (as my suspicion already indicated). However, even though the game failed to be a good sandbox/rpg game, it did succeed in being unique and diverse. There are a lot of minor quests that are fun, unique and awesome to play when you lost interest in the main quest (which is nothing special, I should mension. Just fun, nothing special..).A last, third thing I should mention is the driving mechanism. I liked this game a lot, mainly because it was good in being mediocore and awesome, but driving in this game is almost impossible. You quickly lose control of your vehicle, it will change direction after the slightest bump in the road, and it can bring you on surfaces you can't walk away from (which makes you restart the game from last checkpoint). I recommend this game, once again, for being an Awesome, Fun and Brutal piece of mediocore game; ups and downs when it comes to gameplay, but the best when it comes to humor and appearances!			"

												It's a game where I have Mixed Feelings. The beginning was really amazing and funny but once I hit the open world it became a little boring and I personnaly hated the system where you have to get your little army and give orders to them. I think this game should perhaps been linear as the first hour of the game was really good. Once in the open world having to do each time a song to spawn your car or getting your little soldiers and more started to become a chore... For me they really should have left out that orders thing. For the rest graphics aren't to bad, had some good laughs and the atmosphere is really out of this world, but that's a good thing.Would I recommend it... yes and no depends how patient you are and open minded otherwise you could find this boring pretty fast. So gone say yes but it's on the edge of a no if it wasn't for the atmosphere and funny moments.5/10			"

The Doublefine team always has somehting intresting going on in its games, and except for the it feeling a bit uncomplete (due to a cut section from its story), whats here is good.Its a shame this game never got a sequel, as it has so much intresting basework here that with more time and a slightly bigger budget, it could be an outstanding series.

												The game is chockfull of rock goodness, which means you get to hear great tracks of the 'rock gods'. The storyline in the game is funny, Jack Black voices the main character, the main menu is very funny the firs ttime you see it.The only gripe I have with this game is that it is so damn short. The main story takes you about 7/8 hours to finish. I only took 9 because I spent so much time doing sidemissions. If you can pick this one up in a sale I'd say you should get it. For less than 5 dollar/euro this game is a steal and worth the giggles.			"

												One of the best games i have ever played in the last decade.It was a while ago i've had this much fun with a game.I saw this game for the first time at a friends house in 2009 on its release day.Didn't know much of it, thought it looked funny with all those headbangers and you leading them, but never played it and looked back.Until i saw this on steam and humble bundle, i didn't even have to think to buy it.I didn't regret any of this at all, infact i would have gladly paid full price ( 60 euros ) for this.Metal music, Jack Black, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, headbangers, roadies, epic fights ( Hack 'n slash and RTS ) and a engaging story line that leaves me wishing for more.My only complaint would be the difficulty, i finished this on normal, but the last fighting parts were really hard, lots of trial and error.A difficult game isn't a problem, but being a frustating one is.I barely made those last parts and after i did, it felt very satisfactory, so i guess that makes up for it.In summary, i love this game and it is definitely in my top 5 of best games.

												The legendary fire beast, the molten iron monster, and the creamator of the sky. Ormagoden. His steel flesh, burning blood, and an earth shattering roar delivers the player to the promised land of rock.An open world stuffed to brim with Metal. Ground urchins growing iron quills. Steel spiders spinning guitar strings. Boars powered with engines. Mammoths with chromed tusks reflecting the beauty of the Ormagoden's flesh and blood shattered and spilled to create the perfect world.The game is a masterpiece of visual design with every character, monster and landmark placed right where it belongs precisely the way it fits the puzzle. Voices are on point. The story is engaging and will keep you guessing to the very last battle. Heck... Even the main menu itself blows one's mind. Don't get me started on the soundtrack. Ormagoden's mighty roar with a mix of passionate Ethulia's song has blessed the land of rock with the most iconic pieces of metal. The songs included are by themselves worth the price of the game.RTS element of the game is however a bit tricky, fast paced with blitzkrieg being the most if not only reliable strategy. Once you lose some ground there is no climbing back up. Outside of this one the game is amazing and scores a perfect triple six on my awesomeness scale.			"

												Always wanted to play this game since I was informed about the launch, when I started using Steam was on sale and bought quickly! The game is good as I expected, the best match for a Headbanger because we were listening to music all the time and besides being one of the best playlists I've seen it put that game, we can still know the names of the songs and the band that is playing if they did not know! A great adventure game for those who enjoy games of battles with the performance of strategy war games, but of course with the beautiful theme of Heavy Metal and with the special participation of some of the best musicians in the scene!Sempre desejei jogar esse jogo desde que fui informado sobre o lançamento, quando comecei a utilizar o Steam estava em promoção e comprei ele na mesma hora! O jogo é bem como eu esperava, o melhor jogo para um Headbanger, pois ficamos escutando músicas toda hora e além de ser uma das melhores playlists que já vi que colocaram nesse jogo, podemos ainda saber os nomes das músicas e da banda que está tocando, caso ainda não conhecemos! Um ótimo jogo de aventura para quem gosta de jogos de batalhas com o desempenho de jogos de estratégia de guerra, mas claro com o belíssimo tema do Heavy Metal e com a participação especial de alguns dos melhores músicos do cenário!

												Brütal Legend, the most hilariously awesome game I've played thus far. A game made by metalheads for metalheads like me.The characters, oh god, they are cool, and not because they look cool, it's because they are some of the most respected musicians out there, like Jack Black, Lemmy Kilmister, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob ****ing Halford!. The combat is what I'm used to do on these games, just run around, find an enemy, axe it till it's dead. Yeah, it can be repetitive and boring, but with such a world to explore, you'll have fun uncovering secrets while going on a killing spree with your lovely axe and guitar.And of course, what's a Heavy Metal game without Heavy Metal music? Well, don't panic, this one comes loaded of Metal tracks just to pleasure your ears. The soundtrack goes from KISS, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Slayer and many others. Though I prefer Death Metal, there's little of it on the game. I wish it had a song from Death on the soundtrack, like ""Together as One"" or ""Flesh and the Power it Holds"".Overall, this game will keep you entertained during many hours, just enjoying jamming your guitars to shock (literally) your enemies and then fend them off with your trusty Axe. If you are an open-minded metalhead or just someone looking for a bit of fun while slashing enemies, give this a try, you won't regret it.			"

												Fun game overall, filled with lots of rock/metal referances and also Jack Black. However the game is not without it's quirks, the biggest being the RTS elements, an unnessesary part of the game in my opinion. The game starts as a third person action adventure game, but then goes back and forth between that and RTS for the stage battles. Then theres the difficulty scaling towards the end, it took me several trys to complete the final battle with Ophelia. Despite both of these, I love this game, for it's awesome soundtrack, characters and story.			"

												Very good thematic game for those who worship the Gods of Rock.The mechanics of the game does not invent very much new compared to the GTA series or similar titles, but the theme choice and the environment makes this game really loveable.During the game you fight as Eddie Riggs, a roadie who travelled to a fantasy-world where the Rock and its followers is suffering under the tyranny of the evil Doviculus. As a no suprise you have to fight against it.The main story is not that immersing, but for someone who loves rock music the references to rock bands, songs and other topics (like making business from the art) are outstanding. To highlight the other weak point of the game, it can be repetitive as most of the missions are about fighting alone or a strategy-part where you have to command your units against the enemy. This also true for the secondary missions (3-4 types) and the boss fights (about the same).On the other hand incorporating all the rock-relevant features is amazing. From the music you hear during traveling, the characters, the voice actors (Ozzy is still great), the composure and all the tiny details about them are spectacular. The Double Fine guys and girls really put everything rock-related into the game that deserves discovering. Also the composure of Mr. Crowley with one of the tragic part of the game is an iconic moment.There are many other things that can be mentioned, but as a summary you will value this game if you like the rock music (especially '70s and '80s metal) even if other parts of the game not so original. So Rock On. Brütally.			"

												Brütal Legend is a fun game, but the world and the characters are what make it. The worldbuilding is rich and the often hilarious fusion of metal and fantasy is truly great - stuff like the Screaming Wall, a massive wall of speakers and amps that crackles with feedback-thunder as the microphone-seagulls circle above. The story is well written, the voice acting is excellent, and the animation gives life to characters that in other games would be flat stereotypes or caricatures. Actual gameplay can be a little unwieldly at times, but not overly so, and everything else is so awesome that it didn't bother me too much.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/05/brutal-legend.html "

												Brütal Legend is a fun game, but the world and the characters are what make it. The worldbuilding is rich and the often hilarious fusion of metal and fantasy is truly great - stuff like the Screaming Wall, a massive wall of speakers and amps that crackles with feedback-thunder as the microphone-seagulls circle above. The story is well written, the voice acting is excellent, and the animation gives life to characters that in other games would be flat stereotypes or caricatures. Actual gameplay can be a little unwieldly at times, but not overly so, and everything else is so awesome that it didn't bother me too much.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/05/brutal-legend.html "

												Back in the year of 2009 i came across this game for the xbox 360 and it became of of my favourite games of all time.Sad fact is that Brutal Legend is an under rated game and it is one of those game that didn't sell huge so EA decided to don't make a sequel....you know EA guys....either spamm it and break it or don't make it.Well,what can i say about the game itself....Brutal Legend was made by Tim Shaffter a genious in making different,stylish, games and the game introduced me to a whole new set of metal bands which was a breath of fresh air regarding music selection.The game features jack black which is pretty damm cool,its like school of rock II + Tenacious D,it also features Ozzy Osbourne,Lemmy RIP and many others.The Gameplay is very simple and fluid,graphics are really damm good on pc.I love this game so much i allways recommend to friends and believe or not,one day i was at at gaming store and saw this girl browsing thru games and she was like,played this,played that,she wanted the same as i.crash bandicoot vortex and we started chatting and when she said,yeahh brutal legend i played that cool game i was like....ADD TO BEST FRIENDS FOREVER LIST....even tho she ended up getting the only one copy of crash bandicoot available at the store at that time..gurls master race demmmmmmAlot of  memories this game gives me,its a good game that just didnt made it out on the mainstream which is kinda good,its like a cult game :D\m/			"

												This mix of strategy and open world mission-driven action is odd at best. In this case it's well done and the story of the game ROCKS (pun intended). If you are a fan of heavy metal and rock'n'roll, this is a must. If you are a fan of good games, this is a must. Worth every penny. Unfortunately, the game has its lows. The audio is a bit strange, where the awesome music in the background will be nearly muted when characters are speaking but it comes back between lines of dialogue, creating a wavy volume control.In conclusion, they could have done  better job mixing the audio, but the fun is still there, with a lot of recognizable faces and voices.

												I remember time when I was watching the review of this game on TV few years ago. Then it wasn't available on PC but I knew that I have to play this game soon or sooner. Now, because of Humble Bundle, my dream came true and I'm not disappointed.There is only one game like this focused on the music! The world created here is really incredible. I like that we don't need to follow the plot all the time. We can find a lot of sidequests and things and places to discover like monuments or noteworthy places that make game's world look truly amazing! And the most important - music that follows us everywhere and make this crazy ambience when you're driving a car smashing animals on the road! The graphics is really nice, but because of my weak hardware I can't fully enjoy it (so I've got a reason to get back here in the future ;) ) Simply. If You love sound of rock and metak and You are bored of Guitar Hero like games - You need to play Brutal Legend. Let's rock! "

												Brütal Legend, the most hilariously awesome game I've played thus far. A game made by metalheads for metalheads like me.The characters, oh god, they are cool, and not because they look cool, it's because they are some of the most respected musicians out there, like Jack Black, Lemmy Kilmister, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob ****ing Halford!. The combat is what I'm used to do on these games, just run around, find an enemy, axe it till it's dead. Yeah, it can be repetitive and boring, but with such a world to explore, you'll have fun uncovering secrets while going on a killing spree with your lovely axe and guitar.And of course, what's a Heavy Metal game without Heavy Metal music? Well, don't panic, this one comes loaded of Metal tracks just to pleasure your ears. The soundtrack goes from KISS, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Slayer and many others. Though I prefer Death Metal, there's little of it on the game. I wish it had a song from Death on the soundtrack, like ""Together as One"" or ""Flesh and the Power it Holds"".Overall, this game will keep you entertained during many hours, just enjoying jamming your guitars to shock (literally) your enemies and then fend them off with your trusty Axe. If you are an open-minded metalhead or just someone looking for a bit of fun while slashing enemies, give this a try, you won't regret it.			"

												Always wanted to play this game since I was informed about the launch, when I started using Steam was on sale and bought quickly! The game is good as I expected, the best match for a Headbanger because we were listening to music all the time and besides being one of the best playlists I've seen it put that game, we can still know the names of the songs and the band that is playing if they did not know! A great adventure game for those who enjoy games of battles with the performance of strategy war games, but of course with the beautiful theme of Heavy Metal and with the special participation of some of the best musicians in the scene!Sempre desejei jogar esse jogo desde que fui informado sobre o lançamento, quando comecei a utilizar o Steam estava em promoção e comprei ele na mesma hora! O jogo é bem como eu esperava, o melhor jogo para um Headbanger, pois ficamos escutando músicas toda hora e além de ser uma das melhores playlists que já vi que colocaram nesse jogo, podemos ainda saber os nomes das músicas e da banda que está tocando, caso ainda não conhecemos! Um ótimo jogo de aventura para quem gosta de jogos de batalhas com o desempenho de jogos de estratégia de guerra, mas claro com o belíssimo tema do Heavy Metal e com a participação especial de alguns dos melhores músicos do cenário!

Story was solid, so many references to the metal world, even had Lemmy from Motorhead in it, and that's amazing in it's own, but a great game and is always worth a pick up.			"

												OK so when Double Team made this game I was pretty excited. I heard a lot of things before this came out, and I heard even more after it was released. As a metal fan, I had to own this game someday.Unfortunately it was only till a couple of weeks ago that I was first able to play it. I knew this was a game to enjoy because of the cameo's and references, and because I didn't expect any news-breaking gameplay I wasn't in a rush to get it.I must tell you: I was NOT dissapointed.First of all, when you buy this as an appreciator of either old classic rock (Menowar, Judast Priest, Black Sabbath, etc.) or just plain metal (Megadeth, 3 Inches of Blood, Children of Bodom and almost too many more) you will enjoy it. When I saw Ozzy Osbourne almost my whole life flashed by because of his pure awesomeness. And of course Rob Halford as Lionwhite, Lemmy as The Kill Master and more. But even smaller cameo's like Tim Curry (Rocky Horror Show), Metalocalypse-writer and actor Brian Posehn and Jack Black's sidekick Kile Gas.And last but not least; Jack Black... In real life almost such a hero as in Brutal Legend (except saving the earth as a Roady by preforming awesome solo's and creating whole stages and merchandise booths by pure awesomeness). Second comes gameplay. Yes, un purpose. Because if you are more interested in the works of Tim schafer and Double Fine you will find this game probably dissapointing (unless you are actually interested in the 'fun themes' of Double Fine). Yes, the humor does return in this game, even in a large amount! But gameplay wise this is certainly not news-breaking (as my suspicion already indicated). However, even though the game failed to be a good sandbox/rpg game, it did succeed in being unique and diverse. There are a lot of minor quests that are fun, unique and awesome to play when you lost interest in the main quest (which is nothing special, I should mension. Just fun, nothing special..).A last, third thing I should mention is the driving mechanism. I liked this game a lot, mainly because it was good in being mediocore and awesome, but driving in this game is almost impossible. You quickly lose control of your vehicle, it will change direction after the slightest bump in the road, and it can bring you on surfaces you can't walk away from (which makes you restart the game from last checkpoint). I recommend this game, once again, for being an Awesome, Fun and Brutal piece of mediocore game; ups and downs when it comes to gameplay, but the best when it comes to humor and appearances!			"

												I own 3 copies of this game (PS3, X360, PC) and have played them all entirely. While my Steam playtime doesn't reflect complete playthrough, that is because I also received a DRM free copy via Humble Bundle. I can't recommend this game enough! Many were put off by the surprise RTS elements that were introduced after the beginning, but if you stick with the game to explore the most metal world ever created, the best soundtrack hands-down, and the amazing comedic performances and writing from the staff (which includes Tim Schafer, Jack Black, Rob Halford, Lemmy Kilmister, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne), you will not be disappointed.I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this game, except for maybe the marketing. It was a bit deceptive trying to disguise the game as something it was not, but if you have $5 you could probably buy a copy for youself and another copy for a friend. I've done this on multiple occasions, and I advise others to do this as well so people can appreciate one of the best games that sadly went unnoticed by too many.			"

												It's a divisive game. I'm among those who really enjoyed it, but I totally understand those who did not.It's a 3rd person action adventure game with periodic RTS-lite battles. None of the individual elements are particularly special, but they all work together in a way that's more than the sum of their parts. You maintain your full 3rd-person control and moves during the RTS battles, and some of the strategy units will appear throughout the world that you can team up with and lead around to help in fights.The soundtrack is fantastic, with a healthy blend of a wide variety of subgenres and time periods from metal and rock history. I'm a fan of metal so I had an inherent interest, but I've been told by friends who don't listen to metal regularly that the metal jokes were still funny and the soundtrack was enjoyable and thematically appropriate.

												This game gets two thumbs up, not just one. If you do not wish to read a long, detailed review, know this; Brutal Legend is absolutely brilliant. It has a good story, fast paced gameplay, which combines action and some Real-Time Strategy elements, is semi-open world (more on this later) and has the most rocking soundtrack of any game in living memory. So, what do you get if you purchase Brutal Legend. Firstly, you will find a crisp video introduction featuring Jack Black, introducing you to a record of such rarity, he forgot where it is. When he stumble upon and opens it, you are presented with the best menu system in any game. It is quality, and marks the start of what will become a quality game. After starting the game, you are thrust into the main story. Make no mistake, this game is story driven. It will present you with the illusion of choice, but, really, there is little need to play many of the side quests except to earn Favour of the Gods points, which you can spend on upgrades to your car. The story is suitably epic. I will not spoil anything suffice to say that you are a Roadie for a modern tween-metal band, just getting on with your thing, thinking back to the glory days of metal, when an accident calls you to action. After the carnage has cleared, you awake in a new land, one in which you can harness the power of metal to slay the bad guys. After this, you are tasked with freeing a people, helping with an uprising and vanquishing the oppressors of this world. The characters are excellent, many voiced by prolific figures in rock and metal - Jack Black, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, etc. Each character is designed to be the cliche, but this is no bad thing. It adds to the humour of the game.Your character, Eddie Riggs, is armed with a giant axe and a giant axe (this time of the guitar type). With one, you can bash the living daylights out of your opponents, with the other, you can call lightning strikes, small explosions or play solos. The solos are a great game dynamic. Use them to summon your car, raise relics that are used for varying purposes, or simply melt the faces off large groups of enemies. You also use them to capture fans in the RTS parts of the game.This is where the game gets unique. Rather than simply bashing your way through hordes of enemies, you get presented with a battleground at various point in the game. You and your crew build a stage, as does the enemy. This is your base, if you will, and you must protect it. Geysers in the ground spew forth ghostly fans, which you have to capture to boost your fan points. These you can spend to upgrade your stage, your fighters and actually buy your units. The battles are fast paces and frantic, but very enjoyable, at least for a time. Luckilly, this part of the game is not overused. When it is used, it is in the right places, and builds tension. However, for me, there was perhaps one or two too many of these RTS bits. When the rest of the game tries hard to vary what it is doing, these are always a little bit samey, which is a shame. At least the setting changes each time.I completed the game in a single sitting or about 7 hours. I played some of the secondary missions, but not all - I am not a completionist. However, for completionists, you will be happy to know that the main story is only about 50% of the game - there is still plenty to do. For the age of the game, the graphics are amazing. It easily holds up with today's games, mainly due to the art style, which is phenominal. It really is a good looking game.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed. I bought the game a long time ago and never played it, but thought, ""hey, I may as well give it a go"". Thank goodness I did, as it is now one of my favourite games of all time. It is humourous, with its tounge firmly in its cheek, but hell does it rock. Buy this! Buy this now!!!!!!			"

												Brütal Legend is not a game - it's an EPIC game. In all caps.The story is hilarious and plays with common cliches. The soundtrack is absolutely superb and so is the voice-acting. The graphics are not state-of-the-art anymore, but this hardly matters since this game is all about chrome and metal anyway. So as long as the bump-mapping is okay: you are cool. Also I truly believe hair-animation was originally invented by some dude that played Brütal and it's only purpose was to allow more realistic head-banging.The game itself hardly sticks with any genre. It takes whatever floats the boat and is the most fun. Meaning it is a road-racing, story-driven, strategic, exploration, adventure, 3rd-person fighting game with RPG elements and Ozzy Osbourne. Also you cast magic spells using an interface that basically looks like Guitar hero.Personally I'm not a big Metal fan. So I may be missing a few puns, but since the focus is on more classic material (even though Metal never gets ""classic"" it simply becomes more ""epic"") even an ""outsider"" like me can enjoy it very much and will recognize many of the characters.The game may be less fun for kids that have not been around in the 19XXies, folks that are dead-serious about their Metal, and people having a favorite activity in bird-watching. (unless it's bird-watching with Metal music)For anybody else: I highly recommend it!			"

												(Four horns for the metal; two for the game itself)This is fantastic game for metal heads, primarily, for all the in-jokes and chuckle-worthy self awareness. Black's dialogue and delivery is priceless as is the fantastic writing by Mr. Schafer himself. The PC version is more than 'just a port', looking and moving far superior to the console editions. The controls are fantastic, specifically with a gamepad. The only issue I have with the game, really, is that combat can be far too simplistic and frantic to be as fun as one might imagine it would be. Also, once the game introduces RTS elements in the form of squads and minions, it goes from 'true metal' to 'nu-metal' in terms enjoyment. That being said, there is a great story here with an enjoyable cast of characters and satirical achetypes. The game overall is great fun, and exploration and a joy. It's a shame that it couldn't decide if it was an adventure game, beat 'em up or a strategy game.			"

If you do, however, your in for a lot of fun. For awhile.... It's a short game, and it doesn't have the best replay value.

												Brutal Legend is to put it simply, a love letter to metal, its easy to tell. From Jack Black being the main character, to Ozzy Osbourne as the shopkeeper and god of metal. This game uses as many iconic things that makes up metal and its culture. The game has 3 main gameplay mechanics, its a beat em up with heavily used driving mechanics and strategy game mechanics mashed together. If strategy games like Comand and Conqure isn't your thing then don't worry, its not filled with it and its more action oriented than those counterparts. The only main complaint is the game's length, it shouldn't take much time at all if you really wanna try a speed run of it, so if you're looking for a long and joyful distraction, Burtal Legend is FUN and a great time, but it won't be able to go for long especially if you care for only the main story. Other than that this is a great hack and slash, open world game with a huge love for metal, with a soundtrack of artists like Ozzy, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Megadeth, Diamond Head, and so forth; this game is even better when you're a metal head!8/10 - If longer I would whole heartedly give it a 10/10!

Though the story is a bit crazy, but it really fits with the Metals world.4. Jack Black really put a heart in this game.Cons : 1. Like most people had noticed, some bands songs are too often, balance should be better.2. Control could be better, not only driving, it didn't optimize for Mac users too.      basically, you have to remap them once you start the game, so it could be more useful.I'm a huge fan of Jack Black, and really really enjoys the game, hope it could become movie or BL II, and hope more people could try this one.

												Brutal Legend is secretly a masterpiece classic game that any gamer should play.  If you are a fan of heavy metal, or of Jack Black, that is bonus.  The game itself has an such a range of unique characters/enemies, visually stunning environments, and excelent game mechanics that it really should be played by every adult gamer.  The game does have very strong language and excessive gore, but that is part of the theme of the story and somehow makes the game better.  The use of the heavy metal theme is done so well.  It's in everything from guitars as your weapons, to mountains of giant speakers to all aspects of the game.  It seems like heavy metal was actually the perfect video game world, or maybe video games are the perfect way to experience the heavy metal world.The game is very affordable, and very entertaining.  I payed $1.50, and have gotten about 20 hours of fun out of the game.  I constantly laugh out loud (literally) at the main character's lines.  I have taken several really awesome screenshots of areas in the game.  I very rarely take a screenshot in a game, so I feel like that is saying something.  Especially when you consider this game is fairly aged.  It still looks amazing in most places.If I were to say anything needed to be changed or added to the game, I would request (As I always do) the ability to play through the campaign in two player coop mode.  The game does have a multiplayer mode, but it is a seperate game type/mode that is really only one of the mini games in the main game.  I would love to go melt faces with a friend!  ...and an HD texture pack.I highly recommend you get this game and play until your face melts.  (or at least until you learn how to perform the face melter in the game)			"

												As a gamer, I'm gonna say that I've definetely seen better games than this. As a fan of heavy metal, I'm gonna say it's almost a masterpiece. I got it on sale during the Steam Winter Sales 2016, and I probably wouldn't have bought it for the full price. I thought, wait, is that Jack Black, Lemmy and Ozzy I hear, while watching a trailer, and thought ""f**k it, I'm gonna buy it. I'll just write a short resumé that doesn't really spoil anything:ResuméYou start off as a Roadie named Eddie (voiced by Tenacious D lead singer Jack Black), at a gig. A member of the band has climbed up high on the stage, and is now falling down. Eddie manages to save the bandmember, but is crushed by some falling scenery. His blood lands on his belt buckle, in reality an amulet for Ormagöden. The monster Ormagöden then comes to life, and kills the band, and then takes Eddie to a magical world, in which a guitar not only makes sounds, but also blows things up. Eddie wakes up at what looks like a satanic summoning ritual (no surprise, it's a heavy metal game), and will soon have to fight the monsters dressed as monks. He meets a woman named Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale, known for multiple hit video games and TV series, such as WoW, Mass Effect 3, and multiple Star Wars series and games). Together they go and meet a guy named Lars (voiced by Zach Hanks, also vid game voice actor), and together they decide to free the magical world from the tyranny of the evil Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford). Eddie starts off by freeing a bunch the ""Headbangers"" (get the reference??) from a mine. During the adventures, Eddie meets many different characters voiced by famous heavy metal starts, including:Notable VoiceactorsLemmy Killmister (legendary heavy metal star, founder of Motörhead), voicing the Killmaster.Ozzy Ousbourne (also a legend, from Black Sabbath), voicing The Guardian of Metal.Kyle Gass (deserves to be a legend, from Tenacious D), voicing Kage the Kannonier.Jack Black (just ONE step closer to being a legend than Kage, from Tenacious D), voicing Eddie Riggs.Buy it on sale, unless you are a really hardcore metal fan, then just get it as fast as possible, you're missing out on something golden "

												One of the best games i have ever played in the last decade.It was a while ago i've had this much fun with a game.I saw this game for the first time at a friends house in 2009 on its release day.Didn't know much of it, thought it looked funny with all those headbangers and you leading them, but never played it and looked back.Until i saw this on steam and humble bundle, i didn't even have to think to buy it.I didn't regret any of this at all, infact i would have gladly paid full price ( 60 euros ) for this.Metal music, Jack Black, Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy, headbangers, roadies, epic fights ( Hack 'n slash and RTS ) and a engaging story line that leaves me wishing for more.My only complaint would be the difficulty, i finished this on normal, but the last fighting parts were really hard, lots of trial and error.A difficult game isn't a problem, but being a frustating one is.I barely made those last parts and after i did, it felt very satisfactory, so i guess that makes up for it.In summary, i love this game and it is definitely in my top 5 of best games.

												Listen up: THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. In fact, it isn't for many people. This game is for gamers who love heavy metal. If you don't love it, you'll get nothing out of this game. If you do, however, your in for a lot of fun. For awhile.... It's a short game, and it doesn't have the best replay value. But I'd recommend it to anyone who likes heavy metal with the low price tag on it at the moment. Also keep in mind though, the PC version isn't quite as good as the console versions.			"

												Back in the year of 2009 i came across this game for the xbox 360 and it became of of my favourite games of all time.Sad fact is that Brutal Legend is an under rated game and it is one of those game that didn't sell huge so EA decided to don't make a sequel....you know EA guys....either spamm it and break it or don't make it.Well,what can i say about the game itself....Brutal Legend was made by Tim Shaffter a genious in making different,stylish, games and the game introduced me to a whole new set of metal bands which was a breath of fresh air regarding music selection.The game features jack black which is pretty damm cool,its like school of rock II + Tenacious D,it also features Ozzy Osbourne,Lemmy RIP and many others.The Gameplay is very simple and fluid,graphics are really damm good on pc.I love this game so much i allways recommend to friends and believe or not,one day i was at at gaming store and saw this girl browsing thru games and she was like,played this,played that,she wanted the same as i.crash bandicoot vortex and we started chatting and when she said,yeahh brutal legend i played that cool game i was like....ADD TO BEST FRIENDS FOREVER LIST....even tho she ended up getting the only one copy of crash bandicoot available at the store at that time..gurls master race demmmmmmAlot of  memories this game gives me,its a good game that just didnt made it out on the mainstream which is kinda good,its like a cult game :D\m/			"

												So what can i say about Brutal Legend?Is it brutal?..sort of..it it lengendary!....considering the Heavy metal tracks you get to listen to thoughout the game...HELL YEAH! at first i thought this was going to be a funny yet serious narative kind of game considering Jack Black as the roadie in the game, but this was only in the begining.the game gets pretty dark and serious afterwards with not much room for comedy.Which was disappointing but a good game none the less. The combat could use a bit more work and its rather hard to order around individual unit groups.The world looks fantastic in the Heavy Metal theme.A Big thumbs up on the art style! I wish you could develop more with the other characters and well as their storylines.If you enjoy the world of leather,chains,bikes,sharp things,fire,skulls,Heavy Metal and demons.Brutal metal is for you!Buy the game even if you intend to just drive aound in the deuce exploring the beautiful metal world listening to metal tracks all day long!

												Fun game. Awesome soundtrack. Easy game to play and you don't have to have played any game extensively in order to fully enjoy this title. Though one thing might turn you away from this game. When I first bought the game it wouldn't load past the logo screen. If you run into that error, know that it is fixable!			"

The soundtrack has barely any original songs that weren't made by famous artist already, but i think that's one of the things the game got right. i dont have much hours into the game since i mostly played it on console. but i can safely say this goes down in my book of badass games. 9/10			"

												What can I say about this game? Brutal Legend is the very reason why I'm into the music I'm into today; which is of course, Metal! All kinds, but I'm a big fan of Black/Death metal. This game has a heavy emphasis on metal music, with the entire game basically being one big metal album, with a collection of metal songs as well as clever references to other metal bands/songs.One thing that may surprise you is that this is *kind of* an RTS game. About 35%-40% of the way through, you have your first stage battle of the game (of which there are only 5 in single player). The RTS elements were never included in a demo before release because the release of this game got rushed, which is why I think people are a little harsh with this game. People just weren't prepared for RTS :PAbsolutely worth the $15 if you like RTS games, hack 'n' slash games, or if you want to get into metal music! Especially the last one :P9/10			"

												It's not a long game but it's oozing with style.  Basically a mash up of 3rd person action, RTS and driving that uses a lot of Metal iconography to paint a pretty interesting fantasy world.  It's a bit amazing how good this game looks considering how many years it has under it's belt.I'd recommend this to anyone who likes classic metal, but then again if you do you've probably already played it.

												This mix of strategy and open world mission-driven action is odd at best. In this case it's well done and the story of the game ROCKS (pun intended). If you are a fan of heavy metal and rock'n'roll, this is a must. If you are a fan of good games, this is a must. Worth every penny. Unfortunately, the game has its lows. The audio is a bit strange, where the awesome music in the background will be nearly muted when characters are speaking but it comes back between lines of dialogue, creating a wavy volume control.In conclusion, they could have done  better job mixing the audio, but the fun is still there, with a lot of recognizable faces and voices.

												Metalhead's Paradise.The biggest project by Double Fine to date released on consoles with the help of EA and self-published 3 years later on PC, Brütal Legend is the ultimate videogame tribute to metal as a music genre. The game features stars like Jack Black and Ozzy Osbourne, absolutely kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack that can satisfy tastes of pretty much any true metal fan old and new (who said ""nu""?), shines with great humour and takes place in a rich and creative open world that feels truly alive with real-time day and night cycle and variable weather.Gameplay-wise it starts as an extremely fun slasher but halfway through turns itself into a somewhat hectic action-strategy which may turn many people off, but take your time to master its mechanics and you will find hours of entertainment within, which further extends into the game's multiplayer part.A must-have for every true metalhead regardless of their sub-genre preferences and just a fun open-world slasher / action-strategy game for everyone else.

												I'm not really a fan of Slash games in general, and I'm not really a fan of metal in general. I am though, a big Double Fine fan, and they did not disappoint me in this one. mowing down loads of enemies is not that disappointing when it's not the only thing you do.I really enjoyed how they turned some parts of the game into a little RTS, managing your army (one of the funniest things I've ever seen, tbh) while building merch stores and shredding away to mow down enemies... that's just silly, yet awesome.The cameos are just so funny, Ozzy as the beholder of all metal is perfect, and Jack Black as the main character is not half bad, he actually managed to pull this hardcore badass that'll save the world through the power of metal. To make a long story short, this game is worth it's price, tight graphics, amazing Soundtrack (that really fits in with the game) and great character designs... One of Double Fine's Finest.			"

												The game concept is great and the story is pretty fun. The cutscenes and characters are great as well. The gameplay is a bit generic but has a bunch of unlockables thrown around a somewhat boring map, which will keep you entertained enough as you drive pretty much everywhere. Obviously the theme of the game is Heavy Metal and there is a lot of that in there. Some of the cameos are painful, but having a wide library of music to play while you drive around is pretty cool.During the game, there are these really out of place RTS battles. It is a welcoming change of pace to the game, but gets really old really quick and seems shoehorned in. There is even a multiplayer version of it no one will play.RTS shoehorns aside, this game is pretty good. The gameplay is mediocre but the cutscenes and overall look and feel of the game really did it for me.			"

												Brütal Legend is a fun action/adventure game with a lot of comedy in the World of Metal which is now been enslaved by a demon, and you Eddie Riggs, need to free it. The game has a great atmosphere with excellent music and responsive combat system. Also the game manages to mix open world action with some strategic grand scale battles with bosses. Graphics and art design are also Brütal and appealing to look at.Probably the only problem is that the AI sometimes plays it easy, while other times make it really hard for you, mostly on these strategic stage sessions. These battles therefore can be a little stiff sometimes and hard to beat. Issuing orders and keeping the battlefield together is also really hard in this view.The side missions are fun, but after a while you will see that most of them are repeating quests and they are the same except for some.The game is fairly long (around 12 hours) with (a my opinion) kinda lame ending. There is a multiplayer also, but without matchmaking, so you can pretty much just play with your friends.Brütal Legend is a rare gem in the action genre and a very fun game to play. I would definitely recommend to metal/rock fans, or even those who are just looking for some fine action.8/10 Awesome !			"

												Jack Black's humor and Double Fine's greatness come together in a game I thoroughly love. The hack and slash is decent, the RTS elements admittedly were a bit clunky, but the unique concept, amazing soundtrack, and quirky humor make this game a must play.			"

												This is the most Metal game you have ever played, and probably will ever play. If you play it. I'll be honest here, this is a pretty unique game, not just in music and art direction, but also in gameplay. If you hate Metal I doubt you're going to enjoy the game and its story very much, which is filled with nods to those elements. It practically lives of it. So, this review is based on the fact that you ♥♥♥♥ing love Metal.The story is pretty decent, it's got great voice acting, still enjoyable graphics, good cutscenes, interesting characters and villains (at least some of them), though you'll never going to get to dig too deep, so the characters remain somewhat shallow mostly. Still, a fun ride.Bonus points for some rock and metal legends being represented in the game: Lemmy, Ozzy, Jack Black himself of course...From a technical view point, the game still holds up about 7 years later on Windows 10 and works pretty flawlessly. Just make sure to set FOV and camera distance to max. There are some hitches in the vehicles sections, but that's about it. Sound is obviously fantastic.Now let's get on to the gameplay: BEWARE, this game ""looks"" like a 3rd person brawler, but it's really not. Not at all. While you can and will engage in typical brawls with your weapons, the system is rather basic and you will mostly do so during certain missions and the early stages of the game. Slight spoiler alert: The latter stages of the game (about 2/3s or so) will be more of a RTS, in which you will also fight yourself. This means that you are going to have a base (the stage) and you'll need to capture resource nodes (fans) to train your different units. As the game progresses you get more and more units to choose from. Each of them do something different: There are basic melee and ranged units, a healer, advanced melee and ranged units, siege units, ultimate units, aoe units, etc.These can be ordered around via the D-Pad on your controller to attack, defend, follow, whatever. Many of the later missions revolve around your ""tour"", i.e. you need to get your tour bus to a certain location at which a stage battle or stage defense will take place. Later on you'll not just have to crush your enemy, but also accomplish certain goals to be able to. You can personally take part in those battles or view them from different angles and just direct your troops, though that won't get you far probably. Better than just hacking away at enemies, however, is the use of your special abilities, called ""solos"". With these you can buff your allies or ""melt the faces"" off your enemies for example. Beware that you need to FIND those solos first in the open game world. Without face melter for example the game becomes much more difficult. Same as with solos you can also get upgrades for your character and his car, but you need points for that. You can do side missions to get more of those, but they are not really necessary and they are kinda boring.The stage battles can get a bit tedious after a while, especially if you would rather brawl around, but well, that's just the way the game was designed. If you're really not into that, better not buy and watch a bit on YouTube first or watch the whole story and gameplay.I didn't play the MP portion of the game, but I imagine it's a) pretty much dead and b) probably more stage battles. Since there are 4 factions in the game, each with different units (2 are pretty similar), I assume you can just play as any one of them.Bottom line: If you like Metal, give it a try, on easy it's not too difficult, only the last 2 battles are a bit annoying.

												Я натрапив на цю забавку коли читав в Вікіпедії про Містера Кроулі. Скажу прямо, я слухаю надзвичайно багато металу. Я виріс на піснях Озі Озборна, Моторхед, Мегадес та Металіки. Я був здивований коли побачив гру повністю про метал, рок-н-рол та треш метал. Що здивувало мене найбільше це каст гри. Легенди року як Озі, Роб Хальфорд та Леммі Кілмайстер озвучили своїх же персонажів в цій грі мене заставило трішко просльозитися. Також здивували зірки як Джек Блек які вирішили озвучити цю гру. В русифікаторі атмосфера трішки пропадає але люди які вільно говорять англійською мовою можуть насолодитися озвучкою гри.ГеймплейГра це свого роду РПГ від третього лиця. Ви мусите проходити побічні завдання щоб отримати ""Fire Tribute"", свого роду валюту на яку можна купити апгрейди для своєї сокири, гітари, машини чи нові комбо атаки. Все це можна зробити в спеціальних гаражах, де Озі продає все це добро. Гра такоє має свого роду стратегічну систему. Вона не складна, але цікава. (Навколо неї побудований мультіплейер). Гравець повинен знащити ворожу сцену за допомогою своєї армії. Цей процес можна прирівняти до катки в Доту, але в Brutal Legend гравець не дуе помагає ""кріпам"". КонтрольСкажу прямо, але я просто ненавидів керувати деусом. Керування мені здавалось важким. та погано зробленим. Особливо ненавидів місію втечі з замку Ліонвайта. Самим персонаем керувати не складно (крім гри соло на гітарі, але до них я швидко звик)СюжетМи грайемо за Едді Рігса (Джек Блек). Еді- роуді який працює на сучасну рок груву ""Cabbage Boy."" Але Еді ненавить сучасний рок. Він думає що сучасний метал повільно падає на коліна. Одного разу дурний гітарист виліз на статую Еді побудував для концерту. Еді всіх рятує та помирає. Трішки його крові попадає йому в пржку паска що переность його в дивний світ. В новому світі людство забуло що таке метал, через загарбників які відібрали нашу культуру і землю. Еді вступає в ряди супротиву щоби повернути метал та нашу культуру. На своєму шляху Еді зустрічає Майстра Вбивств (Леммі Кілмайстер), Вогняного Барона (Роб Халфорд) та інших персонажів з якими він повинен повернути волю та метал своєму народу.ПідсумкиЯ закохався в цю гру з першого погляду. Мені сподобалося все! Голоса, метал, пасхалки, квести, сюжет та персонажі. Все було мультяшним, кольоровим, дзвінким, але на жаль контролі  трішки портять досвід гри. Моя оцінка: 9/10 Покойся з миром Іан ""Lemmy"" Кілмайстер :Killmaster:			"

												For a game released in 2009, this is great. I had no real knowledge of the game going into it, so I was very suprised when it went from open world to an inovative RTS + third person mixup partway through. A fresh take on the RTS genre coupled with a solid overworld to explore makes for some varied and engaging gameplay. Add on top of that some solid humor brought to you by Jack Black and some other comedic voice actors engaged in a decent storyline and you have yourself a pretty solid experience. It's even got multiplayer which actually might be the biggest aspefct of the game.The main negatives are the somewhat wonky vehicle controls and pretty mundane sidequests. If it were just an open world game it'd be hard to recommend, but there's so much more to it than that.			"

												The reason I enjoy this game is because I love Jack Black, I was a total metal-head as a young teen, and the soundtrack is amazing,(when they played ""Rock of Ages"" during the first big boss fight I almost♥♥♥♥♥♥myself) and the cameos by famous metal artists is awesome.Now those are the reasons that I liked it, but as far as reasons the average gamer would enjoy, the game is a bit lacking.Combat is simplistic and feels lacking overall. Driving isn't tight and feels to chaotic to have an arcadey feel. The story is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ overall and just seems like  random crap thrown in to get all these people in one place to do some voice acting.If  you're a child of the 80-90's and love Metal and don't mind dropping a few bucks, get it.If you're looking for a new open world game to explore and have fun in, give it a miss.

												Get this for the story and the tunes, not for the gameplay.  While it is fun for a sec, it quickly gets stale.  If you've played it, then you might enjoy the nostalgia.  If you haven't played it, I suggest mashing through to get the story and move on.  I spent much of my time cruising the sights and enjoying the metal!  Praise Ormagöden~			"

												3rd person, action, adventure game with open world feel.Very funny game voiced by a lot of famous Rock / Metal music artists. Many popular Rock / Metal music tracks through out the game. Main character you play as is voiced by Jack Black, that also looks somewhat similar in game. Basically in this game, you try to help people with the power of Rock / Metal music.A lot of melee hack and slash combat, with some fun combo moves and effects. Game has good but simple story, great humor, decent visuals, nice animation, great voice acting, average environments and really great selection of music. It's a simple but very fun experience, unless you don't really like Rock / Metal music.			"

												Really, really great concept and a good story. This game is funny. And I like heavy metal quite much. Therefore, I really wanted to like this game.BUT the controls are untolerable, especially with the car. It's not just me. Every negative review on the Store page mentions the same problem: controls.I also find the camera distance and rotation problematic while driving the vehicles. Also, the game badly communicates the objectives or the means to achieve them. Only if you are doing something wrong for a while, a hint appears. Why not mention what and how to do something in the beginning? Why I have to keep guessing? Sometimes, I achieve victory right away, sometimes I need to try few more times. Either way I don't know what I did right or wrong. Things just happen in this game. The game has no mini-map, therefore I need to check the global map all the time. The game has no healthbar, therefore I don't know, how much health I've left. What's even worse: the game poorly communicates, whether you've received damage or gave damage. Also, it's hard to distinguish between friendly units and enemy units. For every friendly unit you have a matching enemy unit, who looks almost the same. The minor differences are noticeable only from a close distance. Also, the heavy emphasis on guitar solos doesn't make things any more convenient (you need to press a certain button combination during the solos and you are vulnerable to attacks for a few seconds before the solo is through).Real-time strategy, racing, adventure, hack-n-slash - this game has mixed so many elements, but none of them is done properly. The game has a good soundtrack and story and that's about it. Everything else is just chaos happening between the cutscenes. Therefore, I cannot recommend this game. The gameplay is torment.But I do recommend to watch the cutscenes on YouTube. If you perceive Brutal Legend as a cartoon, it's great, especially, if you know a bit about the history of metal and hard rock music.My overall rating: 6/10			"

												Provided that you like (or at least tolerate) all of the following:  Various forms of Metal music and all the imagery that comes with them, 3D Beat-em-ups, Driving, Exploration, RTS games, chatty NPCs, and the voices of Jack Black, Tim Curry, and Ozzie Osbourne... this may very well be your new favorite game EVER.  It's charming and imaginative, funny, and utterly awesome.But if any one of those elements would be an absolute deal-breaker for you, well... you can't really avoid any one of them altogether, although I did manage to fudge through most of the campaign's RTS segments with a one-man-army approach; the car becomes really OP in single-player.Oh yeah, there's also a competitive mode, in which you can play as the factions that were strictly enemy opponents in the single-player campaign, but you REALLY have to be into the RTS mechanics to stand a chance there.

												This game is just another example of poor PC porting, if you ask me. There aren't enough graphical settings for my liking (I like to consider those with bad computers) and, quite frankly, the mouse gets in the way of what I'm doing (I play with a gamepad, because I've been playing this since the original Xbox release)That's my only problem, really. Game has a ballin' soundtrack (Most played on my Ipod 3 years in a row) The storyline is awesome, charming, and funny. I just wish that the console port was better.Don't get me wrong, I love this game, I just wish it was as smooth as the console version.			"

												Brutal Legend is a very charming game filled with funny moments and feels like it was made with so much love.Unfortunately, as funny and as cared about the game is, the fact that there is basically 3 missions in the game, that just slightly reskin and increase the difficulty, gets very tiresome after a while.The three missions are - Heard up a wild beast, Escort a van and protect it from attacking monsters and RTS tower defence type mission. For a while it was fine but after 6 hours of the same 3 missions, it got too repetetive to bare. I had a lot of fun with this game for about 5 hours, so it might be worth picking it up on sale, but don't expect something groundbreaking and prepare for monotony.  "

												In the years leading up to this game I had begun to go off Jack Black. So I did not get this instantly. Then I bought it for the PS3. OH MY GOD! What a fantastic game! Tim Schafer take a bow. It helps if you like metal music but its not critical. The story is fantastic and has some metal ledgends lending their likeness and voices. Ozzy, Lemmy, Rob Halford, Lita Ford also Tim Curry does an awesome voice for Doviculous. Jack Black was fully commited to his role of Eddie Riggs and really restored my faith in him. The whole world is based on metal album covers and looks great. Its just a fanatasic game and now its on the PC its even better. Get It, Get It Now! Decapitiiooooooon! \m/("")\m/			"

												I love Jack Black and everything he does. This game basically makes him the badass we all know he is, and lets you play that awesome character. The game is visually stunning, always picking the best view when you are idle. The soundtrack is BOSS, but, being Jack Black he made sure it would be. The story, while a little bit cliche it would seem at times, is very entertaining and enjoyable. The combat however, is kind of repetetive at times to me, but still enjoyable with the mix of the guitar and the solos you can play. Jack Black playing the voice of the main character makes this game golden to me, and the suprise appearance of several other famous people makes it even better. Overall I give this a 9/10 and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. The derpy multiplayer is the only thing I really don't like about the game.*EDIT* change  ""the badass we all know he can be if he wanted to""to ""the badass we know he is""			"

												So I really, really enjoyed this game!Yes, me, the guy who normally thinks gameplay is the absolute most important element in any game, thinks Brutal Legend is a great game!The gameplay is... not rubbish, but really nothing special. The actual combat is kinda-fun but still mostly brainless button-mashing. while the pseudo-RTS elements actually IS garbage and not an RTS at all. Driving is still pretty fun though, in a Halo/Borderlands kind of ""Not really much benefit to it but still dang fun"".But it's everything else that really makes this game what it is! The music is bloody brilliant, the graphics and concept are close to ""Lord Of The Rings, as written by stereotypical heavy metal fans"" (aka: bloody awesome), and the voice acting and story is... good enough, I guess, I could never really judge voice acting.Basically, did you ever watch Army Of Darkness? Neither did I, I've only seen the trailer. But imagine what that movie would be like if it was just like the trailer, then make it 12 hours long, and you'll know whether you like this game or not.

												*INITIAL IMPRESSIONS*Inside my dusty, cobweb infested mind there were two debating sides of my shattered phsyce, one of them saying not to jump a sh*t and buy Brutal Legend just because of it's TF2 promotional item, and the other side saying ""naw scruu u"". Guess which side won.Initially, I'm somewhat glad that side was victorious. Brutal Legend is from what I've seen so far (little over half and hour) a third person hack-n-slash adventure game. The controls are simple and easy to pick up on but at the same time leave room to enhance one's skill with combos and strategy.  Graphics wise it leaves a tad to be admired, and the game has a fussy camera system which is especially prominent in the vehicle segments. I don't have any right to make a comment on the story yet, but I can say that the writing has a charming, casual approach to the brutal nature of the games world. The game also features Jack Black (School of Rock, Kung-Fu Panda) as Eddie Riggs, while I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Black I honestly can't see anyone else filling in the role except for him.So far, it's a pretty fun experience, it's rather obvious that it's been ported from the Playstation but that hardly gets in the way of the gameplay. FYI, these are my initial thoughts on the game, further into the game they may change.			"

												There are some movies that are good even though they're terrible: Evil Dead 2, The Room, Mars Attacks... this game is kind of like that. The gameplay is a bit dodgy and a little frustrating, but the soundtrack is awesome and the universe it creates is filled with so much insanity that you want to keep playing and exploring just to see what it's going to pull on you next. An ancient jungle tribe with KISS facepaint? Check. Chrome-tusked mammoths? Check. A whos-who of classic heavy metal voicing characters based on themselves? Check. If you're a metalhead, or if you just thought Metalocalypse and Spinal Tap were fun to watch, consider checking this out.			"

												One of the biggest points of this game is Heavy Metal and its imagery: Long-haired head bangers (with comically -unless you are a F1 pilot- sized necks), cool and sexy (In the eighties sense of sexy) biker girls, huge metal-themed statues bursting out of the ground, giganitc anvils with lava rives flowing, riffs, demons, epic battles, motorcycles speeding, and beer and horns everywhere. Is one of those games made by someone who enjoyed the medium it references and which grow in it. This is not a ""let's push some random generic references to heavy metal"" (as so many games have done before with the eighties), but a truly unique and well crafted journey through the perspective of actual metal fans of what the ""Land of Metal"" is.Thus, if you know who Rob Halford is, or if you use (or used) to headbang with Ronnie James Dio, you will feel here at home, laugh with (almost) every joke and smile at every single reference, and really enjoy how the world of metal and some of its sub genres is represented, all glued together with one of the best licensed OST's lawyers and money can put together. You got no idea about classic heavy metal? Then lookup ""Brütal Legend Soundtrack playlist"" and choose the playlist with MORE THAN 100 LICENSED SONGS. Titanic effort to please your ears while riding through the land of metal.The mandatory horns are here -> \m/, so we can keep going.This is a classic Double fine game in what background and history refeers: Its ♥♥♥♥ing great. At every single level. Characters are funny and well developed (Voiced in the original version by people like Jack Black or Lemmy Kilmister), the artistic side of the game is impressive at almost every single level, with different zones of the map following different substyles of heavy music, huge creatures which seems to have just escaped from a Judas Priest cover roaming the land... visually everything is in its place and ready to rock, achieving a weird mixture between some of the best designs for both creatures and landscape I've seen, alsoo imbued with a classic spirit straight from the beginning of the eighties. Also, the (epic) history, filled with demons, vikings, gods of metal and a ""as subtle as an atom bomb"" reference to Motörhead would fit without problem in a conceptual album from Manowar or Dio. The main problem with the game is that it tries to cover way too much features. You got a car which you can use to roam the Land of Metal listening to the different heavy metal songs mentioned earlier. You can fight with axe and guitar (yeah and guitar, HELL YEAH!) against multiple enemies. And you can direct battles in a simple-RTS style, in which it seems to be the main focus of the game. Everything can be upgraded, everything has combos, but almost nothing is deeply explored.You never got to a smart designed melee fight past the first level, nor you get more activities than racing with your car, and the RTS battles aren't exactly food for fans of the genre, as most of them are really simple ""go ahead with everyone until you destroy the enemy base"" missions, something that, on the other hand, is to be grateful for as the RTS controls (designed to use a console pad) are improvable, if I had to be polite. The crappy thing about all of this is that I'm not complaining about the game being bad (besides the poor RTS controls), but because I WANT MORE AND BETTER. The hack and slash deserves levels playing together with Ofelia (The female companion of the main character), the open world deserves to be bigger and more detailed, the RTS deserves to have proper mouse + keyboard controls so I can actually think on performing more complex strategies, like banding together with some infantry and attack in a mosh pit while a squad of bikers from hell cover our asses.I liked the game. A lot. I enjoyed every reference, listened to every song (Even discovered some groups that have gone under my radar), laughed at every joke and enjoyed a ride in a world I want to go back to. But I have serious doubts as if someone who wouldn't enjoy the background of the game would enjoy the gameplay itself, with its cool things, but also with its many flaws.			"

												The humor and music are just incredible, and the gameplay is a fun fusion of Action and RTS. I don't think any other game has left me with such a feeling of ""HOLY COW THIS ROCKS"". The PC port is really well done. Performance is great, controls are great, plenty of options to make it fit your PC. And at full HD with antialiasing, it looks so much better than the console version. One thing you should know before playing: the game feels like a free-roaming sandbox at time, with side quests and exploration bonuses. Don't let that distract you; that side of the game isn't very rewarding. Just play the story and enjoy the heck out of it.			"

												I love this game and have played through it multiple times. I first bought this game for the PS3 and played the hell out of this game due to its gameplay, looks, characters, and definately the music. When I saw it was going to be on steam I booked it to get it pre-ordered. This gem of a game should be experianced by any lover of the RTS genre or strategy gamer. Plus what other game has Jack Black as the hero and Tim Curry as the villian.			"

												I love Jack Black and everything he does. This game basically makes him the badass we all know he is, and lets you play that awesome character. The game is visually stunning, always picking the best view when you are idle. The soundtrack is BOSS, but, being Jack Black he made sure it would be. The story, while a little bit cliche it would seem at times, is very entertaining and enjoyable. The combat however, is kind of repetetive at times to me, but still enjoyable with the mix of the guitar and the solos you can play. Jack Black playing the voice of the main character makes this game golden to me, and the suprise appearance of several other famous people makes it even better. Overall I give this a 9/10 and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. The derpy multiplayer is the only thing I really don't like about the game.*EDIT* change  ""the badass we all know he can be if he wanted to""to ""the badass we know he is""			"

												One of the most artistically creative games I have seen hit from the 7th console generation. Everything in the game is a celebration of all things rock and metal, and as such, it has a ton of great music in it and personality and charm oozes out of this game's pores. I was really pleasantly surprise when Double Fine put in the effort themselves to get this originally PS3/360-exclusive and EA-published game onto the PC, and then even Mac and Linux, when they originally had no plan to do so, much like how they went back and gave Psychonauts a new shine on PC/Mac. It's a good port of a good, straightforward game, and I don't think it sold very well during its initial release, so major kudos to Double Fine for believing in their game and expanding it to reach new audiences. I thoroughly enjoyed this open-world hack-n-slashy journey, including those somewhat strange RTS-like parts you may have heard about. A truly inspired and fun, unforgettable game with a lot of heart and a brilliant vision.			"

												*INITIAL IMPRESSIONS*Inside my dusty, cobweb infested mind there were two debating sides of my shattered phsyce, one of them saying not to jump a sh*t and buy Brutal Legend just because of it's TF2 promotional item, and the other side saying ""naw scruu u"". Guess which side won.Initially, I'm somewhat glad that side was victorious. Brutal Legend is from what I've seen so far (little over half and hour) a third person hack-n-slash adventure game. The controls are simple and easy to pick up on but at the same time leave room to enhance one's skill with combos and strategy.  Graphics wise it leaves a tad to be admired, and the game has a fussy camera system which is especially prominent in the vehicle segments. I don't have any right to make a comment on the story yet, but I can say that the writing has a charming, casual approach to the brutal nature of the games world. The game also features Jack Black (School of Rock, Kung-Fu Panda) as Eddie Riggs, while I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Black I honestly can't see anyone else filling in the role except for him.So far, it's a pretty fun experience, it's rather obvious that it's been ported from the Playstation but that hardly gets in the way of the gameplay. FYI, these are my initial thoughts on the game, further into the game they may change.			"

												There are some movies that are good even though they're terrible: Evil Dead 2, The Room, Mars Attacks... this game is kind of like that. The gameplay is a bit dodgy and a little frustrating, but the soundtrack is awesome and the universe it creates is filled with so much insanity that you want to keep playing and exploring just to see what it's going to pull on you next. An ancient jungle tribe with KISS facepaint? Check. Chrome-tusked mammoths? Check. A whos-who of classic heavy metal voicing characters based on themselves? Check. If you're a metalhead, or if you just thought Metalocalypse and Spinal Tap were fun to watch, consider checking this out.			"

												This game is a wonderful mash up of the Action, RTS, driving, and Guiar hero genres. Soem it does better than others. If you are a fan of metal, speciafically classic metal (Black Sabath, Judas Priest) this game will speak to you. The action parts are smooth and the story line is decently knit together. There are some quests where you just feel you are on a fetch quest, yet most open world games have that feel at some point. Thegenre mashups do help keep the game feeling fresh as you near the end.PROS: soundtrack, Genre mashup, Jack Black humor, metal guest stars, seemless transitions CONS: Genre mashup, repetetive, slow parts may turn you off of the gameClarification: Genre mashup can be good and bad, it is good because it keeps the game fresh, it is bad because the RTS sections, which are forced, are not that great. You can single handedly do most of them with out needing to even go into the unit build menus.			"

A single individual against vast and innumerable odds, conquering his way through adversity with nothing short of awe-inspiring trenchancy.  Weild thunder and lightning?  Check.  Throw fireworks?  Check.  Use a guitar as a magical death-array?  Bam, done.  Slaughter enemies with a souped-up motor-car forged by The Ozz of Metal?  Go ♥♥♥♥ing crazy.This is a game that you do not soon forget.  This is a game where they've taken a masterpiece setting and given it a thick, heavy pulse, full of grit and power.  This is a game, ladies and gentlemen, that properly represents the spirit of Metal. Should you thirst for blood and lightning, for power and amazement, for a five-star cast and white-knuckle writing, then spend your money on this fantastic game.  Play it, enjoy it, and cherish it.  It's well worth your time.			"

												I am a dedicated metalhead and a former roadie and this game had me howlling with laughter from the moment I launched it. Total awesomeness and epic amounts of serious METAL! Buy this game! Gameplaywise it is reminds me of Overlord in an open world with a great soundtrack and also featuring a demon-hotrod.The only real negative things so far is that controls are BAD with keyboard/mouse (but not nearly like Dead Space or any other crappy port of a console game) and a tendency to crash when tabbing in/out or on exit.BRÜTAL! :D			"

												If you can get this game below £10 It's worth it 100% the game itself is set in a different universe where everything is inspired by heavy metal from the enemies to your allies even the map itself.the story and charaters are interesting enough  and the humour is good(if you like the jack black type of humour).The game itself is essentially an rpg with the main missions being a cross between a rts with the whole producing units, capturing resources and moving them units around with the addition of you yourself being able to fight in the combat. throughout my playthrough I didn't come across any bugs or anything that ruined the game but I did find it to be way too easy as I managed to complete the game on it's hardest difficulty in only 7 hours (bear in mind I must've only died about 5 times in them hours)There's a bunch of upgrades to the main character you can aquire in game aswell as for your main form of trainsport and lots of places to visit in the world itself.So I hope this helps and once again if you come across this game being on sale either during a random sale or the summer and winter sale I would say buy it without a doubt like I did. Dont let it just sit there in your game libary with the other 100 or so games like I did as It was genuinly a treat to play.			"

												Maybe I'm nostalgic, or maybe I'm a sucker for Jack Black's VO's, or maybe I'm just a göddamn shameless Tim Schafer fan (second only to Will Wright, he's right up there with the demigods of gaming!), but Brütal Legend (WITH A GÖDDAMN UMLAUT!) holds a REALLY special spot in my heart. Yeah, the gameplay isn't exactly stellar, and there's a good few bugs, but by the fiery breath of Ormagöden, this game still kicks äss on so many levels, it puts both Duke Nukem 3D, Doom 1 AND 2 as well as Serious Sam 1 to shame! The music is brilliantly chosen, and normally I focking despise Dragonforce for being the most ludicrously shïtty band to ever reach fame 'n' fortune in the world of rock and metal since cover-Metallica, but the way their tune played during that one scene in the game... I dunno. It struck a chord inside me. Yeah. I'm making music refs now. Deal with it.Moving on! The humour is in the usual Tim Schafer style, but with the added- yeah, I can't write this with a straight face, but the added ""maturity"" of it all (sexual references, profanity, shït like that), somehow makes it all the funnier. Sure, you can choose to bleep it out with censoring and shït, if you're a weak-äss little püssy! But seriously, hearing Jack Black cuzzin' out a dumbäss teen-band member for doing the Bobby Zilch dance on top of a flimsily built stage prop... golden. Just golden. 9.2/10			"

												It's hard to review this game as it has many great ideas, but also many horrible ones. And sometimes even those great ideas are horribly executed. The game is a hybrid 3rd person action adventure with RTS elements with racing elements. Truth be told, I spent 3/4 of the game in Deuce, the beefed up car, mostly because the 3rd person combat and RTS elements are rather poorly executed. The game's story is quite an interesting one and cameos from many well known metal figures are rather funny and/or interesting. All in all if you like metal music, just buy the game. You will enjoy many many things while enduring the cumbersome parts. \m/ If you don't like metal music, or if you're just indifferent to it, there is nothing for you here. Nearly every aspect of the game lacks polish and it's not worth going through all the shortcomings to enjoy the nice story.			"

												*INITIAL IMPRESSIONS*Inside my dusty, cobweb infested mind there were two debating sides of my shattered phsyce, one of them saying not to jump a sh*t and buy Brutal Legend just because of it's TF2 promotional item, and the other side saying ""naw scruu u"". Guess which side won.Initially, I'm somewhat glad that side was victorious. Brutal Legend is from what I've seen so far (little over half and hour) a third person hack-n-slash adventure game. The controls are simple and easy to pick up on but at the same time leave room to enhance one's skill with combos and strategy.  Graphics wise it leaves a tad to be admired, and the game has a fussy camera system which is especially prominent in the vehicle segments. I don't have any right to make a comment on the story yet, but I can say that the writing has a charming, casual approach to the brutal nature of the games world. The game also features Jack Black (School of Rock, Kung-Fu Panda) as Eddie Riggs, while I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Black I honestly can't see anyone else filling in the role except for him.So far, it's a pretty fun experience, it's rather obvious that it's been ported from the Playstation but that hardly gets in the way of the gameplay. FYI, these are my initial thoughts on the game, further into the game they may change.			"

												There are some movies that are good even though they're terrible: Evil Dead 2, The Room, Mars Attacks... this game is kind of like that. The gameplay is a bit dodgy and a little frustrating, but the soundtrack is awesome and the universe it creates is filled with so much insanity that you want to keep playing and exploring just to see what it's going to pull on you next. An ancient jungle tribe with KISS facepaint? Check. Chrome-tusked mammoths? Check. A whos-who of classic heavy metal voicing characters based on themselves? Check. If you're a metalhead, or if you just thought Metalocalypse and Spinal Tap were fun to watch, consider checking this out.			"

												This game is a wonderful mash up of the Action, RTS, driving, and Guiar hero genres. Soem it does better than others. If you are a fan of metal, speciafically classic metal (Black Sabath, Judas Priest) this game will speak to you. The action parts are smooth and the story line is decently knit together. There are some quests where you just feel you are on a fetch quest, yet most open world games have that feel at some point. Thegenre mashups do help keep the game feeling fresh as you near the end.PROS: soundtrack, Genre mashup, Jack Black humor, metal guest stars, seemless transitions CONS: Genre mashup, repetetive, slow parts may turn you off of the gameClarification: Genre mashup can be good and bad, it is good because it keeps the game fresh, it is bad because the RTS sections, which are forced, are not that great. You can single handedly do most of them with out needing to even go into the unit build menus.			"

												What if Dorothy was super into heavy metal and Oz thus reflected that? That's basically what happens with Brutal Legends. You get sucked into a world full of trees made of car mufflers, spiders that spin steel bass strings instead of web, and a ""Wailing Wall"" made up of giant guitar amps instead of bricks and mortar.The story is incredibly tongue-in-cheek and had me chuckling on several occasions. They poke fun of heavy metal throughout the game, but at the same time you can tell they have a deep love for it. It has great voice acting (Jack Black normally gets on my nerves but he's fine here), and an excellent soundtrack (assuming you can tolerate heavy metal).The gameplay is your standard open-world character action game, but what sets it apart is the RTS element which is pretty divisive. Personally, I love it, and am surprised more people didn't get into it. They've spun it out into a full-fledged multiplayer mode with matchmaking, and I'm looking forward to digging into it even more. It does have a steep learning curve, but once you get the basics down there is a lot of fun to be had.Definitely a game worth checking out if you haven't already.			"

												TLDR – Brutal Legend is a third person hack / slash game with some simple rhythm elements and a sprawling single player campaign. There’s a lot of humor to be found, probably due to the lead character being played by comedian Jack Black. It’s also got a lot of foul language, so be warned if that kind of thing offends your sensibilities (you get the option to add censors).In the story, you play Eddie Riggs, a heavy metal music “roadie” whose job it is to follow rock stars around fixing things and setting everything up to make the band look awesome while staying out of the spotlight himself. Through a mystical event, you are cast into the distant past (The Age of Metal) ruled by a demon named Doviculus, and inhabited mostly by monstrous creatures. The whole game has a heavy metal music theme, including rock concert battles, playing music to cast spells (kind of like songs in Ocarina of Time), and a lot of cameo appearances by famous rock musicians. Most of the gameplay is straightforward third person hack slash where you use your trusty axe and just swing until the enemy is dead (you can buy more special attacks later on). You also have a magic guitar to play songs for special effects, and as the story progresses you learn more and more songs to play. You also spend a lot of time driving around the open world in a car that you can summon (one of the first songs you learn). Like with most open world games, this means that the map is filled with optional missions and racing minigames, as well as artifacts that you can find for “fire tributes.” Fire tributes are the “money” of the game, and despite the game playing like an RPG, you don’t level up or get experience when fighting. You acquire the fire tributes and spend them on power ups and cosmetics for your character. One note that I’ll make is that a lot of the purchasable items are unlocked as the main story progresses, so don’t bother doing all the missions and hunting down collectibles too early in the game, since you won’t be able to buy much anyways until later on.Pros:+Despite not having the greatest graphics, it is clear that the game developers spent a lot of time on the scenery and overall game world. The main characters may look cartoony, but the otherworldly environment is great. If you’ve played Just Cause 2, you should know what that’s like (gameplay graphics better than cutscene graphics). If you enjoy rock music, you’ll be in for a treat as well. Driving along with the soundtrack is pretty fun.+The game’s story is engaging and well written. Since the game world is so different from our own, the writers were free to come up with some interesting villains and history. Maybe you don’t like Jack Black’s style of comedy, but I thought it worked well with this particular game. He’s probably better known for childish humor/movies, but Brutal Legend has some mature themes.Cons:-As with many games of this type (open-world) there are a huge number of collectibles to be found and if you’re like me you probably don’t want to go out of your way searching for them after the game’s story is over. It turns out that you won’t have enough money to buy all the upgrades unless you hunt down most of the collectibles. There’s no easy way to do it either, even with an online guide because the game’s world map is kind of weak.-One weird thing I noticed is that the game never actually tells you how to unlock some of these collectibles (using fire spells or thunder clap skills). I had to look it up online. This is a minor gripe though, since most collectibles just give you some fire tributes to spend. I was able to beat the game my first playthrough without buying much. The majority of purchasable items are cosmetic.Overall, if you liked action adventure games such as Darksiders, but thought they would be better with more humor and less hardcore fighting, you may enjoy Brutal Legend. The game doesn’t take itself seriously, and the silly ways that rock music is woven into the story/gameplay will likely bring an occasional smile to your face.  "

												Maybe I'm nostalgic, or maybe I'm a sucker for Jack Black's VO's, or maybe I'm just a göddamn shameless Tim Schafer fan (second only to Will Wright, he's right up there with the demigods of gaming!), but Brütal Legend (WITH A GÖDDAMN UMLAUT!) holds a REALLY special spot in my heart. Yeah, the gameplay isn't exactly stellar, and there's a good few bugs, but by the fiery breath of Ormagöden, this game still kicks äss on so many levels, it puts both Duke Nukem 3D, Doom 1 AND 2 as well as Serious Sam 1 to shame! The music is brilliantly chosen, and normally I focking despise Dragonforce for being the most ludicrously shïtty band to ever reach fame 'n' fortune in the world of rock and metal since cover-Metallica, but the way their tune played during that one scene in the game... I dunno. It struck a chord inside me. Yeah. I'm making music refs now. Deal with it.Moving on! The humour is in the usual Tim Schafer style, but with the added- yeah, I can't write this with a straight face, but the added ""maturity"" of it all (sexual references, profanity, shït like that), somehow makes it all the funnier. Sure, you can choose to bleep it out with censoring and shït, if you're a weak-äss little püssy! But seriously, hearing Jack Black cuzzin' out a dumbäss teen-band member for doing the Bobby Zilch dance on top of a flimsily built stage prop... golden. Just golden. 9.2/10			"

												Some games are made so that you can mindlessly mow down hordes of generic whatsits with your fat, noisy bullet-hose.This is not one of them.Some games are made so that you press A repeatedly in a series of menus so that you can watch your numbers go up every now and then.This is not one of them.Some games are really boring.This is not one of them.This game is an inspirational, madcap epic - in the proper sense of the word.  A single individual against vast and innumerable odds, conquering his way through adversity with nothing short of awe-inspiring trenchancy.  Weild thunder and lightning?  Check.  Throw fireworks?  Check.  Use a guitar as a magical death-array?  Bam, done.  Slaughter enemies with a souped-up motor-car forged by The Ozz of Metal?  Go ♥♥♥♥ing crazy.This is a game that you do not soon forget.  This is a game where they've taken a masterpiece setting and given it a thick, heavy pulse, full of grit and power.  This is a game, ladies and gentlemen, that properly represents the spirit of Metal. Should you thirst for blood and lightning, for power and amazement, for a five-star cast and white-knuckle writing, then spend your money on this fantastic game.  Play it, enjoy it, and cherish it.  It's well worth your time.			"

The metal queen itself can be put down some times, but every time climbing on the net and comming down to kill you again. No matter if you blast her when the lid is open or try something else.

												I feel sad for not liking this game. It is a double fine title, and they normally make very interesting games with great designs and a good setting. This also has a very good visual design, and it have taught me that I really like metal, when it does not include growling, because it sounds like a hungover bear, who occasionally beats his wife. So it haves a great soundtrack with a great design for every creature and the whole world. It also wants to do a lot of things, because it combines open world, hack and slash, racing and real time strategy, and it really destroys every aspect of it. The hack and slash is the best part of it. It only needs two buttons on the mouse to fight and there are some combos and such. It does however just become repetetive and easy, since there are not really any major penalty for death. Then there is the RTS which is just take all your soldiers and destroy things you hate. You just wins anyway, because you chop them up with your axe or drive them over with your car, which brings me to the racing and driving. That is seriously the worst, since your car controls like an♥♥♥♥♥ Good luck with making a turn without ♥♥♥♥ing up. And there are missions where you have to shoot things while driving, and you cannot hit it. The open world is not that great either. It just feels like a very annoying break between missions. Sure there are collectibles and side missions, but they should just let that obtainable through menus. Worst of all, there is no ♥♥♥♥ing minimap. Every open world game needs that, because you do not want to look at your map every minute, when you are lost. The game haves a very metal design, and it is great. Combined with the good humour and Jack Black's cheery voice it do have some good moments, but the whole game is really bad. If you want a great double fine product, then buy Psychonauts, which is cheaper and have a better design. I can only recommend this to hardcore Jack Black or metal fans.			"

												Pros:— Awesome universe, beautifully crafted and immersive— Pretty good graphics— Killer soundtrack— Great scenario, with depth and twists— Delicious cameos from Lemmy, Ozzy, etc.Cons:— Frustrating controls (no jumping, no strafing, and worse: not enough responsivity...)— Too much dialogue, and it doesn't work good (the same NPC sometimes repeats the same line 10 times in 30 seconds)— Too much (useless) cutscenes, especially in the beginning— The RTS part is tedious as balls. And I say tedious, not difficult, because it's just not fun.— Way too often the game threw me into the domain of I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING. That is not a good thing.— Most objectives are absolutely unclear and the trial and error to figure out what the games wants you to do is a hassle.— The fact that there is nothing on the screen (no health meter, no map... nothing) may be ""arty"" but it doesn't help and makes the game even more confusing.Conclusion: What would have made an absolutely awesome movie makes a game that is okay at best. The fact that the gameplay is a blend of various genres is nice, but not well done. The artistic part is AMAZING, but the gameplay is just not good.5/10.			"

												First you’ve got to understand that this game is a pool of bugs and glitches, nothing game breaking but when they pile up, all that stick to your memory is a terrible experience.First with the technical bugs, I got the sound not working for me until I figured out what’s the problem, the controller was a mess, when you press a button it input another button for some reason, I wasted hours trying to figure out what’s the problem, I even contacted the support twice but they didn’t respond, I had to learn the hard way that the controller would only work if you’re in the big picture mode in steam, I really don’t understand why but that is exactly what happened.Second is in game bugs, the game keep stuttering even though my pc could easily handle it on maximum settings, and for some weird reason every time you view a landmark the whole UI glitches and you have to restart the game.As for the game itself it has a lot of pros and but more cons, the concept is one of a kind, a metal heaven with some real time strategy, hack and slash and fun, Jack Black is freaking awesome here, as well as all of the other characters, top notch voice acting, great music, beautiful world (slightly small for my taste), badass humor, driving and upgrading a badass car, fly around and admiring the color patterns, I also like the way they ask you at the beginning of the game if you want gore and profanity, it’s so seamless I wish some games would offer similar things, I credit this game for that.The cons are major, for example the game is a mess, you wouldn’t really tell where are your enemies and where is your army, they all look the same from above, no way to tell what’s your current health and what not, too many insufficient mechanics that confused me so much, I don’t think I have the attention span to learn everything, the game is not deserving, it’s not long and rich enough to be worth it in my opinion, this game is just a pack of mess.All in all I don’t recommend this game, the first impression was awesome, but after 7 hours of playing it left a sour taste in my mouth, I really can’t stand playing this game even though I wish I really got into because I loved the idea so much, I just couldn’t even finish this game, I give this game a terrible 3 out of 10.

												I wish there were more games like this, with metal. It makes everything so epic ( kinda like Wagner's music ). And even if Metal is my favorite genre, I still discovered some bands I didn't know ( like Lita Ford, fell in love with this chick <3 ).Now the game itself maybe lacks good gameplay, it's repetitive, the world doesn't have much to explore ( I mean, compared with other open worlds like the Elder Scrolls, Gothic or even GTA ), and I stopped playing it after some hours, never finished it.BUT it's worth it, just for the music, characters and voice acting. Now I wish someone would make an epic metal RPG with Vikings and nordic mythology, where you can battle powerful creatures while listening to Manowar and other bands like this.""666/10, Brutal"" - Nathan Explosion approved.

												I wish there were more games like this, with metal. It makes everything so epic ( kinda like Wagner's music ). And even if Metal is my favorite genre, I still discovered some bands I didn't know ( like Lita Ford, fell in love with this chick <3 ).Now the game itself maybe lacks good gameplay, it's repetitive, the world doesn't have much to explore ( I mean, compared with other open worlds like the Elder Scrolls, Gothic or even GTA ), and I stopped playing it after some hours, never finished it.BUT it's worth it, just for the music, characters and voice acting. Now I wish someone would make an epic metal RPG with Vikings and nordic mythology, where you can battle powerful creatures while listening to Manowar and other bands like this.""666/10, Brutal"" - Nathan Explosion approved.

												My only complaint about this game was it was too short and didn't get a sequel.  I own it on 360 which is where all my playtime of it is,  I bought it on steam because it is just that good.  The comedy alone makes it worth 15 dollars.  But if you can get it on sale you won't be disappointed.  The soundtrack also makes it worth 15 dollars btw.			"

Good deal of humor and funny game play.I woundnt say its very deep game with lots of play time , rather its good game for some quick entertainment.Soundtracks are great imao. graphics are ok , and game plays are quite satisfying as long as you re not comparing more serious games like shadows of mordor or something.However i must admit I was pleasantly suprised by the game the way they presented the ""experince"" The drawbacks will be little crappy controls, slightly lack of contents considering the price tag.Overall as long as you expect too much about the game , this game will rocks. and its pretty good game			"

												Ummmm. You know what. I don't like it. Maybe it's because I'm not a metal fan.Gameplay-wise, it's a very generic action game with a rather empty open world, plus some combat combos. But that's about all. Tried to beat the game several times, everytime I couldn't stand the repetitiviness and yup, back in the shelf it goes.In terms of soundscape this game does a decent job though, which I can't deny. Metal lovers will love the guitar riffs and overall metal themed BGMs and effects.The voice overs are very good also, just don't expect telltale-tier VOs and you will be fine.I don't get it why so many people are recommending this. Perhaps the abundance of metal music references keep people interested. I really don't know.			"

Brütal Legend wants to be an ode to metal while being a fun game to play. At times it feels like the world collide good enough to be enjoyable, but as a game it doesn't work as well as it should.The Good:· Introduces gamers to metal and vice versa. If you're a fan of both, you will love this for sure.· Great voice acting, including Jack Black among others.· Creative environmental design...The Bad:· ... but the world itself feels flat and empty. Everything metal-esque is squeezed together in a little enivorment or area, but everything around that feels like a flat world with some stones here and there. It's an open world that doesn't need to be there, but one that exists simply to boost the scale and to keep you busy while going from A to B.· Even though it's sweet to melt the faces of headbangers, the combat feels dull, repetetive and generally useless. There are basic axe-swinging attacks, then there's thunder and lightning to damage your enemies from a small distance. Besides that and some special guiter solo's, that's it. · The enemies have no health bar and neither do you. It feels like you're just mashing buttons to see which one of you drops dead first. Your screen will start flashing if you're nearing death, but by that time it's either too late for you to flee away and keep some distance for a few seconds to do it over again. Some people say the combat is difficult, but I say there isn't enough information given on your screen to know just what you're doing.· The story, albeit filled with iconic characters from the metal world, is dull and uninterresting. The familiar faces are the only reasons to sit through it until the very end.The Ugly:· The game isn't very pretty, but good enough to do the job. Nothing too dated, nothing too superb, just okay. The character models and filled environments are a clever mix between fantasy and rock that helps to make Brütal Legend a little bit more interresting.Final verdict:If you're a metal fan and ejoy the occasional video game, definately get this. If you're the other way around, like myself, then don't. It's 75% metal and 25% game, and Double Fine should have taken another direction with Brütal Legend. It's bigger than it needs to be, but not figuratively big enough to fit in all the potential.5/10			"

												The game is sort of alright. A hack n slash with rts elements.I thought this would be a fun game, but it's onlysort of fun, with fun characters, but sort of does not cut it for me. There are too many things wrong with this game that make it unenjoyable.The car controls are absolutely terrible with bad camera angle, you can hardly see where you're going most of the time. Same with combat, that feels clunky and terrible also.Because of this I had to do the bridge section several times and then listen to the same dialogue repeated again each time you fail.I tried to give the game a chance and keep playing, but I don't like it, Iam not a fan of metal, but thought the game looked like fun,  it's not though, the gameplay is half arsed and just feels strange. The game is repetitive, slow paced and boring overall.I only like the crazy characters and dialogue, but without good gameplay the game isn't worth it and it's hard to keep playing just for the characters.I'd say this game is for heavy metal fans only, most things about the game just seems stupid.I got this game on special for $2.49 USD and this game is not even worth getting on special, I wont bother wasting my time playing it anymore even if it was free.Don't recommend this game 4/10 bad. Avoid unless you're a headbanger.			"

												This game escaped my review for some time due to the fact that I'm never going to finish it. While I do like Jack Black, even in the Neverending Story III, this is an atrocity of a game. I guess it has some elements of an open world RPG/action game. There are some bosses. I don't even know. The whole thing was so boring and stupid. If this game had just picked a genre it wouldn't have been so bad. Instead there's a good bit of action, then a bit of rpg, then a bit of racing, then a bit of real time strategy with absolutely no controls, then a bit of the most annoying quests ever, then maybe some open world exploration for no reason at all? If this game had possibly decided to be one of these things it might have been good. Instead it's just a confused mashup of random elements of other games. I bought it mainly cause it was $2.Not worth it imo.			"

												Not bad for a third person action game but much better titles exist. Darksiders 2 immediately comes to mind. This is still a fun game with pretty decent gameplay though. Being a fan of hardcore metal and deathcore, I despise the music in this game. I bought it for the gameplay though so it is tolerable. Jack Black does good voice work in this game and it is fun to run around killing things and doing missions. The graphics are below average but the game has good art design. Combat is a little janky but still works good enough. The game could have been optimized better as it gets a few stutters here and there but nothing that really detracts much from the core gameplay. Car handling pretty much blows. Controlling minions is easy and combat is pretty straight forward. The game may not have the depth or overall fun factor of much better third person action games but it doesn't take itself seriously it tries to have fun and crack a few jokes so it is decent for one play through.6/10 a good deal at $5 or less.

												Tim Schfer the Mastermind behind the cult hit classic Psychonaut did it again with another Double Fine Masterpiece. Brutal Legend.This game has nearly everything a Heavy Metal follower would enjoy. It has Metal. It has rock star cameos everywhere, it has action, drama, Real Time Strategy, Music, comedy and such a compelling storyline that you would go deeper and deeper to learn everything about the world of Brutal Legend.Why should you NOT get this Amazing work of Art? To put it straight you would be amazed by such detail and art that was put into this game to cater to a wide range of Rock enthusists.  To date this game has one of the most Licensed Metal/Rock Songs to date in this EA title. Sure EA as a company is pretty bad but Double Fine has talent that is not to be overlooked.Buy at full price and you will not be regretting it. Buy it at sales and you would be getting a treat for how massive it is!If you enjoy Real Time Strategy, then Stage battles are definately quite an attracting part of it.One gripe I do have though......How come only in the Stage Battles that you are only able to fly while on the Map you cannot? I guess it has to do with glitches/exploits I suppose. Nevertheless. Very graphic Heavy and intense you best have a PC strong enough with enough of processing power to run it.Best First purchase on Steam that I never regretted. Thank you DoubleFine for such an amazing title!			"

												As a preface: I'm not sure if my computer was meant to play this game.I saw Jack Black in the opening of the game. He's hilarious. Surely the game has to be good. And it was, up until I met this strange lady who the main character wanted too hard. I spent 4 hours on this game. 3 of them were at one part. I'm going to say up front that I'm not the best at Guitar Hero, but I play fighters, so timing buttons isn't terribly difficult. But yet, there was something going on. During the Guitar Solo portion of the game, the first one, even that only requires 4 different inputs, one of which is given to you for free, the timing wasn't right. At least, it wasn't right visually. I didn't think of doing it by ear because the sound should match up with the picture, right?I don't know, but after look up stuff on the game, I didn't find many people with my issue, so I'm pretty sure it's got to be an issue with this computer. No big deal. It did make the game frustratingly unplayable, though. Oh, and the camera.Don't get me started on the camera.Then again, it could have just been visual lag again. I don't know.What I do know, though, is that the visual lag I had in this game made everything awful. The car responded to my inputs noticeably slowly and that made the first escape the bridge sequence awful. Along with every other car-related portion of the game. Along with every portion of the game. :/			"

												Brütal Legend is a game that tries to combine hack-and-slash with real time strategy. The end result is a cluster♥♥♥♥ that lacks both the mindless brütality of butchering your way through hordes of enemies, as well as any real strategic depth. I ♥♥♥♥ing love metal, and the game's aesthetics and humor, character design, soundtrack - it's amazing. Everything about this game is amazing, except the gameplay. I really enjoyed the start of the game, where it plays solely like a hack-and-slash. Cranked up the difficulty to max and comboed my way through hordes of enemies, and fun bosses. But then the game shoves its weird psuedo-strategy thing in your face, and from that point on most of the game consists almost solely of these so-called ""stage battles"".The strategy ultimately boils down to rushing down your opponent all day every day, with one huge blob of units. Even if there was room for more elaborate strategies than ""send all the dudes forwards"", your overview of the battlefield, combined with the hectic hack-and-slash pace of it all makes it impossible to stop and focus for any given moment. You'll find yourself in a situation, then, where you're just trying to charge at enemies and at least enjoy the hack-and-slash - only to realize that everything the game has taught you so far about combos, timing your blocks, and so on, is ultimately pointless. Your only way to make any sizeable difference in a fight is to use ""Double Team"" - ie. taking control of one or several of your units and spamming their one or two attacks. At least solos are still fun.Bottom line, this game, on paper, might just be the best video game ever made. Though in practice it turns out that hack-and-slash and real time strategy simply do not blend. If we ever get a Brütal Legend which focuses solely on one type of gameplay at a time - preferrably the hack-and-slash - then I might just give the team my entire wallet and call it a day. Until then, might wanna dodge this one.			"

												Update:Thumbs down.After a dozen hours of play, technical issues and repetitive mini-games have killed my interest. I want to love this game for the theme and the aesthetic, but it just doesn't play well. The biggest problem was controller lag - there's a small but serious delay between the time that I push a button, and the time that the game responds. I've found posts from several people who also suffered from controller lag, tried their solutions, but nothing worked for me. This takes most of the fun out of the action sequences. Unfortunately, even if I'd found a solution to the lag, I think the repetitive mini-quests were just too much. How many times can I enjoy beating up the same cloned goon squad? Several. More than one.But not nearly so many times as the game seems to require.Original review:Thumbs up.If you like Jack Black or Tenacious D, then you'll like this game. If not, then you probably won't. As a fan of Tenacious D,  the style and theme of this game totally do it for me. Ever wanted to see what Rodin would do if he'd been a rocker? Then take a short hike to the guitar mountain overlook, where you can admire a gigantic slab of rock, sculpted by the Titans into the shape of pair of hands holding a guitar. Unfortunately, the gameplay is medicre, seemingly unfinished, with many of the missions being awkward or unclear. For example, there are several side-missions involving base-defense. The key to success is getting out in front of tne enemy. Unfortunately, despite cries of ""the enemy is coming!"" and ""they're behind you!"" the attacking forces are often hidden by the landscape until just before they reach your base, which means it's hard to see them in time. If there'd just been a HUD arrow, something to point out the direction of new attackers, these missions would have been far more fun.			"

												While the strategy stage fighting part of the game is a bit lackluster for me, the rest of the game with the amazingly damn good art & music & characters makes up for it. With the metal soundtrack from all over the range of heavy metal plus so many iconic landmarks in the game looking like they were painted by Frank Frazetta & put on a heavy metal album just oozes with so much rich atmosphere that you have to see it. Also Ozzy is quite amusing in the game playing himself & definitely one of my favorites from Double Fine that I bought it on PC after playing a ton of it on the Xbox 360, works great with a controller here too. The intro with Jack Black is a fun little bit too. And lastly, the best way is done at the start to gauge how much language or violence you want in a game instead of just a button in the options. So go get some heavy metal in your life with this game!			"

												Wasn't interested in Brutal Legend beforehand. Got the game through Humble Bundle and tried it out. The story seemed alright, similar to what I'd expect from a Jack Black-metal-fantasy movie.The gameplay is terrible. I highly doubt I will ever finish this game. If I ever play it again, it'll be for the Steam Trading Cards.			"

												I can't say this is the greatest game I've played nor does it even come close but it did revive my love for heavy metal. The sound track is amazing and it brings back alot of those good memories of being in a highschool garage band with long hair and not a care in the world. If you're not buying this game for nostalgia purposes than the story line comes off unbearably cheesy and the game play and graphics aren't really anything to wow about. The boss fights give it some depth along with the cast of special guest but other than that theres not alot going for it.			"

												Welcome to the Age of Metal, a time before Modern Man.When you first play the game, you might think it's a simple Action-Adventure game, continue playing and you'll find out it's actually a Open-World Action-Adventure game with vehicles and Real Time Strategy.A non-conventional mixing of gameplay, but Double Fine managed to pull it off surprisingly well.The game world is based around it's own Heavy Metal inspired mythology, with a full backstory, and the world filled with such things as trees with mufflers acting as branches, volcanoes with liquid metal as lava, and metal spiders that spin bass strings.The main missions in the game advance the story and has you fighting three factions in your quest to free Man, the missions involve you doing a array of tasks to increase your own faction and unlock new units, along  with doing RTS battles. The game also includes side missions, involving simply defeating a herd of enemies, using your car as a mounted gun, or even racing.On foot the game is pretty standard, with you having two weapons: a Axe for melee attacks and a Guitar that you can do more range attacks like setting enemies on fire and lighting, along with combining them for some combo moves. You can also use your car to go around places, which also contains two weapons, though they can be swapped for more varied types. The rts portion of the game involves you commanding units on foot and in the air (as your character gets the ability to fly with wings), and capture Fans (which show up as vents you have to build Merch Booths on) which you use to get more units and ultimate destroy your enemy's stage.There is also a bunch of stuff to find across the world, giving you more Fire Tributes (used to buy upgrades for yourself and your car), backstory ,or new abilities in the form of playable songs.The game also feels quite short and cut back though, the ending comes rather fast, as a bunch of content was cut including a fourth faction.Overall the game is worth playing, even if you aren't a big fan of metal.

Graphics and the world of Brutal Legend are fantastic. Pretty much captured the 80's metal scene in one game.Although I enjoy the themes and etc, the gameplay is poorly done. The RTS elements are put in at extremely weird places and are harder to use. The mini games are bland and couldn't be more boring. In my opinion this is a game you play once for a couple hours then set to the side. Overall 5/10.			"

												Short version: Good writing, bad controls, and buggy. Get for a console, or avoid entirely.Long version: Brutal Legend is a well written game with a clever spin on the usual hero's journey story arc, with a self-aware sense of humor that makes even some of the failures funny. And that's the good news.Bad news is that the gameplay itself is quite bad. First, you'd best have a controller, because Keyboard/mouse is basically impossible (Even the tutorial is for controller). Moving and attacking are sluggish, you fight the camera more than most enemies, trying to drive is a joke (and don't even think about racing), and the graphics will chuck often, even on a high-end PC.And here's the real kicker. It's unplayable on high-end PCs. There's a bug that crashes when the game clashes with many graphics cards, most of them fairly good. The fix seems to be to UNDERclock your card/system. Yeah, no. I shouldn't need to make my PC worse to play a game. And at this point, there's pretty much no chance of a bug fix for it.With the bug aside, it's a mediocre game that deserved better than what it got. 6.5/10 for the writing and style, but major points lost for the gameplay itself. And then the bugs just add to it. Get it for a console if you really still want this game. The PC version is just another lazy port.			"

												There is something weird about this game, it really makes you *want* to like it. It has a fun story, characters and setting and if you can  get it cheap (I picked it up in a humble bundle) it's probably worth a play through. The problem is it's also a bit crap. It tries to be an epic hack and slash adventure, a driving game, an rts, and a teeny bit of rhythm game thrown in for good measure... and in the end it means that it does none of these things particularly well. The UI occasionally breaks and basic touches that would have made certain things so much more livable and which are present in their other games... just weren't there. If you just want to play through, it's a shortish varied game working on the basis that stuff is awesome and you should come along for the ride. If you're looking for something more in depth, there are better options out there.			"

With rising game difficulty you bascically play against the camera and movement, and it gets more and more frustrating, while the game itself is just dull and offers nothing aside from some funny dialogues.I'm now at a point where it gets downward unplayable because of camera issues and I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore.

												I try to only write reviews for games I've finished but I can't really bring myself to finish or really play much more of Jack Black the game.  For me the game suffers from not really knowing what it wants, its not going to be a hack and slash, or a sandbox/ exploraton game and its not really a good enough RTS to try to claim to be that either.  All the pieces were in place but they didnt really end up fitting together like they needed to which is a shame.  Story wise I quite enjoyed what I saw, I got a few smirks out of the humor and it wasn't taking itself seriously enough to not make fun of how dumb it was, which really worked for it.  The soundtrack is worth mentioning as it is amazing, truly wonderful in my opinion:  all the clasic metal you could want or tolerate at all the right times.  The art style too is not bad, the disproportionate characters and the metal world all look really nice and are fun to see and explore.  But it all comes back to gameplay and I just can't handle it.  I've fought my way through worse games before but theres just something so unappealing to me about this game that I can't go on with it.  But maybe you can, I don't know, this really does seem to be one of those games that people either love or can't make up their minds either way about.  I didn't like it but I can see why some people might, if you want to listen to metal and Jack Black going nuts and aren't bothered by average gameplay then you might get more out of this then me.

												Who is this Game For?==================People who like Heavy Metal, Jack Black and like the idea of it's psdo hybrid RTS, hack'n'slash brawler. Even then, Jack Black and Heavy Metal can only carry this game so far.Is it good?=================It’s a failure. While historically that accusation is because it confusingly turns from a hack’n'slash brawler into an RTS about three hours in, that’s not really the problem here. The issue is that Brütal Legend is an idea in search of a game design. In fact, it’s even more nebulous than that: it’s raw enthusiasm in search of a game design.Does it have any problems?========================Brütal Legend on the PC seems like a huge missed opportunity to really refine the gameplay to make an all-around better game. There could have been quickbars to access powers instead of using a radial menu system, click-to-move mouse support, the ability to select individual units with the right-mouse button, and overall better camera controls and a mini-map. In other words, this could've been much more than a straightforward port. This game is not the best of ports and is riff with plently of problems. I would recommend checking out the PC Wiki before buying.(http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Br%C3%BCtal_Legend)Final Thoughts!====================I want to go nuts. I’m just not sure that ropey, weightless buggy-driving, RTS army control that doesn’t go any deeper than essentially Everyone Go Over There and a spectacular open world where you die if you touch water and the only thing to do outside of the storyline is cloned minigames offers me the scope to go nuts that it thinks it does.

												The game might have big names in it such as ""Dio"", ""Ozzy"" and ""Jack Black"" and the story in itself isn't that bad I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone.- The game might be fun for some time. But if you want to play it through you really need the nerves for it.- The game is extremly annoying facing the part that you first think you play a hack-and-slay (It still is partly h&s), but you're actually playing a base-defense game. Commanding units, sending them to special places. Tear down buildings.It might sound funny but it pisses you off when you have to play a mission over and over until you find out what to do at some points.The commanding system isn't that good either, you have to play stupid♥♥♥♥♥riffs to summon your car and do other things.It is fun for a short periode but not on the long run.

												Urgh.Excellent job on the humour, nice enough graphics, stupid plot but then that's part of the charm.But then.. The game play begins to suck. It's the uncomfortable blend of 3rd person view, guitar riffs & directing troops as an RTS that kills it. I just didn't want to be bothered with the larger battles, it's just a chore of dealing with the fact you need to be near troops to direct them, but you need to be in the air to get an overview, then you need to keep landing and playing riffs all the time. It probably sounds ok, but it just feels clunky and tedious to play.Press tab to do this, Q to do those, 1 to 4 to do those, F to fly and land, don't forget your mouse combo's in fights .. pfft.It's difficulty is fairly low, so even with the tortured interface you will probably win the fights, but it somehow isn't fun.You might like it, it's not horribly horrible, just annoyingly tedious. Maybe controller based folk find it easier. It's a pain on PC keyboard & mouse though.Sad face. It started with such a lot of promise as well.			"

												Tim Schafer's brilliance is hidden beneath Jack Black's painfully unfunny creative control (coming from a person who enjoyed some of his films).  It seems like the high cost of licensing all the top chart metal hits and guest appearances from...everyone...sucked up the funding for the actual gameplay, which is garbage.  I see potential for a unique and entertaining hack-n-slash if they had expanded on it a bit more, but the subpar RTS elements make it nearly unplayable.A neat idea wrapped in a quilt sewn of poop.

												Developer Tim Schafer has been delivering funny games for the past two decades, but none of them have enjoyed the marketing push of Brutal Legend. Gaming's best kept secret has been given the limelight. Has Schafer and his studio Double Fine created something worthy of all this attention?Oh, hell yeah. This is one of the best games I've played all year and it provides something we don't find often enough in this industry: a unique experience. I'm pretty sure you've never played a game quite like this before. True, a game needs to be more than ""different"" to work -- it has to be fun. And Brutal Legend is a lot of fun.It all kicks off with a hilarious intro poking fun at the softer, more mainstream direction heavy metal has taken in the past couple decades. Brutal Legend is front heavy with the humor stuff, though. While the first half hour will have you shooting milk through your nose, the laughs eventually taper off leaving you with a story that is rich and bizarre but lacking in the bite of the opening scenes. Brutal Legend is a celebration of classic heavy metal and takes every cheap shot it can at hair metal, nu metal, and other diluted variations on the genre. While the ultimate evil and its minions are truly terrible monsters, the lesser bad guys are made up to resemble glam rockers or emo kids. It will appeal most to those that spent at least some of their formative years as angsty headbangers although it isn't exclusionary.Brutal Legend lives up to its name: there is plenty of delightful gore to be found here, although the cartoon art style softens the effect. Heads are chopped off, blood is splattered, and faces melted, but it's all in good fun. The game is rated M for Mature, so theoretically if you're playing you're old enough to appreciate that sort of thing, but regardless you can choose to turn the gore on or off at any time. That might be a handy feature if you have kids that wander into the room from time to time while you're playing. The same can be done with the game's harsh language -- you'll even get the classic Parental Advisory sticker over any middle fingers that are flipped. Not to mention free  DLC for the steam port			"

												Brütal Legend is a game where you star as Jack Bla- er, Eddie Riggs, a roadie for the worst metal band in history. He longs for the time when metal meant something, where it was hardcore, and worth banging your head to. But these days? People like him are stuck to just being the clean-up crew for today’s “metal."" The story starts out with him doing just that, but a part of the stage falls apart, crushing Eddie, causing blood to drip into his belt buckle……Which summons a massive fire beast that brings Eddie to the Brütal Land, which is (as Ben “Yahtzee"" Croshaw puts it) a “cross between Narnia and Ozzfest."" Brütal Legend features a whole world full of the cliches of the age of metal, from its characters to its styles. Later on in the story, you face off against other factions that represent different sub-genres of rock: glam metal, punk rock, and deathcore. A bit a ways into the game, you find out that the game isn’t just an open-world game with hack’n’slash combat… A lot of missions are also RTS’s (real time strategies). These are called stage battles, where you send units from your stage to go attack enemy units, and tear down their stage. You do a lot of these, but it’s still entertaining to send out Headbangers (troops that spent their whole lives mining by banging their heads, until they all have inhumanly thick necks)  and Metal Beasts (massive, feline beasts that breath fire, tamed by women that look like Amazons, but from KISS) and watch them tear up enemy troops. Eddie Riggs is still often an entertaining character, dishing out lines that would normally seem annoying and a bit childish, but Jack Black delivers them wonderfully.Gameplay wise, the game is subpar. It’s not necessarily bad, but it feels obviously unpolished. Additionally, some features you have to find yourself (such as where to upgrade your weapons/vehicle), the game giving no clue on what/where it is. But the unique setting, entertaining characters, and twisty story make up for it. I’d definitely recommend Brütal Legend.			"

												While the graphics are designed to be of a lower key than most, once you really discover the heart of this game, all of the imperfections (if you found any) will slide straight past you.It may not fit all gamers, but I really found and amazing game in Brutal Legend. With an excellent selection of Metal well threaded into it, this really feels like more of a music video than a game; and wreaking havoc by slamming some strings? This has gotta be one of my all time favourites.Besides, it has Jack Black voicing the main character: it deserves 11/10 just for that.			"

												Very short game. About 4 hours for main story line. Lots of side quests but a bit repetive. It has that ""Portal"" problem where the gameplay mechanics are great but it is a short lived game. If you are concerned about content, it is not a Christian friendly game. You have an option to turn off swear words (they get beeped out) and reduce gore (no blood). With that said, you still have pagan symbols and Lucifer hand salutes everywhere. If this doesn't bother you, it's an excellent game. With that said, if you are trying to filter out negative energy, this is something you should avoid. The story line is pretty good. It has a freedom fighter type of feel to it. Worth playing if you can overlook the main down points.			"

												Liked the player character and music. Bad controls combined with timed vehicle racing mandatory missions are terrible. Would be good if it was just fighting levels, but the timed vehicle stuff just sucks. Very annoying to progress and a ton of steam cards to collect, was annoying just to get all the cards.			"

												As a game, Brutal Legend really is terrible. Yet I have to recommend it. First, the bad: Ill-concieved game mechanics, buggy interface, clunky controls. I have a high tolerance for wierdness --- Giants: Citizen Kabuto is one of my favorite games of all time, and Brutal Legend, to its credit, immediately brought Giants to mind --- so don't take my criticism as coming from someone who wants developers to play it safe. Brutal Legend takes bold chances, and makes bold choices, and fails in almost every respect mechanic-wise. In the last 20 minutes of play, I've driven off a hidden cliff twice, gotten stuck in a polygon once, and, just before writing this review, my game crashed to desktop. Just after this review, however, I'm going right back in. Why? It's because in everything else that Brutal Legend does it does them so well that it's hard to imagine any improvements. Jack Black shines, the soundtrack is excellent, the colorful character designs are really fun. No spoilers: Watch for the first appearance of the a main enemy about five or six story missions in. Back in the day, we'd call this game a ""must rent,"" with all that implies. It simply would not be worth a purchase because of its many flaws, but it does everything else so well that it's worth experiencing. It's the sort of game which would shine on a Let's Play, or in machinima. Simultaneously, it's the sort of game which even if you see all it has to offer, you'll want to send the developer some cash just for the wildness of the ride and the execution of all it does well. Thanks to Steam sales and Humble Bundle packaging, you can pick it up for a few dollars, and it will be a well-spent few dollars.			"

												Very short game. About 4 hours for main story line. Lots of side quests but a bit repetive. It has that ""Portal"" problem where the gameplay mechanics are great but it is a short lived game. If you are concerned about content, it is not a Christian friendly game. You have an option to turn off swear words (they get beeped out) and reduce gore (no blood). With that said, you still have pagan symbols and Lucifer hand salutes everywhere. If this doesn't bother you, it's an excellent game. With that said, if you are trying to filter out negative energy, this is something you should avoid. The story line is pretty good. It has a freedom fighter type of feel to it. Worth playing if you can overlook the main down points.			"

												First off, yes I do recommend this game, but only to the following people :-Fans of Tim Schafer and previous Double Fine games-Fans of heavy metal musicThat being said Brutal Legend is a hybrid between action/adventure and real time strategy. You play Eddie Riggs (voiced by Jack Black), a roadie who, after an accidental sacrifice of blood, is transported to the land of Metal. It's inhabitants are living in squalor and fear of an oppressive emperor, Doviculus.The journey toward restoring freedom to this land will be filled with many locales, enemies and varied missions. In addition, you will be able to upgrade your car in the motor forges, unearth statues which will unlock new songs to listen to while driving, learn guitar solos that comes with various effects and so on.Pros :-Story and dialogue is top notch-The world is filled with lore and great ideas. The attention given to the details is   exceptionnal-Fans of metal will feel right at home, others might be put off-Songlist is long and covers all the main metal subgenresCons :-Gameplay is underwhelming in every aspects, combat feels tame and upgrades don't seem   to deepened it at all-Anyone who has played at least one mediocre RTS will rage over the RTS elements present   in the gameplay. They are clunky and some basics are not even present-Tad too long-Achievements are mostly grindyFinal :Clearly a labor of love, this game is for fans of Schafer/Double Fine and Metal music (or both such as myself), a shining example of ""better than the sum of it's part"". Nevertheless if you are not a fan stay clear 8.5/10			"

												Much of the enjoyment of the game is the music selection and orchestration. I have youtube playthroughs of many of the missions (sadly a lot were hit with claims, but w/e) and in putting them together I'm struck by how appropriate the music choices are for the sequences.It's not *just* heavy metal in the soundtrack, but it is all essentially rock. And it's *always* appropriate.The story is well written. Virtually all the stories in Tim Schafer games are excellent. The gameplay can feel repetative because it's not a hardcore brawler or a hardcore RTS or a hardcore pikmin/overlord. It has all of these bits that come together with lots of diverse forms of play. The open world combat spans the gamut from ""yeah, I can solo this easy"" to ""omg run away!"" There are small encounter missions with minigames and just out-and-out combat. There's lots of landmarks to find that explain the world and lore.I daresay you can liken it to the GTA/SR games. They're terrible driving games. They're terrible shooters. They're terrible at everything *except* writing and providing a vast world to explore and screw around in. In sum, though, it provides a fun experience.If you actually *hate* rock music, it's possible you have a bad time. Not because the game depends on it, but because Brutal Legend also draws on a lot of the same tropes. The landscapes are out of metal covers from the 70s and 80s. The backstory *is* Metal. I think, though, if you're open enough to playing the game at all, you'll be fine with it.I *love* this game. ffs... I figure out tabs for some of the music from the OST.I think you'll be able to get over your ""not a fan""ness of metal and enjoy the game.One last thing, if you love Jack Black, you'll be a bit disappointed, as his character is not as Jack Black as some Jack Blacks you might have seen. If you hate Jack Black, you'll be happy to know that his character is not as Jack Black as some of the Jack Blacks you might have seen.			"

												As a game, Brutal Legend really is terrible. Yet I have to recommend it. First, the bad: Ill-concieved game mechanics, buggy interface, clunky controls. I have a high tolerance for wierdness --- Giants: Citizen Kabuto is one of my favorite games of all time, and Brutal Legend, to its credit, immediately brought Giants to mind --- so don't take my criticism as coming from someone who wants developers to play it safe. Brutal Legend takes bold chances, and makes bold choices, and fails in almost every respect mechanic-wise. In the last 20 minutes of play, I've driven off a hidden cliff twice, gotten stuck in a polygon once, and, just before writing this review, my game crashed to desktop. Just after this review, however, I'm going right back in. Why? It's because in everything else that Brutal Legend does it does them so well that it's hard to imagine any improvements. Jack Black shines, the soundtrack is excellent, the colorful character designs are really fun. No spoilers: Watch for the first appearance of the a main enemy about five or six story missions in. Back in the day, we'd call this game a ""must rent,"" with all that implies. It simply would not be worth a purchase because of its many flaws, but it does everything else so well that it's worth experiencing. It's the sort of game which would shine on a Let's Play, or in machinima. Simultaneously, it's the sort of game which even if you see all it has to offer, you'll want to send the developer some cash just for the wildness of the ride and the execution of all it does well. Thanks to Steam sales and Humble Bundle packaging, you can pick it up for a few dollars, and it will be a well-spent few dollars.			"

												Okay, lets start off with this... It is a game about, Rock Music! Already perfect. But when you add in a comical and loveable main character played by Jack Black, a fun and quick combat system, and a completely original and random story, you have a game worth playing. Although a lot of the story can be a little confusing with the ""base building"" style fights, and the sometimes unresponsive movements can be irritating, i still like this game, despite the feeling of incompleteness. What allows you to forget this is the comedy of the game, the originality and the amazing rock music. So i have to say, this game, is amazing.			"

												Amazing     This game will always be near and dear to me, the aesthetic and atmosphere are just right, the characters are funny and exactly what they should be. The story is good, a little cheesy but that doesnt take away from the overall experience.The voice acting is great, all the recognizable voices and very stylized story telling give the game a distinct personality.The melee combat could be better and the game could do a better job at setting you up to do the right thing. Once or twice i had to look up how to progress but that just might be my short comings. i would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who wants to sit down and enjoy themselves in a non-competitive story driven third person metal comedy beat em up strategy driving game.

												An interesting game for sure as a weird mix of open world hack and slash and RTS, it's not perfect, but still tons of fun.You probably have to love Jack Black and Heavy Metal to really get the most out of Brutal Legend, but if you do, its probably worth your time.The controlls are kinda unpolished and some of the core mechanics are... just not really very good, but some how Legend is a lot more than just the sum of its parts, and its one of the few games that I would say has some real comedy to it.

												Brutal Legend-Brutal it most certainly is :)Hmmmmmm,ok,maybe its a while since this was released,but damn is it a good game.For starters,its got a bit of hack'n'slash,a little rpg,racing,rts and best of all,METAL!!!!!!!!!!!.Oh yes,and Jack Black as the main character,Eddie Riggs.You start off as a roadie at a concert,and from there are brought into a world of Metal,demons,Goths etc etc.Its your task to free the downtrodden people of this new world from the Emperor Doviculus(masterfully voiced by Tim Curry,who as usual is superb)and his minions(he he Bottom!:).The entire world is large,including some of the characters in the game.Jack Black plays Eddie exactly as you'd imagine.Larger than life,and full of attitude.And the Guardian of Metal is none other than,well,I'll let you find out yourself.Ophelia is voiced by Jennifer Hale,who has voiced a lot of other characters in other games,and damn,is she hot.Even hotter later on ;)(I meant Ophelia,though Jennifer Hale is quite hot too,in case she ever reads this :))-Most of the other main characters are easily recognizable,esp if you grew up in the 70's/80's.The music fits the game superbly,and if you like Heavy Metal and similar,you'll love this.The gameplay starts off simple enough,but once you start getting into it,as with the battle stages,it gets a bit more complex.I've only just finished the game,and I'm diving right back in for another go.This is really only a bare review,but I heartily recommend this game(until Doviculus rips it out that is).See you on the stage people!!!!

												Brütal Legend is a game where you star as Jack Bla- er, Eddie Riggs, a roadie for the worst metal band in history. He longs for the time when metal meant something, where it was hardcore, and worth banging your head to. But these days? People like him are stuck to just being the clean-up crew for today’s “metal."" The story starts out with him doing just that, but a part of the stage falls apart, crushing Eddie, causing blood to drip into his belt buckle……Which summons a massive fire beast that brings Eddie to the Brütal Land, which is (as Ben “Yahtzee"" Croshaw puts it) a “cross between Narnia and Ozzfest."" Brütal Legend features a whole world full of the cliches of the age of metal, from its characters to its styles. Later on in the story, you face off against other factions that represent different sub-genres of rock: glam metal, punk rock, and deathcore. A bit a ways into the game, you find out that the game isn’t just an open-world game with hack’n’slash combat… A lot of missions are also RTS’s (real time strategies). These are called stage battles, where you send units from your stage to go attack enemy units, and tear down their stage. You do a lot of these, but it’s still entertaining to send out Headbangers (troops that spent their whole lives mining by banging their heads, until they all have inhumanly thick necks)  and Metal Beasts (massive, feline beasts that breath fire, tamed by women that look like Amazons, but from KISS) and watch them tear up enemy troops. Eddie Riggs is still often an entertaining character, dishing out lines that would normally seem annoying and a bit childish, but Jack Black delivers them wonderfully.Gameplay wise, the game is subpar. It’s not necessarily bad, but it feels obviously unpolished. Additionally, some features you have to find yourself (such as where to upgrade your weapons/vehicle), the game giving no clue on what/where it is. But the unique setting, entertaining characters, and twisty story make up for it. I’d definitely recommend Brütal Legend.			"

												Some people say that the gameplay is boring or unbearable, but I tell you - it's playable, very playable. More like an interactive story actually. Contains many interesting ideas and quite loyal to the player, so you don't need to fear to get stuck somewhere. Just something you need to relax and play while listening best of the best of rock and metal music.P.S. I didn't expect so much black and gothic metal in the second half of the game and... thanks for Super Beast by Rob Zombie :39/10 - I could only wish some better slasher part and better physics for the vehicles...

												So this is one of my favorite games of all time.Setting: Imagine a game based on what it would be like to interact and inhabit the world that's depicted on Heavy Metal albums from the 70-80's.Imagine seeing a creature like the one depicted on Judas Priest's 'Screaming for Vengeance' or better yet, to be able to travel to the great pyramid and temples of Iron Maiden's 'Power Slave' album.Only the journey doesn't end there...imagine if this metal world was separated into different regions based on the different styles of music. An example region, Mashlands covered in a dense fog that's the home of emo-nightmare before Christmas creatures and people.Another example, imagine Amazon jungles with panthers that shoot lazers out of their eyes while being road by warrior women from KISS' album 'Love Gun'.Gameplay: The game starts out as a 3rd person hack and slash with driving and overall RPG- Action/Adventure where the hero explore this amazing world I talked about above. You soon assemble an army, from this point you become a commander and a warrior...the game then becomes a RTS. It's a very interesting shift in gameplay.Story:The story honestly reminds of something from a Black Sabbath or RUSH album. I can't put it into words without spoiling it.I think the best way to play this is jump in head first.Soundtrack: One of the greatest soundtracks out there. If you want to cut your teeth on metal, rock, or just something new for those of you who don't normally listen to heavy stuff, look no further. The soundtrack that comes with the game for $19.99 is the OST written for the game (Not the one with Ozzy, Iron Maiden, and so on) . Which I also highly recommend.Does this game have it's issues? of course but, I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone thanks to the game world, music, and it's great story.			"

												In a nutshell: You play as Jack Black driving around a Heavy Metal themed world using the Power or Rock to blow stuff up. If that alone is not enough to make you get this game then Beware the Wrath of the METAL GODS!!!Though granted the RTS elements could use a little polishing (either that or i just suck at it).			"

												An interesting game for sure as a weird mix of open world hack and slash and RTS, it's not perfect, but still tons of fun.You probably have to love Jack Black and Heavy Metal to really get the most out of Brutal Legend, but if you do, its probably worth your time.The controlls are kinda unpolished and some of the core mechanics are... just not really very good, but some how Legend is a lot more than just the sum of its parts, and its one of the few games that I would say has some real comedy to it.

												I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this game.  It was an awesome concept that was poorly done.Based off of the trailers I expected a Legend of Zelda meets metal.  Instead I found myself playing a Legend of Zelda meets metal meets Dawn of War meets GTA meets.... well you get the point.  That was of course after I spent hours trying to get it to run properly.This game just lacked direction in what it wanted to be and game play suffers for it.  The combat is meh, the battles have no real strategy, and the car... that piece of s*** CAR!  Driving controls are awful with a bad camera and the majority of the game requires you to drive.  Blasting metal tunes doesn't make it any better (which I do on my way to work in the real world).  If you're in a race and slightly bump into something (which you will cause controls suck) you might as well start over.Some positives is that the world itself is well done.  I think that's the only reason I'm still playing it.  I want to see the sights and learn the lore of world. Its clear the developers put a lot of thought and passion into it.  I get a kick every time I see Ozzy Osbourne as the Guardian of Metal and the cut scenes are also fun to watch.  I can see that they thought it was epic enough to support different genres in one game.  They needed to just stick to one and develop it far enough to add epic game play to this epic world.If you want to check it out, I would wait till its on sale.  When you get mad at it, you wont feel even angrier for paying full price.			"

												This game, I love it and it kinda translates this into the real world.The main story is about heavy metal (good music) is dieing from p*ssy rockband music and you have to bring back heavy metal and defeat the evil guy or whatever he is called (can't remember atm)However unlike the game, good music is dieing (Like queen) and p*ssy rockbands are on the rise (One Direction) yeah hate on me you 1D fans, its true that they say they are a ""Rock band"" while they play sh*t love songs. *Edit* Also I learned that they diden't sing for a young girl who had cancer and only 8 weeks to live, she was a fan of them, knew all the songs of by heart etc and they diden't play because they wasn't getting payed... can somebody shoot these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s?

												The voice acting is both sirprisingly and unsurprisingly bad.  Surprisingly because you would think that Jack Black would do a better job.  But unsurprisingly because a large group of the voice actors are not actually actors at all.  The graphics are a bit sub par on this game to be completely honest.  BUT that being said, it's one of the best features of the game.  The glitchy graphics make even the most serious cutscenes hilarious when girls' hair flies everywhere or their breasts jerk upward for no reason.  Other than that, this is one of my favorite games.  The gameplay is enjoyable, the open world that has been created is really cool, the characters are great, the corny humor is tastefully corny, but most importantly, the concept and plot are absolutly amazing.  It's a hidden gem in my opinion.			"

												Jack Black's performance and the writing are SUPERB! Soundtrack is great, gameplay for first 1/3 of game is good 3rd person action/slasher. Last 2/3 are where it gets decidedly different and departs from that formula. It turns into a watered down RTS. Now I'm not one for RTS games (last RTS I enjoyed was Kohan in 2000) but this is not a bad thing. It's done well enough that the game still holds together well, and you control everything from above the field while still controlling your character. You can drop down to fight with your units or stay in the air and play warlord. Lots of collectables, lots of great cameo appearances from rock legends. If you see it on sale and like comedy, rock/metal, and action/RTS hybrids then definitely grab it. The Jack Black is a plus, if it's your thing.			"

												This is a tough one.The hack-and-slash bits are good. The metal backdrop is good. The cameos are great. The art style is good.BUT.The forced RTS ""battles"" completely ruined the game for me. The controls are clunky and awkward and it all feels just a wee bit too much disconnected from the rest of the game to justify them being there. So in short, good game if you can endure the RTS stuff. I couldn't. A ""meh"" or ""neutral"" option would be the choice for me here, but since Steam doesn't have that, I'll give it a recommend anyway. The positives outweigh the negatives, but the negatives can impair your enjoyment of the game quite a bit.			"

												This game has a cool concept.  It is definitely not my style, but I can understand why people would like it if they were a metal head or just enjoyed dressing up like one.  It is very Jack Black themed and has some comedic properties.  I lost interest in the game very quickly once I learned the controls and did a few missions.  I dont mind linear storylines, but combining the limited abilities of the character and the lack of loot or ability to choose the dialoge, this game is just not for me.  There is no way to customize your game-play (ie. talent-trees, armor).  The sheer lack of features a modern game is expected to have these days forces me to give a negative recommendation.			"

												If I had to describe this game in one word, its dull. The gameplay doesn't feel fun or exciting, and the story is uninteresting. Jack Black gives a very ethusiastic perfromance, but some of the cameos made by rock legends clearly don't know how to do voice acting. I was excited to play this game, and I was completely let down by everything. This game would have been better off just trying to be a Zelda clone, but tried too hard adding in RTS elements that dont feel fun in a game that isn't a pure RTS. This certainly is not a BAD game, but its simply boring and dull.			"

												I enjoyed this game. It has great art direction, memorable characters, and a fantastic story. I also felt that the game carries a nice shift from hack and slash combat to full out RTS battles which got pretty challenging in the end.I'm not a fan of RTS games in general, but I've heard the controls and ability to manage troops are somewhat limited in this game. Some people might not be big fans of metal music or familiar with some of it's icons.That said, I still enjoyed the game immensely and I hope you do too :]			"

												I was never really into rock or metal. Some games had great songs in that genre, but others not so much.This game has mostly awesome songs, and actually got me into this type of music.If you absolutely hate rock and metal and cannot stand to bear it, don't get this game.Anyway, besides the music, the game is very fun. There is comedy in the game, and I honestly don't laugh at many things. I liked a few of the jokes the characters made. Of course I didn't fall out of my chair, but I laughed a little.The story starts with a Roadie named Eddie Riggs who gets killed after an on-stage accident. The statue on the stage comes to life, turning into the God of Metal, full of rage over Eddies death and killed the idiot performers that caused it. He takes Eddie into another world, and Eddie finds himself in a situation where he has to lead a rebellion against ones keeping the locals from having their freedom.I won't say much more. I personally loved the story, and I don't want to spoil it.But if you beat storymode, or don't feel like doing it right way, you can always explore the world to find collectibles, or complete side missions (they can be repetitive, but they give you money for upgrades).The game has a HUGE world. The best way to get around is in your car, and upgrading it's speed and turbo boost would really help you go to far-off places. The scenery is very nice, and you really want to run over the creatures running around.The only issue I have is that foot or car are the only choices for transportation. If there was some sort of teleportation or fast travel, it would've been much better.The gameplay is great. Driving is easy. Controls are simple. Combat is very smooth, and there are a couple of combos that you can use. Also you can pick which weapons you'd use, letting you try out different weapon effects to see what you feel comfortable with.However, my main issue with combat is that it's easy to die on Normal difficulty. I don't bite off more than I can chew (not often, anyway), but when I feel that I can take a couple of enemies, I'm proven wrong.Currently, the only way I know how to increase your maximum health is by finding a bunch of dragon statues, and there are so many placed that it takes about five to ten of them for a tiny bit of health being increased.If you want a noticeable difference, I suggest finding as many statues as you can.Now, the most memorable thing about the game are Stage Battles. Bascially you are able to call and command troops. It's your choice to focus on offense or defense, but a balance of both is very handy.The goal of a Stage Battle is to destroy the enemy's stage. Don't think you can do it yourself while a hundred of your guys distract the enemy; you are unable to harm a stage. And as soon as the stage becomes damaged, an alarm plays, and the enemy immediately rushes to it and tries to stop you.You are also able to fly during a Stage Battle. Flying is the fastest way to travel, and lets you see everything while remaining unharmed. Unfortunately, you are only able to fly during a Stage Battle. If it was available in free-roam, it would've been amazing.Multiplayer lets you have a Stage Battle against another player online. Additionally, it lets you play as two of the enemies you fought against in single-player, along with Eddie's side. Each side has their own ups and downs, different troops with different abilites, and different solos (which are basically player abilities).However, I have never been able to find another player online.But a good thing is that you can play against a bot for practice, and can choose it's difficulty. This isn't exactly the same, I'm sure, but it lets you have a Stage Battle at any time you want.Overall the game is amazing. I loved the gameplay, I loved almost all of the music, and it's definetly worth playing.			"

												Wow, jeez, it's only $15?What're you confused about, then...?You play Jack Black in Metalvania. You drive around in your hot rod beating up demons and edgy teenagers, while listening to some of the best metal. Sometimes you get these games that comes along with soundtracks like this, and you find like one or two that you enjoy listening to. For example, oh, I don't know, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 or something.Brütal Legend on the other hand is all metal, and it's all good.The game itself plays kind of like an RTS/RPG hack n slash hybrid. But when you're slashing, you've got combos and such to think about, which is nice, as combat therefore has kind of a bit of depth.If nothing else, you'll definitely feel refreshed after playing this. It's highly original.			"

I played in Brutal difficulty and had to go down to Gentle and I was still losing when I was following the developer's guide they personaly wrote for this game.It was a shame having such a hyped and cool-looking game brought down  by small effort on the gameplay section which is essential when someone makes a game.PS. The pc port is also lazy and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's full of glitches bugs and pop-in graphics which do not allow anyone to fully enjoy it.			"

												I'm not a heavy metal fan and for a long time that kept me from trying Brutal Legend. And that's a shame because - based on heavy metal or not - this as an imaginative and fun game with amazing graphic style and impressive soundwork (both in voice-acting and music). Unfortunately, the actual game portion of this title suffers in comparison, with unimpressive minigames, unfocused gameplay and unwieldy controls. I loved /exploring/ the spectacular world that the developers had created and interacting with its colorful characters, but found the combat, the driving and the platforming to be tedious at best. Sadly, this seems to be par for the course for Doublefine; I loved the settings of both Stacking and Psychonauts but couldn't stand the gameplay of those titles either. Ultimately, I gave up on Brutal Legend long before I reached the end, albeit not without remorse, as the world is that interesting. But I just couldn't take the gameplay anymore.			"

												I didn't get too terribly far.Beautiful to look at. Great to listen to. Consistently funny. Satisfyingly ludicrous story. Boring to play. Boring boring boring.Quite a few different types of attacks are provided early on in an attempt to spice things up, but that's offset by the poorly designed levels, super low variety in enemies, and generally unsatisfying combat. I shared my discouragement with a friend, who said it was too soon to judge as I'd not even progressed to the first ""stage battle"". Fair enough. The first stage battle consisted of defending a location against multiple waves of 3 types of enemy set against a pretty, non-interactive backdrop. The 3 enemy types were duplicates of the 3 friendly until types I was employing, making the battle both more bland and more confusing. Bleh. At least static defense sidesteps the poor level design issue. Recommend searching YouTube for ""Brutal Legend Movie"" and mailing Tim Schafer $5 as an alternative.According to Steam, I played Brutal Legend for a total of 2.6 hours. The movie is 2.5, and a better use of your time.

												I'm going to be brutally honest with you, brutal legend is an amazing with a unique design, fusing music (specifically metal/rock), real time strategy and action-rpg.  The balance is just right, and the world you explore is amazing and detailed, giving you lots of opportunities when you are not progressing the main storyline to explore and take on side tasks if you desire. The game's hero is voiced by Jack Black and he brings his signature humor to the game, coupled with other celebrity appearances lending to the atmosphere of the game. Returning to the gameplay, the combat is almost single hero based with squad control, and basic single base RTS elements which it executes well (very intuitive with controller). The story is something I'd rather not spoil, but it is characteristic of Metal, and Metal themed media, that being said, even if you as the gamer are not a fan of the genre there is still a rich world and character interactions/story elements that are applicable to all aspects of music and a solid gameplay experience which should definitely keep you involved. The only place where this game falls short, and I'm not alone in this sentiment, is near the end (spoiler free review of course), it seems like the game was going to have a decisive third act but instead it was concluded on the second act. Nobody really knows the reasoning behind this aside from probably the development team, but it left gamers wanting more even though it did still basically wrap up all the loose ends of the story. Regardless this game is a full recommendation to fans of metal/rock no all music, and those who enjoy a good action rpg. It is an accessible, quality experience which will leave you with many fond memories of it. Embrace your inner metal-head and get this game.			"

												It's a bad console port. Controls are awful.- To move camera angle, you have to move your mouse, but the sensitivity doesn't go high without using external software.- Radial command things are weird and it actually behaves like a thumbstick. With a mouse, you'd think moving the mouse in a circular motion will pick the option you want, but it's actually all about moving in a direction. Let's say you want to pick the upper left option. You have to move the mouse into the upper left position. It sounds obvious when I explain it, but it's just really weird.- The second mission or so has you drive over a collapsing bridge. This is early in the game so I don't consider it a spoiler. It's actually just the tutorial part for the car controls. The car handles so horribly that you can be pressing left to try and avoid a gap and the car either goes left and drives up a wall or it goes left very slowly, driving into the giant hole in the floor.This game could be so freaking heavy metal badass but the controls are just all wrong and slow. Maybe I need to get a controller...			"

												I bet the console versions of this game are a lot of fun, but the keyboard controls are simply terrible.  The driving sequences especially are an exercise in frustration.  Then there's the rotational selector you use for choosing guitar solos and summoning troops.  You're in the middle of a battle, and then spend ten seconds desperately trying to get it to select the option you want.  Also, the Mac version at least is really buggy.  The map and tour book, for example, sometimes verge on unusable just because they stop responding to the controls correctly.  Double Fine should be embarrased to have let this game go out when it clearly wasn't ready yet.			"

												Great game but I can't recommend it to anyone.  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea behind this and the game as some really cool mechanics, wicked humor, and is the right mix of RPG and FPS.  However, the camera in this game is annoying as hell.  Basic functions of walking or driving a vehicle will have you believing that you are drunk.  For random reasons, I have yet to figure out, the camera  changes angles indiscrimately and at critical times while trying to do something.  I mean what is the purpose (ever!) to move a camera angle to anything but behind a vehicle when you are driving it?  I don't want to see what I look like in the car, I want to see where I'm going.  Targeting enemies or getting around obstacles is more difficult than it needs to be.  After decades of FPS games on the market, how is it that a developer can screw this basic thing up so badly.  It's sad that one simple thing ruins this game so easily and that it can be easily fixed.  Not going to be playing much of this one unless the camera is patched.			"

												Play this now if you love (or loved) metal!I'll also c/p my post on GOG, dude was asking if I'd recommend it to him, even if he's not into metal.""This game is pure metal :D story, characters, environment and everything all heavy metal. So I don't think you'll have so much fun as I did when you saw/heard the legends such as Lemmy, Ozzy or Rob Halford (almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic lol). The gameplay is not so good imho, especially the RTS part sucks! So I'd pass this one if I weren't a Tim Schafer fan & a metal-junkie. BTW there is no Iron Maiden song on OST, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ WERE THEY THINKING?! And some early Metallica wouldn't hurt as well, guess they couldn't licence these two.""			"

												Wow! This game has everything!  Controller works flawlessly even in menus, it should be on steam big picture.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST the SOUNDTRACK EDITION! , honestly this game you can't pay enough for.  The Voice acting is great, I wasnt a big Jack Black fan always thought he came off like a jerk, but from this game I really started to like him, now that I can see like what hes into.  There is NO WAY to upgrade to soundtrack edition so get it WITH the soundtrack!  Even when this game came out it was full of bugs the dev said, I cant find any, also its a console port but get this, the devs made it work on pc!  Unlocked the FPS from the 30 lock and everything.  Take that rockstar someday maybe those clowns can learn how to port games see LA noire and Bully for what a joke their company was, they went bankrupt because they couldnt code, they just never had the skills to pay the billz like this game does!Rating:  10/10  Value:  $24.99			"

												I'm really astonished that someone can recommend this game. Ok, it has great soundtrack... but's all. Story? Meh, not the worst but not good either. You play, you watch it, you forget it. No matter what happens -you don't feel anything, curiosity included. Graphics are... ok, they are just as ""meh"" - both considering quality and design. Exploring world is just as boring as side quests... And they are really, really boring. There is maybe 5 types of them. The same goes for main quests... There are few exceptions but mainly they are ""Escort the bus' and ""Stage battles""... And the second type is the worst part of whole game. Seriously, just terrible. And boring. As hell. Seriously... The game starts with a blast but that blast goes away after first hour (max two) and then it's just doing the same stuff all over again... Which might have been OK if fighting were at least interesting. But it isn't.  Seriously, this is the first game where I lowered difficulty level just to make through game faster, Pity.			"

												It's really boring. Gameplay is a shallow hack n slash, and a shallow RTS broken up by a shallow open world. The open world is boring, there's not all that much there to entertain you and it's just used to hide collectibles (that let you buy new skills), Hack and slash is simplistic and you dont know how much health you have, or enemies have, so it boils down to button mashing and isnt remotely satisfying. The RTS segments are simplistic, and you have to move units around with your leader which restricts you and slows things down.The only good thing is the music.			"

												STORYThe game greets you with a cool intro with Jack Black entering a music store telling you about this secret vynil getting you into the main screen, the game starts fast pasced and the main character is behind scenes of a new hip metal group that arent all that metal and he talks on how real metal is dead, one thing thing leads to another and he gets transported to this metal themed world and gets into an all out war against some guys that want to ""sell out"".GAMEPLAYThe game starts strongly as a beat em up wich i loved, but as you keep playing there are this sort of battles that resemble more  an RTS than anything else and they get boring REALLY fast, the only thing that keeps you playing are the well written dialoge and interesting characters, though I havent beaten the game to say if the whole game is like this.GRAPHICSGraphically the ame is not very appeling, with aweful hair physics and outdated textures wich resembles more something that came from the original xbox than the new gen.The overworld is as plain as it can get, good thing you get a car early into the game or it would take years to get to point A to point B, also I dont know if it is just me but the animations seem to have been done to be played at 30 fps, and so i am playing at 60 fps and it looks like if im am looking at a claymation, but as I said, it could just be me.SOUNDProbably the best thing about the game, it got some great voice acting, including Black Jack as the protagonist and Ozzy Osbourne as our car seller wich got some HILARIOUS quotes, also the game comes with a killer soundtrack with copyrighted metal songs and some other original ones. The dialoge is one of the funniest I have seen in a while aswell.CONCLUSIONI havent played the whole game but for what i have played is not worth the the full price, sure the writting and characters are spot on, but they alone dont sell the game for me, if you are getting it try to get it on a sale since it is still worth a whirl, how ever it isnt a must buy.

												The concept for this game is an inspired work of genius but I can't bring myself to recommend this game. You play as Jack Black who is sucked into a world of heavy metal and demons. World awesome and full of cool characters and cameos from heavy metal legends. The problem comes with the gameplay. It has elements of hack and slash, real time strategy, free roaming exploration and driving. It manages to do all of these elements quite badly. The hack and slash parts are okay, the RTS parts are terrible, the side missions are uninspired and repetitive, the mapping system is poor, The inability to jump and the sketchy driving make getting around annoying, the upgrades seem to make no appreciable difference and the story is for the most part uninteresting. I guess if you like heavy metal you'd like the sound track but once I had turned off all the songs I didn't like I was basically left listening to Mr Crowley on repeat. This game does have its moments but mostly it is just not that much fun.			"

												I would love to rate this game higher, but I am affraid I can not. The question of course is why, because the game certainly does have several things that speak for it. Brutal Legend is a game filled with humor that is akin to main man's introduction cult movie; The Pick of Destiny. Personally, I enjoy it for in the game it is not constantly bombarded at you if you are just cruising in the Druid Plow (that is your car), but fills the conversations with a light air that is certainly good for a laugh. If you are cruising Metal music (of different genres of metal) greets your ears. Something I enjoy and in fact made me appreciate some artists better, but certainly not for everyone. Okay so that gives it a rather niche public, but that doesn't make it bad does it? No, it doesn't.However, the game also has real time combat and does so in a the old Warcraft/Starcraft format, but has the view not topdown but on you as well as you are a important player. With no pause function, bad overview, the fact that you need to fight as well as command constantly -  because the AI is just horrible - makes it stressful. A shrill constrast to the rest. Now a friend of mine has it and does well enough. The difference, a controller. I have mouse and keyboard and the controls are such .... finicky, that on a dial I can not even select the unit above or below it because it either won't move or will go down 2 in an instance. The solos you need to perform to boost you army also require key combinations which also go wrong at times due to this. No problem outside combat but in it... The problem is that this game is fun, looks nicely, has good humor, but was not properly developed for combat with mouse and keyboard.Thus, the game has its niche in which it does well. However, if you do not like this niche or do not own a controller, I would say it is not worth the frustation of the combat and quirky controls (even with remapping!) - because that is the opposite of what the game is intended to be and would be a dissappointment over an otherwise well intended and decently executed (mainly music, humor and graphic wise) game.

												I bought this game when it was on sale thinking it was a great normal action game where the main character kills the bad guys by himself, I was wrong. I hate tower defense games with a very strong passion and this game is a posing action game that is really a undercover tower defense game.The game was good until I had to build towers that they call fan booths and defend them against army enemies while trying to build more towers/fan booths.This game reminds me of sour milk. It looks good until you look closer into it and then you find out that it is better to throw it away.If you are like me and hate tower defense games do not buy this game. If you are a tower defense freak then you will love this game.			"

Exactly as those games, Brutal Legend is not for everyone, but I would recommend it for people who are looking for something different.

Granted, the plot is rather average and for its length the game could use a little bit more gameplay variety, but it is still a solid experience.			"

												The gameplay is mediocre.However, everything else is actually pretty good. The art style, the music (Well, if you like metal. If you can't stand metal, just stay away), the writing, the voice acting, it's all pretty damn sweet.It's a shame the gameplay isn't up to snuff (For elaboration, the hack + slash mechanics devolve quite easily into button mashing or executing the same combo over and over, and the RTS sections are veeery clunky. Despite attempts at higher strategy it's generally just zerg rushing), but as long as you can tolerate mediocre gameplay, the game's something you should check out.Note: By mediocre, I don't necessarily mean bad, dull, ecetera. The gameplay's not very fun, but it's not something you have to suffer through. It's more like an interlude, after which more cool visuals and nice writing swings by.			"

												Brütal legend is a heavy metal themed hack'n slash open world racing game. You play as Eddie Riggs who become the leader of Ironheade after having freed them by starting a revolution. Eddie's main enemy is the boss demon named Dovicolous. On the tour we have lot of stage battles against demons, and we can recriute fans to our side. Many collcetibles are scattered around to find, and there are also secondary missions, too. Completeing primary and secondary quests as well as helping your buddies to defeat enemies you gain fire tributes that is used as a ""currency"" to buy upgrades for yourself and your vehicle called Deuce. Deuce can be summoned everywhere after playing a giutar solo. Giutar solos results in cool things such as battly cry, summoning a burning airship which crashes to your enemies causing serious damage to them etc. And finally you can always hear heavy metal music for example from Motörhead. I really enjoyed playing it. 7,5/10			"

This game also includes great music from mostly 80s bands: Motorhead, Motley Crue, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, Diamond Head, Testament, Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath. If you are a fan of 80s metal and Jack Black, you must buy this.For a 16$ game I give this 8/10It goes on sale a lot for a cheap price often as well. "

												A spiritual successor to Sacrifice and Giants: Citizen Kabuto. Exactly as those games, Brutal Legend is not for everyone, but I would recommend it for people who are looking for something different. It features an amazing setting, cool characters, funny dialogues (with great voice acting) and tons and tons of awesome metal music. Granted, the plot is rather average and for its length the game could use a little bit more gameplay variety, but it is still a solid experience.			"

If your not good at Micro-management it may be a bit diffacult but the game still has good gameplay and a good story. The multi-player is all on the RTS side but that is the best part of the game.

												There's a lot to like here.  The graphics and audio are well-done, the whole heavy metal asthetic is burned into the DNA of the game and its world and there are lots of great heavy metal tracks to unlock from a really well-chosen selection of big-name bands and more obscure (but excellent) underground bands.  The characters are okay, not up to the typical Double Fine standard of memorability or amusingness, but most voice acting is great (the worst being the guest voices from rock icons, but hey, it's authentic) and it's mostly lighthearted enough.What really fails is the game itself.  There's some moderate fun to be had driving around and exploring. but the riff-based 'magic' system isn't as fun as it should be, and the pivotal epic battles are designed as (bizarrely) a sort of real-time strategy game that is clumsy, confusing, and ultimately so damn poor.  The story - a fairly generic tale of good, evil, betrayal and redemption - is merely a skeleton to dress the rest of the game upon, and not enough to keep me playing through an indefinite number of these rough spots.

												I loved the humor and the silly over the top heavy metal universe, that's a lot of fun for the first couple of hours. Unfortunately I can't really recommend this game.Its gameplay is an hybrid of RTS and 3rd person action/adventure. And like most hybrid games, it does neither very well. Having to fight the interface to try to give your army orders is not very fun.Not even the awesome soundtrack manages to save this game for me. As a real action/adventure game or maybe even as a regular RTS with decent controls it might have been a great game. On the other hand if you like weird hybrids and don't mind using ""consolized"" controls to play a RTS game then you may still like it.			"

												This game: so much potential wasted by ignoring the details. The characters, story, and acting are pretty good. But it makes me wonder how it would have been without Jack Black. Probably not as good! But the real thing lacking in this title is the gameplay. First of all; there is no JUMP. It LOOKS like an action-adventure/platformer, but it's just the action adventure part. Sure it is my own pre-conceived notions that expect a JUMP function but I'm sorry, I LOVE jumping in games. You no have jump, you no have fun game. In context, of course. I don't expect jumping in Civ 5. I digress...Overall the controls are just plain clunky and not responsive enough. The attack moves are more funny than practical. You will likely figure out the two moves you like and stick mainly with those along with the block move. The kicker is that the camera control is sub-par. I suppose perfect camera in 3rd person is rare.If you can get it on a sale or bundle, it's probably worth it just for the humor, especially if you're a rocker, otherwise I do not recommend this game.

Maybe it did work well in the console or maybe with a controller, but using keyboard / mouse to play this game provides a horrid experience, specially when you're behind the weel... the car just doesn't go where you want it to and it's frustrating.Overall, I'd have loved this game if it was a movie: a fun and great story.

												""Full Controller Support"" Does it hell! Controls are slow and sluggish at best.I'm not trying to use anything fancy, nothing with 76 buttons, 3 ergonomically crafted sticks, light-up, flood-proof, shock-proof, proof-proof(!), titanium cased with twiddly-bits... No! (not that I can afford anything remotely resembling AlienWare anyway.)All I want to use is a standard issue wired xbox 360 controller!!! I can use it with Fez, Gateways, Jamestown and loads of other 'small' games, so why not BL? Not being insulting but I am comparing those mentioned with a game that has had enough money to afford Jack Black and Lemmy thrown at it. What the chuffing hell is going on? Occassionally the buttons work in BL, the triggers don't at all. The controls are sluggish and sloppy, reacting split seconds behind the press.Okay, I'm playing on a laptop, HP DV7, 6gb ram, i5-2410M cpu (@2.3gHz), Radeon HD 6490M gfx (512 dedicated ram) so I shouldn't expect a lot.... But, I own and have played Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Saint's Row 3 fluidly with no lag and completed them all, so I honestly don't think it's too much to expect to have something like responsive and working controls as a standard feature!I can only say that I'm glad it came as part of a Humble Bundle so I can write it off against the other better games that came with it. I'd be a lot more disappointed if I'd paid full money for this. I also find it disappointing given that the same company released Psychonauts, a great game that contrary to BL I'd recommend at the drop of a hat. "

												This is quite possibly the worst game I have ever played and I've played a lot, the story is weak to a degree that a 10 year old child wrote it. You are left with more questions at the end than actual answers to this vast new society that you are chucked into. Character backgrounds are a big let down as there is ZERO mentioning about them so really you learn nothing apart from HEAVY METALLL!!!!!!!!Characters will drive you insane after a few hours that you will want to tear your own ears off so you don't have to listen to the same sentence when doing a side mission, over and over and over and over and over and over.... (Eddie: 'Who are we hunting today?' ""Special"" head bangers: 'BAD GUYZ!!!! Wanna help?') and that is all they say for about 10hrs gameplay in that series of missions really! I found my IQ drop for every time I talked to these NPC's that I was happy when I finally completed this abomination. Control's are awkward when trying to play stratergist on the battlefield and it gets old really quickly. Eventually you will be forced to reduce the difficulty level as the enemy side are (one hitting) your troops that it becomes more of a torture than any sort of enjoyment.Maybe they should of paid Jack Black less and actually hired a decent developer + producer and a wider range of voice actors the game probably would actually be pretty good unlike this rubbish before us! How they ever won an award is nothing short of laughable stupidity! IGN gave it a 9.0/10 seems to me they never actually played it...  it's a 3/10 at best in my opinion, so instead spend £1 on getting super Hexagon or something with a beer, as that is much more fun.I laugh at anybody who ever paid full price for this garbage, I got this at a deal price and felt they should have paid me in the end... worst purchase on steam BY FAR!

												The Good:- A Double Fine Production means lots of good humor in the game- Apearance and voice of some Metal Gods Like Ozzy Osbourne- Nice Selection of Metal Music- Good dialogues between charracters inside primary missionsThe Bad:- This game can be the example of poor level design. It's one of the worst in gaming history!- Bad collider implementing for objects and environment- Very poor physics engine (after an accident no one can guess which direction your car will go!)- Car Control is a true headache (it's very hard to control your car and driving will cause motion sickness in this game)- Side missions are boring and repeatative- The strategy part of the game isn't fun at all (I wish it had gameplay like Darksiders or GoW or Devil May Cry)The Ugly:- The worst part of the game is driving (like I said in the bad part it's really really bad). And the ugly part is that this is an open world game, which means you have to use the car a lot, and experience lots of accidents with objects and animals, falling into oceans and abysses and headache from motion sickness (and I used a Xbox360 controller, god help who uses mouse and keyboard!!!). Actually when I think about it I'm so relieved that I will never play the game again.With all that I just said I'm sure that I probably can't stop you from spending 1.5$ (in 90% off) over this game, like I couldn't stop myself from buying it. But please for god's sake DO NOT spend too much time on side missions and finding collectibles and make the game 100% complete like I did. Just play the Primary missions, watch game's ending and uninstall it.[P.S. you can still play and make the game 100% after completing campain, but this time you can save a lot of time with the car upgrade that'll show you map secrets.]			"

												Well i got that game because i thought it was super funny, simple and enjoyable. Well i am not content. The game is funny but it is not what i expected from the reviews/videos. Its not that simple/easy. I find myself dying on medium difficulty. Its not that enjoyable. The grafics are bad and the game feels buggy. Not really really buggy but not smooth enough. You would expect great levels of smoothness from such a simple-grafics game. Overall i am not happy with this purchase. I havent even finished the game... I am not going to grind for such a silly game. I excpected something really fun and really simple that will make u laugh a lot and i didnt get that....			"

												Oh how I am loath to say something negative about Double Fine.  It's a company I would love to support, but this is the end.  As usual, they're amazing at building a world, characters are good, funny etc, but gameplay is perplexingly bad.  It's like they come up with the story and plot, then outsource the gameplay to some chimps who've only played about three games before and mash them all together.  I can't explain how such a mess of a game could get released otherwise.  The game is part strategy, part RPG, part Adventure.  The strategy is overly simplistic, just hurl your units at the others and give them a hand... yet you have a big ♥♥♥♥ off axe that still takes 6 hits to take out the weakest enemy.  So when there's 30 enemy, that's a lot of chopping... using your area attacks are just as weak, but they might hit three enemy at once, still takes 6 hits minimum though.The adventure part takes place in the worst sandbox I have ever encountered.  It's what I would call 'over designed'  everything looks so dense that it looks the same, so navigating is tiresome, difficult at times, and worst of all, boring.What's worse, when you spend 20 minutes. 20 sodding ♥♥♥♥ing minutes driving around, not even doing missions, simply going from one place to the next mission, getting stuck, fighting random hordes of enemies, only to make it all the way to your next mission, just nick a bit of black ground that looks the same as the rest of all the other black ground, but apparantly it was black water, which is instant death, only to get respawned WAY on the other side of the map and have to do it all again... you're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off... When I made it back once more, I Saved it as I didn't want to start the next mission as it was now time to go and do something else as all of my time was wasted, when returning, it loaded me WAY on the other side of the ♥♥♥♥ing map again, and I had to drive all the way back.. again....Oh, and many parts of the map are identical, they just changed the colour filter, clever in its use, but lazy is lazy... OHx2, bugged up the♥♥♥♥♥♥at times, game breakingly so, only twice, but still.Lastly, and fatally.  In a game you drive a great deal, the driving mechanics are the worst I've seen in a Sandbox, and I've seen some BAD driving mechanics.So in summary, ONLY buy this if you are VERY forgiving of bad gameplay because you enjoy fun characters and settings etc, and if you are a big big fan of Double fine games... I was... this is the end my friend, never again.It's a shame, with a bit more polish it could have been a c+ as it is, it's a big AVOID!			"

												I purchased this game as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle, so use that tint when reading this review.Brutal Legend has oodles of theme, but can't quite decide what it wants for gameplay, and suffers accordingly.  You start out with your typical hack'n'slash, then it adds a driving element, and just when you are getting comfortable with that, you find that the major encounters are handled as real-time strategy battles.  There were a number of issues that really hurt my opinion of the game:The driving implementation is terrible.  You simply cannot steer effectivelyThe camera is only taking your suggestion.  Sometimes it is completely out of your controlThe overview map is too vagueThe directional hints via the turn signals are too difficult to useDetermining your health is a guessing gameSame for your vehicle health, enemy health, boss healthSide quest variety is extremely limitedSpecial combos do not fire reliablyI set the game to normal difficulty and expected a fair challenge.  Instead, I found in some scenarios I could do nothing at all and succeed, and in others I had to figure out a precise series of RTS actions to lead to victory.  In some of the ambushes your party rushes off to death before you can even get under way.  On the upside, Brutal Legend features an amazing soundtrack and voice cast.  If you love heavy metal you might enjoy this game on theme alone.  In fact, you'll probably forgive all of it's blemishes for having Lemmy, Ozzy, Jack Black, Lita Ford, and many more.  I'm not a huge metal fan, though, so for all of its charm I just couldn't get past the glaring gameplay issues.			"

												This game kicks all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥ I really can't believe I haven't heard of it until relatively recently and only played it today. It's almost like a parasite of a company (that to this day continues to be funded by mouthbreathing idiots like those that plague Steam) sabotaged its marketing because of something as silly as genre fads and stopped the company behind it from doing anything otherwise interesting like porting it. Funny that.Anyway, I haven't played much of it thus far (am actually redoing the first part because it's that awesome) but I think I've played enough to get a decent idea of the gameplay. It's kind of like a more fluid ARTS mixed with third person fighting. You've got two axes. One is an actual axe for primary attacks and the other a guitar for secondary/ranged/special attacks. It works well thus far and I'm liking how well they did on making it work with a keyboard and mouse. I know that being the type of game this is it should have been PC first anyway but one can't take these things for granted.Besides the gameplay the main thing that made me decide to do the review now instead of later is the epic everything-that-isn't-gameplay. Starting from getting to play someone voiced by Jack Black who is... Well, Jack Black. The art is great and appropriately metal with some pretty awesome character and world design. The advertising really isn't lying when they say it's inspired by rock album covers. Speaking of, the music in this just kicks all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥too. I don't even know what else to say besides that. Seriously... Just look on youtube for the OST. No description does it justice.I'm also liking the story. It glorifies everything epic about rock while at the same time taking loving stabs at the more silly parts of it. In standard Double Fine manner it also likes to point out the obvious while still making it genuinely amusing. One thing that was really weird to me though is that the band who Eddy is a roadie for has a guitarist that is Raz. Not someone who looks like him. He is Raz. I'm guessing it's just because the VA voices both of them and has a distinct voice but in my mind he's an alternate reality Raz who still left the circus but decided to start a garage band (called Psychonauts, it totally works as a band name) instead of going to camp.Anyway, not much else to say yet and I don't really think there is much else to say. It's an epic ARTS-like game with great soundtrack and dialog. If you like ARTS-like games and like great soundtracks I don't imagine you'll be disappointed.Edit: Oh god, I just saw the beginning cutscene again. That's definitely Raz. He's doing the stupid egyptian-walk-dance-thing. :|			"

												Well, the fight mechanisms during territorial battles is fun, and the available music on your car's radio is lovely, but the map navigation is hell and the game may have a few annoying glitches here and there. The subject matter of the game is a little dorky, what with the whole ""new music is♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; attitude to it, and the humour is raunchy and deliciously immature, and any game guest starring Ozzy is good in my books. I recommend buying it when it's on a really high special, like when it costs $5.00 or something, because you'll finish it fast and forget about it forever.			"

												I really like metal. This is a game that lets me fight demons alongside Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and Lemmy. While driving a car that shoots missiles. And Manowar is playing. I think my beard just became fuller from writing that. I also like Double Fine, and I found Brutal Legend to be another hit in their long list of good games. Honestly, I'd probably recommend the game based on the soundtrack alone, which includes over 100 kickass metal tunes to blast while driving around, but like I said, it also has the ""being a good game"" thing going for it. The strategy elements could have been handled better. It's less ""strategically place units"" and more ""gather troops and throw them at enemies.""  Except for the last two bosses, but that's because the computer cheats, and I won't hear anyone say otherwise. There's a lot to explore and find within the game. Lore, solos, songs, dragon statues tied up in bondage gear, and plenty of side missions. Each of these gets you favor with the metal gods, which you can spend on upgrades by talking to the Guardian of Metal, voiced and modeled on Ozzy Osbourne. You can also run over porcupines and ride mammoths into battle. Best of all, you can continue exploring after the main story, so you're not in a rush to finish everything before the end. That's pretty nice. All in all, I had fun, and any game with Iced Earth in their soundtrack gets a recommendation from me. \m/			"

												This game has pretty much everything a great game should; great music, fun gameplay, interesting characters. However where the game falls short is the campaign. You see, Brutal Legend was designed with the multiplayer component in mind (despite having broken matchmaking), which means the focus of the game is the stage battle system. The story mode clocks in at four hours, is poorely designed and rushed, littered with unlockables, but otherwise worth playing through atleast once. What many players seemed to want was just the hack and slash gameplay, but didn't like the stage battles which were essentially just giving you allies and resource points to fight over. Ironically, everybody loves Dawn of War and Company of Heroes yet didn't like Brutal Legend just because you are on the feild yourself. It's litterally the same concept: Grab the resource points and balance between tech advancements and troop production. In fact, DoW2's MP can be thought of as the RTS only version of Brutal Legends MPGameplay wise, amazing. Your Stage has defenses and produces troops, and can level up to three. You use your troops to clear Fan Geysers so that you can play a magical guitar solo to build a gathering structure on it. You need to have more of these than your enemy to win; as you will get more resources and thus have more troops of better quality. Your goal is to destroy the enemy Stage with your troopers. Map control is required. Another strange thing is the cars, each character has one, but can also fly. It's rare to need such a device if you can fly. It's mostly only for the campaign.  "

												Great humour, rather original in some ways and good tunes of course, but the game itself is rather average and tedious most of the times. Audio and visuals aren't bad too, with some lovely scaling and depth, though it's mostly wasted on being rather liner and DirectX 9 only at best.It's just not my style or genre of game and most likely enjoyed by everyone else accept me. So don't take my 'NO' recommendation too seriously, as you personally might like it.*2/3* - Plays too much like an old and possibly broken console game, but with the substance of a decent quality Windows OS/Steam game []^_^]			"

												Driving mechanics killed a good game.I would really like to give this game a recommendation, because it's charming, funny, has a lot of heart and I love Double Fine. I would be willing to forgive it it's boring fighting mechanic and pretty empty strategy mechanic (which doesn't have any real strategy to it). If this game only required you to complete one of these two chores (or a less bad ""guitar solo"" mini game) every now and then to move on to the next funny scene, I would give it 3 stars because that would be an overall fun experience. Jack Black and all his guest stars are just that fun, story is funny and the graphics are very pretty.Sadly, there is also driving. Terrible, TERRIBLE driving.Don't trust the other reviews when they describe driving as ""not great"". Driving a Yugo is ""not great"". Driving in this game leaves the impression that it has been designed by a race of ethereal beings from a non-physical plane of existence who tried and failed to imagine the experience of driving based on reading comics and studying photographs. Your car has no inertia and steering...I honestly never had a RL or virtual experience that is comparable to this steering. The closest thing that I can imagine would be driving a tank with super-traction tires on Jupiter. There are few missions that try to spice up the driving with shooting, but the aiming and shooting is, out of necessity, made very easy because keeping the car on course is challenge enough, unless that course is a straight line.I finally quit the game when a mission (won't spoil the story with background) required me to use the to escape a pursuer. There was couple of U turns on the track and...I just don't know. Maybe one of those genius kids who figure out surgery on their own at the age of 6, without ever going to school, maybe one of them could figure out how to complete a semi-challenging driving course in this game without their hearts overflowing with hate and despair. I couldn't, so I had to quit and delete the game without completing it.			"

												This is a cool idea, and probably really good for people who like heavy metal. However, I don't like heavy metal (or demons), so it was all pretty much lost on me. Great voice acting, but clunky RTS mechanics. Dated graphics for 2013.			"

												If you're into your Heavy Metal and like Hack n Slash games like God of War, Dante's Inferno or Devil May Cry, this game will enter your top 10 games within minutes of playing. The story is great, funny and immersive. The humour is spot on and the voice acting is spot on from people like Lemmy, Ozzy Osbourne and Jack Black.If you don't like Heavy Metal but do like Hack n Slash or RTS games, I still suggest you give this a go, it's fun for SO many different reasons, you won't regret it.

												I regreat not just buying the soundtrack.It has some classic metal from Motorhead, Black Sabbath and a few other rock bands fromthe 1970's.The gameplay is really lame though, it was obviously made for the ""tale tale"" generation, where you are lead through every action. Should old metal heads buy this game? Umm nope. Get the sound track if you have not already heard the music 10 billion times from your own collection, there is nothing new here.Should younger kids buy this game? Well, maybe if you like older heavy metal, And playing tale-tale game. Then maybe you will like it.Mechanics:Ripped off Devil may die game-play. (not a good rip off, just a rip off) Some lame driving scenes unlike any car game you would ever like to buy.Grand theft auto mixed with Guitar hero rythem game.Memorizing countless combos. (yeah, this is really fun)Esthetics :Sort of cool. It is like a Motorhead Album cover, and ancient Heavy Metal comic books in stunning 3D.Lots of interesting models, and character concepts. None of which are pulled off with any believability.Overall:This is like a Disney version of what metal is. It does not do Heavy metal, or speed metal justice. Young children will get a distorted/ whitewashed version, that is politically correct for millenials, and their meat discharges (children?).If Heavy metal went to rehab, and then went to a Christian church, and attended weekly 12 step meeting, you will get this game.It is sort of like a Pixar movie on bad acid.

												Finally..now i can say i played all Tim Schafer games, if you know me well you will know i always said this guy he is the best game developer ever..well, but unfortunately Brutal Legend was a disappointment or can i say the least favourite game even Broken Age was much better.why i said that? well.. Brutal Legend is not feel like Tim Schafer games, as simple as that. the story not interesting at all, i mean i like the metal age idea but the whole story it not going well and you will lost the intrest of it after a few time. Tim Schafer always created a great characters in his games and very iconic, in this one you will not find those type of characters at all, even the main character Eddie Riggs he reminded me to Ben from Full Throttle.The open world another thing disappointment, there are a lot of empty space and has a bad design and lack of creativity, and you don't have a lot to do except a repetitive side quest (i liked the race missions) and some stuffs to collect.What is more annoying about the game is the whole Stage Battles and Fan Geysers system, i mean i have no problem playing and fight the enemy with axe and guitar but putting a real time strategy elements it really frustrating and not fun at all.I really don't want to do it..this's so hard to not recommend Tim Schafer game.well..

												However I really wanted to like this game, because of its style and promises, it does not deliver. Technically, everything is how it should be. Eyefinity is supported, wide range of FOV options, controller support,...you name it. The style is cool, I really like the characters, some of the humour. Graphics are a bit so-so, but that can be excused as it was originally intended for the previous consoles, which are quite lackluster in power.But on the less brighter side, the gameplay really did not deliver. The combat is wave after wave of doing repetitively the same. The boss monsters are usually very simple by repeatedly doing a certain sequence, which is in my opinion not really much more than a well-disguised quicktime event. I did not enjoy it at least.The open world-factor is a big scam too. It's really an ""open-world"" yes, but what use does that have if the only thing it serves is being a hub for the next main mission, and maybe some boring sidequests on the line, and the collectibles. Don't expect any open-worldness like Skyrim offers for example. I really can't grind myself through this. There is better out there.Alternative recommendations if you're searching for something around this theme/style: Skyrim with the Inferno mod.World of Warcraft			"

												It starts out well with live video of Jack Black (!) and decent brawler mechanics.  Then, for some ungodly reason, instead of building on this solid base of a game, it changes to RTS/WTF??!?  Way to kill the game, Double Fine.  Here's a clue - the audiences of brawlers and RTS's rarely co-mingle. Instead of making them both happy you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them both off.  You should apologize to Jack Black for this horror show of a game.

												Brütal Legend features action/adventure fighting, vehicular combat, and real-time strategy in equal measure, and often all three simultaneously. Unfortunately, no one of those modes ever feels properly realized unto itself, and the game never manages to make them cooperate as parts of a greater whole, leaving only a messy hodgepodge.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game on aesthetic alone. I've always been a fan of metal and Jack Black, but the game itself is unfortunately bland and uninspired. The UI is bare (presumably to increase immersion) and it's frustrating not having and information on screen during the beat-em-up segments. The limited RTS content I saw was pretty barebones, but I didn't see much of it.Characters are well written, music is awesome, and the story is charming. If you can struggle through the gameplay, I'm sure there's a great story here.5/10, buy on a good sale.			"

												It's a 10% of decent but flawed gameplay among 90% of autistic non-content.The core (or so I though) gameplay is copy-pasted from one of the greatest video games of all times, Sacrifice by Shiny E. You have up to two sides fighting with each other for control of mana- I mean, FAN fountains to destroy your oponent's Altar- I mean the SCENE. Your small armies are controlled via simple commands and supported by your main hero with spells- I mean the SOLOS. It's a great concept really, and Sacrifice pulled it off perectly, of course.The problem with Brutal Legend is that the devs had not a slightest idea how to build this kind of game. That's probably the reason they decided to cover it up with tons of autistic non-content, but I will get to that in a minute.The core gameplay is over-simplified and absurdly unbalanced. You don't have to do any real resource management (your fans are generating only from the fan booths, there are no real base mana units) and from a variety of units, only few are relevant (among all three armies). And even they don't matter, since you have absolutely overpowered guitar solos who can destroy everything around you after a short QTE. It's decent enough for a few fights, but after you discover that the best way is to bait all your enemies into one spot and cast one AoE attack which will take all of them, there's suddenly no challenge, even vs the highest difficulty level. The multiplayer is dead anyway. But all of above is just a small fraction of the whole game. There are up to 8 (?) stage battles throughout the whole game, which is laughable. The rest of the game consists of autism simulating in an open world area, searching for autism throphies and doing lazy side-quests, while struggling with hell of a driving model and collision issues. There's nothing to add about this part of the game, but at the same time it makes up to 90% of it. The theme is amazing, but if you want to listen to some music, just open up your Internet browser. If it's this kind of core gameplay you're looking for, just play Sacrifice. This game is not worth it, unfortunately.			"

												Some good humor can't mask a bad game, unfortunately! I think the only reason this got so many positive reviews is because people have a soft spot for Double Fine games. This is certainly no Psychonauts, though. At least Psychonauts was fun to play. This game isn't terrible, just not good, and probably not worth your time.			"
