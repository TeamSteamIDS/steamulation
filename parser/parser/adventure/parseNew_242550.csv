												Rayman Legends is quite possibly the best 2d platformer released in the past 10 years.It’s the follow up title to Rayman Origins (also a great game) and if you missed it, 40 of the stages from Origins have been included in Legends as additional re-mastered content.It features over 120 different stages each with varying atmosphere, amazing music, and plenty of hidden collectibles. Each of the levels are hand drawn and beautiful to look at. Despite not being overly impressive on a technical level, Rayman uses a timeless style. While games like Crysis 3 probably won’t look that great 10 years from now, Rayman Legends will no doubt retain its charm.The game also has multiple characters to choose from along with a host of unlockables. There are underwater stealth missions, time trials, and even musical stages where you jump to the rhythm of remixed popular songs. The inclusion of daily and weekly challenges allows you to compete with your friends, adding tons of re-playability.If you enjoyed classic 2d platformers like Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country, you should check out Rayman Legends as it’s the closest thing to them in this day and age.For a more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and fellow reviewer Trent uploaded:

If you feel like changing it up a bit, then just go jump into another picture for different types of gameplay.			"

												Rayman Legends is a truly special game. Following the fantastic reboot of Rayman Origins, Legends surpases it in every way possible. The tight controls and superb level design makes gameplay smooth and fluid. Every death feels like a fault of your own and not the cause of a cheap obstacle or bad game design. Add to this the best visuals and art direction of any platformer ever (yes, including Trine 2), and you have a recipe for greatness. The UbiArt engine is able to produce such lush and wonderful artwork that it's hard not to stop at stare.As for content, this game has more than enough. Boasting a sizeable amount of main stages as well as Origins redone. Throw in the time trials and daily challenges, this game will surely satisfy any platformer fan.Although it may seem hyperbolic, I believe that I can say with certaintly that Rayman Legends is the finest platformer that I have ever played. It's the complete package. If you are a fan of the genre at all you owe it to yourself to pick this title up.			"

												Fantastic platformer with great visuals, tight controls, good soundtrack and lots of content. Levels are creative and varied. Weekly and daily challenges add even more to the mix.The only thing I might hold agaist it is the requirement of uplay. It might cause some issues with online content. Get stuffed Ubi. Steam should be enough DRM.EDIT. Weekly and daily challenges can be quite frustrating due to cheaters. It is a common sight to see people steal the diamond cups with riddiculus results like 9999 lums collected within a minute, or a challange completed in 00:00:00. It would be nice, if Ubisoft would make a sweep every once in a while and ban these people from multiplayer. Come on. Make this DRM uplay do something for players for a change. It probably won't happen.			"

												I fnd this game to be excellent, perhaps the best 2d sidescroller of the year.There is a lot of variety and content in the game. I love the ""20,000 lums under the sea"" campaign the most thus far as it contains exciting levels which makes it feels like you're in an ocean's elevn or a bond movie even.9.5 / 10 because I always think that games can be improved, however this is pretty close to perfection, I must say some levels are extremely tedious, such as Olympia's rescue mission.All in all, recommended however.

												After playing Rayman Origins I thought there's no way there could be a better Rayman game. I was wrong. Rayman Legends is even more beautiful, more fluid and better in a lot of ways than its predecessor.The art style is similar to Origin's but brings little improvements that make it seem not only pretty but also chiseled from a tech point of view. It definitely looks like they took their time with the visuals of Legends, when you have to improve on something as good as Origin's art style it's the details that make a world of difference.The difficulty can vary depending on how thorough you want to be with the collectibles - and there's a lot of them: lums, teensies, trophies for getting them as well characters/costumes getting unlocked because of it. The game can be enjoyed by anyone, it's never dull even if you don't decide to got after those though to reach collectibles.Pros:+ beautiful+ technical for collectibles+ great campaign pacing+ those music levels+ couch co-opCons:- no online co-op			"

												I'm going to start this review off by saying the only negative thing about Rayman Legends is Uplay, which if you haven't yet experienced it is basically the worst thing since the invention of the Vuvuzela. That said, I'm not even going to let Uplay hold me back from giving this game the amazing review it deserves. If you like platformers, you're going to love Rayman Legends. Simply said, it's one of the best platformers ever made and,  as someone who really loves platformers, I don't say that lightly. The artwork is beautiful, the soundtrack is incredible, and the game is just non-stop un-adulterated fun from stop to finish that you'll have a hard time putting it down. I logged more time into this game that I've ever put into any game short of Pokemon Silver version before I'd even realized I'd been so long. The amount of content that this game has to offer is astounding, especially considering almost all of it is utterly fantastic. Normally I'd give the message to boycott anything and everything that runs through Uplay but - just this once - I'll have to make an exception, because if you don't play this game you're missing out on something truly wonderful.

												one of the best platformers ever, puts Rayman origins to shame, this game has tons of extras to unlock. there are some amazing classic hit songs in some stages (won't spoil the surprises on you ;) ), the score is awesome and the art style is top notch, high production values all around.in case you didn't play Rayman Origins, the game is basically run from point A to point B to finish the stage, of course there are many hidden secrets in every stage and many things to collect to be able to unlock the other stages and progress through the game, it has a lot of variety and always interesting that you won't be able to put the controller down, there are many things that will spice up the game like in some stages you need to run as fast as possible to finish, some stages you will have a companion to help you out by raising up platforms or cutting ropes for you..etc.the main game tends to be a little easier than origins but it still lots of fun and there are many challenges to be had if you want to, there are also a few stages from origins that made it to this gamethe multi-player co op is frantic and funny as in origins, you will be laughing all the time at the crazy things that you can do when playing it with 3 other playersand then there is the mini game called Kung Foot, a crazy football game which requires you to slap or kick the ball and make it hit your opponent's goal, it might sound simple but it is really fun and you might get a lot of hours just playing this mini game.well i think that should be enough to make you buy it or at least give it a try, it really is amazing and it is really scary how much content this game has and if you are a fan of platformers, believe me you will enjoy this game for sure			"

												After buying this game on sale, I couldn't put it down until I beat it! It's honestly the most fun platformer that I've seen come out since Super Mario 64 or Sonic CD. The main story is an OK size (took me around 6-7 hours), but there is a lot of side and bonus content, including daily and weekly challanges, and even most of Rayman Origins is in Legends in unlockable stages. Easily worth $40, let alone a sale price!			"

												I love Rayman franchise. I admire the main hero since the first game, which was released back in 1995 and simply named 'Rayman'. The games were always very colorful and beautiful. I truly enjoyed 3D games like 'Rayman 2: The Great Escape' and 'Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc'. They took a lot of hours of my life and I remember helping my cousin to beat them. Every single time Rayman games amazed me with great soundtrack, great gameplay and gorgeous characters.'Rayman Legends' is no exception, it's very similar to 'Rayman Origins', but I dare to say that it's easier than Origins. Why? You can collect everything without much effort. Lums are quite easy to get in a first try, the same goes with Teensies. I still love this  game though. It's beautiful beyond measure. the art is truly breathtaking. The same goes with music, it's really catchy and I found myself humming to it quite often. Daily challenges are nice addition and they keep you busy, even after beating the main story. It's a pleasant game and I can't wait for the next Rayman's adventures. Hopefully, next time we'll see them in 3D, because till this day one of my favourite games is 'Rayman 2: The Great Escape'.To sum up, 'Rayman Legends' is truly enjoyable, not too hard but still a must have for platform games fans, and what is more important: for Rayman fans, just like me.

Posted: December 19, 2014
												I have beat this game multiple times on console (don't hurt me), and I can easily say that this is one of the best platformers ever...hands down! Whenever people hear ""greatest platformer ever"" people always point at the original Mario games, Super Mario Galaxy, etc. However, this easily joins among their ranks.  This game is a breath of fresh air in the platformer genre. Along with its counterpart Rayman Origins (which I have also beat), they are both really refreshing platformer games because of their unique style, in graphics, gameplay, and level design.  Firstly, the game is visually stunning. The game uses an engine called the ""UbiArt"" engine, which is used to easily animate any image. The animations in this game are flawless given the many different movements that Rayman can use. Plus, the game feels INCREDIBLY smooth, and there are no visual flaws whatsoever. If I was to ever to die in this game, I cannot fault the game for choppy frame rate... I always blame myself! Speaking of which, the game has a difficulty balance that can accomodate both new players and old players. Some levels can be a breeze, but then others you can die A LOT, especially some of the later levels.  The level design is really good. Like most platformers, each world typically has a ""theme"". In my personal opinion, I believe that the ""Fiesta de Los Muertos"" world in Rayman Legends is the best, clearly because the level design is so great in every single level (if you play the first level at the world, you will see exactly what I mean). What a lot of platformers truly fail at achieving is creating MEMORABLE levels, and Rayman Legends has at least a few memorable levels that will be stuck in your head. Even the boss battles are really great!   The gameplay is also really addicting, with plenty of different moves to learn. This can range from a series of simplistic punches, all the way to cartwheels (a slightly more advanced move). While the objective is to complete a level, there is also a ranking for each level to grab a both a certain number of lums and ""teensies"". Lums, unlike the last game, are accumulated and can be used to unlock new variants of characters. Plus, lucky tickets unlock plenty of different things, including updated Rayman Origins levels!   ...and the multiplayer...oh my....the multiplayer is GOLDEN!!!! This game easily has the most fun local multiplayer in a long while! The multiplayer is perfect for anybody, whether you want to play seriously or if you want to troll your friends. :) Another memorable part of the game, even though it is not as prominent, would be the soundtrack. The soundtrack really compliments the game in different ways, and I had a couple of tunes stuck in my head. Overall, the game can last you quite awhile, maybe about 15-20 hours to complete everything (depending on how good you are). What can also add to the length would be the daily and weekly challenges, where you can REALLY hone your skills. There are a few flaws, given the overall grand scheme of things, but hardly hold this game back from sheer greatness. I think that there should  have been more minigames along with ""Kung Foot"" because ""Kung Foot"" isn't necessarily my favorite part of the game. Also, I think that there are also too many ""clone"" characters (variants of Barbara in particular). To whomever might read this review, I would not even hesitate getting this game. Play it and love it! You won't regret it!			"

												Rayman Legends is just so much better than Origins. I remember talking, erm.. not so positive,.. about Origins. aside from the wonderful, colorful graphics. Well, let me say that Legends is a bigger and better game in every way; customization, unlockables (oh man, they keep on coming), secrets; there seems to be much more variety this time around and I couldn't recommend this game more.There are 6 worlds to be completed, with the last one being more of a bonus world. Each world has about 8 to 10 levels, and each level could you take at least 5 minutes to complete. So it's a big game. Add even more secret and unlockable levels to that number and you know why it's called Legends. Each of the first 5 worlds end with a musical level where you just run, punch and avoid enemies based on the music. It's brilliant and it works very well. In general there's much more variety gameplay wise as well, with the aforementioned musical levels but there are also stealth levels, and levels where you have to rely on a (CPU controlled) co-op partner.The animations and graphics are top notch. Rarely have I been as impressed with 2D visuals as I've been with the last few Rayman games. No words can describe how this game looks and plays, you really have to witness it for yourself. This is art !By the way, the boss fights aren't as frustrating as the ones in Origins. There was only one boss that, in my opinion, was more of a trial-and-error boss fight, the rest of them could easily be beaten the first time around, if you pay enough attention.Rayman Legends surprised me in a big way and I'm saddened to hear that it didn't sell all that well. It has tons of content, so much even that most games look empty in comparison.Buy it. Cherish it. Love it. Play it. But, more importantly, enjoy it. How can this game not put a smile on anyone's face ?[Rating: 92/100]			"

												This is what sequels should be all about. Taking mechanics that worked from the first title and buffing them to a mirror finish, and then introducing new ideas to make it original. For me, Origins was a really, really fun and solid game and a great return to form for the Rayman franchise. I've sunk many hours (three digits) into it and, despite not being the completionist type, have been pushed to try quite hard to do so by it's captivating art and great soundtrack, plus pile of content. With Legends, Ubisoft has managed to recreate this gem, but better. It's as simple as that.The UbiArt engine is slick at all times and always stable, the game is even prettier then the first and, somehow, even more tuneful. I haven't anything to complain about yet, except perhaps that it's not occasionally as brutal as Origins in spots, but there's always plenty more in the game, and I haven't even mentioned the online challenges yet where the player competes against a global leaderboard.If you like platformers, you'll probably love this game. It's fast, it's competitive and is sensibly integrated into online challenges, and doesn't suffer very much from being originally WiiU exclusive. It's my favorite game of 2013 (previously a title given to Revengeance), and a perfect 10 in my books.I do recommend picking up Origins before this one if you're a newcomer to the franchise, though. You will simply be missing out otherwise and it has come down drastically in price.			"

I then tried to uninstall and reinstall UPlay and once I did this I was greeted with a message asking me to enter the product key which I've already entered (minor inconvenience) but when I hit enter, lo and behold the product key is already in use! No way UPlay, really? I've sent a message to UPlay support but from what I read on the internet so far, the chances of me getting my issues resolved and being able to play a game I paid for looks bleak. I will be sure to read Steam's fine print and avoid the Ubisoft games from now on.			"

												Ill be honest here. Ubisoft has create some very discouraging factors for players to even buy this game. It has unnecessary DRM that forces you have installed Uplay and steam at the same time to just play the game. This is a rather rude concept when i speciffically purchaced the game on steam and want to keep and play my games on steam. A online multiplayer could had made this game a huge hit for many years and instead we get one of their ppl tell as excuse that he likes it local because you cant hit other ppl online... really? I could see a endless line willing to slap him for that. Still, the developers did manage to safe this game by making it simply amazing from graphic and gameplay to amazing level design. The game allows you to play also the levels from Rayman origins but has also many bonus mini games that unless you are really bored, you wont probably play those much.Multiplayer makes most games more fun but doesnt have effect on the whole playtrough so single player is just fine. Pc controller work fine in my case. So if you like quality games, you are a rayman fan and can tolerate Ubisofts flaws then the game is definitely worth it			"

												I love platformer games.  They're such a nostalgia blast, taking me back to the old days where I was parked on the living room floor, 5 ft. from the TV trying master that epic double jump without falling in the hole for the 10th time in a row.  Rayman Origins came along and proved that that old school platforming action could still be viable, fun and challenging.  Now, Rayman Legends has managed to come along and actually improve on the foundation that Origins laid! Rayman Legends packs a ton of fun in one single package.  You have unlocks to collect, in the form of lums, characters, monsters and even old Origins levels.  You have challenging platformer action.  You have varied platformer action!  You have a great sense of humor.  You have a great art style to make it all shine.  It's really great.  Sometimes, games of these types reach a point where the game becomes too difficult.  It makes the experience nothing but frustrating and then the fun falls off fast.  Even Origins suffered from this from time to time.  In Legends, they've managed to find a perfect balance in the difficulty.  Most maps are challenging, without becoming anger inducing.  You might have to take two or three tries and a particular jump, but the pattern will click.  These types of games can also suffer from repetition, but Legends break that up as well.  You'll find the puzzle style changing from level to level, even within the same groups, keeping the game feeling fresh and entertaining. Beyond all the platformer action, I'm really impressed with the style and art direction going on in the game.  The end levels in each section doing something really great in how the tie in the games music with the game play.  This really stood out when I was playing a boss level to a Rayman-esque rendition of Ram Jam's ""Black Betty"".  As I came to obstacles, it because clear my jumps were timed to the drum beat of the song.  As you progressed, hearing that familiar back beat, you noticed the entire level was timed to it.  I couldn't help by smile and play the level over a couple times, just to marvel at the fun of it all.  They do this on every level and it's an attention to detail that you don't see to often!  So, should you snag Rayman Legends?  Yes.  Yes you should.  Don't even debate it.  Really, this game is worth it at any price.  Definitely bring your game pad though, I can't imagine pulling this game off with a keyboard and mouse. "

												This bad boy has local co-op, which is excellent.  It also has a decent chunk of the game Rayman Origins included as unlockable goodies.  It is a solid platformer in the vein of New Super Mario Bros., and the art style and music are both excellent.One negative is uPlay, but it hasn't ever caused any issues for me.Definite grab if you're itching for a platformer.

												This game is impressively good. If you like Jump'n'Runs / Platformers you really should give it a try.  I managed to collect all possible 700 Teensies and I never had the feeling that I have to go on just to finish it, which sadly happens too often to me nowadays. I think it's easier than Rayman: Origins, which could be seen as one of the few cons. Especially the Back to Origins levels felt less challenging than the originals.The art-design is superior and the graphics look just great. It's crazy, bright and funny, but not too childish to be not appealing to mature audiences. Surely, you have to like that type of style and humor. The same goes for the sound, great work! The levels are greatly designed, not too long not too short and enough variety to keep it fun to play. It has challenging parts, which never are too hard and can always be mastered with some tries. Fortunately, the checkpoints are set really fair, perhaps making it a bit too easy.The music-levels are a highlight of the game, you run through a level to a song, while your jumping, attacking and the whole level architecture is timed to and built for the music.The daily and weekly challenges are nicely made and keep you going after you finished the rest of the game.I haven't played it with local multiplayer, but that also looks fun.While the game is such a great one and really conquered the throne of 2D-Jump'n'Runs for me, the only really big letdown is the usage of Uplay. Since you can buy it on Steam, why the hell do I have to use Uplay for online features. I can't even change my username! Sadly, I realized this after I connected Rayman: Legends and Farcry3 to it, with something like: username: uplayaccount … -.-Conclusion*Story: Well this is not the biggest part of the game, it's OK, nothing special but it doesn't need to be.*Gameplay: Great! Fluid controls, impressive varied levels, lots of stuff to unlock, online challenges*Graphics&Sound: Superior! I really love that style, not too childish but funny and crazyI give it 95 out of 100Side note: I played the game with maximum graphics fluidly and with a controller.  "

												Coming from Rayman Origins I was expecting to see improvements from the old game, and boy was I right. For the most part it has better graphics than Origins, the controls are far more fluid and the addition of extra races, Murphy, and boxing glove powerup it really stood out beyond Origins, however, they removed the map system and went for a Mario 64 approach by using paintings to jump in. It's more organized this way but it doesn't make you feel like it's all in the same big world. For some reason I feel like the makers forgot this is a seperate game, as all the new stuff gets just thrown in your face without introduction/explanation, for instance the boxing glove. And just like that it also lacked quite a bit of story as there are 5 of the same nemesis all of the sudden for no reason. I was very happy to see some of the old characters from Rayman 1 return in Origins and was hoping to see some new ones in Legends as well. Sadly enough Murphy is all we got, no Ly, Clark, or robot pirates from Rayman 2. The nymphs from Origins were also nowhere to be found, instead we got random chicks (once again for no reason whatsoever). I will list in big lines the positive and negative aspects of the game:Positive:+ Smooth controls+ Amazing artstyle and graphics+ Broad variety of characters to play as+ Intense fast phased platforming+ Great amount of mobility+ Good amount of levels+ Increased difficulty as you progressNegative:- Close to no story- Lack of explanation for a lot of things in the game- Throws random things at you at parts- Becomes repetitive after a whileIn conclusion I recommend this game to all casual gamers who want some fun action packed gameplay and do not care about story. For the diehard Rayman fans I recommend Origins. For a part because it had much more story (the nymphs) and actual ending. For another part because it had more rememberable music, map and character evolution (Rayman gains new powers like wallrunning and fighting). Making it far more immersive. MrTheMarkoman out.			"

												Great game, reminds me of the good old days of Crash Bandicoot. Music levels where the game action was synced to the beat were particularly fun. The only downside I can think of for this game is that they should tell you where checkpoints are and that the swimming levels were particularly difficult with a keyboard, since you can only swim in 8 directions (up, down, left, right, and combining 2 of those actions together). These swimming levels are much easier if played with a gamepad, since it allows omnidirectional control.			"

												Rayman Legends takes what was established in Rayman Origins and improves it. The vector graphics are back and look prettier than ever, there is the addition of a sidekick as well to help you get through some levels.There is a lot to do in this game, each level has 10 teensies to find (The little blue guys), as well as the challenge to find enough lums (The yellow flying guys) to earn the Gold trophy. There are also unlockable characters as well, collectable creatures, unlockable bonus levels from Rayman Origins (each has teensies and trophies to collect) and Time Trial levels as well. If you're a bit of a completionist like I am with these sorts of things, you'll have lots to keep you occupied. There is also the new music levels, which are very much like the chest chasing missions in Origins, completely timing based where you jump or attack in time with the music. These are excellently thought out and the timing is spot-on. These are a bit more forgiving than Origins' chest chasing missions though, having checkpoints rather than making you restart after each death.There are downsides though, this game is a console port and at times it shows, making some actions hard to perform using keyboard if you don't have nimble fingers. It is perfectly playable with the keyboard though and supports full key remapping (Which I suggest you do, I set mine to the Origins controls and it saved me a lot of trouble), but it may be easier to play using a controller. I can't say which is better, since I've only played using keyboard, although you can play one handed using keyboard, leaving your other hand free to do other stuff like eat a sandwich or write a book. It also doesn't really have much replayability, apart from the music levels which are awesome just to play occasionally, unless you are a big Rayman fan. Plus it only works through UPlay, which is not a bad piece of software but it does make things frustrating when you just want to get right into the game.Overall, this game is worth picking up, even at full price and the annoying DRM. Graphics are pretty and there is a lot to do. I'm really looking forward to the next game in the series,9/10			"

												I have always had a soft spot for 2D platformers and this is probably my favorite of the genre at the moment. It has got bright colorful graphics, great controls, interesting level design and it offers a good level of challenge without being unfair or frustrating, something Rayman Origins often missed the mark on.The main part of game world is divided up into 5 different paintings, each with 9-10 levels based on different theme.  The paintings all end with a boss and a musical level, where the action in the level follows the background music. I loved the musical levels and I wish there were more of them. There is an extra unlockable painting that let’s you play the musical worlds again with added challenges, but it is basically the same level.The game has tonnes of content with invaded levels, daily/weekly challenges, and you can unlock most of the levels from Rayman Origins. You certainly get your money’s worth here.Honestly the only caveat for this game is Uplay...I have had issues with it in the past and I know many people continue to even today. To Ubisoft’s credit, over the last 3-4 years they have taken Uplay from being an unusable piece of malware to more of an annoyance. So let’s give them credit for that, I guess…My advice is just log into the Uplay application once, set it to offline and never, ever, touch it again.			"

Make your life legendaryRayman Legends is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Rayman Origins, with Legends taking what worked from Origins and refining it.Pros:You no longer have to unlock powers separately, meaning those who’ve already played through Origins can experience the entire moveset from the start.A fantastic artstyle that’s a lot more shinier and polished than Rayman Origins.A large pools of fun and great levels, backed by good level design.Additional modes like Challenges and Kung Foot help make the experience more replayable for both local co-op and singleplayer gamers!Surprisingly well optimised for lower-end computers!Nitpicks:The bonus “Creatures” element of the game is completely unnecessaryBeing locked out of certain levels in the challenges mode by a leveling system is frustratingOnline Multiplayer would had really made modes like Kung Foot more popular.The levels containing Murphy feel a lot more repetitive than normal, although at least they aren’t auto-scrollers.Cons:For a mostly local cooperative game, there’s no excuse for this to require Uplay., even if it has a lot of somewhat unnecessary online activities.The ReviewAs someone who grew up playing Rayman, I adored the return-to-form that was Rayman Origins, and Legends continue the trend with new levels, shinier graphics, and a ton of additional packed goodies.Rayman Legends is a mostly 2D platformer with a lot of collectathon elements, but it’s great to know that collecting all of the teensies is much a major requirement, which allows for speedrunning. There’s a huge amount of levels to play, and since you aren’t restricted in playing all of the worlds in order, you are given a lot more freedom to tackle levels! The return of 4-player co-op is good fun, although it quickly devolves the game into a chaotic mess, so completionists are better off playing alone (Which is still fun!).Gameplay for the most part, is as refined as Rayman Origins. The controls are responsive, and your moveset is versatile but simplistic enough that you are given a lot more control. It’s actually really difficult to talk about this game because of how perfect controlling the characters is. The physics, the button layouts, it just feels so natural. However, for keyboard players, I highly recommend picking up a controller to play this game, as with other platformers.The newest mechanic in Legends is of course, Murphy. By the press of a button, you can have him slap switches, tickle enemies, and cut ropes. For the most part, however, Murphy’s only included in some of the levels, which I’m perfectly fine with because Murphy feels heavily gimped from the Wii U version.As someone who’s 100% complete the game on Wii U, I’ve noticed huge differences between this version and the Wii U one as well. For one, there’s no 5 player co-op, or the ability to have complete control over Murphy. Both versions seem to trade one thing for another; The Wii U version allows complete control at the cost of not having direct control over your player in single-player mode, and the PC version lets you control your character, but have more limited control when it comes to Murphy. A good middle between the two would had fixed the problems, but both versions are stuck with the levels containing Murphy being either a slog or being quite the unintentional challenge when speedrunning/completing comes to play.The reason why Murphy levels feel weird in the PC version is because they were designed to be slow-paced, which makes them unintentionally more difficult now that you have full control over your character and can freely run.The game includes a wealth of side-modes to play, and while they aren’t anything to write home about, they are nice additions. Challenges make for a unique set of leaderboard challenges that’s constantly reset weekly (although a lot of the challenges are the same things from past rotations and can get repetitive), and Kung Foot is an insane blast to play. However, the addition of a XP bar to lock challenges and the “Creatures” addition seem to be completely unnecessary, and only serve to make 100%ing this game feel more like a chore. Also, Online Multiplayer would had really helped when it came to modes like Kung Foot, because I can’t really get my friends together all the time to play it.Presentation-Wise, Rayman Legends nails it. While I like the more zany look of Rayman Origins, Legends polishes up the artstyle to look completely unique and beautiful. When certain enemies or objects are shown as a 3D model, it doesn’t look odd or unusual, making it a solid blend of 2D and 3D visuals. It’s music is a joy to listen to, despite being dangerously close to being generic medieval fare. The UI mostly doesn’t distract the player, although the constant in-game notifications definitely are annoying.So how’s the PC version of the game? Surprisingly good! I managed to get it running 60fps on my laptop (which seems to like running games at terrible framerates), and it’s been doing superb for me on my main PC (to no surprise). If you have a low-end computer, you should give it a shot, it isn’t as intensive as it looks.Unfortunately, the game requires uPlay (which is weird because Rayman Origins didn’t!), and it’s as big of a mess as always.TL;DR - Rayman Legends is a fantastic platformer with splendid controls, tons of bonuses, and a stellar presentation. It’s still my GOTY of 2014!

												I can't belive that i didnt picked this game earlier up.One of my steam friend bought it for me, i can't thank him enough.I'm now currently at World 4-2. So far everything that i saw was absolutly fun, cool and i could play these levels over and over, just because they are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome.One thing that this game makes it so cool is the fact of the humorous and jokes this game has to offer. Want to play as a duck? Wanna see a random giant wrestling guy falling from top to bottom just you can go on? Or do you just want to hear a plant singing by slapping his eye?Then this game should give you a good laugh.Gameplay: Nothing here changed since Origins, which i also played too (Wiii Version). I feel like Legends is easier then Origins. I had my problems getting progress in the previous game, probably because i was back there a child which had nothing better to do. Also, the levels from Legends are in my option better, but it's also cool to see that you can play the previous levels from Origins, i really like that.Bosses that i had to beat were top. My favourite one HAS to be the 3rd boss.The biggest feature are the music levels. Diffirent covers from songs, like from Black Mary, Eye of the Tiger and so on. I NEVER had so much fun playing these Music Levels. They are completly new and fresh also. if some DLC's were avalible, i would defendly try them out. Also Castle Rack has to be the best one.Soundtracks: Some soundtrack from Origins were re-used, but that doesnt matter. The soundtrack is often outstanding, is fitting really good in the currently situation you are in. I was imaging i were in a mission impossible in World 4-1, damn that was perfectly. Challenge: I never had the experience yet to be in a trial and error section. Otherwise, the game isnt too easy, and isnt too hard.  Mixing the difficulty perfect together makes an awesome game experience.Overall, this game is it money worth. Buy it now if you can!  Trust me! You will never have more fun then playing this!10/10			"

												This is one of the prettiest platformers I have played.Also one of the chillest, which is weird since the original Rayman game was  extremely difficult in several parts. This one probably gets pretty hard in some optional parts, I guess, but at an initial level, it is quite easy and relaxing. No lives, no pressure.Also, it has a mariachi version of  Eye of the Tiger, in one of the musically synchronized levels, and that is just amazing and delightful.Definitely pick this up if you have the least interest in pretty platformers.E: On the August 17th  2016 and for a month afterwards, Rayman Origins will be  free on Uplay. While it has less  content (and said content is mostly included in legends) than Legends, it is an amazing platformer in its own right, and  FREE! For awhile at least.			"

												I have to say, this is a pretty inspired platformer. The controls are simple, power-ups are few, but instead you get treated to some seriously well designed environments. The daily and weekly challenges are a testament to how much gameplay variety the game has. There are enough background touches that replaying a level a few times, you'll notice things that you missed the first time through. The musical stages are a treat for the eyes, and a nice homage to the early auto-play ROM hacks (i.e. SMW Kumikyoku) which would do the same thing. (though you need to jump and fire to the beat, of course)You don't have a lives counter. When you die, you just start back at some arbitrary checkpoint. You can also just opt to restart at the last checkpoint via the pause menu if you messed up getting some collectible. (lums or teensies) Challenge purists may scoff at this feature but anti-frustration features such as these are long overdue. Some players go for utter perfection and they can still impose that challenge on themselves. Those of us who'd rather not endure dozens of repeats of an entire stage for one difficult section will have things the way they are. Not to mention, anti-frustration features are much more kid friendly. Finally, Ubisoft cycles through challenges every day where you can compete with the world. They have you covered, though they admittedly do a miserable job at managing the hackers.The game is fairly non-linear, with paths opening up as you collect more teensies and lucky tickets.  Teensies make more standard stages available, and tickets (eventually) open up more of the ""Back to Origins"" stages.90% of what I _didn't_ like about this game can be summed up in one word: UPlay. The fact that they're using steam as a conduit to push their redundant DRM system which significantly adds to the startup time is appalling. One thing you better not do is check the box that says ""don't tell me again"" when you close the window with your key. You won't have the steam overlay available to get it again when it's time to enter the key again, many minutes later. I almost botched my install this way...luckily I hadn't copied something else into my clipboard. This experience alone almost caused me to knee-jerk a negative review in...lucky for them, the game is extremely good.The rest of what I found irritating were some of the pop-ups after a level. One made it look like an option but literally forced me to stop what I was doing and go play an invasion level. I also kept getting annoying popups to use the tickets even though I'd already responded to one such popup. It's my own damn prerogative if I want to use them all at once. I also don't like the fact that unlocking levels is somewhat RNG based, but I'm guessing that they had the sense to heavily influence the ""randomness"" of unlocking said levels.All in all, I guess I recommend it. Hopefully someday Ubisoft will realize they're alienating gamers with their DRM, and...yeah, I'm sticking with Steam. Thanks. That said, the game itself is worth the annoyance.			"

												Great 2D platform sidescroller. Very nice visuals, good music, interesting main character and great to play with children 7 and above. Supports controller. Has several additional modes besides the main game.Graphics 9/10 - Very nice graphics, colorful and pleasing to watch for grown ups and children.Sound 8/10 - Good music, not great and nice game sounds.Gameplay 9/10 - Easy to learn, not very challenging for grown ups however great to play along with children. Overall 9/10 - If you have a child who likes to play games, get this one ASAP. If you are an adult that likes well made platform games, get it on a STEAM promo.			"

												This game is a Masterpiece. Wonderful level design combined with some of the most beautiful art and animation that I've ever seen in a game. The music is also fantastic. Everything about Rayman Legends is perfect. Absolutely perfect. Except for the forced installation and registration of Uplay. That sucks. But its worth it. When I bought this game I was really bummed out to find no way around installing Uplay. But even with the initial disappointment I am still awestruck by the perfect execution. Tight controls, brilliant level design, awesome soundtrack, fun and creative animation, not so great Uplay requirement9.9999999/10			"

												If you enjoyed Origins you'll love this.  This is seriously one of the best platformers I have ever played.  The developers should be proud to have made such a refined and ejoyable game.  The balance of difficulty is excellent and better than Origins, I think.  I'm glad they let you skip the animation at the end of each level during the Lum tally.  There are a lot more game modes here than just the story too.  It feels like there's more variety to the gameplay than origins as well.  Well worth the purchase.			"

												Rayman Legends, a game that was supposed to be Wii U exclusive on February 21, 2013 and Ubisoft decides at the last second to make it multi-platforms so it was moved to September 2013. I honestly have played all the versions of this game but i only own the Wii U and PC version. Rayman Legends is a sequel to Rayman Origins where this time, instead of saving happy faces, you save the usual Teensies like in most Rayman games. There are multiple characters to play as even though there all the same. Gameplay is good however, when your playing Murphy levels, you cannot tap whatever you want unlike the Wii U version. This is frustrating since you cannot get some extra lums for a gold trophy. Every level has 2 objectives, get a certain amount of lums and save teensies. You cannot progress furthur until u get the right amunt of teensies. There are other modes in this game like Kung Foot where its basically soccer. There are also Challenges in which you do a certain objective everyday. There are 4 types of challenges: Daily.Daily Extreme,Weekly, and Weekly Extreme. The maps also change once its been a day/week and a diffrent objective like how far can you go or how fast can you get a certain amount of lums. You do get trophies for this which raises your Awesomeness level. Your Awesomess Level increases as you collect trophies as they give you points. Once you reach a certain amount of Aweomess, you unlocked all the challenges. There is also a lottery and to get tickets, you need to get a certain amount of lums in levels.I give this game 7 out of 10 because this game is literally meant for the Wii U, Plus the Wii U version has more content than the other versions like being able to control Murphy which is really good.

If you're the one for nostalgic games, including Rayman, then this is the one for you! The gameplay is superb, and although it does lag a tiny bit now and then, you won't even care because you're too focused on how fun this game is. ;) Some levels require fast thinking, multi-tasking and being quick on your feet (Rayman feet) as you jump through obstacles and fight off enemies that come in your way whilst a fire blaze is coming after you. There are also lever-related levels where you have a handy sidekick guy who helps make your obstacles a bit easier, as long as you remember to use this little sidekick guy by pressing 'w', or 'q' and 'e' to make him rotate the wheel/s. Furthermore, there are mini games such as challenges, and a sports ball-kicking multi-player mini game. Throughout the game, you'll have little bonuses popping up here and there to help you gain more points/life, and during the game loads, there may be a free life-line heart which you must grab before the loading has finished (if you want to!). You also must try to free all of the little blue guys (in some or all levels) in order to gain all three trophies for each game room. Overall, from a Rayman lover, I think this game is worth the buy, especially since I was able to get it 75% off (special sale). You won't regret it, and like I similarly said, you will have so much fun once you get into the grip of the game. "

YES, it has uPlay and this is one of the few games I've had legit problems with trying to get to load up with it initially (though I hear a lot of people have problems with lots of games on uPlay, so I figured I'd throw that out first)./rantThis game is FUN.  If you liked ANY Rayman game past or present, then you owe it to yourself to get this gem.  Is it any different than previous Rayman games?  Well, ah...not really, but the visual style is great and if you've played Rayman, then you already know what you're getting into.			"

												Here I was thinking Origins would be the best platformer I ever played... I am so happy I was wrong.Featuring a beautiful and lively hand-drawn world of wonder and expansive variety, your eyes will thank you for all of the stunning visuals this game has to offer.  Gameplay feels absolutely perfect, even with Murphy being programmed to a single key.  The levels feature plenty of challenge, abilites and indeed the famed music levels that will make you want to scream in exitement with every perfectly synced note.  Speaking of notes, you'll be hearing a lot of them from the same composer that wrote Origins' music... which means yet more astonishing scores to be experienced on just the soundtrack, since Cellos played as bass guitars are BADASS (look up ""Dive another day"" or ""Lost in the Clouds"").  Even after you reach 100% completion there are still new daily and weekly challenges to keep you coming back for more.You'd have to be out of your mind to think you can get a better platforming experience on PC anywhere else right now, it's an absolute no-brainer.*NOTE: THIS DOES REQUIRE UPLAY, WHICH SUCKS BUT WHATEVER*			"

It's an impeccably executed game in a genre that should have gotten stale a long time ago.The fully orchestrated soundtrack works wonders for the atmosphere, and on more than one occasion, the developers capitalize on this and tie the gameplay directly to the rhythm of the underpinning song.

Has wonderful artwork, great sound, many levels, and very lighthearted. Rayman legends was a slightly easier difficulty to me than Rayman origins. However Rayman legends is the recent version and shows the improvement with overall peformance by far. The minute i played rayman series, ESPECIALLY rayman legends i would play nonstop, it was so good. Rayman continues to improve and if there ever was a new game made in the rayman series for the computer I will definitely purchase it.  There is only one question left- what are you doing??

												This is the best platformer I have played in many years.   The art style and overall ambiance enhance the game experience instead of hindering it, the music perfectly matches the levels (especially the musical themed levels), and the controls are very tight.  There are so many levels to play and they are the perfect length, not too long or too short, with checkpoints on each screen transition, making some of the harder levels fun to master, instead of dreadful.  Once you beat certain levels and reach a certain level of collectibles, levels unlock that are tougher than the main campaign for those seeking challenge (they usually have time limits which require perfect control or else you will not reach the goal).  The steam version also has the previous game (Rayman Origins) included, but require unlocks to play.    For those who love platformers, this is a must-have game.			"

												Super fun platformer! The gameplay, the art, the soundtrack ... is all so well done. It truly makes you want to come back to the game for more hilarious fun. It's like Rayman Origins, but with enough new elements to keep the experience fresh (and imo it's more fun too).Have to say this is one of the most (if not the most) fun rayman game I've ever played. Rayman 1 is still my favorite in the series (though nostalgia is a big influence here), but in terms of pure fun, this game is just AWESOME.If you have some friends to play this game with, I strongly suggest you do so. It makes the game even more fun & hilarious. Don't worry though, so far I've only played singleplayer and that is a lot of fun aswell. Also, if you haven't played Origins (and you wish to do so), there is no real need to buy it, as there is a whole ""back to origins"" stage available in this game. You gain access to these levels throughout your adventure.So: if you like rayman, or 2d platformers (with humor), just get this game. It's worth its money for sure!			"

Rayman Legends capitalizes on the simplicity of the platforming genre, and does it in an accessible, streamlined experience.The good:  The game modes.  When you finally exhaust the immense amount of levels, there is still more to do.  You can play a surprisingly intense round of Kung Foot, which is soccer meets the Matrix.  You can play some levels from the previous games.  You can also do some challenges that are devilishly tricky.  Obviously, this stuff was added as an afterhtought, and it isn't as fleshed out as the main levels, but it was a smart afterthought, because it is still quite fun.The bad:  It's an Ubisoft game for PC, so you know what that means.  Yup, you're gonna have to deal with the annoyance of Uplay.  Booting up the game from Steam only to have it open Uplay and update itself, and then slowly clunk you into what you actually wanted to do in the first place, which is play the game.  It's unfortunate that this exists, because the developers had nothing to do with this decision and it's all Ubisoft's fault.  Bah humbug.Overall, this is a must own for lovers of local co-op and/or platformers.  It has a unique charm about it that is unseen elsewhere, and it's worth dealing with Ubisoft's incompetence to get to the reward of this phenominal experience.Verdict:  Buy it for any price, you won't be sorry.

Rayman Legends is amazing the game has stunning graphics and great gameplay. Worth the buy though a little expensive even for my favourite game. I bought it on sale and I recommend the same for everyone. :) Also no matter how much Uplay sucks it doesnt really affect the game.			"

												When you pop in this game, the first thing you notice is the poor edging on Rayman, the main character of the movie and the main character you control in the game. The Rayman Legends movie was done with Silicon Graphics Computers™ and the instruction booklet says the game's graphics were created with the same 3D computer models used in the making of the blockbuster movie.We don't know however if the game uses Silicon Graphics Computers™. If SGI Computers™ were used, we suspect they were only used for character animations because the backgrounds do not have the detailed quality graphics of Donkey Kong Country. As any good dedicated game-player knows, Donkey Kong Country was created with Silicon Graphics Computers™ and doesn't have edging problems.  Whats even more strange is that  Rayman is the only character with edging problems. All of the other characters look great.One question remains, why didn't Ubisoft use Silicon Graphics Computers™ for the entire game? Were they too expensive? I don't think so. Come on. Big Ubisoft is one of the richest corporations in France. Let's get real here.Bottom line, Barbara is cute.			"

												Rayman Legends is a thing of beauty!If you ever enjoyed 2D platform gaming like Super Mario Bros, or Donkey Kong Country you simply can't go wrong with this game. I would even go so far as to say this game is better.The controls are very fluid and soon become second nature. Which is just as well because after a few easy introductionary levels the difficulty picks up. It's all very nicely balanced, though. Levels that may seem impossible at first become feasible and you'll find yourself zipping through them. The feeling of satisfaction when you're conquering another world is a joy.The tunes are memorable. You'll find yourself humming them. The graphics are poetry in motion. Check the trailer and you'll see what I mean. If there's any drawback to this game (I have well over 200 hours playtime in this and my kids (4 and 6) about 50 hours between them) it's the lack of a coherent story. But really, who needs a story to a game like this? Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped by Bowser time and time again without any formal complaint. If you're into platformers, grab this game! You won't be disappointed.			"

												When Ubisoft came with the idea of heading back to the 2D world with Rayman Origins I immediately knew it would be a smash. And Rayman Legends tops that.Its hand-drawn scenery, the new characters and the (sadly few) rythm based level never failed to make me smile. If you like the adventures of Rayman and his wacky friends co-op, give it a try!			"

												This game amazed me on levels few other recent games have. For one, the game started at my fullscreen resolution without needing to be told, then I come to find out it supports a TON of screen sizes and even has windowed mode. By this point, I'm already wowed, but then I look to the left of those options, and what's this? Proper control mapping? And it recognized a gamepad other than the 360 controller? More than that, even while using a 360 controller, I can remap all the buttons! Just when I think, ""Wow this is all great, could it get any better?"" I absentmindedly alt+tab out to check something, and to my surprise it DOESN'T crash the game or make it have a fit, I can open it right back up no worse for wear! Someone, somewhere loved this game enough to give it a PC port with all the trimmings one deserves, and this is from Ubisoft, a company I never expect anything from.Oh yeah and it's a pretty great game too, it's got... running and jumping and stuffs. I like it.			"

												This game is the sequel of Rayman Origins and the fifth canon game of the franchise. Superior to Origins in everything, it features lots of improvements since graphics until its gameplay. It is officially the biggest Rayman game ever, with more than 20 hours of gameplay plus the online challenges that extend more the experience.. Although it isn't better than the first three games of the quintology, this title is superior to Rayman Origins and it brings back fourty levels from it with adapted gameplay mechanics and slightly improved graphism, but the return of the RO levels might make the experience feel repetitive. Sadly, the story isn't quite improved either, it is a game that mostly focuses in gameplay. Despite of this said problems and other particular ones, it is still an enjoyable game and recommended especially to people that still didn't have the chance to play Rayman Origins. Recommended.			"

												Without a doubt, this is one of the best games on steam.  (Or Uplay rather - heh.)There's a TON of content - the controls are amazing, the level variety is great, and visuals/music are INCREDIBLE.  Almost every level of the original Rayman Origins is included to boot.THERE'S ALSO A DAILY CHALLENGE FEED TO KEEP YOU COMING BACK - And you can compete with your friends to top one another, and even see the ghost of the player you're trying to beat.This game is GREAT in solo play, but it REALLY SHINES when you get multiple people to play in local coop - beating up your friends is loads of fun.  There's even a smash brothers-like soccer minigame that's a pretty cool party diversion.THIS GAME IS WORTH BUYING FOUR XBOX CONTROLLERS FOR YOUR PC OVER - Get it, wire it to a suitable TV or monitor that makes for good multiple person play, and have a blast.THIS GAME ALSO SUPPORTS 3D GLASSES KITS and in spite of the 2d characters has tons of depth of field effects and perspective tricks that make a 3d mode all the more cool.FOR GOD'S SAKE BUY THIS GAME NOW - IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I'VE MADE ON STEAM EVER.

												While 2D platformers struggle to stay relevant in the current AAA market, Rayman Legends was my personal GOTY of 2013. Building off from Rayman Origins, Legends ups the scale with more variation and scale while maintaining the natural flow and personality of before. Although the original campaign is of a fair length and difficulty (though slightly lower than Origins' hair-pulling time trials), it'll give a good reason to check back every day for new content.If you can't afford a WiiU, the PC version is a very acceptable option for the solo player. Runs smoothly and looks great.			"

Very satisfying to play.The game also features remastered Rayman Origins (previous title) levels, and you can play as a lot more then rayman (4 characters with a ton of variations between them).			"

												Out of all the Rayman games I've played I got to say I enjoyed this one the most. I still think Rayman 2 is generally a better overall game due to it's nice story and atmosphere, but this game is just so satisfying to play. Everything from the gameplay, tight controls, co-op, music, stage-variety, bosses, design, daily/weekly challenges and even the Origins levels are just amazing. The music stages are specifically cool as they implement the music into how you play the level. This is as far away from an uninspired boring platformer you can ever get in my opinion!The only negative I have to say about this game is probably its lack of story. Not that the story has ever been the highlight of the Rayman games, but it feels really lacking as it's even more basic than the first Rayman game!			"

												I bought this game a long time ago. Before I started writing these reviews nobody reads. Today I decided to reinstall this game  because I needed some inspiration, as I make games on my spare time and I remembered this game as one of the most amazing looking games I ever played, then write a review nobody will read. Every screenshot is an artwork. But visuals anyone can tell how good it is by looking at the videos and screenshots, so I'll move on and talk about the rest of the game. By the way, if you're into art I also recommend googling Rayman concept art and get to know Aymeric Kevin's artwork, the artist behind it.Now that I started writing this I realize I don't have much to say about the game. There is nothing new to be analyzed; you jump and attack through the levels. So I'll put it like this: imagine the best 2D platformer you ever played, it's likely done by a small team, indie. Now imagine if that game had the amount of polish a triple A game  usually gets. That's Rayman Legends. Every second on it seems to have been crafted by a hundred skilled hands and playtested to exhaustion. It's so well paced that at times it's challenging without being frustrating, at other times it's easy without being boring. At the end of each chapter there's a musical level where you run and jump as you do in bit runner and other rhythm running games, and it's so fun I was laughing out loud while playing. Laughing because you are having fun is not something I'm used to. Laughing of a good joke? sure, but it's not the same thing. It's a super nice variation from the previous levels and it does feel like a reward for beating every level. This is something we always want as gamers, rewards for beating the game. It's why we watch the whole credits and absorb every bit of extra content we have. In the old days we would examine every pixel of those static images of the end game credits. I feel like These musical at the end of each chapter gives us exactly what we want. An explosive and fun reward for all the ""work"".Also, it's not every day you see a reboot light years better than the source material. It baffles me every time I remember what the original rayman was like.If that's not obvious by now, I quite like Rayman Legends and I recommend it.			"

												Mario ain't got nothing on Rayman Legends. Slamming music, tight controls, eye-bleedingly astounding art direction, 4 player-same-screen-co-op on PC. Show up for the charm and amazing aesthetics. Stay for the super-hard-core platforming action. RESCUE ALL THE TEENSIES!Hands down one of the most finely crafted platformers I've ever come across. You owe it to yourself to check out Rayman Legends. Just make sure to rebind Murphy's context button. It's horribly placed. =DHowever, there's a pretty big asterisk to this review: Like most Ubisoft games, this game requres you to maintain a Ubisoft Uplay account in order to run the game. I don't care, personally, but a lot of people are turned off by draconian DRM measures that Ubi has put in place. Making matters even more confusing, Ubi is evolving Uplay into its own digital distribution platform ala Steam. So it's like Steam-ception. It's a Steam within a Steam, albiet a Steam that is geared towards Ubi's publisher proclivities. So, to recap, you have to download a digitial distribution service through your digital distribution service in order to play the game. Like I said, doesn't bother me, but I know it sure as hell bothers a lot of people.			"

												Almost everything about this game, when it comes to platforming terms is perfect. The graphics and gameplay was something to look at, and had a shorter delay time than what Gabe Newell had mistaken to be lunch: Half Life 2 episode 3. Ubisoft outdid themselves once again for making another great recovery from that raving rabbids horror show, that nearly destroyed rayman. However, that logging in to ubisoft garbage was quite annoying and have made access a little more complicated...(especially the blasted updating)Think back to the other Rayman greats like Rayman 3: The Hoodlum Havoc or Rayman M. You HAVE the disc, you GOT the disc! You can do anything with it. Except using it as toliet paper like I do with any disc that has Call of Duty in it. This game's whimsical structure was quite charming, but could have had bosses that actually connects to the story and maybe not always giants. And an actual final boss next time. 9/10			"

												This is actually one of the greatest Games of this Year, and maybe one of the greatest 2D Platformers of all time.The Artstyle has not changed a lot in comparison to Rayman Origins, but is improved at the right spots and looks even greater.The Soundtrack is incredible (One of the bests this Year) and has a special, really creative use in some of the Levels.The controls are really smooth and the gameplay is all in all really fun and varied.That is due to the pure Creativity of the developers of the game, because in all of the levels, which are all great designed and full of great, fresh ideas, like the greek maze or the best idea of the year, the music levels, which are perfect designed and a lot of fun, even if they aren`t that easy.This game is a Must-Have for everyone who loves Platformers.Better with gamepad.

												Good platforming fun. Has great local co-op for up to four people, rotating weekly challenges, and a whole ton of other content. Filled to the brim with good times. The worst thing about this game is U-play, which, for 98% of people, is not problematic at all. If you're in the 2%, this game will suck to play. I had no problems with it, and it continues to be a complete non-problem for me, so I heartily endorse picking this up.			"

												The #1 best 2D Platformer ever!!!!! If you liked Rayman Origins, you'll LOVE this game! I also love how they've brung back some of the levels from Origins, to this game. My favorite thing about this game would be the Music Stages, they're awesome! I would say more, but I refuse to do so, why? Because that would be considered spoiling the game! All I'm going so say is that if you're a 2D Platformer type of  guy & you don't own this game, or if you never played this game at any point in your life, you haven't even lived yet! Try the Demo to see if you can run the game (I don't know what to say if you can't run it, I mean c'mon, it's a 2D game...) & if you like it (You probably will), BUY IT!!!! If you can't afford it then wait for a sale or buy it on♥♥♥♥♥or something cheap, because I can agree on the fact that this game isn't worth $40....So just find a cheap copy. if you own an Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, PS3, PS4, or even PSVita, see if you can get a cheap copy of this game for one of those consoles (I don't recommend getting it on the Wii U if you're a speedrunner, the murphy stages are super slow and poorly designed in the later stages). Other than the somewhat ridiculous price, this game is the best 2D Platformer EVER! This game even won an award for The Best 2D Platformer of 2013, which is why there was a remake of this game for Next Gen consoles in 2014 (Xbox One & PS4).....THIS GAME IS AN AWARD WINNER! An Award Winner that I highly recommend to you 2D Platformer fans out there :)			"

												This is the best platformer I have ever played. Take everything great about Rayman Origins and make it even better. All the great stage design, boss fights, and challenging difficulty is back. There is so much content in this installment of the Rayman series. Online challenges, remastered Rayman Origins stages, Local Co-Op mode with a fun minigame, Time Trials, creatures to collect, characters to unlock and a ton of awesomely designed stages in the main section of the game. There is also a nice statistics screen to keep track of all your progress.There are online challenges that change on a daily and weekly basis. Every player in the world competes in them and gets ranked by how well they perform in the challenge. You can also race against the better ranked player's ghosts. It basically shows exactly what they did during the challenge, while you are playing. You can also increase your trophy level by placing high in lots of challenges and clearing portions of the game. The music themed stages in this game are probably my favorite platforming levels in any game ever. Playing a whole level in sync with the music feels very satisfying. There are also a ton of other stages that are amazingly designed. The boss fights are very satisifying to play. The Time Trials portions of stages feel perfectly designed for running through them as fast as you can. There is quite a bit of depth in making your character move as fast as possible in all situations. These Time Trials make you realize how fast you can actually go.I have spent around 40 hours to 100% the game and do some of the online challenges. You can probably spend around 30 hours just to 100% the game and around 20 hours trying to complete the levels. Some of the levels are very hard and the online challenges have sections that are even harder. They bring back portions of the Land of the Livid Dead from Rayman Origins for some of the online challenges. You can also play a lot of the Rayman Origins levels in this game, but they have been remastered to make the levels a bit better designed. This game has everything you could want in a platformer. It is highly recommended and I don't think you can find a better designed platformer game than this one. Go buy it now!			"

												Say what you will about dealing with uPlay (it's deserved)... but Ubisoft's art studios produce PHENOMINAL environments.  The light hearted atmosphere and delightful characters are, at least for me, a much needed escape from reality and ""try hard"" gaming.  Rayman Legends, as with its Origins predecessor, achieves a classic sidescroller gameplay that you haven't experienced since the '90s.  10/10.			"

												Context:Well polished and rich game, reminds me of the rich, unique, original and well polished work that used to come out more often in the past, caring so much about the finer details that make a game a universe of its own. Considering how the CoD and AC series were initially at a such high level of quality, especially the first releases but later declined with every sequel. It is therefore a surprise how Ubisoft with its overall declining quality, managed to produce such a great quality work with this one. Could this mean the same for its other series? Only time will tell, since as Ubisoft has shown here, it's never too late to get back on track.Some snippets from the game itself: +This game as many others have mentioned, is suitable for all ages and is great for gathering friends and family in playing such a fun game cooperatively or competitively.+Every level is unique on its own, giving a different flow, challenges and experience to every level, this is one of the major factors that make the game so replayable.+Small details regarding playable and non-playable characters in their movements and reactions to the envirnoment, which are so well made that not only do they truly give an impression of the personality of the character, but aids in making the gameplay experience so fluid.+Manages to instill an actual sense of achievement, versus a ton of modern games that reward 'achievements' without the actual senseMinor negatives:-Requires Uplay which constantly and forever will have sync issues with achievements or saved games. (I never needed to backup saves for Rayman, but for AC:Unity and Sleeping Dogs, which overwrote my progress, I needed to backup my saves constantly mid-game)-Only local Coop +Counter: However this encourages getting actual persons to play with you in the same room, which enriches the experience. Also, there is an online score ladder, with other player's ghosts to compete with in the weekly/daily online competitions.Rating: 9/10			"

												I have always been fascinated by the Rayman series because of the good graphics, but I never liked the games very much and never related in any way to the main character. However, giving this newest part of the series a chance was a very rewarding decision. The developers did nearly everything right in my opinion:gameplay - just great, you have perfect control over the character and a lot of different moves, in part depending on your environment amount of content - the game is really exemplary in this respect: multiple playable characters, a huge amount of levels and additional daily and weekly mini challenges that remodel certain areas difficulty - even though challenging at times, the game always seems to be fair and does not lead to a lot of frustration (and I played all the locked and hidden levels)design - the graphics are beautiful, especially the vegetation and the sci-fi stuff. the level design is very good and keeps you entertained with varying design elements and a lot of funny and crazy ideassound - the sound effects and most of the music is great and original, sometimes very atmospheric, more often very funny. some of the tracks could have been better suited to underline the atmosphere of certain areas. the music-themed levels (in which your movements have to be in line with the music) are awesome in general, as is the music for the underwater levels  In sum, I can really recommend this game to everyone who likes to play platformers. Even If you only like some of the platformer classics, but stopped playing that type of game for a long time - you probably should give this game a try :)[fanboy mode off]			"

												This is simply the best platform game I've ever played!

There are so many levels and character.You must try this game!When you run this game after download, this game will install Uplay. This game haven't any achievement on steam, but on Uplay this game have many achievement and have a reward like you can get 5000 or 7000 or 10000 Lums or etc. (Lums = The name like COIN on Rayman, but it's call Lums), and you can unlock their reward with UPLAY UNITS.My Favorite level is CASTLE ROCK xD!

												I have only played 20 mintues of the game so far and the reason why i stopped playing is because i can't stand playing platformers with a keyboard, so I will wait untill I get a 360 controller. Besides that I do think that this is a great game. Its nice to change the pace sometimes with a good platformer instead of the copy and paste COD and Assassin's Creed games that we get every year. I can't write so much of this game because I have barely played any of it but I can tell you what I think so far. I was confused in the begining because their was no difficult options. I guess the game will gert harder and harder but still I wish I could have the option. I also hope that the enemies will get smarter and harder to kill later in the game because so far they are pretty much one hit kill, unlike in the old 3d Rayman games the take more hits untill they die. This is basically a pretty good game that i would recommend to all platformer fans. I wish that Ubisoft would release Rayman 4 tho and stop with rabbits and 2d Rayman games.			"

												This game is pretty great. If you liked Rayman:Origins, you'll like this one. If you don't have Origins, you don't really need to buy it, since this game contains almost every one of the origins levels as bonus levels. It's a great idea, and they're fun to revisit. If you like fun, cheerful platformers with good music, good controls, and a good difficulty curve, you'll really like this game. However, unless you really enjoy pain, I'd recommend finishing the main levels and quitting. By the time I realized that was what I should have done, I was close enough to 100% that I just soldiered through, but it really left a sour taste in my mouth in places. One of the best parts of Rayman:Origins for me was how the difficulty ramped up through the whole game, culminating in the Land of the Livid Dead. Those levels were monsters, but practice and a bit of luck would see you through, and man did I feel accomplished when I beat them. You needed every single trick you'd picked up in the game, and maybe a few more, but they weren't unfair, just brutal. Rayman:Legends on the other hand, has a land of the livid dead that's not new, it's not interesting, it's just selected levels you've already beaten with hideous graphical filters over them. Pixelating them, adding pulsing static and other visual noise, oh, and removing the checkpoints. Two of them gave me hideous headaches. Just for that alone, I'd have to say Origins is the stronger game. Legends also adds a whole bunch of timed mini levels, some of which can take dozens of runs if you're trying to rescue all of the smurfs that have been captured. Some of them are a nice break, but having so many of them makes the magic run dry very quickly. I'd also like to know why there are ~40 unlockable playable characters when there aren't appreciable differences between them. Not sure what the point there is. Anyway, overall, this game is in places good, even great, but for completests, it's a bit of a kick below the belt in the places it should really shine. I recommend it, but with the caveats mentioned.			"

Legends is Rayman's finest game so far, and the Ubi Art framework is nothing less than a masterpiece of technical witchcraft. Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end, practically infinitely replayable. If you always wanted to try a Rayman game but never have, I can not think of a better installment to get you started.

												Amazing game. I've loved the Rayman series for it's immersive gameplay and unique style since the announcement of Rayman Origins. Ubiart Framework is a fantastic studio and I just adore this game like no other. The game is quirky and fun, you'll notidce that little is serious about this game when you play it. It's comical and charming all together. Fans of Rayman Origins will definitely enjoy this game. It has a lot more features than Rayman Origins had-In this game you collect Teensies, there're 10 in each level, and how many in each painting varies. In the invasion levels, and other specific levels(such as bosses or music levels) there're 3 teensies to collect. Each level is just an epic immersion into the marvels Ubiart Framework can achieve with their technology. The music is phenominal, it adds dynamic to the overall gameplay and allows the player to truly get into the game, and the E3 press conference mostly emphasized one of the music levels-but it's not just the music levels that have great music. The entire game has a beautiful soundtrack that truly adds to the game's feeling. I only have a few complaints about the game...Some of the invasion levels are merciless and tedious. For one level I spent a good hour trying to get it just right to earn all 3 teensies. The levels are put together awesomely, but the spike in difficulty of invasion levels sometimes takes a toll on gameplay. If you're a perfectionist, it becomes more of a chore than something fun...But it feels great once you do get it just right. The daily and weekly challenges always add a spice to the game, allowing for players to earn more lums for completing various tasks in certain levels, it helps keep things fresh, and it definitely made me come back for more because I always wonder what's going to be the challenge for today. In this game you recieve lottery tickets after earning so many Lums, which is pretty cool-but you can also earn 'creatures' for your creature gallery. I never really understood the creature collection. They supply lums daily, but otherwise they don't seem very collectible unless you just, you know, like to collect them(personal opinion). Overall this game is amazing. It's worth every penny,			"

												The first Rayman game I played was on my iphone and I enjoyed it so much, that I thought I buy it on my PS3. A friend of mine lend me Rayman Origins and it was good. When I saw on Steam Rayman Legends for sale I bought it straight away and I have to say its one of the best games Ive played. I grew up with 2D platformers like Mario and Sonic, I played the New Super Mario Bors on WiiU but its no match for Rayman. Rayman is in my opinion the best Ubisoft Game and the best platformer hands down. It has so much content - unbelievable. Here you can even unlock the levels from Rayman Origins - so basically you have two Rayman games. The later levels are challenging but not unfair thanks to well placed auto-saves where you dont have to restart the whole level - which is fair because I think I wouldnt finish some levels, or I would have to play them till I retire. It has a very high replayability value and is definitve worth the money even on full price. The next Rayman game I will buy right when it comes out - im looking already forward to it. An by the way, the graphics are cool but the music is just awesome - especially the music levels. Love this game - go get it!!!			"

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: Rayman Origins was a very fun and generally very well designed game, if slightly flawed in certain areas. Rayman Legends is a very fun and generally very well designed game, if slightly flawed in certain areas. It's the same ""old-school"" platforming experience delivered in Rayman Origins, but this time it's delivered just a bit better. Gone are some of the absolutely infuriating and sometimes unfair memorization-heavy levels (for the most part; I'll get to that later). Out of the core five worlds, there were really only three levels that I wasn't too terribly fond of. For a game that has about 40 levels in the core worlds, that's quite good. In fact, my only ""minor-major"" complaint about the core worlds is the implementation of Murphy. It shows that he was meant for the Wii U version, but it's not that much of a deal breaker; just that it maybe could've been handled in a slightly better manner (let's say controlling Murphy with the right analog stick). Note that I signified the fact that the ratio of good to bad levels was quite good in the core worlds. There is also a portion of the game called ""Back to Origins,"" which is essentially a best-of collection of levels from Rayman Origins. Again, most of these levels are pretty good, but it just seems lazy to me to only bring back some of the levels, rather than bring back all of them. They've essentially given us all of the good stuff, leaving us no reason to go out and buy Origins. Much to my annoyance, they also brought back the boss fights from Origins, which are the aforementioned unfair memorization-heavy levels. They were the worst part of Origins in my opinion, but they are not the worst part in this game.That ""honor"" goes to the Livid Dead Party world, which in my opinion contains some of the worst levels in the game. The Land of the Livid Dead level from Origins was easily my favorite level in the entire game, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found that all that was new and Livid Dead related was another music stage. It wasn't bad, but it was still very disappointing. Then... the remixes strike. These are 8-Bit reprises of the music stages that you unlock at the end of each world, with the two primary differences being a lack of checkpoints and an (in my opinion) incredibly stupid and infuriating visual filter(s). The first stage wasn't so bad; it just kinda hurt my head since it was a fisheye lens. The second stage... made me not want to 100% the game, even though I had gotten 682 Teensies up to that level. I don't get motion sickness, but that stage nearly made me throw up about three times due to the godawful visual filter done exclusively for ""LAWLZ RETRO GUIZ."" The rest of the stages were more of the same, albeit not nearly as bad as the second remix stage.Again, despite my negativity, I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who anyone who just wants a pure fun platforming experience. Just stick with 100%ing the core worlds; the rest of the game ain't worth it. For an incredibly well crafted and fun set of core levels, a mediocre way of padding out the gameplay, and an immensely disappointing Livid Dead world, I will give this game an 8.5/10 for gameplay.Story: Skipping this, as the story can literally be told in less than a paragraph.Graphics: Man, I wish Ubisoft would release the level creator/editing tool to the public so that we can do things with it. Then again, maybe it's for the best that they don't; it'd only be a matter of time until the Internet poops all over such a glorious utility. What I'm trying to say is that this game is gorgeous and that we (as consumers) should totally be able to get our hands on the editor to make more amazing stuff happen. The character design is quite good as well, if some of the characters start to look like the others after a while. Despite this, there's a great deal of characters that you can switch between, so that you're not stuck staring at the same character the entire game. For proving yet again that style trumps number of polygons, this game gets a 5/5 for graphics.Music: You can tell that the composers had a great deal of fun with the music in this game. That fun of composing transcribes into additional fun in playing the game. It's not something that most people would want to listen to outside of the game (at least I'd think so), but it's still very fitting and lends itself quite nicely to the ambiance of the stages. The songs chosen for the music stages puts this soundtrack over the top, allowing it to receive a 5/5 for the music portion.Overall score of 8.5/0/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. If I didn't decide to be a completionist for this game, I would've rated it higher; however, the Livid Dead Party is still a pretty large blemish on an otherwise excellent game. Again, the best experience is achieved by just sticking to the core five worlds in my opinion.			"

												I'm writing this review at about 50% complettion of the game, so keep that in mind. Having played the Rayman Origins game with a friend, I knew what I was getting into. That being said, this is probably the best implemented local coop game I've played in years. They managed to take Rayman Origins and remove most of the annoying things (poorly implemented levels for multiple players, confusing map, etc.), and added a ton of new imaginative content that just blows you away. Seriously, the first time we got to the final level for one of the ""stories"" we were just blown away by how amazing the game we were playing was. I don't want to spoil it, but I can say that if you get this game and get some friends together to play with a few Xbox controllers, you'll have a fantastic time.			"

												The first Rayman game I played was on my iphone and I enjoyed it so much, that I thought I buy it on my PS3. A friend of mine lend me Rayman Origins and it was good. When I saw on Steam Rayman Legends for sale I bought it straight away and I have to say its one of the best games Ive played. I grew up with 2D platformers like Mario and Sonic, I played the New Super Mario Bors on WiiU but its no match for Rayman. Rayman is in my opinion the best Ubisoft Game and the best platformer hands down. It has so much content - unbelievable. Here you can even unlock the levels from Rayman Origins - so basically you have two Rayman games. The later levels are challenging but not unfair thanks to well placed auto-saves where you dont have to restart the whole level - which is fair because I think I wouldnt finish some levels, or I would have to play them till I retire. It has a very high replayability value and is definitve worth the money even on full price. The next Rayman game I will buy right when it comes out - im looking already forward to it. An by the way, the graphics are cool but the music is just awesome - especially the music levels. Love this game - go get it!!!			"

												Rayman Legends is a must have if you; enjoy sidscrolling platformers, played Rayman Origins and liked it or you are a fan of the Rayman franchise.First of all, the art style is outstanding! I was amazed after playing Origins as it just looks beautiful. Everything is very unique and have very smooth animations with each boss being 3D but looking like they are still 2D.Secondly, the sounds and music are amazing with comedic sound effects for hitting enemies and great music that suites each atmosphere very well.The level design is very well done with many challenging and gorgeous looking levels you won't get bored, with levels filled with secrets normally hard to get to, intense boss battles, fast paced music based levels and difficult time trials. There is also a extra area containing levels from Rayman Origins with the new art style and new lum system.The game also supports controllers and allows up to 4 players locally, unfortunately like Origins there is no online co-op support, although it does have a daily and weekly challenge which has online leaderboards and gives you prizes depending on how high you were in the leaderboards.The length of the game is hard to say but as you can see I have played quite a bit of it and still have not got everything with there being 700 teensies to collect and the addicting challenges you will pump hours into this game, if you do have people to play locally with then there is a game mode called 'Kung Foot' which is a football game where you have a very small area to play with 2 teams. The ball is very bouncy and can be hit all over the place making it very chaotic and fun. Although there is a lot to do once you do it all and collect everything you most likely won't play it an awful lot after although you may replay after a year or so or if you have a friend to play it with again.Some improvements from Origins stand out other than the extended gameplay and improved art style which is that they removed the annoying thing where enemies turned into bubbles on death, although the player bubble death is there which isn't a bad thing. The lums have also been improved making it so the first lum in a row of lums is purple/pink and if collected will give 2 lums and will pass onto the next lum unless a yellow one is collected making collecting the lums in order more important and can be challenging when they moving around. The amount of collectables has also been increased.Lastly, the characters in the game are similar to the ones in Origins just with a few more reskins but also the addition of the princess-barbarians which wield an axe as a weapon the first one being Barbara which each need to be rescued. Although there are many characters the reskins are very minor for the princesses mainly.Overall I highly recommend buying this game it is certainly worth it full price, one problem people may have is that it is run through uPlay which means you need to make a uPlay account as well and can sometimes be a problem for people. I was very pleased with pre-ordering this game for £25 which also got me Rayman Origins free with it. "

												This game is the king of arcade genre. It is absolutely beautiful. You will not find anything like this. There are no similar level in this game. I have never seen before such a titanic work of a level designer. If you are tired of shooting and ""strateging"", this game will give you the opportunity to rest in a funny company. It is not a hard game but it can give you a challange if you want to reach 100% progress. You will appreciate the music levels they are damn awesome!!! Not paying attention to this project will be for you a crime if you love arcade genre. He simply has no minuses or analogs.			"

												We bought it and after playing it for awhile it installed a uplay update. Could no longer log in, which meant we couldn't play. Reset password via uplay website, still could not log in. Tried lots of different things and it no longer allows us to log in. My son is crying and our money on the game was wasted because I thought we bought something. Very frustrating not being able to play something that is bought. Atleast we got a good amount of play out of it. UPDATE : Did get uplay login to work again after finding a checkbox on one of the screens of the client side UI that allows you to login (very poor design). After getting the login to work after this last update it shows a bunch of ads now before allowing you to do anything.			"

												You don't know Rayman until you play Origins, you REALLY don't know Rayman until you play Legends. Rayman returns to kick a lot of butt in this game. So many levels to play, characters to unlock, activities to play, and bosses to fight. Since this game has Uplay, you are able to play with other Uplay people and friends who have a Uplay account in Multi-player battles and challenges. Leaderboard and all, not only do you play the levels, but they have daily and weekly challenges for you to play. Seriously this will keep me busy for months.

												If you like torture and pain, if you like failing tens and hundreds of times in a row, if you like dying whenever anything touches you, if you like repeating the same area over and over again until getting the perfect score, this is the game for you. It contains so many challenges that it's hard to count them all.Lack of Steam achievements (well, at least Uplay achievements work) and online co-op and cloud saves, extremely slow startup of Uplay, no instructions on advanced moves, issues with servers* and other drawbacks are annoying, but I can bear with it because it's one of the best platformers ever. Before the resurrection of Rayman, AAA platformers were dead and the genre was left to indies. I'm immensely delighted that I can play Rayman now and small annoyances won't stop me.The game contains levels from Rayman Origins, but you should still buy the previous game because the gameplay has been serously changed. Graphics have been upgraded, but new remixes are not as balanced and perfected as the original levels.P.S. Music levels are AWESOME.* Server and connection issues may vary depending on your location. There are also some bugs with country/server detection.			"

The Land of the Livid Dead level from Origins was easily my favorite level in the entire game, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found that all that was new and Livid Dead related was another music stage. It wasn't bad, but it was still very disappointing. Then... the remixes strike. These are 8-Bit reprises of the music stages that you unlock at the end of each world, with the two primary differences being a lack of checkpoints and an (in my opinion) incredibly stupid and infuriating visual filter(s). The first stage wasn't so bad; it just kinda hurt my head since it was a fisheye lens. The second stage... made me not want to 100% the game, even though I had gotten 682 Teensies up to that level. I don't get motion sickness, but that stage nearly made me throw up about three times due to the godawful visual filter done exclusively for ""LAWLZ RETRO GUIZ."" The rest of the stages were more of the same, albeit not nearly as bad as the second remix stage.Again, despite my negativity, I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who anyone who just wants a pure fun platforming experience. Just stick with 100%ing the core worlds; the rest of the game ain't worth it. For an incredibly well crafted and fun set of core levels, a mediocre way of padding out the gameplay, and an immensely disappointing Livid Dead world, I will give this game an 8.5/10 for gameplay.Story: Skipping this, as the story can literally be told in less than a paragraph.Graphics: Man, I wish Ubisoft would release the level creator/editing tool to the public so that we can do things with it. Then again, maybe it's for the best that they don't; it'd only be a matter of time until the Internet poops all over such a glorious utility. What I'm trying to say is that this game is gorgeous and that we (as consumers) should totally be able to get our hands on the editor to make more amazing stuff happen. The character design is quite good as well, if some of the characters start to look like the others after a while. Despite this, there's a great deal of characters that you can switch between, so that you're not stuck staring at the same character the entire game. For proving yet again that style trumps number of polygons, this game gets a 5/5 for graphics.Music: You can tell that the composers had a great deal of fun with the music in this game. That fun of composing transcribes into additional fun in playing the game. It's not something that most people would want to listen to outside of the game (at least I'd think so), but it's still very fitting and lends itself quite nicely to the ambiance of the stages. The songs chosen for the music stages puts this soundtrack over the top, allowing it to receive a 5/5 for the music portion.Overall score of 8.5/0/5/5; cumulative score of 9.3/10. If I didn't decide to be a completionist for this game, I would've rated it higher; however, the Livid Dead Party is still a pretty large blemish on an otherwise excellent game. Again, the best experience is achieved by just sticking to the core five worlds in my opinion.			"

												You don't know Rayman until you play Origins, you REALLY don't know Rayman until you play Legends. Rayman returns to kick a lot of butt in this game. So many levels to play, characters to unlock, activities to play, and bosses to fight. Since this game has Uplay, you are able to play with other Uplay people and friends who have a Uplay account in Multi-player battles and challenges. Leaderboard and all, not only do you play the levels, but they have daily and weekly challenges for you to play. Seriously this will keep me busy for months. You don't know the Legends until you PLAY the Legends!			"

												A superb platformer. It packs a lot more ""stuff"" compared to Origins, not to mention Origins is pretty much in the game from unlocks. The 2D graphics are gorgeous and death never feels cheap. The levels are very creative - you will never be bored. The difficulty lies somwhere between old school and new school, but the later unlockable levels and ""invaison levels"" will be a severe challenge. Overall a fantastic game.			"

												Rayman Legends definitely lives up to the old style of Rayman games, with a little more extra features than the older games.It features over 120 different stages each with varying atmosphere, amazing music, and plenty of hidden collectibles. Each of the levels are hand drawn and beautiful to look at. Despite not being overly impressive on a technical level, Rayman uses a timeless style. While games like Crysis 3 probably won’t look that great 10 years from now, Rayman Legends will no doubt retain its charm.There are underwater stealth missions, time trials, and even musical stages where you jump to the rhythm of remixed popular songs that'll have you laughing stupidly hard at how at first you won't understand what's going on but quickly have a hard time playing because of the nostalgia that hits you as you go further into the stage. The inclusion of daily and weekly challenges allows you to compete with your friends, adding tons and TONS of re-playability. The weekly challenges come with leaderboards so you'll always feel accomplished having topped a certain percentile in the gaming community.The community is great, many of which have turned into speed gamers for this game.8/10			"

 Rayman Legends - A really fun and well polished platformer  Overview: Maybe it's just because I love platformers, but like Rayman Origins I absolutely love this game, even if it can be frustrating. Pros:  Great fun with loads of levels, including those from Rayman Origins Runs really well Doesn't feel hindered by the fact that it was originally going to be a Wii U exclusive Great fun for local co-op Cons:  Unlike Rayman Origins, Legends is not DRM free and requires Uplay, which can be annoying if you use Big Picture No online multiplayer "

												Wow, I have never cared or paid attention to Rayman. I tried the demo on a whim and had a blast. The graphics/art work/direction is A+ on this game. The level design is never redundant, and the mechanics or tight as can be. The daily challenges are a blast competing against everyone else! It is pricey and never goes on sell but this is one of the few games paying full price is worth. Even if not that into platformers get the demo right away and you will be hooked! How can you not fall I love with the music levels?! The Black Betty one is the demo is awesome!			"

												You know, it's funny. Rayman was once considered ""just another platform game"" but now with Sonic running underwhelming sequels and Mario failing to do anything new or creative since Mario Galaxy, it's Rayman whose ultimately on top and destroying them with what is hands down one of the best examples of a platform game in over a decade.The first thing you'll notice about Rayman is the atmosphere. With beautiful hand-drawn artwork and polish that is truly unrivaled, the game gives off an immediate great first impression. Fortunately it doesn't stop there.Lead by great music and fantastic level design, Rayman Legends manages to snag your attention and hold on to it for dear life. Constantly changing things up, every world adds new concepts and eases them in with an old-school ""learn by doing"" approach.With that said, it should be said that this game can get very hard. It starts out easy but very quickly ramps things up. This is of course expected of a Rayman game and wouldn't be one without being as punishing as it is beautiful.And the best part of it all is... content. The game has a ton of it and it all holds up to the same level of quality. If you're even the slightest bit interested, you'd be a fool not to buy it. Easily my game of the year for 2013.			"

												The game is worth your money and then some. I absolute adored my time with it and felt an 'itch' to play it every time I stopped playing. With so many things to collect and unlock, you could be playing this game well after you have seen the creditsI strongly recommend that you purchase this game and have a lot of funExtreme Rant Inbound (Possible spoilers) (Definite swearing)This is unrelated to what I have said above. I still had so much fun with all of the regular levels but this rant refers to the 8-bit music levels. Orchestra Chaos, Mariachi Madness and Dragon slayer an UN-♥♥♥♥ING-PLAYABLE. These levels are absolute garbage as far as I'm concerned. Mariachi Madness and Dragon Slayer aren't 8-bit. It's just pixelated NONSENSE and I can't SEE A ♥♥♥♥ING THING to be able to avoid it. Orchestra Chaos normal and 8-bit severely ♥♥♥♥ing lags everytime I do the long drop so combined that with the static garbage and no checkpoints and you get an immense amount of RAGE. Dragon slayer 8-bit lags too when I run up the walls right before the dragon part so combined that with being able to see ♥♥♥♥ all because of this nonsense you call '8-bit', I can barely stand to retry it. In fact, I stopped playing just to write this review so I could blow off steam before giving it another go.I strongly recommend you patch this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t if possible because it's not fancy, it's not artsy, it's not clever, it's not funny. It's just a bunch of pixelated garbage that would make the NES facepalm in disgust. End rant (Until I try again because this♥♥♥♥♥♥IS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ME OFF)Buy the gameEdit: Start RantSo raising the resolution helps a bit until the screen does that stupid thing where it full statics (Orchestra chaos) or when the screen goes 'Blarggaghah' at certain points (Like before the first time you shrink in Mariachi Madness). Now the problem is I literally cannot beat Dragon Slayer 8-bit because of how much it lags at points. It's like my character is lagged but the death side of the screen isn't so I get dragged back and automatically lose. It is absolutely ridiculous and I'm getting so frustrated that I'm tempted to just say ♥♥♥♥ it and not bother with the rest of the game.			"

												Lets start with my complaint about this game. It requires Uplay and you kinda don't own it on Steam. You own it on Uplay Basicly. I don't agree with not having the full game on Steam and Have to Download Another app you don't want. good thing that this is the only game that I own on Steam that I regret purchaseing On Steam. Sim City 4 is the full game and don't require Origin to play. thats what I thought about rayman legends and bought it thinking it was the full game without downloading uplay. Now thats out of the way. Lets talk About the game itself. Its a very good game that i recommend getting if you love rayman. I own Multiple copys and have no Regrets. I love how this game looks and plays Just as i thought it would of a rayman game. this and my oringinal game copy of the first game got me into this franchise on the pc. This has very good graphics and platforming is great. The negitives i have with this game as follows. it requires uplay, it can be very hard at beating the Nightmare bosses without dying multiple times (remember unlimited Lives), and having to play only 4 Stages that gets old very quickly online even if they change up the levels in onine mode.

												Rayman has always been one of my favorite series. And yep, Rayman Legends is not an exception.First, about the graphics. This game has came a long way from the previous Rayman game i've played on PC, ""Rayman Origins"". The graphics is STUNNING. I mean literally, it's like, the whole different game from Rayman Origins, from the world, to every character in the game, all have been enhanced, and they fit with the world perfectly. And the best part is, this game runs at full 60FPS in my crappy laptop. Yes, not a single drop, it's always stable at 60, all the time. That's the one i like most.Ok, now about the storyline. Rayman Legends, like the other Rayman games before, puts you in a funny storyline. Well gotta say, in my opinion, this game is made to make you laugh, specially when you're playing coop with your friends. Every levels is well designed, suitable for both adults and children to play together, not too hard, but also not too easy, just challenging enough. Also, this game has a ""Back To Origin"" part, where you can play the levels from Rayman Origins (but this doesn't mean I recommend you to play just the Legends one, i've finished Rayman Origins, and currently playing Legends, and tbh, each game has its own unique style, you can try both if you want)Thirdly, i really don't understand why people don't recommend this game because of just ""Uplay"". For the first 3 hours, i haven't encountered any crash, bug, or something like that. When i launch the game from steam. Uplay just pops up for a few seconds, then I'm enjoying the game, without any bug, or crash. (And for those who can't play properly because of Uplay, and want to rate down the game, here's my suggestion: After you've launched the game, saw Uplay pop-up said ""logging in"", shut it down, uninstall Uplay, and download the other version at Ubisoft homepage, install it. After that, you can launch the game properly)[EDIT] How could i forget about the music, the soundtrack? They are like, what made this game to become a success. All of the music, specially the music levels, are amazing, that's the part made me want to play it again and again (Still in love with the Mexican style music) xDDDIn general, i think this game is perfect to play when you want to relax, or playing with your friends and family. Seriously, i couldn't think of anything bad about this game. So yeah, my score for it is 10/10. Recommended.			"

												From what i've played so far, the game is really fun. Though, there are quite a few sections in the game where (assuming you're using an Xbox controller) you have to press Y to control a fairy guy to activate obsticles on the course, and it's a little obvious it was made for the WiiU's gamepad. It's a better transition then you think it would be, but it really ruins the pasing in my opinion, the flow is almost completely ruined in those levels. (Update: It's worked in a lot more levels, but in quite a few he could definitally been left out) That, and the added punishment for people who actually bought the game, and no one else, which is known as ""Uplay"" (A DRM service for ubisoft games as an anti-piracy method) is also used for the game. Multiple people have reported Uplay crashes when attempting to boot up the game, and they have also reported stolen gamekeys, so Uplay doesn't think you actually bought the game when you did, and the customer service is reluctant to help. So be cautious with the software. Currently, i'm unable to get cards and steam acheivements because of Uplay, so that's a bummer. Probably won't go for that completionist because of it. (just saying, Uplay is basically gunlaws for piracy, the only people you're punishing is the honest.)But, with the game's amazing art, controls, gameplay, music, and even a large collection of levels from Rayman Origins, it's definitally worth getting on sale, just in case Uplay does ♥♥♥♥ you over. Otherwise, i'd maybe even spend the 40 if you're a platformer or rayman fan. And it's easy to see that Ubiart put a lot of care into the game, they even added lore for pallet swaps. Reccomended.Edit: forgot to mention the lack of online multiplayer, because ""You can't punch people over the internet.""Ubi pls no.			"

												This game..... THIS GAME!!Since I was a child, Rayman has always been a fun game, containing the massive, yet just, amounts of frustration and fun.The first game, Rayman for the PSX, had me in tears half of the time, yet I alway went back to it, and eventuallyI got to the painted lands. and I quit.BUT I ALWAYS PLAYED IT AGAIN!I actually 100% completed rayman 2, which I found to be 300% better than the first, and the mini level at the end was great to bring back the nostalgia of the 1st.Origins did have some small bugs. Believe me, when you climb into a collapsable pillar (Ice levels), you have some bugs. But the game was nearbye goddame perfect.BUT THIS. THIS GAME brought the nostalgia of the childhood platformers that I DREAMED of. The music. The colours, The art work. THE  8 BIT ******** FRUSTRATION. But most of all, that music, colour, artwork and FUN. This is what most games are missing these days! IT'S BEAUTIFUL!Buy this game and waste hours of your life in this goddame masterpiece.			"

												A sequel to one of my favorite platforming game (Rayman Origins.) Legends surpasses Origins in every single way. It looks better, it plays better, more characters, more skins, and it has more levels. You can even unlock some of the original levels from Origins to play on the new engine.You don’t see many AAA platformers released on PC anymore, and it’s a shame because Legends is just a joy to play.I love the music levels at the end of each world. It’s truly amazing when you have each step and action sync up to the song playing in the background. One of my complaints is that there is only local co-op. There is no online multiplayer available.Legends is a must play for anyone. If you’re still on the fence there is a demo to download. "

												The best platformer i've ever played. It's genius from the word go.. the payoff levels at the end of the worlds are fantastic additions. Everything just screams quality and it's obvious a lot of care was put into making sure the game flows smoothly. Amazingly enough, it also has a great soundtrack to complement the action, it feels really organic and changes seamlessly to suit what's happening on the screen. As a nice bonus it even features the best levels from the previous Rayman title, itself a modern classic.This is a seriously underrated game here, the only drawback being that it may be a bit too easy with unlimited lives and no timers. That doesn't bug me at all though and there are more than enough challenges and baubles to make up for it.			"

												This sequel to Origins managed to surprise me even from the first level.First of all, the most noticeable thing is the flow of animation - smooth actions drawn perfectly.Second of all, its a great way to pass some time with your friends - both levels and other options such as football and daily\weekly challenges will surely draw some laughs (Plus its a great time punching your friends on the load screens).Last of all, each world ends with both a boss and a musical level - and as soon as you learn that, the anticipation to experiance more levels hits sky high.Totally recommended.

												Rayman Origins felt like a test. A well-thoughtout game, but a bit unpolished. Legends adds that extra pollish to both controls and art style, although that's hardly what feels improved. Difficulty curves quite nicely letting people experiment and mess around without being forced to progress until later on, and the controls are very responsive (even when used with a controller! Controller mappings are rebindable). The games tacked-on ""underwater"" world isn't actually too bad, more requiring critical thinking than it does skill and percision. Challenge support for this game isn't too unique, I've seen challenges repeated quite often although it was nice to see that I ranked at the very top of Gold-level players. Even if you aren't good at said challenges, a ""ghost"" option lets you hone and improve your skills and learn from other players.Although... I've two semi-obvious complaints. The Ubisoft DRM can be quite invasive before gameplay, REQUIRING updates to its service and making you lauch the game from its Uplay service (I do not approve of it, mind you). My other negative thought being there is NO online multiplayer. Enjoy crowding around your monitor with 3 other people shoving controllers into every USB port you have.			"

												So I was excited as I could've been for this to come out, seeing as how Rayman Origins was proabably my fave 2D platformer in a long while. It was on the day when this became available for preorder that I noticed it had mandatory Uplay DRM. I swore not to buy it at full price, let alone preorder it, solely because of that fact. I would not be the one supporting DRM in my DRM, no sir.I eventually bought this more than half off and found out that there's no option to disable gamepad rumble, and do believe that I loathe rumble.After having muttered some Ubisoft addressed swear words I started playing and...  I forgot about my well-founded self-rightous hate in all but a few minutes. It's slick, intuitive and responsive, the sound design is one of the best you'll ever find and the graphics are sure to make you widen up your eyes on occasion.Do I recommend getting this game? Of course I do. Do I recommend getting this game on Steam? Not necessarily.			"

												Rayman Origins has the benefit of being DRM-free (even on Steam) and cheaper. Rayman Legends has the advantage of more varied levels, enhanced graphics (although whether or not they're actually better is debatable), more characters, and... containing most of the levels from Rayman Origins as unlockables. It also has the disadvantage of being tied to Uplay for pretty much the sole purpose of the daily challenge feature... which has to date not worked for me even once.If you can stomach Uplay (which I have had more than my share of issues with, personally), it's the better game, and an ace example of platforming.

There's no more flying mosquitos (which were the most boring part of Origins) but there is a kind of gimmicky green guy that appears every so often. He's not that bad but you won't really be hoping to see him. Otherwise I love it. Pretty much the same as Origins but better by just enough, and thats good enough for me. It has a lot of levels from Rayman Origins (a lot with the dumb mosquito) in it, but not all of them. It was just a great time. If you like 2D platformers, you should really get this one.

												Rayman has always been a fun franchise.  Legends is no exception.  Quick, fast-paced gameplay keeps you engaged while a great soundtrack provides a suitably energetic backdrop for  the polished graphics.  To clarify, what I'm talking about is, if you've ever heard the phrase ""polished to a mirror finish"" only they started with mirrors and polished THOSE to a mirror finish.  The graphics on this game are less graphics and more just plain art.  The game is teeming with environments and characters that are vibrant and full of humor while some rotating challenges give you reason to pick up the game even after not playing for a while.  Between the slick platforming that smartly straddles the line between fun and annoying and the zany characters, you could theoretically get a good number of hours out of this.It's a shame that none of that matters.  Rayman isn't tarnished by some small issue, it's not marred by some defect, it's truly maimed, defenestrated then lit on fire and run-over by a garbage truck named Uplay.   If you're unfamiliar with Uplay, I want you to imagine something which is both uninteresting and yet rage-inducing.  A program which is supposed to launch other programs but magically doesn't when you want it to.  Imagine something which takes up disk space, memory and wants to start at startup just like a real program but isn't useful.  A program which, and I don't want to cause you to panic, makes EA Origin look like a decent launcher.If you're having a good time imagining that, you should call Ubisoft HR because I bet they'd love to have you working for them.  Then again, if you're on Steam, you might not be ""out of touch with the gaming community as a whole"" which is apparently a job requirement for working there.			"

												I'd never played a Rayman game before and so I had absolutely no idea what to expect when I started up Rayman Legends for the first time. Man, was I ever pleasantly surprised! It's truly one of the most fun games I've ever played. While not particularly deep from a gameplay perspective, good humor is bursting from every seam and it's impossible not to be swept along.The level design is perfect and the visuals are utterly spectacular. I find myself playing ""just one more level"" to see what incredible visual treats the game has in store for me next. I also have to single out the game's remarkable composer, Christophe Héral. Music is as integral to the experience here as it was in classic Warner Bros. cartoons. You may find yourself replaying certain levels again and again just to enjoy the wonderful soundtrack. Of particular note is the fact that many of the tracks were recorded using a full orchestra, something which is very rare in games these days. Huge kudos to Ubisoft for being willing to spend the extra money to get such high quality results!In conclusion, Rayman Legends is pretty much a must-have game. I think gamers of all skill levels, ages and backgrounds will find plenty to enjoy here.			"

												This title was a complete surprise for me. I did not expect this game to win me over like it did, but its aesthetic and its polish are unbelievable. This is a must buy for any fan of platforming games. This is the culmination of decades of creating platform games, and they nailed it. -The game looks absolutely incredible. There are 3D elements tied into the 2D perspective and they really did an amazing job with it. The game is VERY colourful and looks super crisp on my monitor at 1920x1080. -The game runs like a dream, no problems there. The graphics settings are rather limited, however. -The game features precision platforming but at times it becomes a spectacle-platformer of sorts -It incorporates very creative ideas in its level design, including rhythm courses where your actions sync up with the music - this was incredible. I had a smile on my face the entire time, it is a must play, or at least a must watch on YouTube.  -The game is very deep, with tons of unlockable heroes and weekly and daily challenges, etc. Leaderboards are very prominent. The replayability of this game is unbelievable. -I HIGHLY reccomend you play this game with a controller. It is doable on keyboard with some keybinding adjustment required, but I much prefer the controller.I cannot say enough about this title! Must-own.			"

												Rayman Legends is a brilliant homage to the Rayman games before it and an excellent platformer on the whole. It's vibrant, colourful atmosphere makes you feel like a giddy 10-year-old and it's creative level design is both challenging and fun. The game has a phenomenal original soundtrack which rivals that of Bastion's, which is saying something. If you have any interest in platformers or just want to have fun then definitely pick this game up, it is nothing short of a masterpiece.			"

												NOTE: this review is written by a person who doesn't have any sentiments for Rayman having never played original Rayman titles on PS/PS2.i did, however, play previous Rayman game, Origins, and it was great. truly, a 5-star platforming experience. when i found out that there is a sequel on the way, i was all over it.i was playing on the launch day already, in fact, the two of us were. it's a great title to have fun while playing with family or friends and i highly recommend.(pros marked with '+', cons with '-')+ GRAPHICS.gorgeous, simply gorgeous. it was hella hard to beat the look of Rayman Origins, but Legends managed to do it. what's amazing too, it's that it has considerably low requirements for what it is, i play it on Intel HD Graphics completely fine.+ CONTROLS.works wonderfully, as you would expect from a game that has pretty difficult time attack levels.+ LEVEL DESIGN.platforming is amazing, it's tons more fun to do local co-op in this one. fighting is easy, but then again enemies aren't supposed to challenged you, they're rather obstacles in this game, similarly to barricades.my only gripe with level design is time attack/rush levels in co-op - the player who is slightly faster will always activate some events that lead to another player dying, at least we couldn't find a way around it. maybe it just requires being in complete sync, hehe.+ SOUND/MUSIC.music by itself is amazing. it's quite different from Rayman Origins, which had also had a stellar soundtrack, but while the first one was cutesy pitched-up singing, in Legends we platform to cinematic/orchestral top-notch quality music.special mention: musical levels are best thing to happen to platforming in a good while. Castle Rock is the best level in any platformer i ever played.+ CONTENT.there's quite a lot to do.collect 700 teensies - and it is pretty fun to do it. main levels have 8 (6 scattered across the level, 2 found in special puzzle rooms) in them, with time attack/rush/boss levels each having 3.collecting lums net you lottery tickets, which are a fun side activity - they unlock collectable creatures and also remastered levels from the previous Rayman game, Origins. yes, they are gated between the grind, as in you have to collect enough lums in each available level to get a ticket to get a chance to unlock a level, but without trying to get a maximum rating we easily unlocked more than 16 remastered levels by simply beating the levels.5 colourful words, each having two additional character unlocks, a boss level and a musical level. 6 world, as a bonus one, contains remixed musical levels. strangely enough, those are quite nauseating to play because of the fish-eye effect.there are lots of other unlockable characters as well.+ DIFFICULTY CURVE.Origins had one very annoying feature, or rather, lack of one. proper checkpoint system. often you had to redo way too long sections of the level, especially, if you missed a Teenie, and that was one of the reasons we couldn't finish all levels from it. i feel like Rayman Legends, while easier overall, is a good balanced game, and much, much less rage-inducing that it's predecessor.- STEAM INTEGRATION.yes, that is a con for me.i'd have loved getting achievements from this game. i'd love trading cards and background art for my profile from this game. i think workshop could have been pretty wonderful too, you know how many amazing talented people are there in the mod community.i must mention the uPlay thing. i hate being forced to use their DRM on top of Steam. it's unnecessary. and i'm never going to spend money on a platform, that is trying to force itself on me. i bypassed uPlay requirement in my own version, so i'm missing out on the leaderboards, but so be it. i don't consider this to be a fair requirement to begin with.- MINOR PORT SYNDROM.well, it was originally conceived for Wii U, only later brought to other platforms.this is not a major problem, trust me. the thing is. Murphy levels, which are based on QTEs and moving certain level props as you progress through them were originally controlled with special controller Wii U has. instead, in the port we control Murphy with a button push ('Y' on XBOX controller). sometimes he's focusing on the wrong platform depending on which player is ahead, and that can cause problems for players to progress at a slightly different pace.that's not too bad, but it could be better, simple as that.to sum up, it still is an amazing experience, despite the uPlay DRM inconviniences. i highly recommend it, this is a great, family-friendly, couch co-op experience that will net you many hours of enjoyment.9.5/10			"

												If you are looking for a PC platformer, this is a must have (even with everything we all hate about Uplay)I wanted to fill that Super Mario Bros. hole and although it took a couple of hours to really let Rayman Legends grow on me, this is easily one of the best games I own.  The momentum is naturally different from Mario and an attack throws things off initially but a half dozen levels or so and things will start feeling pretty natural.- Some of the best high resolution 2D art I've ever seen- Wide variety in levels (jumping, flying, swimming, timed, stealth, boss fights, even a Rockband inspired music level)- Non linear progression so you can do whatever you are in the mood for- Early and frequent character unlocks (key for me, as I'm not terribly fond of the original Rayman)- Challenge modes that make you feel like you are playing with other people work surpisingly well			"

												Following off the glorious footsteps of the fantastic Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends successfully follows in the footsteps of its predecessor and delivers another high-quality entry into the Rayman franchise.The rebooted Rayman series are 2-D platformers that do away with the traditional lives and continue system in most platformers in favor of a fair balance of high yet-fair difficulty balanced out with a good checkpoint system, making the game more about overcoming obstacles rather than trying to beat a game in a single sitting. The spot-on controls make it so when you die, you feel it was your fault rather than the game messing up or the game being cheap.Since this game was originally planned as a Wii U exclusive, there are several stages that are clearly intended to be played on a touchscreen, which involve using longtime series character Murphy the fly to do tasks such as moving blocks, rotating wheels & cutting ropes. These features work perfectly fine on controller, but these particular levels are not nearly as engaging as the rest of the game.This game also supports four player co-op and has a fun multiplayer mini-game. Sadly, the multiplayer is only local. There is also a daily challenge mode that gives players the opportunity to complete with other players in several time trial courses complete with player ghosts to help feel the competitive spirit of the addicting game mode.This game has a great deal of content that can be enjoyed both in single player and multiplayer and is a title that deserves to be in your library.

												I'm all for Rayman, I'm a fan of the original Rayman on the Atari Jaguar/PSX, it was colorful, and I was a huge fan of the very difficult and challenging nature of the platformer.  I have not played any other Rayman games except the original, so I'm not sure of those leading up to this game.  The art style in this game is very vivid and colorful, just like the original, which I really like.  The music is also okay, though I was not a huge fan, that is just personal preference.  The main ""lobby"" for selecting worlds and levels feels cluttered, like they just threw it together.  The movement is pretty good, my only gripe is that you can only charge your punch standing flat on the ground.  My main problems begin with level design.  They really like to use these chains/ropes which you can grab onto and slide down, but unfortunately if you even get CLOSE to anything that you can grab onto, it will auto grab whether you want to grab onto it or not, and you have to hold down and jump in order to let go.  After grabbing onto, say, a rope that you can slide on, you gain a lot of momentum almost instantly, which means if you are trying to get to something to the left, you have to let go of the rope and walk back, which, if there is an obstacle you have to jump over, you might accidentally grab onto the rope again and have to repeat this same process over and over.  It's not as though I fundamentally couldn't get past this obstacle, it's just that it happened often enough to be annoying, and that stacked up pretty quickly.  A lot of the levels consisted of me wanting to get to a secret area, but having to play around the frustrating issue of Rayman grabbing literally every rope handle and ledge in sight.  The level design isn't very interesting, every level blended together, felt pretty much the same, and left me bored very quickly.  Everything is very simple and quite easy, for the most part you can just hold down the run button and blast through all of the enemies without a second thought or ounce of difficulty.  They introduce a basic enemy right off the bat which is almost no threat at all whatsoever, I don't know how anyone could ever get hit by them.  Later on they give those enemies wooden shields, but you can just kick and one shot them just like the others, what is the point of them having shields if they are literally the same enemy and the shield does absolutely NOTHING?Basically, I just feel like I am just playing Super Rayman Bros. Wii U.  They don't really do anything interesting to pull you in and get you addicted and wanting to play more, it felt more like a chore going through each level like a zombie hoping that the next level would be exciting (never happened).  I will say, though, that this game would probably be best to play co-op with friends and not single player.  It seems to be designed with the exact same co-op as Super Mario Bros. Wii U (and the four five or six or how many other generic mario bros. platformers Nintendo made for the Wii, not including Galaxy of course, those games were a breath of fresh air).  Easy to say that I would not recommend a game that left me wanting to quit after getting halfway through the second world.  It's not interesting, it really doesn't introduce anything new or exciting, it's just, well, a generic, unmemorable platformer.			"

												As of late, the 2D platforming genre has seen a bit of a resurgence, especially in indie games like Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy and to a lesser extent in more high-profile titles New Super Mario Bros. and the like. Rayman Legends, the sequel to 2011's reboot of the Rayman series, Rayman Origins, is one such platformer, and quite possibly one of the best in its genre. Rayman Legends, like its predecessor, is very simple in terms of its gameplay: Run, jump and punch your way through each of the levels, rescuing the small, fairy-like Teensies (who replace Origins' Electoons) as you go. It's actually quite a good thing the gameplay is this simple, because this game's difficulty is certainly not to be sniffed at. On some of the Challenge levels in particular it might take someone many different tries to get past a particular area of the game, and whilst at first this may seem aggravating there's no feeling quite like finally completing that ONE level. Another interesting addition is the Murfy mechanic - whilst playing, the player can use Murfy to guide their character through the level, by for instance moving platforms or distracting enemies, adding a little variety to the gameplay whilst still retaining the simplicity that makes it so enjoyable. There are also additional characters, but the differences are mostly cosmetic and don't change the gameplay, though in all honesty this is more to the game's benefit, since the gameplay is OK as it is, and doesn't really need any different character abilities to make it any better. Also like Origins, Legends' story is barebones, quite possibly to the overall game's benefit. Not focusing much on the story means that the player can divert their attention to actually enjoying the gameplay and uniquer art style, which are the game's main points. I have but two overarching criticisms of this version, however: First of all, the implementaion of the uPlay DRM system, even on the Steam version, which is unnecessary and cumbersome. Second: This game was clearly meant for the Wii U, a fact that shows as you play the game. I thought that maybe the Wii U's features would transfer more easily to the PC, but unfortunately Ubisoft didn't really take advantage of the keyboard ands mouse in the same way they took advantage of the Wii U's gamepad. Actions formerly performed by the player themselves as Murfy on the Touch Pad are now performed with a single touch of a button on the controller, which if you ask me is a bit of a missed opportunity. To summarise, despite clearly being designed for the Wii U, Rayman Legends is the best anyone could ask from a platforming game. It's challenging, it has funny characters, enjoyable levels, it doesn't focus too much on the plot, and most importantly - It will keep you entertained for a VERY long time. Yes, it can get very, VERY difficult, but as you play it, you realise that that's the whole point: Trial and error, improving with every failed attempt, slowly but surely perfecting your strategy. And it's exactly that that makes Rayman Legends special.			"

WOW!!!Some of the challenges are very difficult and requires many failures, but in the end it is very satisfying when you get all those Teensies in a level.This is easily the best platformer I've played in years. Also, all levels from Rayman Origins is included* as unlockable content.My favourite thing about this game: the Music levels, for sure.10/10.

Overall, I give this game a B-.  Noteworthy for strong platforming and aesthetics.  Very weak on plot, legacy, and characters.Very fun platformer, for sure.  Difficulty starts low but it ramps up as it goes, and the game feels challenging yet rewarding.  This is at its core, a platformer, though.  Don't expect much from combat and don't expect much from the boss fights.  The platforming itself is spot on, and arguably the game's best strength is its music levels (watch some videos to see yourself).  The visuals are breathtaking and just in style with Rayman, and the soundwork is equally top tier.  The platforming, art, and sound all definitely feel like Rayman, alright.  I give these an A.HOWEVERWhile this game looks, sounds, and plays like Rayman, thats as far as it goes.  If you are looking for a Rayman nostalgia trip, I wouldn't exactly say this is it.  Beyond what I mention above, this game holds little in common with its predessesors.  First off, Rayman Legends fails to live up to the tones of the previous games.  The trademark ""grimdark hidden by a humorous and groovy world full of adventure and mystery"" has been thrown out in favor of a completely light hearted and juvenile tone, but somehow isn't even big on the humor from previous games to make up for it.  Rayman Legends is as it implies; its all about adventure, mystery, and exploration, so it manages to keep those at least.  Its not about saving the world or laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off, its about running through various locations while you beat up random monsters that happen to find themselves in your way.  You won't feel much for the characters and they won't inspire you to feel much yourself.  Every character is a cookie cutter of the last; they offer no unique expressions or unique performance.  Rayman won't be offering his snarky comments and you won't get the comic relief you expect from Globox or the Teensies.  Villians from previous games do not make appereances.  None of the additional characters have anything to offer rather than a sentence of flavor text and are cookie cutter skins, and feel quite out of place given the Rayman universe.  Nobody even SAYS anything to characterize them or add any semblance of a plot.  The most plot you get is the order in which you play the levels and the progression between them.  I give the game's legacy, characters, and plot a D.  Note this game is still quite good, but its sad given that this game is literally half of Rayman; Rayman was known for its superior universe / tone AND its gameplay.Legends and Origins are supposed to be prequels to the 3D games, but since there is no dialogue or plot its highly arguable that this is a completely standalone title.  This dissappointed me quite a bit, since the game's sells itself as Rayman's ""origins"" and ""legend.""  Please keep that in mind when purchasing this product.Also if you are eyeing Origins, don't bother since this game includes Origins.Another thing that might really get on your nerves is that because of the game's target audience, there are a bunch of really dumb minigames that the game is constantly shoving in your face, such as the Monster Room or the Lucky Ticket game.  In fact, in order to even play the Origins half of the game you must play that minigame around 100 times.Overall, I give this game a B-.  Noteworthy for strong platforming and aesthetics.  Very weak on plot, legacy, and characters. "

												This games is misrepresented and badly advertised. Not only does the store page not have any clear labeling of the forced uplay instalation outside the small greyed out print at the very bottom of the screen, the games crashes on startup if you are connected to the interent. This can be avoided by disabling the LAN/WiFi connection on your PC and disconnecting yourself from the internet and then launhing the game. Releasing a game in this state is not right from any company but from the likes of a Triple-A publisher like Ubisoft this is an insult to the paying customer. It also cannot be played in fullscreen on 1080p monitors when using AMD graphics cards without significant adjustment either. As standard this game runs at 50hz in fullscreen 1080p forcing a black frame around the screen. This can be fixed by setting up a Custom Resolution in the AMD Catalyst Control Center. You can also run the game in windowed mode in which case the game is displayed correctly at 1080p and 60hz, but the game does not have an option for full screen windowed either so this also presents the game in a less than optimal maner. Again there is a fix, and again it involves the use of external applications to fix the problems created uncaring and bad developers, you need an application to firce full screen borderless windowed like ""Borderless Gaming"" and ""Fullscreenizer"".This of course is not an issue for Nvidia users, Ubisoft are openly backed by Nvidia and their software solutions, it is only an issue for AMD graphics cards. This is basic stuff and the developers have made a mess of it. They have had years since the release of the game and still these issues have not been fixed. This game is not worth the money, clearly they are not using it to produce complete and working games. Do not buy this game.			"

Or if it does it makes you search for your Uplay login which has ridiculous password restrictions (so I can't seem to remember it). In short: don't buy unless they fixed it so it can run from steam.Does this happen at other game titles? You buy the game and you can't play it? I should really just ask my money back :'(..			"

												Unfortunately this game crashes upon launch for me.  I have tried to contact Ubisoft Support and they have told me that there is no fix for this issue.Others on their forums are also complaining of this issue, and the official statement has been to ""Disable internet before launching the game, and start Uplay in Offline mode"".  When done, the game *does* launch (and it's a GLORIOUS game).  This is quite possibly one of my favorite couch co-op games, similar to a less-frustrating Super Mario Bros Wii in that each player tries to complete the level simultaneously, but can punch or inhibit other players if they want to be mean.  The game has very excellent controls, vibrant and varied visuals, and a stellar soundtrack.  Upon completing each stage you are rewarded with a ""musical"" level that requires you to keep the beat almost like a platformer Guitar Hero.However, despite my glowing review, I cannot in good faith give this game a recommendation until Ubisoft does something about the Crash On Launch issue that turns launching the game into a chore.

												This is a Good game, brilliant platforming, amazing graphics, beautiful sounds, and great controls. However there are 3 flaws which makes this game from brilliant, and a must have game, to avoid, and avoid like the plague. 1) The World Map, unike Rayman Origins the world map isn't a map but an art museum, now when I think of adventure and action I don't think of an Art Museum.2) U-Play, this is forced if you want to play this game. So if you don't want U-play don't get this or any other PC Ubisoft game3) Rayman Origins does it better (at lease on consoles).So if you were thinking of getting this game, get it on Console to avoid U-play. If you just want a new Rayman Game just get Origins, it is a lot better, controls better and the music better.			"

I looked online for a fix only to find people have been having the same problem as me since the game launched with no fix. I tried downloading on another computer only to have the same problem occur. If I purchase a game I don't think i should have to cross my fingers and hope it works.The 7 hours I played are great and I'm tempted to pick it up again on a console, but I will never buy a Ubisoft game on PC again knowing that I will have to try and jump through Uplay hoops.

												Today's Review: Rayman: LegendsOverview: Rayman Legends inmediatly stands out as one of the BEST platform games ever created, everything about the games has been pulished at the point the seek to release a game purely fun, adictive and really adaptative to the different capabilities of every player, making this one a fun-as-hell game.Graphics: Dazzlig. This game was made following Rayman Origins model and work pretty well! of course the detail fit to the type of game this is which is of course not COD Ghosts but it manages to get a really satisfiying quality and the result of years of working on ubisoft really pays off.Music: Maybe the best part of the game, the music is simply 1 world: Awesome! You have deep tone balades and some amazing rock for times you just enjoy the moments were you complete a level and you get rewarded with rayman dancing, making the sountrack one of the best available.Story: The story follows the line of the Rayman series, the world is threaten again and Rayman (and friends) must wake up to save it from the evil (things?) that swarm the peaceful world. Really the story is just a background for the game and does not really affect, every person that have played the previous versions of rayman knows that there's no need for an excuse to kill the bad things and save the good ones.Metascore: 90/100 ""Maybe the actual 39.99 it's a bit high, the game worth it but a sale of 75% it's deffinetly the moment to get this game and you MUST get this game"".

												It adds a lot new levels and a new gameplay mechanic in which every few levels there's a little fairy dude who you can press a button and he'll bop an enemy or open a passage to help you through the level. It has a lot of recycled levels from Rayman Origins, but for some reason they didn't recycle my favorite world, The Land of the Livid Dead, or give us anything in comparison. There's online leaderboards for bragging rights and to help you collect Lums but there's no way Ubisoft is going to convince me to collect 1,000,000 of those guys just to prove to the world that I can. I'm not keen on time trial levels either so once I beat the game and the Living Dead Party world I just dropped the game, I didn't 100% it like I did with Rayman Origins.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			"

												This game is pretty fun to play, but the game doesn't launch through Steam, but instead comes with a weird DRM-in-DRM system called Uplay which often takes a few minutes to update when you launch it. I find it kind of obnoxious that Ubisoft needs to install their own DRM and registration system on top of Steam. To play this game, I had to register a Uplay account and register the game purchased in Steam against Uplay.Update: Uplay seems to have been updated recently to be less invasive, so I've changed my recommendation from No to Yes. The game is really good but the DRM is pathetic and annoying.			"

												The game itself is probably awesome.But... Ubisoft makes players' life more... well, intresting. You cannot simply buy the game and play it. It would be too easy. You need uplay installed. You need to download it manually (kill the uplay process first, and then reinstall) as the steam version does not work. Even if you installed the more recent version you still cannot play the damn game because the uplay, when registering the game, says that the connection is not available and you should try again later. It tells the same message every time you try to run the game.If you read this to find out whether you should buy the game or not, my advice is: stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from every game Ubisoft hosts in its uplay software.I really want to play the game as I love the franchise, but I feel like I just lost the money. Again. Next time I'll be more careful and check whether the game I buy use external services such as uplay or origin, or not.I hope you were more lucky than me if you decided to buy the game.			"

												Game has great art and has some nice music but has some serious problems which render it a frustrating and un-fun experience. The gameplay mechanics are inconstant and lack depth. Simple things like not being able to do a charge attack upwards shows how little polish the game has. The running attack mechanic is poorly designed and flings you forward causing you to lose the ability to accurately land after a run attack. You can't ""hang"" off ledges, which means you will spend a lot of time accidentally running off cliffs when you simply meant to get close to the edge.Collecting random garbage is NOT fun. The game ranks you based on how many fairies and mini guys you grab but at no point do you feel rewarded for collecting these things. The fairies are ONLY used to unlock characters which don't have any different abilities or anything unique about them. The mini guys that you find unlock levels but having to find 10 of them per level makes the task feel like a chore instead of a game. Overall you spend the majority of your time collecting items that serve little purpose.Enemies? What enemies? The enemies in this game are WAY too easy. It is almost impossible to die from them as they don't attack back, rarely move, and have such a short range of attack. The game would be more fun if you didn't have an attack button and actually had to land on the enemies heads, at least this would give them a shred of difficulty.The saving in this game is absolute trash. Did you just spend 10 minutes collecting all the random garbage in an area. Well you better not die because if you do you will have to collect all of it again. In almost every other modern platformer I have played the things you collect are saved but you are returned to an earlier checkpoint. Making you go back and have to recollect every item is terrible design. Not to mention replaying the music over and over which is annoying to say the least.90% of the levels are a complete bore and lack creativity.  Each world introduces some new level mechanic but none of these mechanics are really ""fun"". Flying = boring. Sneaking = boring. Hitting Y to move some element in the level = oh god so boring. Compare this game to any other platformer and you will see more creativity in one level than you would in this entire game. Overall the game can be summed with two words ""not fun"". It doesn't hold a candle to  Braid, Super Mario, Little Big Planet and many other modern platformers.  It is a step back in patforming and I am surprised that people have given it such high praise.

												The game has a large some of fun levels. Funny as well. Though the few annoying ones make this game not worth getting. I feel as if they did not test this game properly. There are these time trial based areas in which you have 40 seconds to save the three teensies. Most of which are doable on around the third or forth try, some take a bit more. However a select few require sitting for maybe an hour or more endlessly trying to even finish. Taking a break doesn't help, you lose the rhythm of the course.  If you want something with sever difficulty curves bend inward, this game is worth a try. Otherwise don't waste your time.			"

												Super fun and addictive 2d platformer with nice graphics and amazing daily/weekly challenge system that helps you keep interst in game. The music themed levels is just brilliant.Having said that, it's very easy to ruin all fun-factor for you just when you starting to push the game to its limits and try to 100% complete levels (collect 600 lums & 10 teensies). That's when you start to notice overall sloppiness in controls of your character and unregistered commands from time to time.I like this game alot and it's great for local-coop but I just can't recommend it for someone else. If you some kind of OCD-100%-platinum-all-trophys-completionist be prepared that late in game levels would be hard without any reasons for it.			"

												Many problems hit me as I played this Legends.- The level of difficulty is way too low. I understand that the first levels need to be easy for everyone to get used to the controls. But I never really had problem moving forward.- The level select screen is completely unoriginal. This might sound like a detail, but it really is a pain.- It is way less fun than Origin.- It counts too much on the Origin levels to last in time, I would have prefered more level in the main campain.- The level design is not as inspired as Origin. The thing is, Origin was so good, and this one is so OK, that I cannot recommend it. Sure the music are great (even if some are taken from Origin, again), the animation is beautiful, and there are loads of playable characters. This game introduces some very interesting features. But if you have a choice to make, prefer Origin to Legends. "

												If you're interested in Rayman, try Rayman Origins instead, it was better in almost every way: a lot less cheap tactics, more appealing level design. Will always remeber gourmet, underwater and mountain levels from Origins but can already hardly remeber any levels from Legends except Rock Castle (""Whoa-a-a, Black Betty, BAM-BA-LAM"").Also, the game was meant to be Wii U exclusive at first, so there is some gameplay functionality clearly intended for a touch screen.In conclusion, Origins: 9/10, Legends: 7/10.

												Game starts at a terrible default resolution with text going off screen. Can't go to options page without crashing. Couldn't find any fixes after searching for over an hour. Just a terrible buy esp.  with the 3rd party drm which screws up my bluetooth gamepad. Never had such a bad experience with a game before. It's silly that pirated software works better than this. Would not recommend.Update 1/12 - Have asked for support as of Jan 3 and no reply yet from ubisoft so there's also that. Also, I understand that this review has nothing to do with the game. I'm sure it's a great game, but the fact that the game is unplayable for me makes me unable to recommend it to anyone.Update 1/15 - Received support yesterday after 1 week + of waiting and after about an hour of trying their methods I gave up. Ended up just pirating the game and it ran perfectly. After a few hours, I'd say this game is pretty fun and it is deserving of the positive reviews. I however still can't recommend this for the PC just because of gamebreaking drm.Update 3/10Finally finished this game without ever using the official stuff. Overall, it's a great game but having to install a pirated version just to play it is pretty lame.			"

Legends has the same unique and crisp art style, the levels have more gameplay mechanics added to them, more characters to unlock, and plenty more to do outside of the main campaign, such as challenges, Rayman Origins levels, time trials, a soccer mini-game and collectables.  I can't recommend this game enough.  It's a 10/10 in my book.			"

												Rayman Legends is a really good sequel to another really good game (Rayman Origins).But in my opinion i think Ubisoft need more 3D Rayman games like Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc. I like the challenges minigames though, they give the game more replay value because everyday and week there are new and fun challenges. The story is... well it's ok. I liked the first storyline way more but this is still ok.One thing i really think Ubisoft need to look at is ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING HACKERS IN CHALLENGES!Sure they sometimes get banned but not all of them and this really grinds my gears.Other than that, it is just a pretty well made sequel to Rayman Origins with similar style but there are more levels and the graphics are a little bit more detailed. It also introduces a new character; Barbara.A small thing that annoyed me is that Xbox One controllers are not supported and only Xbox 360. So you will need something like Xpadder for it to work.Conclusion:Rayman Legends is a fun 2D adventure game that most people can both play and enjoy.I will give it 8.5/10.			"

												The game is very fun to play by your own and with friends the controller setup is easy you literally just plug it in and the game will find it but i had a problem with the game recognizing the controller as the first player. The game overall lacks some story i have only played the first set of levels but through all the levels they didn't seem to link together very well or start with a story or cut-scene to explain why you start there i also got  introduced to a villain witch you didn't know existed.The game works around a area with magic paintings which take you to different areas it has a feel of a ipod/android game were you can collect and unlock various things and complete daily challenges to get more lums.The introduction of the new character was annoying you saved a little thing ( i forgot there names ) and unlocked the new character, the character had absolutely nothing to do with the game but instead was an option character to play which annoyed me because i expected some kind of awesome saving thing or at-least an introduction to the character. It would of been cool to have that character have different moves or a special ability but nope :(The game is very fun dont get me wrong but i just wish it had some integrity to the levels ( seamless level transitions ) and to the characters ( character introduction and ai partner ).

												Best singleplayer platformer EU. It has local co-op. The only negative things I could find to say about it are that it doesn't have online multiplayer and that it's bound to Uplay (which, honestly, was a non-factor for me personally- launch through Steam, play, close Uplay, done). Everything else is absolutely brilliant. I played it with a friend who never plays any games and we both had fun- find another platformer that can say that; it is a challenging game if you want it to be, and a very enjoyable ride if you don't. Or both at the same time. Animations, voices, controls, content and music are all top notch, fun for young and old, 11/10.			"

The graphics are stunning and “magical”, the music is mesmerising, level design is beyond great for new creative stuff is added in every new one, game has tons of content and on the top of that you are getting new challenges every day in the week.

And the whole level works along with the beat, so if you like that song - that one level at least is really fun.Otherwise, I get kinda bored fast with these games.

												Every time I play this game, I'm just amazed at the amount of the love, care and attention that was so clearly poured into it. Every single level - and there's TONNES, even before you consider the fact that many (all?) of Rayman Origins' brilliant levels are also included - all have their own personality, and you're never left feeling like the game is just going through the motions. The music-themed levels that cap each of the game's worlds are an absolute highlight - if platforming set to a mariachi cover of Eye of the Tiger doesn't whet your whistle, I'm not sure what else I could possibly say. Suffice to say, I want this game to last forever, and I'm reviewing it with the sole purpose of hopefully convincing others to try it as well. One of the best games of the last decade, and one of the best plaformers of all time.			"

												Rayman Legends is a fun, addictive game, that improves upon the originals with slightly improved graphics using the beautiful UbiArt Engine. The level design as well music are fantastic, A few shortcoming held it back from completle greatness, but I still thorougly enjoyed it.Foremost, the interesting level design really shines with the varied levels that you have to overcome. The goals is always the same if not slight different. Rescue a certain number of teensies by finding the secret rooms as well as scouring the level for invisible walls and areas . The journey is accomplishing this and there is nothing better then finding them all  and getting 100% on the level. Other levels of interest are the boss levels as well as the timed ones that keep the variety up. Continuing on, the music levels that you find at the end of each area in the game are fabulous and are always something to look forward to as well as challenging in their own right. Lastly, the simple fair gameplay and tight controls. Everything required for a great platformer. Xbox controller is what I used and what I would recommend althought I'm sure keyboard works fine.For the negatives I wouldn't really say they are complete negatives, but something that people like me will have to learn to live with. There is a lot of online/leaderboard type integration. There are dailies and weeklies. They are indeed fun and definetly challenging. By doing them you are rewarded with lums which are used for unlocking differnt characters in the game that you can play as.The majority can be unlocked just by beating the game but there are a few that require you to do them for awhile. Although I have no idea if these characters are worth the effort or if there mere recolors they are considered superior in terms of cost and I would assume they are pretty good. The positives of this is there is added gametime to the game as well as a stretch goal if you really enjoy it. The negative is not everything is unlocked right after beating the game which means you were probably wont go back unless you really are dedicated. Definetly the most frustrating thing would have to be the Back to Origins levels. While all the good levels in the original Rayman Origins are included they are not unlocked right away. You will unlock all of them sometime after you've beaten the game which means you cant play them in their original order until then. This is extremely frustating as after you beat the final boss and done the extra world the last thing you want to do is go back and 100% those levels that you have done before if you played the original. It would of been a lot better if they were unlocked in order after beating each area of the main game. At the very least I am happy they are included in game as extra content and I applaud the devolopers for not making someone purchase Rayman Legends if they want to experience it.Kind of ranted on about the negatives, but I figure people know or have heard about how great is and should hear a different side. Definetly worth the puchase!8.5/10 "

												This game is simply AMAZING. Absolutely fantastic. This is EXACTLY how you make a sequel to a good game!Firstly, the artwork of the game is just like Rayman Origins, only there's a lot more detail going on here to make the colors and art style mesh a bit more together. That being said, the artwork is beautiful and despite the main characters' very colorful, silly appearance, the settings and areas match them so well that it's hard to say that they feel out of place. The music is just as good, and also brings a more thematic feel to the game, seeing as how Legends takes a bit more of a civilization styled world as opposed to the open wilderness areas that Origins featured. The soundtrack fits each world nicely, nailing a variety of genres and styles almost perfectly. My only complaints with the music would be the oddly off-putting Invasion level songs, which don't seem as urgent as they're supposed to feel.As a modern platformer game, the amount of levels in the game is extremely important, and Legends most certainly didn't disappoint. There's TONS of levels in the game spanning over five unique worlds, and for those who dearly miss the content from Rayman: Origins, there's 60 levels from Origins included in the game to satisfy both crowds. Legends' levels also add a bit more challenge to the levels which partly secures my previous complaint on the easiness of Origins' levels. Though some levels still did feel a bit too easy, I feel the challenge is still decent in the game for what it was going for; a game to please both casual and hardcore players.The amount of unlockables in the game is a great deal more than Origins, but it is a bit lacking. Once you've unlocked all of the normal levels, and the Origins levels, the only other things to get include costumes for the four main characters, though they aren't that special as many of the costumes follow a set theme with each of the characters, such as a Knight costume for Rayman and Globox, a Caveman costume for the Teensies, Rayman and Globox, a Dark Rayman and Dark Globox costume, etc. As far as the methods to unlock them go, it all depends on how much you've played the game as most of the costumes are locked behind a set amount of Lums collected to unlock them, going all the way up to 1 million lums for the final Rayman costume. Collecting all 700 Teensies also rewards you with a costume, which I think is pretty underwhelming. Though the Warrior Princess characters are just different costumes for Barbara, I do like the different amounts of variety in clothing, hair styles and colors they use with each of them. It's a nice touch and they at least added more than 2 extra costumes for Rayman this time.The game plays very fluently, the controls are very well thought out and easy to use, so most of the gameplay is reliant on the player's skill. I've never felt like any death in the game was on part of bad level design or poor control design as they're damn good. I would recommend that people play the game with a gamepad though as playing with the keyboard can get a bit awkward.Speaking of level design and levels, the way they presented the levels in each of the worlds was fantastic. Although each world spanned across at least 10 different paintings that counted as levels, I felt as though I was transitioning from one part of the world's story to the next. Additionally I will say that each world seems to have it's own story, rather than seeming like each world is connected somehow. It makes it seem like each world is separate from the others moreso than just in setting and appearance and gives the game some actual life and a sense of freedom and adventure despite being in a large tent with a bunch of old, crusty paintings.My absolute favorite part of this game that got me hyped were the ingenious music levels, where every action int he level is set to the beat and rhythm of a song, remixed in a very special way for each world's music level. Though there's only a handful of music levels in the game, I feel like this isn't a bad thing as each music level plays out fantastically. The look of sheer joy on my face when I realized that the song playing in the level Castle Rock was a Rayman style remix of ""Black Betty"" is something I can never forget. And although the music levels are seen as the biggest selling point of Rayman Legends, Ubisoft went the extra mile to ensure that they put effort in all of the levels, and used the music levels as a lure for players, which makes the game that much richer in the experience.In terms of story, I'm willing to forgive Rayman Legends for its very basic storyline. Rayman games never exactly had a great story to them, and the fact that there's no set canon of the Rayman games just adds to the charm, which this game is chock full of. The basic goal of the game seems to intertwine itself with the individual stories that come along with each of the worlds.The Challenges and Kung Foot modes of the game add a bit more of a competitive side to Rayman Legends. Competing in different challenges every day and week for a chance to be seen at the top of the leaderboards is very nice, but I feel the PC version's Challenge mode is sort of sullied with the rise of many cheaters, especially in timed Challenges. I don't consider timed Challenges of any sort to be very serious on the PC version as people just cheat to get sub 10-second times as opposed to the people who actually have skill and talent in the game. Lum collection and Distance endurance challenges are just fine though as it's very hard to seem like one's cheating at these challenges as they can be done at one's own pace.I don't have any experience with Kung Foot though as I haven't had the chance to play this game with multiple people.In conclusion, this game is absolutely fantastic. Rayman Legends is a damn good example of how to make an excellent sequel to a good game. Legends builds upon the foundation and base of the original Rayman Origins and addresses many other issues that Origins had and aims very high to correct them. I would certainly say that Rayman Legends is much better than Origins, despite Origins also being an excellent game in its own right.Oh, as an additional warning, you have to make a separate U-Play account in order to play the game from Steam, which I honestly find annoying and a little pointless.Overall I'd give this game a 10/10 "

This game is a must for ANYONE who enjoys the occassional platforming game, such as myself :) I have finished the main levels and may go back to the additional content in the game (such as 'Back to Origins') but I tend not to do that sort of thing so...

												Rayman Legends was more of the same that was seen in Rayman Origins, not that that's a bad thing.  The speed run type levels synced to music was the highlight for me, too bad there were so few of them.  I was disappointed in two things.  One, they boil the entire level selection down to a series of hallways ... very boring.  Two, the Land of the Dead levels were just a rehash with some very annoying designs.8/10Playtime: ~14 hrs			"

												Really good platformer that shows an amazing amount of effort put forward both artistically and level designs. The music is fantastic, topped off only by having a few special levels that revolve around the music. The game is packed with a lot of fun and a lot of laughs, I love Origins and Legends is certainly a worthy sequel with a lot of charm to it. Other platformers certainly seem to have gotten lazy with their games, where one would struggle to know which one is which if they didnt' see the title screen. This one shows effort and is worth the buy. I cannot reccomend this game enough if you like platformers whether it be Sonic, Mario, Commander Keen,  previous Rayman titles etc. It's a great co-op and solo game and don't worry unlike the New Super Mario Bros games, you do not bounce off eachother, you actually have moves to help. You can slap one another ...but, if used right it can actually save your butt. It's worth noting both Rayman Legends and Origin are worth having together, there are SOME levels from Origins you unlock in Legends. But there's a lot of fun to have with both- so get on it! DRM NOTE:This game requires Uplay to launch, which is incredibly irritating. On top of steam a mini-Uplay client needs to boot and often you'll find yourself waiting for Uplay to update before you get a chance to play your game. This counter productive move really ruins the whole idea of steam keeping games up to date when Ubisofts -DRM ontop of DRM- has to update seperately so it can triple check you're not a thief. This is of course is only highlighing my frustration when you know there's pirates playing this who do not have to sit through any of this and just enjoy the game that they didn't pay for but I did.

												This game is definitly in my top games of the year list, and is probably the best 2D Platformer I ever played.The bad stuf first: You need UPlay, which is a stupid annoyance and this game is not so nice to play with a keyboard. I really recommend a controller.That out of the way: WOWEasy to pick up and play -  had a stressful day? Play one or two of the music levels and you'll feel releaxed and calm.Want a challenge? My controller has toothmarks from some of the time trial levels which get unlocked later on.But still the game is never unfair or discourages you so you just keep coming back until you get that sweet sensation of finally beating the level. And when you have you can go to the daily challenges and compete against other players.One thing I like to point out is the level design. Especially in the music levels but also in every other, theres a certain flow. You're almost playing yourself into meditation. Rayman Origins, I felt, had to much backtracking so that you get all the lums and unlocked more stuff. Here you have much less lums you have to collect to get a gold medal, so you can just play the game. Even finding the caged Teensies isn't pulling you out of the flow.On top: The visuals are just.... happy. Nothing against dark and gritty games, I love them, but this game is radiating with happiness and joy. In the animations, the background, the enemys. Everything just says: Have a good time - and you definitly will. Solo or with friends.If you have doubt: Play the demo, but I can't find a reason why not to like this game.			"

												Rayman Legends is worth the price, one of the best family games of 2013.  Played by mom and pop, our 8 year old and grandpa too. We think a lot of platformers are too fast and furious but this one is just about perfect for every age.  No parental guidance required (other than making suggestions on how to conquer a sequence).Good humor keeps us interested for hours at a time.  It is fun just watching someone play.  We've been gaming for 30 years and this is our all time favorite.			"

												Аркада года без вопросов, но...Зачем нужны миссии из Origins?... как бонусный контент - ок, но для открытия всего и вся их нужно проходить. Не люблю заниматься повторными линейными забегами. Плюс в Стим по предзаказу была доступна полноценная первая часть.Опять нет сюжета. Кому как, а для мне история - не последний мотиватор для дальнейшего прохождения. Блин, НАПИШИТЕ ХОТЬ КАКОЙ-НИБУДЬ СЦЕНАРИЙ. В итоге финальные уровни проходишь как очередные, да и как такого финала нет - набор уровней закончился, Angry Birds.Что это за ""8-битная"" ересь.

												I feel that there is only one way to describe this game: classic.The controls are nice and tight. Levels are a blast. Character and environment designs are whimsical and quirky. It's sometimes challenging, but not in the nail-biting ""Dark Souls"" way but in the ""whoops I messed up that move, let's keep going cause this is fun"" kind of way. Overall, the feel of the game makes you just want to keep playing and playing.It's just really, really fun. I would definitely consider this a huge step up from Rayman Origins, which is also a pretty phenomenal game, though I think this game makes Origin obsolete since it includes unlockable remastered Origin levels.A side note, the pop culture references this game makes are pretty amusing. The swimming levels are pretty much a throwback to Crash Bandicoot: Warped's scuba diving levels (too bad they control just as badly with a keyboard though, but tbh I haven't really seen that many ""aqua combat"" sequences in games that were actually fun). Also, the guys behind this game must have either really loved or hated Dreamwork's How to Train Your Dragon movie, hahaha.			"

												This is a game of rare quality. Unless you've lived under a rock these past few years, you know Ubisoft rebooted the Rayman franchise in 2011 with the critically acclaimed Rayman Origins. This game saw the limbless hero of many games in my childhood return to his platformer roots. The game was visually stunning and challenging with a superb soundtrack to boot. And now we have Rayman Legends. This game is quite literally the logical next step for the reboot of this franchise. It still has the cartoony visuals, but this time it looks like you're watching a moving painting instead of a colourful cartoon. The level design is top notch and can be very challenging at times (which led to frustration in my case. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing as it made overcoming these obtacles that much sweeter) and oh my God is the soundtrack even better than the last one. Everything just breathes atmosphere and polish and the attential to graphical detail and the interaction between what happens on the screen and the music/sound design is nothing short of a victory in game design. Well done.So, for a fair price you get a whole plethora of levels set in different worlds, loads of collectibles, online rankings (with daily and weekly challenges) and a host of levels from Rayman Origins with updated visuals. In short: best platform game in recent memory. Worth every penny.			"

												Ever since I saw this game coming up on steam I wanted it. I wanted it bad! I still remember the very first rayman that I used to play with my brother when we were still kids. The hours of fun we had with the game! Rayman legends is exactlyw hat I wanted and needed without knowing about it. This game is absolutely amazingly constructed, the levels are fun and the more you play, the more characters you can choose. Fellas a noteworthy thing: If you're looking for something to introduce your better half into gaming, this is the golden gate. Easy enough for kids but difficult enough to keep the older of us occupied and fascinated. The graphics and animations are amazing and oh my god the music levels! I was living every single one of them! The game is actually very difficult to complete on Gold as there is always a lot of hidden stuff in every level and there are oh so many! I got it as a present from my best friend and I don't think any other game made the inner child of mine happier than this one.I have now ords to describe how much I recommend this game to everyone. 10/10			"

Hell no... it only challenges you in other ways. The gameplay is very easy to understand and the Deadzone when you hit ""things"" is fair ... you won't touch anything until the pixels are in contact.

												Every time I play this game, I'm just amazed at the amount of the love, care and attention that was so clearly poured into it. Every single level - and there's TONNES, even before you consider the fact that many (all?) of Rayman Origins' brilliant levels are also included - all have their own personality, and you're never left feeling like the game is just going through the motions. The music-themed levels that cap each of the game's worlds are an absolute highlight - if platforming set to a mariachi cover of Eye of the Tiger doesn't whet your whistle, I'm not sure what else I could possibly say. Suffice to say, I want this game to last forever, and I'm reviewing it with the sole purpose of hopefully convincing others to try it as well. One of the best games of the last decade, and one of the best plaformers of all time.			"

												Rayman Legends is a fun, addictive game, that improves upon the originals with slightly improved graphics using the beautiful UbiArt Engine. The level design as well music are fantastic, A few shortcoming held it back from completle greatness, but I still thorougly enjoyed it.Foremost, the interesting level design really shines with the varied levels that you have to overcome. The goals is always the same if not slight different. Rescue a certain number of teensies by finding the secret rooms as well as scouring the level for invisible walls and areas . The journey is accomplishing this and there is nothing better then finding them all  and getting 100% on the level. Other levels of interest are the boss levels as well as the timed ones that keep the variety up. Continuing on, the music levels that you find at the end of each area in the game are fabulous and are always something to look forward to as well as challenging in their own right. Lastly, the simple fair gameplay and tight controls. Everything required for a great platformer. Xbox controller is what I used and what I would recommend althought I'm sure keyboard works fine.For the negatives I wouldn't really say they are complete negatives, but something that people like me will have to learn to live with. There is a lot of online/leaderboard type integration. There are dailies and weeklies. They are indeed fun and definetly challenging. By doing them you are rewarded with lums which are used for unlocking differnt characters in the game that you can play as.The majority can be unlocked just by beating the game but there are a few that require you to do them for awhile. Although I have no idea if these characters are worth the effort or if there mere recolors they are considered superior in terms of cost and I would assume they are pretty good. The positives of this is there is added gametime to the game as well as a stretch goal if you really enjoy it. The negative is not everything is unlocked right after beating the game which means you were probably wont go back unless you really are dedicated. Definetly the most frustrating thing would have to be the Back to Origins levels. While all the good levels in the original Rayman Origins are included they are not unlocked right away. You will unlock all of them sometime after you've beaten the game which means you cant play them in their original order until then. This is extremely frustating as after you beat the final boss and done the extra world the last thing you want to do is go back and 100% those levels that you have done before if you played the original. It would of been a lot better if they were unlocked in order after beating each area of the main game. At the very least I am happy they are included in game as extra content and I applaud the devolopers for not making someone purchase Rayman Legends if they want to experience it.Kind of ranted on about the negatives, but I figure people know or have heard about how great is and should hear a different side.

My only complaints with the music would be the oddly off-putting Invasion level songs, which don't seem as urgent as they're supposed to feel.As a modern platformer game, the amount of levels in the game is extremely important, and Legends most certainly didn't disappoint. There's TONS of levels in the game spanning over five unique worlds, and for those who dearly miss the content from Rayman: Origins, there's 60 levels from Origins included in the game to satisfy both crowds. Legends' levels also add a bit more challenge to the levels which partly secures my previous complaint on the easiness of Origins' levels. Though some levels still did feel a bit too easy, I feel the challenge is still decent in the game for what it was going for; a game to please both casual and hardcore players.The amount of unlockables in the game is a great deal more than Origins, but it is a bit lacking. Once you've unlocked all of the normal levels, and the Origins levels, the only other things to get include costumes for the four main characters, though they aren't that special as many of the costumes follow a set theme with each of the characters, such as a Knight costume for Rayman and Globox, a Caveman costume for the Teensies, Rayman and Globox, a Dark Rayman and Dark Globox costume, etc. As far as the methods to unlock them go, it all depends on how much you've played the game as most of the costumes are locked behind a set amount of Lums collected to unlock them, going all the way up to 1 million lums for the final Rayman costume. Collecting all 700 Teensies also rewards you with a costume, which I think is pretty underwhelming. Though the Warrior Princess characters are just different costumes for Barbara, I do like the different amounts of variety in clothing, hair styles and colors they use with each of them. It's a nice touch and they at least added more than 2 extra costumes for Rayman this time.The game plays very fluently, the controls are very well thought out and easy to use, so most of the gameplay is reliant on the player's skill. I've never felt like any death in the game was on part of bad level design or poor control design as they're damn good. I would recommend that people play the game with a gamepad though as playing with the keyboard can get a bit awkward.Speaking of level design and levels, the way they presented the levels in each of the worlds was fantastic. Although each world spanned across at least 10 different paintings that counted as levels, I felt as though I was transitioning from one part of the world's story to the next. Additionally I will say that each world seems to have it's own story, rather than seeming like each world is connected somehow. It makes it seem like each world is separate from the others moreso than just in setting and appearance and gives the game some actual life and a sense of freedom and adventure despite being in a large tent with a bunch of old, crusty paintings.My absolute favorite part of this game that got me hyped were the ingenious music levels, where every action int he level is set to the beat and rhythm of a song, remixed in a very special way for each world's music level. Though there's only a handful of music levels in the game, I feel like this isn't a bad thing as each music level plays out fantastically. The look of sheer joy on my face when I realized that the song playing in the level Castle Rock was a Rayman style remix of ""Black Betty"" is something I can never forget. And although the music levels are seen as the biggest selling point of Rayman Legends, Ubisoft went the extra mile to ensure that they put effort in all of the levels, and used the music levels as a lure for players, which makes the game that much richer in the experience.In terms of story, I'm willing to forgive Rayman Legends for its very basic storyline. Rayman games never exactly had a great story to them, and the fact that there's no set canon of the Rayman games just adds to the charm, which this game is chock full of. The basic goal of the game seems to intertwine itself with the individual stories that come along with each of the worlds.The Challenges and Kung Foot modes of the game add a bit more of a competitive side to Rayman Legends. Competing in different challenges every day and week for a chance to be seen at the top of the leaderboards is very nice, but I feel the PC version's Challenge mode is sort of sullied with the rise of many cheaters, especially in timed Challenges. I don't consider timed Challenges of any sort to be very serious on the PC version as people just cheat to get sub 10-second times as opposed to the people who actually have skill and talent in the game. Lum collection and Distance endurance challenges are just fine though as it's very hard to seem like one's cheating at these challenges as they can be done at one's own pace.I don't have any experience with Kung Foot though as I haven't had the chance to play this game with multiple people.In conclusion, this game is absolutely fantastic. Rayman Legends is a damn good example of how to make an excellent sequel to a good game. Legends builds upon the foundation and base of the original Rayman Origins and addresses many other issues that Origins had and aims very high to correct them. I would certainly say that Rayman Legends is much better than Origins, despite Origins also being an excellent game in its own right.Oh, as an additional warning, you have to make a separate U-Play account in order to play the game from Steam, which I honestly find annoying and a little pointless.Overall I'd give this game a 10/10 "

												While I prefer the art direction of Origins over Legends (the cel-shaded cartoon look was just SO good), this is by far the better of the two games if you're one of those that has to gold every level.  In some ways it's a lot easier to do so, but at the same time, Origins did some seriously nasty things requiring you to play a level down to a science.  Legends allows you to take a few bumps from time to time and still come out on top.  Whether or not you think that's good or bad depends on the type of gamer you are.The other things you can expect are normal for a Rayman game - tight controls, great humor, heaps upon HEAPS of levels to run through, a bajillion collectible items, AND remixes of select levels from Origins (only this time without any King Lums).If you're totally new to Rayman, I would recommend Legends without blinking.  If you're a bit more of the hardcore platformer, go with Origins.  Or get both!  These are two of the most solid 2D platformers on the market today.			"

												Rayman Legends was more of the same that was seen in Rayman Origins, not that that's a bad thing.  The speed run type levels synced to music was the highlight for me, too bad there were so few of them.  I was disappointed in two things.  One, they boil the entire level selection down to a series of hallways ... very boring.  Two, the Land of the Dead levels were just a rehash with some very annoying designs.8/10Playtime: ~14 hrs			"

												Just buy this game, seriously, it's a work of art. To anybody who thought that the 2D Platformer was dead, this game is for you. Mario still has the 2D platformers, but in all honesty, they're stale, and Nintendo doesn't try anything new with them anymore, Rayman however, still manages to stay fresh after all these years, especially in this game. It takes Rayman Origins and flips it on its head. You'll experience such a mix of emotions while playing this, awe in how gorgeous the graphics and music are, laughing at the game's funny set up, and angry at how difficult the levels are.			"

												Easily one of the best platforming games on PC. It has some pretty wicked level designs, art, and is quite challenging. I personally enjoyed how most of the levels stand out from each other gameplay/designwise. My favorite character to play as Barbara. The only thing I could say would be bad about the game is the zero plot (This game would have benefitted from a LITTLE story), and how unfair some of the levels are (Looking at you 8-bit levels).All in all, I'd say buy this if you like platformers. And I want a sequel. A sequel that should have Barbara.			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes platformers. I had fun playing this game. I had fun unlocking all the levels in this game. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in modern day, and the music really fits the mood of levels quite well. I just wish you could buy the soundtrack with the game on Steam, but apparantly that would make too much sense.... and that would probably be my only complaint.By far the best parts of this game are playing the music-synced levels. Its fun running through a desert while listening to a cover of Eye of the Tiger which hints when you should jump properly. "

												WARNING: uplay DRM, may the creators of it burn in hell.I find myself at a loss of words here. The game is so amazing I don't know how to even convey my impressions, which are positive in every possible way. The game has everything you would want from a sequel to Rayman Origins: a lot of levels full of crazy platforming, fun challenges and smooth difficulty curve, beautiful art style which manages to blend parallax 2D sceneries with 3D bosses perfectly, and the music which is not only amazing on its own, but fits the style of the game perfectly and highlights the crazyness of the action. The game even has a good share of levels from Rayman Origins added as a bonus, reworked to feel like a part of the new game experience (even those annoying mosquito levels aren't annoying anymore).And yes, Rayman Legends has its amount of re used assets from Rayman Origins, both graphics and sound wise, but it is still an astonishing game with a lot of new good stuff added to the mix.All in all: well designed, well executed and damn compelling.

												Best platforming game I have ever played. Excellent audiovisual art direction (music is a work of genius). Whole game can be played cooperatively by 2 players (with fun soccer minigame up to 4 players as a bonus). It gets challenging hard really fast, but repeating is not frustrating - game makes you want to play. At the end of every chapter that consists of typical platforming gameplay there is one ""music"" level where you have to play according to rhythm of music that is playing - excellent idea, too bad there are so few of those. Technically game has some downsides - max res is 1080p, max framerate is 60HZ. This, of course, is dictated by hand made animations and graphics. Platforming genre, like no other, could really make use of 120Hz and beyond with some motion blur reducing technology (like ULMB) :(Another downside is that Ubisoft insists on putting Uplay on their every game even if you buy it on Steam :( This is the game that converts people into gamers.

Regardless of that, THEY (the critics) have been into him and still prefer our latest limbless guy.The game just flows with ideas, that rarely repeat, the graphics is just awesome and the music really makes you hum along.Plus, the special levels and music written to match, that's not something you see very often... let me rephrase... that's not something you've ever seen.

My greatest love of the series is that it's always so silly!My one complaint is, and I don't know if this had to do with uPlay or my fault or what-have-you, but I 99.99%-ed the game (I got every character except Rayomz) but then when my computer broke, I went to play on my new one and my progress was all lost!

												This is quite possibly one of the best side scrolling platformers of the modern era! It controls beautifully, with pinpoint reaction times. The graphics are fantastic with varied environments bristling with little details. Enemy designs are hilarious and varied. Level design is ingenious. The music is decent, but the ""music themed"" levels are a joy to play and a welcome interlude from the more difficult levels. However, what makes this game PERFECT is its innate replay value. Each level begs to be perfected, each item to be unlocked. I've simply not had this much fun with a platform game since I was playing Super Mario.Ubisoft, you weirdos. I love you.11/10			"

												Every time I play this game, I'm just amazed at the amount of the love, care and attention that was so clearly poured into it. Every single level - and there's TONNES, even before you consider the fact that many (all?) of Rayman Origins' brilliant levels are also included - all have their own personality, and you're never left feeling like the game is just going through the motions. The music-themed levels that cap each of the game's worlds are an absolute highlight - if platforming set to a mariachi cover of Eye of the Tiger doesn't whet your whistle, I'm not sure what else I could possibly say. Suffice to say, I want this game to last forever, and I'm reviewing it with the sole purpose of hopefully convincing others to try it as well.

												This game is simply AMAZING. Absolutely fantastic. This is EXACTLY how you make a sequel to a good game!Firstly, the artwork of the game is just like Rayman Origins, only there's a lot more detail going on here to make the colors and art style mesh a bit more together. That being said, the artwork is beautiful and despite the main characters' very colorful, silly appearance, the settings and areas match them so well that it's hard to say that they feel out of place. The music is just as good, and also brings a more thematic feel to the game, seeing as how Legends takes a bit more of a civilization styled world as opposed to the open wilderness areas that Origins featured.

Although each world spanned across at least 10 different paintings that counted as levels, I felt as though I was transitioning from one part of the world's story to the next. Additionally I will say that each world seems to have it's own story, rather than seeming like each world is connected somehow. It makes it seem like each world is separate from the others moreso than just in setting and appearance and gives the game some actual life and a sense of freedom and adventure despite being in a large tent with a bunch of old, crusty paintings.My absolute favorite part of this game that got me hyped were the ingenious music levels, where every action int he level is set to the beat and rhythm of a song, remixed in a very special way for each world's music level. Though there's only a handful of music levels in the game, I feel like this isn't a bad thing as each music level plays out fantastically. The look of sheer joy on my face when I realized that the song playing in the level Castle Rock was a Rayman style remix of ""Black Betty"" is something I can never forget. And although the music levels are seen as the biggest selling point of Rayman Legends, Ubisoft went the extra mile to ensure that they put effort in all of the levels, and used the music levels as a lure for players, which makes the game that much richer in the experience.In terms of story, I'm willing to forgive Rayman Legends for its very basic storyline. Rayman games never exactly had a great story to them, and the fact that there's no set canon of the Rayman games just adds to the charm, which this game is chock full of. The basic goal of the game seems to intertwine itself with the individual stories that come along with each of the worlds.The Challenges and Kung Foot modes of the game add a bit more of a competitive side to Rayman Legends. Competing in different challenges every day and week for a chance to be seen at the top of the leaderboards is very nice, but I feel the PC version's Challenge mode is sort of sullied with the rise of many cheaters, especially in timed Challenges. I don't consider timed Challenges of any sort to be very serious on the PC version as people just cheat to get sub 10-second times as opposed to the people who actually have skill and talent in the game. Lum collection and Distance endurance challenges are just fine though as it's very hard to seem like one's cheating at these challenges as they can be done at one's own pace.I don't have any experience with Kung Foot though as I haven't had the chance to play this game with multiple people.In conclusion, this game is absolutely fantastic. Rayman Legends is a damn good example of how to make an excellent sequel to a good game. Legends builds upon the foundation and base of the original Rayman Origins and addresses many other issues that Origins had and aims very high to correct them. I would certainly say that Rayman Legends is much better than Origins, despite Origins also being an excellent game in its own right.Oh, as an additional warning, you have to make a separate U-Play account in order to play the game from Steam, which I honestly find annoying and a little pointless.Overall I'd give this game a 10/10 "

												Rayman Legends was more of the same that was seen in Rayman Origins, not that that's a bad thing.  The speed run type levels synced to music was the highlight for me, too bad there were so few of them.  I was disappointed in two things.  One, they boil the entire level selection down to a series of hallways ... very boring.  Two, the Land of the Dead levels were just a rehash with some very annoying designs.8/10Playtime: ~14 hrs			"

												This game is excellent; buy it....Oh, you're still here? You mean to tell me that you need reasons to buy things? Okay then.Rayman Legends is the best platformer of this decade. Everything in it has such a touch of affection and detail that it constantly wows the player with it's unique style. Common background elements could have been hung in an art exhibit, enemies interact and animate in a variety of ways that boggles the mind that a team of animators took the time for such a trivial thing. And its platforming is exceptionally tight. The game ramps up in its difficulty in such a way that near the end you're more than prepared for its Lost Levels echelon of difficulty. It hearkens back to the older days of platforming, while at the same time discarding old standards like lives and poor checkpointing. It's constant fun, not tedium. Rayman Legends is what a modern Mario game should have been, and it surpasses the old bastions of platforming on every front.And the music, sweet potato the music. When this game rolled out its series of trailers I was worried that it was just rehashing the songs of the previous title. But no, no no no. Another clever rouse on their part. There was a moment, I think around the third world, where I just had to put the controller down and appreciate how they had integrated the music into the stage. It's that good. In Origins the special stages were exceptionally difficult, particularly the Tricky Trunk levels. While Legends is no cakewalk, the trunk levels have been superseded by musically timed levels. It's understandably strange to jump and hit to the tune of Eye of the Tiger, but not unwelcome. But there's more than just those special stages, there's a huge variety of levels that leave the player with a myriad of options, all fun. There's a Gradius clone with mosquito mounts, time trials, wall running, a whole host of others.There are criticism, and if you've made it this far into this recommendation I guess I could give them to you. The game has the same problem as its predecessor in that once you've collected all the baubles and creatures, there's really nothing else for you to do than the multiplayer stuff or to farm for days to unlock a skin for your character. Once you complete the main story, all that's really left is tying up loose ends, and it feels a little lacking in reason either than tying up loose ends in this game is still quite fun. Also, the introduction of touch based gaming in the series has been replaced by button prompts. Unless you're playing on a system that utilizes the touch, then some of the Murphy levels feel cheating, as entire swaths of gameplay get replaced by hitting the Y button.But these are minor peeves. The game is still fun. It's a labor of love, and it shows it, bleeds it. I think, if you have the opportunity, that Rayman Legends is really worth your time.			"

												WARNING: uplay DRM, may the creators of it burn in hell.I find myself at a loss of words here. The game is so amazing I don't know how to even convey my impressions, which are positive in every possible way. The game has everything you would want from a sequel to Rayman Origins: a lot of levels full of crazy platforming, fun challenges and smooth difficulty curve, beautiful art style which manages to blend parallax 2D sceneries with 3D bosses perfectly, and the music which is not only amazing on its own, but fits the style of the game perfectly and highlights the crazyness of the action. The game even has a good share of levels from Rayman Origins added as a bonus, reworked to feel like a part of the new game experience (even those annoying mosquito levels aren't annoying anymore).And yes, Rayman Legends has its amount of re used assets from Rayman Origins, both graphics and sound wise, but it is still an astonishing game with a lot of new good stuff added to the mix.All in all: well designed, well executed and damn compelling.

												Even better than Origins, IMO - some people say that Origins was harder than this, but I think that Legends actually is harder overall - some of the invasions are really, really hard to clear in less than 40 seconds and get the best score. The addition of leaderboards (through Uplay, sadly - barf) is nice. Wish they were on Steamworks, but oh well.All and all, this is a great game if you like speed platformers. A good analogy I've heard is classic Sonic games - everything is exactly placed so that when you're running, jumping, and punching at a full-speed run, you can chain together all kinds of movements. And the art palette is just wonderful.			"

It's so fun, the song is a classic, and it's one of the most enjoyable missions of the game.

I can already tell that the same outstanding level design that was present in Origins is still there, and the developers have added an insane level of replayability, be it through a hard unlock of characters through lums that players pick up, challenges, or the special ""lucky card"" mechanic they added. the whole game feels much deeper, much more gratifying, and, all in all, is more than worth the full price, though I got it on sale for just $8.99, i cannot recommend that you buy this game enough.

												Rayman Legends is a game that has got a lot of attention everywhere. And it defintely deserves to be regraded highly among the gaming enthusiasts. Its a platformer, and more than that, its the most complete platformer I have ever come across. Its got collectibles and lots of little medals and stuff but most of them are achievable, they are not insanely tough to get or anythinng. The graphics are cute, fresh and interesting. The controls are reallly tight, as should be in a good platformer. The difficulty is not insanely tough( not atleast in the beginning) and every single level seems self-sufficient, in terms of its length, difficulty and number of collectibles. It is also a pretty long game, especially for a platformer but if you play a bit every now and then, it does not feel frustratingly long or overburdening in terms of gameplay. The game is so much fun you wont ever realise there are no steam achievements. There is so much to do within the game itself, that you dont feel like you miss out on achievements. I pretty much love this game and, for anyone who likes platformers, this is undoubtedly the game of the year.Much recommended to everyone.			"

												Much like it's predecessor Rayman Origins, to me, this game is the epitome of sidescroller platforming.This game controls icredibily tightly, rarely was I left frustrated by wonky edge interactions and floaty controls, unlike the New Super Mario Bros franchise, and newer interation of the Donkey Kong Country game. I find that this is incredibly under-appreciated in the platformer genre these days; the reason Super Meat Boy was challengingly fun, rather than challengingly frustrating was because of it's incredibly tight controls that keep the game feeling fair and fluid, but demanding.The musical score is nothing short of incredible once again, with all the digeridoos and kazoos that are associated with the franchise, as well as excellent orchestral pieces.Visually the game is gorgeous and hilarious. It's just so great to see in motion, the animations are so slick and varied. The style is just so cohesive, like a modern looney toons. The one blatant exception to this are the 3d animated bosses. They really stick out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the game, though they are good and fun in their own way.Level design is varied, the world themes are fantastic, and I never got the ""ugh, I've had enough of this world/level"" feeling I get in some other platformers. I did miss the 'Misquito' flying levels from the first game, but they are adequetly replaced by amazing Musically paced levels at the end of each world.What I didn't know going into this game, was that the 40 remasterd levels from the original are available through a scratch card unlockable-system. You've basically got a whole second game worth of content to play through (including some of those misquito levels I believe), if you didn't play through Origins the first time.If you're a fan of the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is a must play.

												If you've played Origins, you pretty much know what to expect, and if you liked it, you'll like this, too. Game works well, has some fun daily/weekly challenges and leaderboards if that's your jam, and I didn't think it would be mine, but platforming is just plain fun in this game, especially the Murphy stages. Not much negative to say about it; good music, cool playable characters, nice level variety with plenty of hidden goodies.			"

												If you like platformers, this game is a no-brainer. It is a complete and total upgrade to Rayman Origins, which is a great game itself. Pretty much everything that could have been improved, has been improved. The controls are really tight and I never encountered frustating or unfair passages in the game. The new cover songs-themed levels are really enjoyable and satisfying as well and I really wish the game had more of those. If you are not sure about buying the game, get Rayman Origins instead. It gives you a good idea of the game mechanics and it's a bit cheaper.However, Rayman Origins is not required to enjoy Legends, because there is no continuous story across games and a decent amount of levels from Origins are available to play in Legends.

												After having completed the unlockable content of the game and being just 30 Lums away from 100% completion, it's time to rate this game. What can I say...:It's the best freaking Jump'n Run ever (on Steam)!The artstyle, the gameplay, the character design, the music, the varying leveldesigns (rhythmbased, flight, speedrun, typical sidecroll levels etc)... It's so well-done, I can't think of anything the developers could have improved.The game has no online coop, but that is understandable, one little lagspike WILL kill you, because the more challenging levels are hell. At least the couch coop is absolutely great and makes the game more challenging (prepare to be trolled).Don't even bother trying to get the gold medals in leaderboard extra challenges, it's impossible!One important info: If you are a fan of the series like I am; Rayman Legends' best levels (I played them all on Wii) are also available in this game besides other unlocks which I won't spoil.One minus point for obligatory UPlay, but still a big recommendation; even Snoop Dogg likes it! ^^9/10			"

												I started to play Rayman  when I was child with playstation connected to a small tv. Some times the gameplay  was harder. I was annoyed and gave up the game.  I tried back Rayman legends after 12 years or more. Maybe as a child in some missions is harder to think and to do the things at the same time. Today I enjoy Rayman in a 42"" screen with better graphics. The game is very enjoyable.  One of the best games to play while you're in relax. I'd recommend to everyone 10/10			"

												Rayman Legends is a very fun 2D platformer. If you enjoy the 2D Mario games you'll really like this. You get new moves as the game progresses that add to the gameplay and keep things fresh. It starts out fairly easy but some of the later levels are very challenging even for veteran players. It never really felt cheap or frustrating though, which is good. I paid about $10 for it and it took me about 6 hours to finish. That 6 hours is only playing through the Rayman Legends levels, not the levels from Rayman Origins which are unlockable in this game.			"

												Even better than Origins, IMO - some people say that Origins was harder than this, but I think that Legends actually is harder overall - some of the invasions are really, really hard to clear in less than 40 seconds and get the best score. The addition of leaderboards (through Uplay, sadly - barf) is nice. Wish they were on Steamworks, but oh well.All and all, this is a great game if you like speed platformers. A good analogy I've heard is classic Sonic games - everything is exactly placed so that when you're running, jumping, and punching at a full-speed run, you can chain together all kinds of movements. And the art palette is just wonderful.			"

												Other than the required U-Play cancer, this game is pretty superb. It's hard to put in words how highly I praise this game. The level design is near perfect for a classical platformer. This, paired with great music, art design, and controls, results in one of the best platforming titles of this generation.  Not counting the gameplay, my favorite part of Legends is how the game is broken up into worlds (which, in itself, is a design choise dating back to 1985, but I digress).  Each world has its own theme and model swap of enemies, making each chapter seem like a new game; even though these are losely connected into the over-arching story, they have their own, subtle sub-plots.Up to this point, I've only mentioned the gameplay in passing, mostly because there's not much to criticize about it. Rayman handles like you would expect him to (most of the time) and never feels too stiff.  At times, Legends can be a little on the easy side, mostly because you have unlimited lives and frequent checkpoints, but is balanced out by the difficulty of the secondary objectives. This game is great for completionists, and you can put a good amount of time into grinding out the last few unlockable cosmetic characters that you wouldn't otherwise have by just completing the game.I don't have a good place in this review to mention the musical levels, but they're pretty fun and a nice change of pace.  Ubisoft also posts daily and weekly challenges with worldwide scoreboards, if you're into that sort of thing. 9/10, would recommend in a second.			"

												I really like previous Rayman but this one is an horrible experience for me.Technically it's a trouble box.  It's too demanding for the laptop but when going on the big desktop it stutters every 30 sec. As I already spend hours to understands that actually Uplay don't get your saves in the cloud (what use is it then ? Don't know) and other hours spend trying to figure why it would constantly reset controllers setting when I plugged the pad (reason: because bug, here for months post release on steam. Finally fixed but that give you an idea of the QA service in Ubi), I gave up on spending more to fix stuttering on a game supposed to use a fraction on the horsepower of my rig. Especially when on the top of this on last quit it puts the xbox vibration on non stop. Had to unplug the thing. I can't waste time on job so poorly done, Ubisoft.  Especially when gameplay has gone wrong everywhere. At first it's pretty then you quickly realise it's very hard to read the action. Not enjoyable (sheer luck in random mess typically does the trick better than controlled moves), using that awful flying thing all the time, etc. Not playing this unless you pay me. And not cheap.

												Before: Rayman Origins was just a flat canvas, painted well, the lively characters had simple, but very colorful detail, but that was just the beginning...After: Rayman Legends has little to some 3D relations visually, but really, all games must have a major 3D process one way or another, and the rest is sky rocketing 2D platforming that is so dazzling you'd can't keep you limbless hands off it.What You'll Get: Ultimate shading, lighting, particles, physics, challenges, for a Personal Computer version, it can be difficult, it is a pop-up book wonderland that is ready to be explored, .What you will be doing: Rescuing Teensies to rocking out on the castle roofs and wondering if someone is still mocking Mr. Dark's ego, or possibly playing the role as the roping up dames and placing them on train tracks kind of villain...?

												When the demo for this game came out I played it over and over again, especially the music level with a version of black betty which adds Kazoos! I racked up over three hours on the demo alone so i was pretty excited when I started playing the full game. If you have played the first version (origins) then you know what i mean when i say that this game is 'slap happy'.  The whole thing feels like one of those cartoons that makes you think that the animators were on LSD. the colors just pop from the screen and i could not help but smile and even screech in delight as a slapped kicked and whacked the living daylights out of enemies which are actually more fun and outlandish than the main characters, and that's really something! this game takes the WTH factor from origins and turns it up to eleven, expect to be surprised and delighted by EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL! It's the small things that make this game fun, the way a venus flytrap sounds like a music box winding up or how the frogs mumble chords from ride of the valkeries as the plummet towards your hero. this game is truely a delight! However the experience is somewhat soured by the inaccuracy of murphy, the character from the wiiu version that makes some of the levels somewhat fustrating, using a gamepad does ease the fustration somewhat however.all in all this game gets a 9.5 out of 10, 8 out of 10 if you cannot stand u-play.

												Rayman Legends is a true platforming wonder. The UbiArt Engine shines again with beautiful visuals accompanied with awesome music.However, if you trully want to enjoy this game 100% in all its glory, you need to play the version for the console it was originally meant to be on: WiiU. Murfy's Wii U Gamepad section feel awkward and just forced into the game and the fact it was meant to be played with the gamepad is present at all times in these sections (and there's a lot of them).Other than that, the gameplay is close to perfect. What sucks though is uPlay. Stop forcing uPlay on us UbiSoft, seriously.If you don't have and/or can't afford a Wii U, buy this version. If you have/plan on buying WiiU, play that version as it is the definitive Rayman Legends experience.			"

												Fantastic platformer that makes Rayman Origins obsolete. The mechanics have been changed for the better in my opinion combine that that a large amount of level from Origins are in this game, all of them redone with the new mechanics, makes me feel ripped of for having paid even more for Origins than I did for this game during the Steam Holiday Sale. Presentation is fantastic and even though I have not unlocked one yet, I played one of the music levels which was fantastic, like Bit Trip Runner but with Rayman Art and Rock music and some very good level design. For the masochists, the games levels progress to what i assume are insanely hard with a 6 skull rating. For the collectors, every level has two sets of trophies to earn more Teensies, which is effect is the currency used to unlock more levels, along with Lums which is the currency you earn in levels and other places that are used to buy new characters, and even on top of that there is an awesomeness ranking which I forget how you earn, but is used to unlock daily chalanges, of which there are up to 4 each day where you compete with poeple all over the world to see who is the best, and as you can figure these levels are different every day. Though similar to other levels already in the game, it still incrases the overall content and replayability of this game. For someone like who play it very casually, you can still run into the same problem that I ran into with Origins which was that I reached a point at which i had to redo previous levels to unlock more levels. This is less annoying in Legends because there are multiple story arcs, and so it means i wont feel as bad not finishing the game as I did with Origins because I wanted to finish the story. In the end the game is wonderful and gives you many ways of earning progress, including the reaffle mechanic (even though the interface for it was clearly made with the Wii U in mind).			"

												Rayman Legends is the best Platformer I have played....litterally...that's it....It's seriously the best ever!If you are a huge lover of platformers you must own this game, it is far superior to that of platformers such as mario, crash, DK etc...By a long shot, the art is beautifully fresh, the music has a magical fanciful feel to it of nothing but pure awesome to the ears, the levels are rediculously preposterous in the best way possible...I love this game....simply put...buy it...you will not be dissapointed.Btw Barbara and all the girl characters make this worth buying.....cuz they hotz son >:D			"

												Rayman Legends is a delightful platformer, and one of the best I’ve ever played. Thanks to clever level design that toys with genre conventions, it gets incredible mileage out of four basic moves. And with great local co-op and dozens of unlockables – including stages from Rayman Origins, special character skins, and mini-games – there’s a lot to do. The difficulty is so smoothly balanced that it can be played with with kids or adult friends and still have a great time.			"

												After playing Rayman Origins, I didn't think this sequel would to live up to the fun I had with that game, and it didn't.... It exceeded it! I love this game from beginning to end. It bring all the wacky traditional fun platforming I had with the last game and enhance it. The music is great and the stages are just gorgeous, honestly I didn't think they would top some of their over the top levels in Origins but they made those look mediocre by comparison. Not to mention how every world end with a musical level is just spectacular.Story:The story is just as confusing as last time, you know what it hard to even gather a story. Who cares! Bad guys are doing bad things, platform your way to victory and stop them! It work for Mario after all. Gameplay:Fast pace platforming that goes from easy to insanely difficult. But despite that there will never be a point you just say enough. You want to keep trying for the better score or fastest time to complete a stage. With the addition of a daily/weekly challenges, you can compete against other people for the fastest times or biggest score. Sound:Some of the best music I heard in a game. Honestly I could listen to all the songs from the musical levels of each world all day long. This games does what a sequel should do, top the prequel. In fact it relish in it by letting you go back and play the classic stage from each world in Origin. Honestly between all the characters to unlock, time/race challenges of each level, the Origins levels, creatures to collects, Scratch off tickets to win, and why am I still typing? I gotta play this game some more!			"

												Ok I nabbed this during the sale for 10$ and I LOVE it its so crisp and colorful I love the style of it. I also grew up playing Rayman my first game I remember was on my Playstation 1. This game and all of the wunderful characters bring me back and make me feel nostalgic though I'm only in my early twenties :p. There is loads to do and lots and lots of characters to play as you unlock more and the levels get harder as you progress sometimes annoyingly hard but it makes it great once you master a way to beat the level.  The game works with controllers aswell like I play with an Xbox controller and it works great. I've only played 3.5 hours or so but I am loving it so far. So for anyone who likes good platformers or Rayman you must give this game a try I would have paid the full price for it definitly worth it.			"

												Why is this game so good?  I have no idea why the developers of this game took such time & care on this masterpiece, but I am so glad that they did.  Hours upon hours of absolutely stunning sidescrolling fun.  Will not disappoint.  I wish the demand for this style of game was greater so we might see more titles as polished as this one.  The only downfall is that once you do devote so much time to it that you beat everything and collect all of the teensies, levels, characters, etc. there really is not much left to do.  It was nice of the devs to include 2 daily challenges & 2 weekly challenges, but I'm not sure how long that would keep someone's interest who had already completed everything else.10/10 **********			"

Tons of stuff to collect and plenty of lv's to run through. Unlike Super Meat Boy! this game doesn't make you feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, its more of a pick me up game. All being easy it is still fun and you will repeat some maps over and over again, but thats a good thing. An added bonus to legend are the daily/weekly maps to race/collect lums against everyone else. So glad this franchise got started again, loving every game and still wanting more.			"

												Really good platformer that shows an amazing amount of effort put forward both artistically and level designs. The music is fantastic, topped off only by having a few special levels that revolve around the music. The game is packed with a lot of fun and a lot of laughs, I love Origins and Legends is certainly a worthy sequel with a lot of charm to it. Other platformers certainly seem to have gotten lazy with their games, where one would struggle to know which one is which if they didnt' see the title screen. This one shows effort and is worth the buy. I cannot reccomend this game enough if you like platformers whether it be Sonic, Mario, Commander Keen,  previous Rayman titles etc. It's a great co-op and solo game and don't worry unlike the New Super Mario Bros games, you do not bounce off eachother, you actually have moves to help. You can slap one another ...but, if used right it can actually save your butt. It's worth noting both Rayman Legends and Origin are worth having together, there are SOME levels from Origins you unlock in Legends. But there's a lot of fun to have with both- so get on it! DRM NOTE:This game requires Uplay to launch, which is incredibly irritating. On top of steam a mini-Uplay client needs to boot and often you'll find yourself waiting for Uplay to update before you get a chance to play your game. This counter productive move really ruins the whole idea of steam keeping games up to date when Ubisofts -DRM ontop of DRM- has to update seperately so it can triple check you're not a thief. This is of course is only highlighing my frustration when you know there's pirates playing this who do not have to sit through any of this and just enjoy the game that they didn't pay for but I did.

Mario still has the 2D platformers, but in all honesty, they're stale, and Nintendo doesn't try anything new with them anymore, Rayman however, still manages to stay fresh after all these years, especially in this game. It takes Rayman Origins and flips it on its head. You'll experience such a mix of emotions while playing this, awe in how gorgeous the graphics and music are, laughing at the game's funny set up, and angry at how difficult the levels are.			"

												A beautifully rendered platformer, with an exquisite soundtrack, and exciting worlds, challenging single-player, baffling co-op... typical Rayman awesomeness. It refines the way Rayman Origins handled, resulting in a much more satisfying game to play than the occasionally slippery original. Honestly, there's little to criticize - Rayman, as a series, has an infectious optimism and joy, and Rayman Legends has it in spades; the music, characters, collectables - everything contributes to an atmosphere of happiness and fun. The only problem is that it's a game developed for the Wii U. And, nothing against the Wii U, the unique control system that influenced a lot gimmicky levels in this installment does not translate well to PC. Neither does Ubisoft's proprietary Uplay system, which is insultingly tacked on and is required to be open to play. Rayman Legends is, thankfully, a game awesome enough to overcome being a Wii U ex-pat and a Uplay software. Any other project would likely be irrepairably tarnished for it.			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes platformers. I had fun playing this game. I had fun unlocking all the levels in this game. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in modern day, and the music really fits the mood of levels quite well. I just wish you could buy the soundtrack with the game on Steam, but apparantly that would make too much sense.... and that would probably be my only complaint.By far the best parts of this game are playing the music-synced levels. Its fun running through a desert while listening to a cover of Eye of the Tiger which hints when you should jump properly. "

												It's hard to put Rayman Legends into words, but know this - if you like games that can be summed up with 'fun' and '2D plattformer' then Rayman Legends is for you. It doesn't really offer a story, but what it does offer is a charming, beautifully drawn world with memorable character designs and an innocent sense of humour. If you're looking for a break from gritty shooters and elaborate sci fis, then give Rayman Legends a go!It's got local coop, by the way, which usually doubles the fun if you can get someone to play it with you.

												Easily one of the best platforming games on PC. It has some pretty wicked level designs, art, and is quite challenging. I personally enjoyed how most of the levels stand out from each other gameplay/designwise. My favorite character to play as Barbara. The only thing I could say would be bad about the game is the zero plot (This game would have benefitted from a LITTLE story), and how unfair some of the levels are (Looking at you 8-bit levels).All in all, I'd say buy this if you like platformers. And I want a sequel. A sequel that should have Barbara.			"

												Much like it's predecessor Rayman Origins, to me, this game is the epitome of sidescroller platforming.This game controls icredibily tightly, rarely was I left frustrated by wonky edge interactions and floaty controls, unlike the New Super Mario Bros franchise, and newer interation of the Donkey Kong Country game. I find that this is incredibly under-appreciated in the platformer genre these days; the reason Super Meat Boy was challengingly fun, rather than challengingly frustrating was because of it's incredibly tight controls that keep the game feeling fair and fluid, but demanding.The musical score is nothing short of incredible once again, with all the digeridoos and kazoos that are associated with the franchise, as well as excellent orchestral pieces.Visually the game is gorgeous and hilarious. It's just so great to see in motion, the animations are so slick and varied. The style is just so cohesive, like a modern looney toons. The one blatant exception to this are the 3d animated bosses. They really stick out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the game, though they are good and fun in their own way.Level design is varied, the world themes are fantastic, and I never got the ""ugh, I've had enough of this world/level"" feeling I get in some other platformers. I did miss the 'Misquito' flying levels from the first game, but they are adequetly replaced by amazing Musically paced levels at the end of each world.What I didn't know going into this game, was that the 40 remasterd levels from the original are available through a scratch card unlockable-system. You've basically got a whole second game worth of content to play through (including some of those misquito levels I believe), if you didn't play through Origins the first time.If you're a fan of the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is a must play.

Also - no Steam achievements which is a shame because this is also one of those games that would be nice to compare friend performance on.			"

												This is a great game. The gameplay is solid, the music is good, and the art is GREAT (refer to my underwater screenshot if you don't believe me). It does a nice little blend of 2D and 3D characters which I found cool. The music and enviroment do a good job in most cases to reflect the necessary mood, which is done well in a specific underwater level (the one from the screenshot, but the picture provides no sound).Super solid game, worth getting.

												Rayman Legends is a very fun game to play. Much fun as Origins. When I first saw the gameplay demo on youtube in 2012 I was so hyped. I know I never owned any other Rayman game(Excluding Origins)   back then,but when I gazed my eye on this game I wanted it. So when the game went on sale, I got my handy dandy Mann Co. keys and traded them for a copy.  The game has good controls and gorgeous art. If you play games on a keyboard, playing this game at first with a keyboard can be hard but you soon get used to it. The game can be also used with a controller(even Xbox or Playstation). The favorite part I like about this game are the Musical levels(Which includes reamkes of Black Betty, Woohoo, etc...) its very fun and I would always play those levels every time I go on. The game also features online challanges which involves obstacle runs and time trials. You win from Bronze to Diamond cups and it also feature the multiplayer minigame Kung Foot which is a form of soccer game. The downside to this game is that is the fact that it doesn't have online co-op and only has local co-op. The other downside (Which I really hate) is the ♥♥♥♥ing UPlay. Every Ubisoft game you buy, you have to make an UPlay account in order to play the game. You even have to make a Uplay account to play the demo. It sucks. It really does.  But back to the subject. Rayman Legends is a fun game I would recommend this game if you like fun, challanging levels. Even if you don't own any Old Rayman game. Just don't expect the online co-op thing like I said if you do plan on getting it.			"

												An absolutely brilliant game: in terms of pure gameplay, not much compares. It's high-paced and essentially very simple, but the inclusion of challenges and collectables add a layer of sophistication.Rhythm runs right at the heart of Rayman - a perfect level run is a beautiful, flowing experience. Very satisfying when you get it right, exhilierating when you crack the challenge levels, and constantly entertaining. And the musical  levels which end each ""world"" are just top-class, a welcome reward for your efforts. 10/10.Worth noting, though, that you have to run the game through UPlay, which is an intolerable piece of bloatware which does nothing but slow the game down. Not a game-changer, but certainly something which should be complained about.			"

												Platforming at its finest. It also helps that it's got an awesome soundtrack and beautiful visuals. Musical levels were a pleasant surprise too. The only downside is that - at the time of writing - it doesn't support laptop graphics cards (so I have to run off the integrated graphics card on my laptop, but it still works ok for the most part) and latest UPlay patch is causing the game to crash unless I have the WiFi adapter turned off (which means I can't play the online challanges anymore). Ubisoft support hasn't been much help either.			"

												Before: Rayman Origins was just a flat canvas, painted well, the lively characters had simple, but very colorful detail, but that was just the beginning...After: Rayman Legends has little to some 3D relations visually, but really, all games must have a major 3D process one way or another, and the rest is sky rocketing 2D platforming that is so dazzling you'd can't keep you limbless hands off it.What You'll Get: Ultimate shading, lighting, particles, physics, challenges, for a Personal Computer version, it can be difficult, it is a pop-up book wonderland that is ready to be explored, .What you will be doing: Rescuing Teensies to rocking out on the castle roofs and wondering if someone is still mocking Mr. Dark's ego, or possibly playing the role as the roping up dames and placing them on train tracks kind of villain...? No doubt, this game should 100% be in your library!			"

Every level is a treat, and I feel a sense of nostalgia from playing the original Rayman many years ago.I very much recommend, whether you are into platform games or not.

												After playing Rayman Origins, I didn't think this sequel would to live up to the fun I had with that game, and it didn't.... It exceeded it! I love this game from beginning to end. It bring all the wacky traditional fun platforming I had with the last game and enhance it. The music is great and the stages are just gorgeous, honestly I didn't think they would top some of their over the top levels in Origins but they made those look mediocre by comparison. Not to mention how every world end with a musical level is just spectacular.Story:The story is just as confusing as last time, you know what it hard to even gather a story. Who cares! Bad guys are doing bad things, platform your way to victory and stop them! It work for Mario after all. Gameplay:Fast pace platforming that goes from easy to insanely difficult. But despite that there will never be a point you just say enough. You want to keep trying for the better score or fastest time to complete a stage. With the addition of a daily/weekly challenges, you can compete against other people for the fastest times or biggest score. Sound:Some of the best music I heard in a game. Honestly I could listen to all the songs from the musical levels of each world all day long. This games does what a sequel should do, top the prequel. In fact it relish in it by letting you go back and play the classic stage from each world in Origin. Honestly between all the characters to unlock, time/race challenges of each level, the Origins levels, creatures to collects, Scratch off tickets to win, and why am I still typing? I gotta play this game some more!			"

The game is so amazing I don't know how to even convey my impressions, which are positive in every possible way. The game has everything you would want from a sequel to Rayman Origins: a lot of levels full of crazy platforming, fun challenges and smooth difficulty curve, beautiful art style which manages to blend parallax 2D sceneries with 3D bosses perfectly, and the music which is not only amazing on its own, but fits the style of the game perfectly and highlights the crazyness of the action. The game even has a good share of levels from Rayman Origins added as a bonus, reworked to feel like a part of the new game experience (even those annoying mosquito levels aren't annoying anymore).And yes, Rayman Legends has its amount of re used assets from Rayman Origins, both graphics and sound wise, but it is still an astonishing game with a lot of new good stuff added to the mix.All in all: well designed, well executed and damn compelling.

												Ever since I saw this game coming up on steam I wanted it. I wanted it bad! I still remember the very first rayman that I used to play with my brother when we were still kids. The hours of fun we had with the game! Rayman legends is exactlyw hat I wanted and needed without knowing about it. This game is absolutely amazingly constructed, the levels are fun and the more you play, the more characters you can choose. Fellas a noteworthy thing: If you're looking for something to introduce your better half into gaming, this is the golden gate. Easy enough for kids but difficult enough to keep the older of us occupied and fascinated. The graphics and animations are amazing and oh my god the music levels! I was living every single one of them! The game is actually very difficult to complete on Gold as there is always a lot of hidden stuff in every level and there are oh so many! I got it as a present from my best friend and I don't think any other game made the inner child of mine happier than this one.I have now ords to describe how much I recommend this game to everyone. 10/10			"

Mario still has the 2D platformers, but in all honesty, they're stale, and Nintendo doesn't try anything new with them anymore, Rayman however, still manages to stay fresh after all these years, especially in this game. It takes Rayman Origins and flips it on its head. You'll experience such a mix of emotions while playing this, awe in how gorgeous the graphics and music are, laughing at the game's funny set up, and angry at how difficult the levels are.			"

												Much like it's predecessor Rayman Origins, to me, this game is the epitome of sidescroller platforming.This game controls icredibily tightly, rarely was I left frustrated by wonky edge interactions and floaty controls, unlike the New Super Mario Bros franchise, and newer interation of the Donkey Kong Country game. I find that this is incredibly under-appreciated in the platformer genre these days; the reason Super Meat Boy was challengingly fun, rather than challengingly frustrating was because of it's incredibly tight controls that keep the game feeling fair and fluid, but demanding.The musical score is nothing short of incredible once again, with all the digeridoos and kazoos that are associated with the franchise, as well as excellent orchestral pieces.Visually the game is gorgeous and hilarious. It's just so great to see in motion, the animations are so slick and varied. The style is just so cohesive, like a modern looney toons. The one blatant exception to this are the 3d animated bosses. They really stick out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the game, though they are good and fun in their own way.Level design is varied, the world themes are fantastic, and I never got the ""ugh, I've had enough of this world/level"" feeling I get in some other platformers. I did miss the 'Misquito' flying levels from the first game, but they are adequetly replaced by amazing Musically paced levels at the end of each world.What I didn't know going into this game, was that the 40 remasterd levels from the original are available through a scratch card unlockable-system. You've basically got a whole second game worth of content to play through (including some of those misquito levels I believe), if you didn't play through Origins the first time.If you're a fan of the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is a must play.

												this game is just wow. I have only played about an hour of it i think. But this is the best platformer in a long time thats not mario. The controls are tight as sh*t the level design amazing. This is a game that doesnt need a story to be good. Just buy this game right now, the only down side is you have to use uplay to actually play the game but its just a minor detailpros and cons+controlls+level design+addicting gameplay+replay value-its kinda short with not too many worlds			"

												I haven't had so much fun on a running style platformer like this in a long time. I wish it had more music levels and I wish that it didn't have the stupid Ubisoft launcher. The launcher make big picture way less elegant than it should be and this is the perfect game to play big on your TV from the couch. Also - no Steam achievements which is a shame because this is also one of those games that would be nice to compare friend performance on.			"

												Platforming at its finest. It also helps that it's got an awesome soundtrack and beautiful visuals. Musical levels were a pleasant surprise too. The only downside is that - at the time of writing - it doesn't support laptop graphics cards (so I have to run off the integrated graphics card on my laptop, but it still works ok for the most part) and latest UPlay patch is causing the game to crash unless I have the WiFi adapter turned off (which means I can't play the online challanges anymore). Ubisoft support hasn't been much help either.			"

												This just may be the best platformer in years. Combines the best elements of old school Donkey Kong, Mario and Sonic - an excellent sense of momentum and precision. The artwork is stunning , along with the music, especially that incorporated into gameplay. The remnants of the wii touch controls are a little out of place but not terrible.  Its's generally much easier than Origins (which apprached Super Meat Boy levels at times) but better balanced and still immensely fun. It would definitely be worth it at full price so at this price it's a steal. Play it!			"

The music and enviroment do a good job in most cases to reflect the necessary mood, which is done well in a specific underwater level (the one from the screenshot, but the picture provides no sound).Super solid game, worth getting.

												Rayman Legends is a very fun game to play. Much fun as Origins. When I first saw the gameplay demo on youtube in 2012 I was so hyped. I know I never owned any other Rayman game(Excluding Origins)   back then,but when I gazed my eye on this game I wanted it. So when the game went on sale, I got my handy dandy Mann Co. keys and traded them for a copy.  The game has good controls and gorgeous art. If you play games on a keyboard, playing this game at first with a keyboard can be hard but you soon get used to it. The game can be also used with a controller(even Xbox or Playstation). The favorite part I like about this game are the Musical levels(Which includes reamkes of Black Betty, Woohoo, etc...) its very fun and I would always play those levels every time I go on. The game also features online challanges which involves obstacle runs and time trials. You win from Bronze to Diamond cups and it also feature the multiplayer minigame Kung Foot which is a form of soccer game. The downside to this game is that is the fact that it doesn't have online co-op and only has local co-op. The other downside (Which I really hate) is the ♥♥♥♥ing UPlay. Every Ubisoft game you buy, you have to make an UPlay account in order to play the game. You even have to make a Uplay account to play the demo. It sucks. It really does.  But back to the subject. Rayman Legends is a fun game I would recommend this game if you like fun, challanging levels. Even if you don't own any Old Rayman game. Just don't expect the online co-op thing like I said if you do plan on getting it.			"

The game is gorgeous, layered, and surprisingly dynamic. The level design is damn near flawless, platforms are in just the right places, timings are intuitive but challenging. Excellent platforming with homages to other genres, plenty of secrets and unlocks, challenges, hidden characters, and most of all the music levels are an absolute blast. This is one of the best games of all of 2013, and perhaps the best sidescrolling platformer I'll ever play.			"

												Oh. My. God.This game is fantastic! I love everything about it, from the cute cartoony style, to the barely visible make-it-up-as-you-go story, to the total general bad♥♥♥♥♥ness of everything you do. But beware: this game is not easy. It is one of the only games I have ever rage-quit, and I am completely unable to get past Ninja Grand-Master Temple. But it doesn't matter. When replaying levels is just as fun as playing them for the first time, with new cool characters available at every turn, and with a race of creatures so cute that it will make you weep for hours (the Teensies), this game offers entertainment for all ages, forever.And the musical maps. See the first line. They defy description. Have you ever wanted to bounce through a giant swamp, and land on the head of a giant toad, on the beat? And feel like it's you, not the game, doing that? It's just amazing.I love this game, and would buy it again.But beware.			"

												Rayman Legends is a delightful platformer, and one of the best I’ve ever played. Thanks to clever level design that toys with genre conventions, it gets incredible mileage out of four basic moves. And with great local co-op and dozens of unlockables – including stages from Rayman Origins, special character skins, and mini-games – there’s a lot to do. The difficulty is so smoothly balanced that it can be played with with kids or adult friends and still have a great time.			"

												When it comes to 2D platformers, Ubisoft has absolutely nailed everything; the controls, visuals, music, and everything else are top-notch in Rayman Legends. This game follows closely behind the formula of Rayman Origins. However, the phrase ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"" really fits here. Rayman Legends takes what Origins did and refines it. There are noticeable improvements in some areas, and lots of minor gripes I had with Origins have been addressed in Legends. There are some  new creative level design ideas and elements that really helped set this game apart.This game is every bit as charming and fun as its predecessor. Both Rayman Origins and Legends make up some of the most creative, fun, and charming 2D platforming you'll ever get to experience. I highly recommend Rayman Legends to anyone who's enjoyed even a single 2D Mario game, or past 2D Rayman games.			"

This has much more content than it's prequel, Rayman Origins, in fact including enhanced versions of multiple Rayman Origins levels. Also, there are even more costumes to earn, and the system for earning costumes has changed, instead requiring you to have a certain amount of Lums, as compared to having to save electoons in the previous installment. Highly recommend to ANY gamer, don't judge this game by its looks, play it and you'll see why this game is amazing			"

												This game is fantastic.I'm not much of a platform gamer, but I grew up loving the crazy twisted world of the earthworm jim games, and many good games in the early eras of gaming were fairly platform-ish... but basically it's not been a focus for me.That said, this game really brought me back and drove home what a great experience the medium can provide.It's made by a team composed largely of the people behind the legendary game ""Beyond Good and Evil"" - if that's not enough to make you moist, you havent played that game, or you have no soul.It's dripping with character, and the art is wonderful and consistent, portraying a bizzare, slightly twisted but incredibly bright and joyful world, even in the darkest places. The music is phenomenal, with a wide variety of excellent tracks, including some that are reditions of songs you may be familiar with. What really got me was the well defined worlds and the sheer variety of gameplay mechanics. It seemed at times like every level was introducing a new mechanic, that may or may not be used in further levels - the path of the game is largely non-linear, with difficulty from level to level having little to do with its place in ""order"". It's most definately not a difficult game, it's a very easy to approach platformer, and you'll quickly learn the ins and outs of what they expect from you. Checkpoints are generally numerous, though the game does spice things up as you progress, there's even levels that have no checkpoints whatsoever and are just a long string of potential deaths - this initially was a source of frustration, but after completing my first level like this I couldnt deny that the sense of satisfaction gained by beating the whole thing flawlessly was well worth it, and I'm glad they had it.It's quite hard to really convey what's really best about this game, and that's the experience of playing it. It's just... fun!If there's a demo out, I'd reccomend giving it a go and seeing what you think. I cant imagine you not finding it worth your time and money though.For long term enjoyment, they have 2 daily and 2 weekly challenges, that are varied in type and setting. While I dont particularily like all of the challenges, they're mostly very enjoyable - the distance based ones, where you're falling down an infinate pit, running up an infinately falling tower, or running across a seemingly infinate level are my favourites, and you'll find yourself rated based on where you stand vs everyone else playing the challenges. You can see the ghost players of other people who have played the challenge who are close to your score, see the markers where they bite it, and generally it just feels solid... Oh yeah, and this game seems to include all the levels from the previous game, Rayman Origins, within the game, so you get 2 games for 1!As for negatives... hmmm... well there's one level left that I havent finished that's hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ though I dont think that counts... Oh I've got one - there's a ""creature"" system, where you collect creatures occasionally when you beat a level, and they all go into a special room and once a day give out lums (the currency - which are these delightful little smiling bug things)  - and the system seems... pointless... you only get the monsters by beating levels, so you've basically beaten the game when you get them all, and the amount of lums they give is negligible compared to even just doing a normal level or challenge. Also the large number of alternate skins for barabara, the female character, are... a bit weird if not downright creepy or offensive at times. Barabara is the character I played as most due to the incredible character design, she's just brimming with a joyful michevious character that really fits the game, and she swings a mean axe... and rayman's kind of silly. But every world you enter has 2 alternate skins for barbara - the first one's pretty tame, but from then on it gets... odd.... There's barabara's that are sexualized (pronounced curves and cleavage) in appearance, and weirder still, when you die in this game you expand and then pop like a baloon - barbara's regular death is fairly normal... but there's 2 skins for her where you get a weirdass panty shot when she dies... it's... weird, man.But whatever, lets just blame it on them being french canadian. The game is absolutely phenomenal and any negatives I've encoutered, which are few, are greatly balanced out by the awesome.So yeah, try demo, get game, enjoy.			"

												Besides having to use another client (Uplay) after starting the game, the game itself is probably one of the most engrossing 2D platformers that I have ever played. Most of the stages are incredibly fun and amazingly drawn. The difficulty level may not be as difficult as origins but the fluidity of the levels makes up for it. Tons of unlockables and daily/weekly challenges invite replayability and the little details the developers put in the game (unique animations where you roll as you land and crouch at the same time, etc.) really show. If you ever encounter this game during a steam sale, definitely consider buying it.			"

												Yes, I will gladly add up to the general praise here.  It is a wonderful platformer and truly a big three platformers member with other two being Trine 2 and Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams.  Yet I have to say that integration of the music and sounds with graphics and action is where this game (did I say gem?) truly shines out.  Also the touch/ feel of the controls is top notch.  And it is doom and gloom free with rather comic approach to all the mission instead of hectoliters of blood and tons of flesh as in other games.  This is how a perfect platformer should look like!

												Played it through to full completion twice now (uPLay not saving my progress across systems the first time... silver lining?).Have to say it is definitely my favourite platformer. Even though I may have some bias due to nostalgia of the originals on PlaySation, in addition to living up to its predecessors greatness this game brings with it a whole new level of polished art, music and level design that is worthy of praise. One of my all times favourites.Highly recommended if you're in to this genre.			"

												Local co-op mayhem at it's finest.I reccomend playing with a controller and with at least 2 players.Fast paced action oriented platforming, slap all that stand in your way including your friends as you race to the end of each level, or work together and try to protect one another from all the other hostile creatures and hazards, it's your choice.Plenty of value for completionists since collecting enough ""lums"" in every stage the first time you go trhough them isn't as easy as it sounds, yet still very do-able.If you collect everything as you go through, the game will last you much longer, but not long enough that you would lose interest.

												Oh my god. This ♥♥♥♥ing game. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥..Oh my god..I can't begin to describe how much in love I am with this game. I remember owning the first Rayman game, thinking it was alright, but the changes that Rayman has undergone since Origins has seemed to have made the future of Rayman games just a cluster♥♥♥♥ of originality and variety. (A good cluster♥♥♥♥.) It just feels so good to pull off sweet flips while getting mad air. Running up walls onto ceilings and then preforming a sweet ground pound on an enemy below to have an explosion of lums fly into your collection. The art is so appealing, the theming is ♥♥♥♥ing perfect, the music to go along with it makes it feel so cinematic and the bosses are ♥♥♥♥ing EPIC and the game is just so polished that there are so many tiny things added in with the extra effort that just brings the world to life! There is tons of trial and error at times, but I didn't find myself getting too annoyed, or at all, actually. It's a really fair game. It honestly reminds me of the classic Donkey Kong Country series with the toughness of the game. It's pretty brutal at times, but DAMN I need to keep playing until I beat it and get a great score (which by the way, feels so damn rewarding.) You don't have to just play as Rayman, but you can choose other characters as well and as well as different costume sets (oly if you have collected enough lums.) In this game, I doubt that's a problem since you practically♥♥♥♥♥♥out lums every time you finish a level, as well as having a chance to win them at a scratch ticked provided that you've gotten enough lums to get said scratch ticket- okay basically, you're gonna get lums up the wazoo no matter what.. And it's ♥♥♥♥ing rad. One last thing: Remember when I mentioned variety? This game is also a sweet♥♥♥♥♥rythem game. '♥♥♥♥in random, right? Naw it's ♥♥♥♥ing sweet as ♥♥♥♥, yo. Rayman, Ubisoft, I expect great things from you in the future. Please take my money.Vote yes on Project Rayman Mirai Plz make it happen omg			"

VERDICT Buy Now (9.6/10)Completion Time: 20-25 hoursBottom Line: ""This game is quite simply the best. Rayman is at it again""PROS+Level Design+Level Variety+SO MANY LEVELS+Really pretty+Hilarious+Awesome Music+Replay Value+The CreditsCONS-No Online Co-op-Uplay integration-The game endsREVIEWThis game is quite simply the best. Rayman is at it again as he traverses 80 creative and often hilarious levels to save the world from nightmares. You'll be swimming, flying, transforming and more through 8 incredibly stylish and unique worlds. With each level you will surely be trying something new, with a huge variety of gameplay mechanics involved. Level designs are incredibly fun and fast paced, including musical levels where your actions are synchronized with the music. While we're on this topic, the score is awesome. There is everything from tropical ukulele driven tunes to stealthy James Bond-esque ballads. Did I mention this game is really pretty? Especially the remastered throwback levels where the detail is immense.Don't even get me started on replay value. Not only are there 120 levels to master, but in each there are plenty of collectables and secret areas. Online challenges also ensure the introduction of fresh new content EVERY DAY. Finally, the ending includes the most creative credits sequence I have ever seen. Never have credits been so much fun.There are only two minor gripes I have with the game. There is no online multiplayer co-op, and there is Uplay integration, meaning you must create a Ubisoft account in order to start the game. Otherwise this game is absolutely brilliant.			"

												Even better than Origins, IMO - some people say that Origins was harder than this, but I think that Legends actually is harder overall - some of the invasions are really, really hard to clear in less than 40 seconds and get the best score. The addition of leaderboards (through Uplay, sadly - barf) is nice. Wish they were on Steamworks, but oh well.All and all, this is a great game if you like speed platformers. A good analogy I've heard is classic Sonic games - everything is exactly placed so that when you're running, jumping, and punching at a full-speed run, you can chain together all kinds of movements. And the art palette is just wonderful.			"

												Oh man, I just love this game.Besides the interesting character designs and cool graphics, a rhythmic game play is also the reason why this game should be recommended. Remade Origin stages and a bunch of new stages provide you with a deal of time to kill.Honestly, when I played Origin in Xbox 360, I felt it challenging. The remade stages are sort of a Legends-compatible version  and a difficulty lowered version. To those who concern, some levels are deleted or truncated.			"

												I've spent a lot of time playing the Wii U version, hence the low amount of play time as of the time I wrote this review.Rayman Legends is a fantastic platformer that improves upon its predecessor in a lot of ways. The music levels never get old and the game has tons of replayability, especially if you're a completionist. It also looks just as beautiful, if not better than Origins.I personally prefer this version over the Wii U, since the Murphy (the green dude you control w/ the gamepad) exclusive levels are a nightmare to play alone, as the secondary character is incredibly slow and is controlled by some awful AI.Keep in mind that there's also a large collection of remastered versions of the levels from Origins. With that being said, if you're deciding between the two games, I would get Legends for sure (personally I would get both, but deciding b/w one or the other is perfectly reasonable).			"

												Another colorful platformer with Rayman and the gang. While pretty similar to Origins, this one includes awesome musical levels that are challenging and a blast to play. There's a lot of content here, too. You could play this one for weeks. Check it out!			"

												Loads of fun, especially playing couch co-op with friends.  I loved Rayman Origins, and I'm tempted to say this is the better game, overall.  The level design is both more creative and flows a lot better than Origins, even when it was at its best.  I'm also glad they replaced the time-trial challenges for each level with specific speed-run challenge levels.  My least favorite part of Origins were those timed runs -- the base levels really weren't designed for speedrunning, so trying to beat them in a set time limit without dying was more awkward and frustrating than challenging or fun.  The speed-run challenge levels here are short and play almost like platforming rhythm puzzles.  Speaking of rhythm -- the music levels are amazing!  By far the most memorable part of the game, and they add a lot of anticipation as you work to unlock them.  It's also one of the most beautiful games I've ever played.  The special effects, shaders, and 3D assets meld perfectly with the overall 2D aesthetic.  I wish more games looked and played this well!			"

So cool!!Rayman Legends is the first Rayman I bought and played and it was absolutley worth it!Super great Gameplay, wonderful designed worlds, great Multiplayer and the music/song levels are the best.I played each of the music levels at least 20 times - so cool <3And if you aren`t in the mode, because of you couldn't make the level - invite your friends or sibling and play every level or even a cool soccer minigame in a group of four!!I totally recommend this game to everyone - especially because of I played this game far too much after I unlocked everything after 35 hours :-D (at the moment 54 hours on the record)			"

												I love the game (espacially the Back to Origins, which has levels from the first Rayman game I ever had).  It's beautiful, the music is great, and it's not too easy or hard.  My greatest love of the series is that it's always so silly!My one complaint is, and I don't know if this had to do with uPlay or my fault or what-have-you, but I 99.99%-ed the game (I got every character except Rayomz) but then when my computer broke, I went to play on my new one and my progress was all lost!  For other games though, like Super Meat Boy, it saves progress from device to device.Aside from my bad experience, I highly reccommend this game.			"

												I love this game and its graphics. it is simply beautiful. So much fun to play! However getting it started was kind of a pain. I didnt have a Uplay account prior to buying this game (ive always played it on the Wii U, which is SO awesome!). Once you create an account with them (Uplay) in order to get the game started you have to have a game key. Well to save you some time and aggravation, once you have downloaded the game look underneath your DLC and youll see that the game key has been installed and then cick on that to copy the game key to the Uplay window that prompts you for said game key. Then you should be good to go. Im new to that whole process with having to download a game like that, so it might have been the obvious thing to do but for someone who has never had to do anything like that before it was aggravating.  It was worth it though. This is a great game for any kind of gamer on any skill level!			"

												WARNING: uplay DRM, may the creators of it burn in hell.I find myself at a loss of words here. The game is so amazing I don't know how to even convey my impressions, which are positive in every possible way. The game has everything you would want from a sequel to Rayman Origins: a lot of levels full of crazy platforming, fun challenges and smooth difficulty curve, beautiful art style which manages to blend parallax 2D sceneries with 3D bosses perfectly, and the music which is not only amazing on its own, but fits the style of the game perfectly and highlights the crazyness of the action. The game even has a good share of levels from Rayman Origins added as a bonus, reworked to feel like a part of the new game experience (even those annoying mosquito levels aren't annoying anymore).And yes, Rayman Legends has its amount of re used assets from Rayman Origins, both graphics and sound wise, but it is still an astonishing game with a lot of new good stuff added to the mix.All in all: well designed, well executed and damn compelling.

												I don't know how I feel about this game. Origins, the predecessor to this game, had a clear focus design wise and simple world progression. Legends has needlessly complicated things by adding fluff that distracts you from the juicy core of the game, much like what hats do for Team Fortress 2. Scratch cards, leader boards, animals, and a currency system based on lums (glowing flies you collect in levels). Couple this together with the dodgy adaptation of Wii U tablet stuff made to work with controllers and you end up with a game that is a bit of a mess. Legends would be a much better game if Ubisoft just trimmed off the fat. But the joy found in Origins is still here under all this pointless flubber. There is still game here that is fun and worth your time, even if you have to wade through the muck to get it.			"

												Platforming at its finest. It also helps that it's got an awesome soundtrack and beautiful visuals. Musical levels were a pleasant surprise too. The only downside is that - at the time of writing - it doesn't support laptop graphics cards (so I have to run off the integrated graphics card on my laptop, but it still works ok for the most part) and latest UPlay patch is causing the game to crash unless I have the WiFi adapter turned off (which means I can't play the online challanges anymore). Ubisoft support hasn't been much help either.			"

												Much like it's predecessor Rayman Origins, to me, this game is the epitome of sidescroller platforming.This game controls icredibily tightly, rarely was I left frustrated by wonky edge interactions and floaty controls, unlike the New Super Mario Bros franchise, and newer interation of the Donkey Kong Country game. I find that this is incredibly under-appreciated in the platformer genre these days; the reason Super Meat Boy was challengingly fun, rather than challengingly frustrating was because of it's incredibly tight controls that keep the game feeling fair and fluid, but demanding.The musical score is nothing short of incredible once again, with all the digeridoos and kazoos that are associated with the franchise, as well as excellent orchestral pieces.Visually the game is gorgeous and hilarious. It's just so great to see in motion, the animations are so slick and varied. The style is just so cohesive, like a modern looney toons. The one blatant exception to this are the 3d animated bosses. They really stick out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the game, though they are good and fun in their own way.Level design is varied, the world themes are fantastic, and I never got the ""ugh, I've had enough of this world/level"" feeling I get in some other platformers. I did miss the 'Misquito' flying levels from the first game, but they are adequetly replaced by amazing Musically paced levels at the end of each world.What I didn't know going into this game, was that the 40 remasterd levels from the original are available through a scratch card unlockable-system. You've basically got a whole second game worth of content to play through (including some of those misquito levels I believe), if you didn't play through Origins the first time.If you're a fan of the sidescrolling platformer genre, this is a must play.

												An absolutely brilliant game: in terms of pure gameplay, not much compares. It's high-paced and essentially very simple, but the inclusion of challenges and collectables add a layer of sophistication.Rhythm runs right at the heart of Rayman - a perfect level run is a beautiful, flowing experience. Very satisfying when you get it right, exhilierating when you crack the challenge levels, and constantly entertaining. And the musical  levels which end each ""world"" are just top-class, a welcome reward for your efforts. 10/10.Worth noting, though, that you have to run the game through UPlay, which is an intolerable piece of bloatware which does nothing but slow the game down. Not a game-changer, but certainly something which should be complained about.			"

The art is gorgeous (sort of painted style) and very light hearted and goofy. Great game to play with my wife or alone. The music is very catchy- my wife and I end up humming/singing the tunes as we're about the house or in the car. I end going back to this game over and over if I'm looking to jump into a game for a quick level or two.			"

												Leafy's simple review - #9 If you remember the first Rayman, this is such a big overhaul in so many ways. Perhaps what attracts me the most is the gorgeous art style and sound design - wonderful, 'casual' game if you will that oozes fun onto a plate of little golden/purple insectoids.			"

												Man, this game..Rayman Legends remains (together with Rayman Origins) THE best platformer of the last 10 years, hands down.The mechanics are incredible and very responsive, the whole game feels very polished (I encountered ZERO bugs with this game, and I played this game a lot! My hours on the record don't even represent this completely, because this game runs smoothly on my laptop, so I took it everywhere and played while being offline a lot.It's simple to start it up for a quick 15 minute gaming session before work, as well as for 8 hour sessions through the night.And let me tell you: This. Game. Is. Just. Fun.Either if you play through it alone, or start a couch gaming session with your buddies. It just feels like a GAME, not like a blockbuster movie.And about the graphics, I mean, I don't really have to tell you about it, do I? Just look at these Screenshots! It's such a beautiful game, that looks even better in motion! The world around you feels very much alive, and a lot of sceneries really left me in awe.With its online feature, the challenge maps, there really is no point in ever putting this game down, because new content is delivered on a daily basis!11/10, would waste precious hours of my life againPS: Didn't proof read lol			"

												I love this game. The graphics are lovely and the music is delightful and incredibly well matched to the game-play. As the levels advance, they may need a few replays to get right, but it's not to the point of frustration. This has because my go-to game when I want to relax.			"

												I played this beatiful 2D platformer with my 5 year's old son a lot and it's hands down one of the best games in this genre I've ever played (since old times of Sega Master System & SNES). I've spent majority of my time in 2 player coop and I'd recommend this to anyone who would like to play with their friends (it must be getting even better with 3 o 4 players).

												I really love this platformer game.  The levels are challenging but not impossible, and makes the right choice to have there be varying rewards based on how well you do, rather than make every level a pass/fail.One of the best parts of it is that there's no real penalty for dying.  Other players can just shoot you, and you're back.  This means that I can play it with my 5 year old and 7 year old, and we all have fun.  Sure, I'm getting most of the lums, but they're having a blast, too.I'm not as big a fan of the challenges.  They're repetitive, and I felt like I was grinding out my million lums by the end.  There's also the problem that there are so many cheaters that a platinum result in the challenges is basically impossible, so it makes it an even longer grind.By far the biggest problem, though, is the lack of multiple saves.  I couldn't play my own game, and then start over again with my kids.  If you want to start over, you need to delete your entire save.  That means multiple people can't really have their own games.  It's a huge flaw, and something the first game didn't do.Score: 8.5/10			"

												Rayman Legends (Orgins) This was always a classic for me considering I first played Rayman on the PS1 as a kid. Awesome platform that always caught my attention. I'm glad to see Rayman has been remade for the PC.This game has no graphic options at all but it doesn't need it because its a 2D platform with amazing graphics and art design. It's very well programmed and the colors are eye catching and beautiful. The characters in the game of course is Rayman and now you can unlock Hero's to play which feels slightly different then playing Rayman. Each hero has many skins to unlock as well. The enemys are well desgined and some look really epic and deadly. The controls are simple. I use a USB 360 controller of course and the game's physics and mechanics are not difficult to figure out and is actually programmed rather well. The movement is simple and basic but yet one wrong move equals instant death. Game is playable to a 5 year old but becomes difficult enough for an adult while a child can still enjoy the difficulty as the game progresses. The platforms are awesome and the levels are super creative its almost genius. Lots of hidden secrets in every level. There are so many levels to play and unlock its insane how much work was put into the length of the game. You simply cannot get bored but many breaks will be taken. The sound effects are neat. While the music really sells it for me. There is also an online type challenge everyday and one that lasts 7 days. You compete for the Bronze, Silver or Gold cup. Which is great if you like a good challenge.I'm running this game on an AMD ASUS Sabertooth 990 FX, AMD 8-Core, 16gb Ram, Nvidia GT 750 2gb LP. Windows 7 no issues at all running this game or any crashes. Yes this game does require Uplay which I wasnt a fan of awhile back but who cares it doesnt hurt anything having it installed just don't use it as a main client. Keep using Steam. Uplay only launches when you launch a game that requires Uplay. After you done playing close it. Steam still records your hours played however Uplay is where your achievments are unlocked and recorded unfortunatly. This shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game though. It's worth the time and effort. I purchased during the Steam Summer sale for 12$ org price was $29.99. It also included Rayman Orgins for 3$ I believe which was an absolute steal. Highly recommend buying this game. If you can wait buy it during a steam event.Overall 10/10Look up some gameplay on youtube just to see the greatness Rayman has to offer. :)			"

												This game is extremely fun side scroller that brings back the fun I had as a child playing Super Mario Brothers. Rayman is super hilarious, the graphics are excellent, it has lower system requirements and the replayability is excellent. My only gripe is that it requires UPlay but the game is SO great well worth it!!			"

Well, I did rage quit because I lost. LOST MY SAVE DATA. UPlay messed this up for me. It was all REALLY fun and good, and I wanted to enjoy this, but Uplay ruined that completely for me. I have to give this a thumbs down. It would've been a 9/10 if Uplay wasn't so bad. Ubisoft, fix your stuff please.			"
