												Just finished playing the game; about 4 hours to complete. All achievements and collectables unlocked.This game was an absolute pleasure to play. It's a short indie game telling a mature story of a young girl and her broken family trying to come back together as they make painful choices, solve difficult situations, and all the while unraveling a mysterious tale of science & intrigue closer to the heart than expected.I understand this may not be for everyone... but the deciding factor I believe we should all consider is this is a very affordable, small-team, indie game worth experiencing. That said, the amount of storytelling I experienced was amazing. If it is worth anything, I have a background in animation as a storyboard artist... I am especially keen to stories that feel ""thought through"" from start to finish, and not merely trying to get to certain moments or even the climactic finale just for the sake of it. Surprisingly the story has quite a few sad & heavy scenes that really tug at the heart.  Stay for the end... it's incredible.The difficulty is quite easy, and that may throw some people off... in my opinion however I enjoy story over challenge, so making all the collectibles glaringly obvious throughout only made me focus on their content and how it intertwined with the story rather than the pursuit. This is very subjective, so those looking for a hard time may be turned off. I've read here & there some having troubles with the shadow puzzles; this again is a tough one, as I got through all of them pretty easy... the most I spent was maybe 20-25 minutes on the last act's few big ones... still, the visuals and little rewards you are given with wonderful voice acting or visual design was well worth it.Speaking of voices, the acting was tremendous. I especially enjoyed the voice of Didi, as child voice overs can sometimes be a hit or miss.Visually the game is an absolute joy to experience. Didi and Dawn are interesting, and I even grew to love the wonderful silhouettes of the characters around them. The soundtrack is very well thought out and you can clearly see the sound & visuals were designed hand in hand to compliment each other.I know reviews can be a subjective mess for some, but I hope this helps in whatever way it can! I'm a pretty level-headed, patient man who really appreciates good art & story. If this isn't your cup of tea, I again remind you it was a fifteen dollar purchase that definitely wouldn't make you regret the experience.I'm not a hardcore ""anti-big publisher / developer"" gamer, but I do want to say, humbly, that games like this make me so hopeful and excited about indie games. They provide an intimacy and patience in story I don't see often enough in the AAA titles.Warm regards,DDCP			"

												Contrast is a curious combination of pros and cons...The game has an amazing soundtrack that you can feel at the title screen, even before you do anything. It will be the first thing you will notice.The second one is it great visual and art from the 1920s. Every character and level are beautiful and the light and shadows effects are pretty nice.Them you get to know the story and, what a good plot it has, you will enjoy it even more when you get the collectibles and find the hidden pieces of information in the levels.The problems start when you actually have to make that jump, mixing the 3D and 2D gameplay the game brings. The controls doesn't respond very well and, I must warning you, you will fall to your death many times...There is only one thing that annoyed me more than fall a dozen times in a row, and her name is Didi. You have to do everything she says all the time, I mean, you must take care of her but Dawn could think a little for her own, it won't hurt.There are only one or two moments that Didi actually helps you and, after that she is your boss and you must just do what she says. That was the negative point for me.Contrast is a pretty short game, in about 4 hours you will achieve 100% on it. After all that I still recommend it for the experience, story and the great visual and sound it has, but not at full price, buy it on a special sale.			"

												Contrast is a puzzle-based platformer in Art Deco style with an enjoyable unique mechanism. Playing the role of the invisible friend of a little girl, you explore climbing and jumping the 3D (in real) and 2D (in shadows) world of the 1920s. The story is mature but nothing too special, and reminds me partially of the game Papo & Yo.The jump- and puzzleparts could be challenging, especially towards the end of the game, but they are never unfair. Graphics and voice-acting are nice an suitable - the soundtrack is really fabulous (especially the maintheme). There are some minor bugs and glitches, but they are not distracting, but controls and camera are sometimes a bit clumsy.Overall Contrast is a solid and good title - and especially on sale, you should grap it. - I think it is not a must-have title but a nice-to-have-played game.Personal Rating 80/100+ The great soundtrack+ Flair of the 1920's- A bit too short (5-6h for 100%)			"

												Contrast is a mixture of dark noir atmosphere and puzzle-platforming adventure. One of the real treats of the game is the music - perfect jazz and sexy voice of Kat Malenkaya (what a nice character name). The main  theme reminds me of a song ""I wish you love"" from ""Eye of the Beholder"" and Jessica Rabbit's ""Why don't you do right"". It is so romantic, sensual and emotional. Dawn is a very interesting main character (now I want those striped leggings), but I want to know more about her, her mysterious story was not fully told. Contrast is a game full of beauty, the dialogs make you sympathize with characters, 1920's Paris, the lights, burlesque and the circus are absolutely gorgeous. There are couple dissapointments - the movements (jumps) are glitchy and the game is too short. Thats it. For me - it's definitely worth playing.			"

												This game is a piece of art, An art doesn't have to be lengthy, exciting and action packed. An art is what makes you feels something...This game is short, The story is simple, but something in it makes me feel so attached to Didi and Dawn, Two girl in the shadowland with big romantic blue moon above noir street. This game makes me feel lonely and abit sad because the world you are in, nobody can see you, and you can only see their silhouette. Only person who can see you is Didi, a little girl who lives in both world.Environment design and music is superb! the only thing that fraustrate me is that sometime you got shifted out of the shadow with no reason at all.9/10 <3			"

												There are so many cool ideas floating around Contrast without a vessel to carry them.A puzzle platformer focused around shadows in a wondrous 1920's Paris, it showcases so much potential but fails to utilize it into something compelling. There's a sense developer Compulsion Games wanted to do a lot more with the concepts they introduce, but whether for time or budget reasons were forced to dial back and condense the experience, the results of which are often middling at best.Contrast opens itself from the start with a desire to tell a dark, complicated story of a family split apart, with a husband in debt to some bad people, a mother who just wants the best for her child, and said child blissfully unaware of the trouble surrounding her as she just wants both her parents back. It's promising beginnings however are quickly cast aside for poorly written reunions, characters that seem to recognize the own stupidity of their actions yet follow them anyway, and a juxtaposition of science fiction elements that are all rushed and strung together as if the writer lost sight of the narrative halfway through and began grasping at straws to tie it all together.Everything interesting about Contrast's plot, from its world of shadow people, impossible environmental deformation, and female led cast are underutilized and painfully unexplored. I wanted to know more about what was happening but all I ever got were a handful of documents left lying around which sketch out a scenario so haphazard and contrived that the story is worse off for including them. Compulsion went through the trouble of making a great environment for your character to explore, but stretched it too thin while simultaneously having nothing to discover if you want to deviate from the set path. It's a lifeless, sterile city that seems so mysterious from afar but ultimately has nothing to show you as you make your way through its barren streets as quickly as possible.Contrast's main mechanical hook of being able to jump into shadows is on paper really neat and creates an immense about of possibilities for puzzle designs and world navigation, but like everything in Contrast it's underdeveloped and poorly implemented. The places you're able to shadow jump (for lack of a better term) are fairly minimal, and you spend more of your time walking around in the real world lifting boxes and trying to control your finicky character. When Contrast works it's tedious and does a lousy job explaining its mechanics, opting for style over engaging gameplay which gets lost under the mountain of technical issues.Your character moves awkwardly as if it's a puppet trying to break free of its strings. I was constantly clipping on edges while attempting to platform onto places I needed to, and even simply entering shadow mode failed more often than not, sending me careening to my death as an obnoxious restart sound bite played for the umpteenth time. Audio, graphical, and performance issues round out the family of technical incompetency that more than anything sell home the fact that Contrast needed more time in the oven.With how great the foundation of Contrast is, to see it come together in such a halfbaked manner is truly unfortunate. There's a very clear vision amid the mediocrity that the developer had much bigger plans than the neutered length allowed them to execute, which makes it so disappointing they weren't able to hold the game back from release until they could be better implemented. I hope this isn't the last I see of Compulsion, but I pray they're given a better time frame for future projects that allows them to capitalize on the potential they almost completely missed this time around.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

			Gameplay from PlayStation 4 game Contrast, showing off the shadow gameplay. It's free for PS+ users and a great interesting game.		

Like i have said the story is really good and is really about the little girl DIDI and her journey and how DAWN (your character) helps her progress through the levels and eventually to the conclusion of the story,that is both a facinating journey and an alltogether well rounded and well put together peice of entertainment.I will say that the game is rather on the short side and unless you enjoy it as much as i did then after you finish it will be another game that will gather dust as its a single player game and when you finish you FINISH,but if like me you enjoy a good story with great gameplay and are looking for something a little different then go spend some time with this game and believe me you wont be dissapointed.(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			"

												This game is so damn fantastic it's nearly impossible to describe! You are back into the 1920s in a mysterious shadow- and dreamlike world. You are playing as a pretty lady with long legs, who btw can shift into shadows, and you are helping out the girl Didi on her adventure around in this fantastic world. Her mother, Kat, is the star of Contrast's cabaret and is incredible sexy, but has a complicated relationship to her husband who always ends up in bad situations. Vincenzo, the famous Illuminist, plays a big part in the world, and has some amazing light and shadow tricks that amazes everybody.Besides that, it's filled with a smooth and sultry jazz ambiance all around in the game. And who doesn't like jazz? Move into the shadows and join the adventure!			"

												1 word: LOVELY.This game truly is a piece of art, the most charming game I’ve ever played. The artwork is gorgeous and simulates a surreal, detailed world in an atmosphere similar to France in the 1920's. The soundtrack is also amazing and fits the game and environment perfectly. Contrast is overall quite original, from the shadow-shifting between two different worlds to the special artistic style.It takes about 5 to 6 hours to complete. You could think this is rather short, but the delightful artwork really makes up for it. This game really is a story-driven experience, so if you're not into this, maybe this isn't really the kind of game for you. I really like the story and the characters. They did a great job on the voice acting. The story is touching, lovely and well thought out, kind of mysterious due to the two different worlds. In the end, I still don’t really know which one’s “real” and which one isn’t. The puzzles are special because of the shadow-shifting mechanism. Each puzzle is different, fun and challenging, not repetitive in my opinion.Sometimes the game's a bit buggy, like the shadow-shifting mechanism between 3D and 2D at certain moments. The camera can also be a bit buggy and clumsy sometimes, but it doesn’t ruin the game.Something you need to know: you can't change the controls. The game works with a QWERTY-setting, so keep this in mind. You can also play this with a controller, which I think suits the overall controls better. I still have to try this, though.If it’s in sale, buy this immediately. Totally worth it. "

												We follow the story of a young girl called Didi, viewed from the perspective of Dawn, her imaginary friend. Didi’s parents have a troubled relationship to stay the least. Her father is constantly falling in with the wrong crowd, while her mother is struggling to make a name for herself as a singer. Didi takes it upon herself to mend their marriage, with a lot of help from Dawn. No one else can see her, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t exist, as she has the ability to switch from the 3D real world into the 2D shadows.It is a really interesting mechanic that has you relearning what you know about puzzle games, much in the same way that Portal did back in 2007, but sadly not to the same extent. There are some very clever puzzles to be solved here, but they are just not up to the same quality as Valve’s finest. Most of the game you will be moving physical objects around, or shining lights on them to create shadows. You can then run up to a flat surface and shift into it, and platform across the shadows as if they were physical objects. There isn’t a great deal of variety though. In general if you can interact with something, you will know it needs to be used to solve the puzzle in some way. You gain a dash ability, which enables you to smash through real world objects, and more importantly to travel through solid shadows blocking your path, but other than that you will just be jumping. You can grab ledges and pull yourself up, but the game is very picky about which ledges you are allowed to grab. The platforming itself isn’t as precise as I would like it to be. Being able to clamber over the shadows of people as they are having a conversation looks really cool, but I was constantly slipping off or getting caught on little edges.The first time I loaded the game up, I was about to hit New Game, as you would expect. But then I stopped. The song that was playing over the menu was so good, that I sat there and listened to the whole thing before beginning my playthrough. It wasn’t long after that I was supposed to follow Didi to the next area, but instead I stuck around in the Ghost Note, a cabaret club, to catch the end of a song through the closed backstage door. The soundtrack in collaboration with Laura Ellis is superb, I just wish there were more of it later in the game. And that goes for the actual gameplay too.Visually it looks pretty good, with an obvious emphasis on contrast between light and shadow. Although the overall tone of the game is dark, there are some nice splashes of colour, and some really bright areas. The only character models in the game are that of Didi and Dawn, the rest of the characters are depicted only in shadow, a device used by much of the noir fiction that Contrast is based on. There are plenty of clichés from that era that the game falls back on, but it is never too cheesy. Despite the youth of the character that the story revolves around, the narrative is quite grown up, and definitely becomes more complex as it progresses. I got a very Bioshock Infinite vibe from it, although the storytelling and the world are not as in depth. The games  premise is one of the most original I've seen in recent times, but it’s just not quite fleshed out enough. I would still recommend playing it to see the clever ways in which you can interact with the environments, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. I hope the ideas and themes can be perpetuated into a new game in the future.			"

												★★★★☆The game was enjoyable, so enjoyable I got everything thus far. But it isn't perfect. The controls are noticably stiff at times, but one can argue that this is purposly design because your character is walking around in heels. Not much opened endedness, which seems like it should but you are stuck on a one way path. But, the good things about this game is the platforming sections and it's unique ""shadow"" mechanic. The platforming feels like it wasn't just a another ""ok, let's just put this here, that there, and this over there"" kinda platforming. I honestly felt like I was playing in a Banjo and Kazooie style platforming, something crafted over time and really thought about, not just something crafted in a few minutes. The story is kinda there, and not. Your character is utlimately ignored in the main story, only a few people will talk about your character. But they never provide much information about you, and your character never talks either...so that doesn't help with this mystery about your character. The game can be done in a matter of minutes, or a few hours, it all matters on your skill level and how fast you are capable of beating platformer games. But, I will tell you this, you won't regret this experiance if you liked banjo and kazooie.			"

												Contrast.. is a rather intresting little gem, it takes less than 6 hours to complete fully - but the ride is so enjoyable and the mood is hit perfectly that I really have no regrets. I will however touch on a few issues; the controls - the whole shifting into shadows and out again sometimes bugs out, tossing you out of shadows for no actual good reason. In addition, some puzzles require you to stand in a specific place before it'll show you the progress, having spent about 30 minutes trying to make an impossible jump I face palmed fiercely when I found out by accident that I simply needed to walk onto the shadow of a cigarette.However, those two issues aside? The game is worth the money, I wouldn't say you're getting spoiled rotten with content, but you will get an appealing little tale, with decent graphics, amazing music score, and a fresh take on the platforming genre.

												Good story, good music, unique art style, interesting setting,...what else do you need for a good puzzle platformer?I enjoyed this game but I also want to tell you what happened to me, what was not that great:At the final act you have to solve a final puzzle and after a while I managed it somehow. After that you have to complete a few of jump sequences,....i fell a lot of times into nowhere and that was not that dramatic because you restart at the very same point where you made a mistake. So finally I was there,....and had to complete my very last task. To point with a spotlight at a specific point. That was not working. It didn't trigger the cutscene. So I had to go back to main menu and ""resume"" my game. But,...I was far away from the spotlight. So I had to complete all puzzles again.So what I want to tell you with this? It's not perfect. The controls are not that good in my opinion (played with xbox360 controller and also tried keyboard).The last few puzzles didn't fit my taste as well.However, it's a nice puzzle platformer but also a short one. With a few flaws.			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  ContrastStatus:  ReleasedDeveloper:  Compulsion GamesPublisher:  Focus Home InteractiveGenre:  3D/2D PlatformerRelease Date:  15th of November, 2013 Type:  Singleplayer General ImpressionI played and finished Contrast in 2013, on my PS3. Those were the days, you’d say. They were in fact far simpler times, before I could go further than imagine the day I’d be able to build my own PC gaming rig. Two more years of hard work had to pass for that plan to come to fruition, but I’m never going to console gaming, that’s a certainty! Why did mention the PlayStation 3? Because even the subpar version of Contrast I played there, left a strong impression upon myself. I wasn’t even that interested in the indie gaming scene, four years ago. Never cared at the time for the struggles some developers go through in order for their projects to see the light of day and reach an overly critical audience. Yet Compulsion Games have hit the ground running. Their debut was Contrast and as of 2016 their second project, We Happy Few is making a name for itself with good reason.Contrast is no more and no less than a compelling story of escapism. Our heroine, Didi, needs to leave behind her dysfunctional family and escape, even through dreams from an otherwise grim reality. She’s not alone though. Her imaginary friend/alter ego Dawn is everything Didi looks up to and strives to become. There’s nothing our girl wouldn’t want more than to reunite her family and so, she sets on an adventure of her own through the buildings and streets of 1920’s Paris. The inherently gracious Dawn shall be controlled by the players, while Didi is handled by a capable AI. You can’t have the Roaring Twenties without Art Deco and the French capital saw the inception of this ecelectic design, which counts among my favorite topics. Even if I’m a “little” biased over this game, you really can’t find many flaws to it. If you have the hardware to push those polygons with no jagged edges in sight, the eye candy alone shall convince you of this game’s potential. Once you’re played it for a bit, you’ll find its plot to be a worthy equal to the graphical style.Aquired taste or not, I’m never wishing to find myself playing a title in dire need of antialiasing. 4K resolution mitigates image artifacts quite efficiently. Couple that with steady 60 frames per second, and you have my answer in regards to console gaming’s potential and the possibility that I migh own another one in the foreseeable future. Contrast was a sight to behold in terms of indie games in 2013 but it has “aged” well and will satisfy even the most pretentious players. Smooth jazz tracks couldn’t have been ignored given the nightclub and vaudeville/burlesque themes present in-game. Ears will be as pleased as the eyes. Structured into 14 distinct chapters, you cannot even say the game might lack in decent length. Especially so if you’re set to hunt every single collectible found in Contrast. These offer a glimpse into the lives of the characters as well as trivia about Paris.Last but definitely not least, I shall discuss exactly what makes this title stand out from a legion of 3D platform adventure games on Steam. How many of those feature both 3D and 2D platform sections? A handful at best. And none feature Contrast’s production values. This hybrid of dimensions works through the clever implementation of shadow play. A popular form of entertainment in many parts of Asia, it involves puppets or different shapes which are never revealed to the audience. Instead only the shadows cast by the objects occupy center stage. An artistic display of optical illusions, if you will. Who would have thought that beside shadow platforming, throwing Parisian cabarets and a riveting story about family and self-identity into the mix, might result in such a great title? Its dev team, that’s who. As far as I’m concerned, Contrast was 2013’s best indie game. Make no mistake, its price tag is fully justified. If you can purchase it outside of Steam Sales, by all means, do it. If you can’t, just wait for the seasonal discount and then purchase it. Indie developers such as Compulsion Games deserve our full support!Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics and sounds.+ Charming characters and storyline.+ Unique twist upon the platforming genre through shadow use.+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards.Weak Points- None worth mentioning.Rating 100/100  This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of LadyOberon, the owner of #GamersRule[ro.pinterest.com] "

												Before I begin the review proper, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge what a complete f*cking idiot I am.When I first played this I went through it entirely using mouse and keyboard, despite the fact I was frequently grumbling about how heart-breaking the controls were and the slight but still awkward disconnect between button press and character. But I still persevered because, well... sure, I do have a control pad, but since the mouse and keyboard were already hooked up and I was already in my pyjamas, I was hardly going to lean over a couple feet to my right to grab and connect a controller now, was I? But before writing this review I decided to give it a shot just to be sure, and damn, am I a complete f*cking idiot. It was a revelation. The difference might be small but the impact is massive, and that tightening of movement and control pretty much eradicated the major complaint I had about the gameplay. So I've learned my lesson, control pad for 3rd-person games from now on. Though, whichever control method you use, you should still find a lot to love about this game.Contrast is a 3D, semi-open world puzzle game with platforming elements. You play as the mute Dawn, an acrobat and circus performer... and also the imaginary friend of Didi, a precocious little girl living with her single mother in 1920s north America (I can't pin down exactly where it's set, as the world has a very European or maybe even Parisian vibe to it, but everyone has an America accent and dollars are a thing here. So possibly Canada? I dunno). Didi likes to sneak out with Dawn and follow her mother to watch her perform at the cabaret club at night, but this has landed her in trouble as authorities threaten to take her into care away from her ""negligent"" parent. And so, Didi and Dawn set about trying to make things right again, helping her mother reconnect with her estranged father who is down-and-out and in hot water with the mob, but also means well and is trying to do right by his family. What follows is an equally whimsical and saddening tale of a young girl's adventure through the dark world of grown-ups and her own upbeat imagination.The main hook of the game is Dawn's ability to shift into the world of shadows. Simply move up to any wall with strong light and shadows against it, and you can change to a 2D silhouette. But what's really clever is allowing the player in some cases to move objects between the wall and light source - or even the light source itself - to adjust the shapes and sizes of shadows for some platforming puzzle shenanigans. Sometimes these can be a bit fiddly as you might find yourself having to repeatedly re-adjust and finesse the exact position of things around in order to progress, but that's probably to be expected given the nature of the mechanics of play and would be all but unavoidable unless the movement of everything in the environment was severely limited.One look at a single video or screenshot should tell you all you need to know about the beautiful art design. The slightly dark, grim world being completely overshadowed by the colourful and elegantly animated Dawn, with only her and Didi appearing as solid models, while every other character is shown as a silhouette against a backdrop of any given scene. This is partly a happy accident due to the time and budgetary constraints of the developers and wanting to keep animation costs down, but a lot of credit does also have to go to the direction of the game and its intention of portraying a child's feelings of isolation. As too does the voice acting and music and audio in general. It's incredibly easy to have kids be annoying and grating in anything they appear in, but whoever voiced Didi did an amazing job at making her a lovable and sympathetic character that we want to see happy, which is lucky since we're essentially escorting her for the whole duration of play.With my five hours or so with the game I did occasionally have my issues with it, like some awkwardly executed puzzles (which, in fairness, may have been the mouse and keyboard controls getting in the way more than anything). But overall, I have little but kind words to say about the game, and even though I'm a bit on the fence about the ending, I like how open they left most aspects of the game. There's a lot of room for interpretation as the lines are heavily blurred between fantastical reality and hopeful imagination or the perception of Didi's own view of the world. The game has a lot of creativity, style and heart, and I really think it should be rewarded for that when so few other games seem to get that mix just right. As happy as I'd be to play a sequel in the future, even if this is all we ever see of the world of Contrast, I still had an amazing and mostly joyous experience that I wish other games would take note of and be adventurous or confident enough to try themselves.

												Contrast is a very beautiful game, it has a unique and interesting art style, the music is top notch, and the game play is pretty unique with using light and shadow to travel.  The story is pretty compelling as well, it has quite a few heavy subjects done in a way that seems genuine and not just thrown in for shock value...  The game has a few somewhat open areas to play through in each Act, the game is comprised of 3 acts,  each act will probably take about an hour or so.  The puzzles are fairly simplistic, although that isn't really a bad thing.  The story centers around a little girl known as Didi, she has an imaginary friend named Dawn, often being left alone at night so her mother can preform Didi enlist the help of her friend Dawn to sneak around in a landscape which is set in 1920.  Going along with Didi, the player (Dawn) will be introduced to numerous interesting characters shown only via their shadows.The length of the game is rather short, I have 11 hours clocked in but over 8 of those hours were from  idling cards while I slept.  I played the game completely and got all the achievements in a little under 3 hours. I'd recommend this game for the gameplay, interesting art style and compelling story.  I personally found it well worth the price I paid, but if you are a stickler for games having a lot of meat and potatoes, I'd think you may be better off skipping out on this one.  Fans of good games will enjoy this in spite of it's short length..			"

												Contrast has to be one of my all time favourite games. The puzzles are very unique, making you think outside the box.Working with shadows and lights, makes for a very different atmosphere and way of thinking. I am just absolutely in love with this game.The only downside is the story line isn't as full as it could have been. But I know the developers were low on funds and time and had to cut a MASSIVE part of their plans out. Looking forward to their upcoming game :)			"

												Great premise, potential to be amazing but ultimately falls short. Puzzles are to simple, It setups for a great story but doesn't do much with it.The shadow mechanic has potential for very complex puzzles with moving light sources, but boils down to pulling a leverto rotate machines on a fixed path until a path opens.Also very short, I completed the story, found all the collectables and got 100% on my first playthrough in only 4 hours			"

												""Shadows talks, didn't see the people walks""May be let the shadows to represent most of the characters is not a good idea. First few minutes find it special, after that it just become dry and plain.Good:- Good direction of design to show a 1920s world- Great soundtrack and vocal- Interesting graphic for interacting real landscape, lights and shadow- Puzzles are unique- First half of story is attractiveBad:- Have good mysterious story beginning but ends up with rush and waste- Checkpoint in later game insufficient, once fallen or exit the game needs to redo previous 15 min solved task- Some shadow platform moving puzzle is pure ""Trial and Error"" experiment, which is tedious- Only 2 real world characters (and one is mute) is too weak for the story line- Neglect the Trial and Error time, the whole game is short and around 3 hours to completeVerdict:Get it on big sales only, it's fun to try but not very fun to complete itScore: 6.5/10			"

												Contrast is an interesting game. 3D in the main world, 2D in the shadow world. Puzzles are built around the concept of traversing shadows to get to places you could not otherwise reach. Unfortunately the execution is lacking. The game is VERY finicky when it comes to where you can enter the shadows and if you get even the slightest bit off while in shadow you'll pop back into the 3D world and have to begin what you were doing from the beginning.Further, there's no educating the player going on at ALL. Studying Half-Life 2 and Portal's puzzle education should be mandatory for all aspiring puzzle game developers. On several occaisions Contrast throws some new concept at you and forces you to realize it's there. The end result is a game that you're fighting with in order to play instead of one you're figuring out. Frustration abounds, not because you cannot figure out what to do, but because the execution has to be pixel perfect or you have to start over.I would LOVE to be able to recommend Contrast. I really would. The music, the art style, the gameplay concept, the story of a kid with a troubled home life seeking to fix her world in any way she can. It's all great, but the core mechanics are just not there. Perhaps with some polish Contrast can become a game that I can recommend. Until then, only buy it if you reall love platformers AND it's cheap.			"

												This game has a great story, fantastic graphics and a captivating concept. I love the idea of merging traditional platformer with 3D story-rich. There is however, one MAJOR flaw that has nearly put me off even trying to finish this game. There is no way to actually *save* your game. Instead you are at the mercy of the game's ridiculously spaced out illogical autosave points, which are not even properly indicated when they activate. Apparently the developers think that everyone who plays their games are all day games who never ever have to close their game in between sessions, so be prepared to lose ages worth of work in one go because heaven forbid you have to shut the game down! I read in one of the earlier discussions that the idea of a tradional manual save point was ""discussed and dismissed"" by the developers, dumb move! If your'e going to force auto-save only then have a LOT of autosave points, I'm losing interest in the story and the concept because I have to keep redoing the same frustrating tasks over and over again every time I launch (and please dont' say I should just leave the game running, that's bad for your machine and I shouldn't have to...manual saves in story/task-risk games are expected features for a reason!)

												Short but beautiful and unique, Contrast is a game for those who like puzzles and platforming. It tackles on the mature theme of family dysfunction and while it doesn't explore it as much as I wish due to its short length it's still a beautiful game. The mix of 2D and 3D platforming at times works but at times feels buggy or inconsistent, but for an indie game it's not anymore then what you would expect.			"

												Contrast is a beautiful third-person puzzle platformer revolving around the little girl Didi and her imaginary friend Dawn, who can freely shift between the real and the shadow world. The game takes place in a Paris-like city in the 1920's and is also the debut for Canadian developer Compulsion Games.STORYDidi's mother dumped her father a long time ago and since she is a singer at a night club, nobody is watching after Didi at night. Naturally, little Didi takes this as an opportunity to take her imaginary friend Dawn with her on a night-time scouting expedition throughout the city to discover that her father came back and tries to win the heart of her mother again. But something stands in the way...I'm not sure if I just didn't get the reason for this during my play or of this was a story element deliberately chosen by the developer to create a certain experience, but apart from Didi and Dawn, all characters in the game are shadows, so you never see them in 3D. This works out okay, but makes the city look fairly empty and liveless most of the time. Considering the beautifully designed enviroments, this is a bit of a shame.VISUALSThe game is based on the Unreal Engine, so visually the game looks really beautiful. The overall art deco style of the game, the level design and the lighting effects fit together perfectly and create an immersive atmosphere. Quite frankly, a lot of the visual elements remind of of Bioshock: Infinte which, funnily enough, is also based on the Unreal Engine.Unfortunately, as with many UE-based console games being released on PC, the game doesn't really offer a vast amount of graphics options. Apart from gamma, graphics quality, resolution and fullscreen there's nothing else to adjust through the game directly. Don't get me wrong: The game looks great regardless but definitely could've used a bit of Anti-Aliasing. This could probably be tweaked through the config files or external tools such as SweetFX or your graphics drivers directly, but personally that wasn't really worth the hassle for me, so I decided to stick with the options that were available.VOICE & MUSICThe voice acting is surprisingly good for a non-AAA game like this. Didi's voice actor has that cute little girl's touch to her and really fits great to that character. Her imaginary friend Dawn, though, doesn't say a single word throughout the entire game, so whenever Didi talks to her (you), it always feels kind of weird that she never really answers. Might be one of those imaginary-friend-drawbacks, though. Who knows, heh.Didi's father is voiced by Elias Toufexis, who also voiced Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I was definitely surprised to hear him in this game but recognized him right away because of his distinctive voice. Voice acting for the side characters, which often tends to be poor because of limited budget, is also pretty decent, so nothing to complain on that side.The game being set sometime in the 1920's, it is accompanied by a fitting and relaxing Jazz-y soundtrack which fits the overall atmosphere of the game perfectly. Not exactly my musical taste, but then again, a Death Metal soundtrack wouldn't quite work in a game like this. Heh.GAMEPLAYYou control Dawn, the imaginary friend, and Didi effectively becomes your sidekick. Throughout the game, she will assist you with a couple puzzles but most of the time you will have to solve them on your own to clear the way for her, so you both can progress on your journey.The main gameplay mechanic is the shadow shifting, which you will use to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles such as huge gaps and so on. How this works is, that you basically approach a shadow that is cast by certain objects in the level, hit the shadow shift key/button and Dawn transforms from a 3D character into a 2D shadow, allowing her to climb around on those shadows. Together with the dash ability, that you unlock relatively early into the game, this makes for some partially challenging platforming as often the shadows will move (because the objects that cast them move) and thus require you to time your actions.While this mechanic is pretty cool and unique and works out quite good, it often suffers from imprecision and the fact that you often get shifted back into 3D for no apparent reason. You can't die in the game and if you fall down into the void, you will simply respawn at the puzzle again. This makes failing not that much of a big deal, but keeps you wishing the developer had put a bit more fine-tuning into the gameplay mechanics to reduce or eliminite those annoyances alltogether.For some puzzles, you have to move objects around such as wooden crates, serving carts or cardboard stand-ups, so they cast shadows in the right size and angle for you to be able to jump and move on them. This adds a bit of variety to the puzzles and demonstrates the impressive lighting effects the Unreal Engine is capable of.The puzzles as such generally are farily obvious and easy. The challenge often lies in the platforming or the object manipulation that comes with them, so often you have figured out how the puzzles work but will eventually struggle with the right shadow setup or the right timing during the platforming itself.All in all, it's definitely a cool mechanic but could've been pushed a bit further with a bit more extensive and varying puzzle design to actually test your combination rather than your platforming skills.PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITYWith roughly 4 hours of playtime, which included collecting all collectibles and getting 100% of the achievements, the game is relatively short and could probably be beaten in around 3 hours if you just rush through it. There aren't any additional game modes, so, apart from replaying the story for the collectibles/achievements, there's nothing else to do in the game once you've beaten it.CONCLUSIONContrast is a short but beautiful and charming puzzle platformer with a fairly unique gameplay mechanic.The game undoubtedly has some minor flaws and annoyances, but if developer Compulsion Games is able to deliver such a debut, I'm definitely looking forward to see more of them - and more of Contrast.

												Contrast starts on a very clever gaming mechanism but ends up falling short. The story is dull, the characters are botched, the game-play is repetitive and the controls are clunky. The whole game can be 100% completed in one seating of 4 hours.That is a pity because the premise of this game, the atmosphere, the era and the soundtrack are top notch. All the ingredients were there to make this game mythical. However, the poor execution ends up ruining the show and the whole thing feels sour in the end.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Compulsion Games Publishers: Focus Home Interactive Initial release: Nov 2013Genre: Platformer, Puzzle, Adventure#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationContrast is a 3D puzzle platformer with an interesting noir-ish art style that stems beyond a purely visual effect.In Contrast, you control Dawn. An imaginary person for most intents and purposes; The imaginary friend of Didi Melakaya. A troublesome gal whose parents have had some hard times. Totally understandable and relatable hard times. From Dawns perspective the world seems rather empty, as Didi is the only person she can actually see manifested in non-shadow form. Dawn is rather unique in that she herself can turn into a shadow. As a shadow she can walk and interact with other shadows and this is the main aspect of puzzle solving in the game. Moving light sources and traversal of the 3D platforms as well as the traveling between the two dimensional shadows allows for some interesting puzzle solving. This can be slightly mind bending at first while some puzzles suffer from mildly clunky controls but it's not that big of a deal in all fairness. Dawn seems to be a fairly lanky character and moves rather quickly for the size of the environment. This is a very minor thing but it's just something I noticed that threw me off a little. I mentioned that Dawn can become a shadow and that Didi is the only person she can see. All other people in the world are only shown as shadows. Though their voices can still be heard. Gives it a very noir feeling aside from the art style itself. I have always seen Dawn as more than an imaginary friend of Didi's creation and much more of a “how she sees herself as an adult”. Her inner desires manifest for the sake of gameplay and story telling device. The voice acting is very good indeed. Didi's father being the most noticeable without having to do much research. Quickly recognizing him as the same actor that played Aden Jensen from Deus Ex. I actually finished this game a while back but decided to revisit it briefly in the wake of “We Happy Few” from the same developers.

												Contrast:  This is a game of light and shadow. A simple three-dimensional platformer where a flick of the wrist turns into a two-dimensional platformer. Such a decision we have already seen in several projects, unlike Contrast - to use lights and shadows to create and manipulate level elements.Contrast short game: Three acts can run for 2.5-3 hours, even with search collectibles and secrets. The final stories are so predictable that they are even insulting. The visual style and mood of the game promises some mystery , detective story or drama, and as a result we get some banal family history, a place that in some lowly daytime drama. A pity.Gameplay:  This puzzling platformer built around the ability to turn into a two-dimensional character shadow. You press the button, the camera hangs somewhere on the side, and Dawn leaves from himself only a shadow in the form which overcomes obstacles and chasms . Depending on the shape you need to change the situation: a break in the wall will not go through the shadows, but to circumvent it in bodily form can be easily. On the other hand, the flesh will not leak, for example, through the glass, but the light (and shadow) will penetrate through it without any problems.Emotional Impact:  The emotional impact that you receive from the story is the jewel of Contrast.  This leaves you with a very memorable performance throughout the three acts.Visuals:  Incredibly stylish and beautiful thing. Almost every game screenshot can be long and enthusiastically regarded as if considering - a jazz fan, retro, cabaret and burlesque - the pleasure is doubled.Story:  The whole essence of Contrast - in the plot. Didi not the happiest child in the world : the parents at odds , mother rambles in the entertainment business , his father trying to deal with their problems , but even more breaks in them. But meanwhile, the sly little Didi goes into his inner world - a natural reaction of protection against the constant attacks of the vernal world. And the inner world in turn leads you, purely friendly shadow named DawnSummary:  Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles. It’s at its best when it marries its poignant story to its platforming, and at its weakest when it’s about moving boxes, but it rarely goes very long without showing us something worth playing.			"

												Contrast is a puzzle game with a mix of 2D and 3D platforming. It tells the story of a young girl named Didi who is cought up in the middle of a broken relationship of her parents. It's thick with noir atmosphere. But you play as Dawn, a mysterious woman who can transform herself to a shadow and run on the walls whenever there is light. This is when the 3D gameplay changes to 2D. You can use same abilities in the 2D and the 3D world. Which aren't much, movenent, jump, interact  and dash. There is no combat in this game, but on one scene you need to use your wits to overcome an enemy. The world and the characters look great, although the world is really empty. You can only see Dawn and Didi in this world. While others are shown only by silhouttes and this only happens in small cutscenes and other storytelling parts during the actual gameplay. The Jazzy soundtrack is really great whenever you get to hear it. Voice acting is top notch, highlight for me was Adam Jensen from Deus Ex: HR (Elias Toufexis) narrating a children's story! The problem with the game is that it feels unfinished. Odd hit detection, impresice controls, glitches and abrupt ending. Furthermore it's really short, but even with its current lenght it mostly needed improvements on other areas. Some of the story is also explained with the collectibles only, so if you want to get the whole story you need to collect those. Fun little game that clearly needed few months more developement time before publishing. [Score: 79]			"

Contrast  is a gorgeous looking, underrated puzzle game which I think deserves more light. In this review I will try convincing you to give this game a shot. 1. Storyline & Characters:The game gives you a feeling like 1920 noir films which  are so awesome. The main character is named Dawn, which is drawn with awesome art style. She looks like an acrobat with  make-up which I really loved. The story follows a young child named Didi, who lives with her mother and really misses her father (Guillaume Provost, the director of this game was a single father, so this kind of inspired the story in the game). Her parents have some problems and the whole story revolves around this family. Didi needs Dawn to help her find her father. The game implies that Dawn is a figment of Didi’s imagination and only she can interact with Dawn. Be sure to collect all collectables because they add more details to the main story and for Dawn’s character  (1 collectable is very important in particular).2. The world of contrast:I was browsing the collector’s edition art book and found a passage which perfectly described the world in a way which I never could, so I decided to share the quote with you. I usually neglect the art books in most games, but for this game I decided to take a look. “Contrast didn’t begin as a film noir story – the prototype was an alternate reality game, and shadow manipulation was just one of many abilities. The world was an abstract virtual reality; a dreamscape; a reality falling apart, fading memories that you had to recover. As the film noir story took hold, we blended our dreamscape with a vaudevillian 1920s/30s Europe, to create a unique world to tell our story. This is Didi’s world, a depiction of what she understands the world to be. The world of Contrast, the environment in which Dawn and Didi interact, is a take on that special world that a child naturally inhabits; a world that adults can see through the wonder in a child’s eyes. A world that we remember with fondness. It is a land of fragmented reality, isolated beauty, and imagination that is uniquely Didi’s and Dawn’s.”3. Gameplay & Graphics:If you have already seen any gameplay videos or screenshots you will see that this game has a pretty neat mechanic which really stands out. There are many areas where you can turn into and play as a shadow in the wall to solve puzzles. This key mechanic is required to reach some places. Shadow Mechanic[i.imgur.com]Now this is great, but the game is quite broken in its implementation. You have a button for entering and exiting this shadow mode the game has its own mind and will randomly decide to exit the shadow mode. This is extremely frustrating, because you need to redo the whole puzzle section again. Graphics are pretty decent for a game which is quite old. In the beginning of most games there is an “Adjust the gamma settings”  option and I usually just keep the default settings, but oh god I could barely see anything with the default setting. Due to not being able to see much in the game my playtime was extended.4. Music:The first time you open the game you will be welcomed by a sweet song, which  is beautifully relaxing and right on spot, and set up a good mood for playing this game. Another game with such an opening is L.A. Noire, which is very dear to my heart. The story  about Contrast’s own original score is quite interesting in my opinion. They used local Montreal voice actors and jazz musicians. The lovely voice from the main theme song is of Laura Ellis. Initially the studio asked if they can use one of her own songs for Contrast’s first trailer, and due to the trailer’s huge success they asked her to perform for the rest of the game. Laura Ellis[i.imgur.com] 5. Puzzles:Puzzles are very easy and the whole point in solving them is to play with light and shadows. Most of the puzzles are timed ones but the timer didn’t raise the difficulty at all.6. Collectables:The collectables are very easy to locate. Since they shine and glow, they are not very tricky to spot. Most of them are letters, pictures, newspapers and posters. The total amount of collectables is 26. There are things called luminaries which are located throughout the game (most of which on the streets) and do not count towards any achievements. They are rarely required to progress, and some are quite tricky to collect since the game is very broken at times.7. Achievements:Contrast offers very easy achievements, which can all be done in a single playthrough. While most of them are story related, 2 will offer some difficulty since they must be done without falling (dying). Again luminaries DO NOT  count towards any achievements. The total amount of achievements is 22.8. Final verdict & overall feeling:Well I felt it was very light hearted for me which is great. I didn’t want to get involved with a game which requires a lot of time and effort to complete and in this aspect Contrast was perfect. I really love games that question the theory of multi universe and alternative dimensions and I really like that Contrast is hinting a little towards that area. It made me rage a couple of times, because the game is very broken but at the end of the day I was pleased with it. The game can be finished in one sitting.

IntroductionContrast is a wonderfully designed, story-based platformer and adventure game that combines intriguing puzzles with 2d shadow elements. Unfortunately, the game suffers from quite a few jarring issues, and I'm only recommending it because of a pretty interesting story. GameplayYou're Dawn, the 'imaginary friend' of a little girl named Didi, and you'll go around with her discovering a pretty intriguing story involving Didi's parents. Now I won't reveal anything more about it, since the story is the best part about the game. So what about the actual gameplay? Well you usually have puzzles to solve involving shadows. Dawn can go into shadows, anywhere that light is blocked by an object, and she can move along a 2d environment whilst in the shadows. This is a very promising mechanic, but unfortunately it can feel rather clunky at times. To be honest, the idea was a very good one, but the execution was a little less satisfying. Puzzles were very creative, and never felt too difficult to solve at any point, but some interactions were rather slow and boring, turning the excitement from discovering a really cool puzzle into a boring waste of time. There were a lot of mini-cutscenes constantly interrupting gameplay which made the game feel a lot more laggy than it should.But the gameplay was not all bad. It had some really fun moments, including a minigame where you played a shadow character inside of a story, moving light sources/objects around to manipulate shadows and even shadow dashing through some timed objects in order to reach a certain platform. There are many collectibles to get and they are divided by Acts. Each act has its own set of collectibles and achievements, so if you're interested in getting those, I'd suggest you follow a guide because this game has one glaring issue here. Bugged achievements.After completing the game for the first time, I went to each specific chapter in order to get the required achievements/collectibles for those sections. However some of them took a couple tries to even work, and one refused to work no matter what I did. I had to start a completely new game and get all the collectibles in order to finally get the last achievement. And the bugs aren't limited to achievements or collectibles, oh no. There are a lot of glitchy areas in game which can cause you an immense amount of frustration depending on how hard the game is for you in the first place. I've managed to collect everything and complete the game, but others have had issues with various bugs, so be aware of this.VisualsContrast shines with its unique, noir-film styled game. Every aspect of the game feels like something from an 80s film. Lowering the graphics to the lowest setting removes most of that look, but the characters will dress the same nonetheless. Environments are well designed, and actually rather beautiful...the interiors that is. The world that you're in, is empty, lifeless, and generally boring. It's unappealing to walk around anywhere outside, but the interiors feel like something you'd want to be in. Again I'm conflicted here.AudioFinally, something I can totally recommend without hesitation. The opening music is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. The voice-acting is top-notch. Every aspect of the sound is golden and really sells the feeling of the game. I'm just sad we can't buy the soundtrack on Steam yet, because I'd happily buy that in a heartbeat.SummaryWell this is an interesting game to say the least. It has really good ideas for gameplay, an amazing story, a unique visual style and creative puzzles as well. However my experience in the game has not been without its share of frustrations, and I think it is important to consider those issues as well. I'm going to recommend the game based on the story and music only. The world did not appeal to me whatsoever and the countless bugs/glitches really took me for a ride. So now, if you as a buyer can appreciate the fine selling point this game has, and you are willing to deal with less than fluid gameplay, then you'll have an enjoyable experience playing Contrast. If not, this game probably isn't for you.6.5/10 - Good ideas, flawed execution.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												What a lovely, little, gem of a game.  The music alone kept bringing me back to play this short but unforgettable, smart, little game.  The use of shadows to move the story along and to solve the puzzles was refreshing and a lot of fun.  8/10.			"

												It's an alluring game artistically and the story is both entertaining.  The platforming is not too difficult and the puzzles worth the effort.  I found myself more apt to wander a bit to explore the world, but the game doesn't give you sandbox freedom. Voice acting is good, and the little girl steals the show.  My only complaint really is that platformng would occasionally get stuck on geometry.  The controls are okay - would be nice to be able to bounce off walls.  There were a few situations in Act 3 where a light cart would get stuck or a ball would end up in the wrong place and I was unable to move it back.  An addition of nice save spots in Act 3 would have been a good.  What could have better?...a bit more interaction with the little girl..with Dawn voiced.  That would help.  She is mute the whole game.  Or maybe just some scenes where Dawn shows some emotion.  I think that dymanic was missing.  Overall a good puzzle-story-platformer.  Not too hard, not too long, plenty engrossing.			"

												Contrast is a puzzle/platform game in which you play as Dawn, an imaginary friend to a little girl named Didi. You play in a surreal 1920s world in which you (the persona) experience the troubles of a little girl whos parents are in conflict.Indulge yourself in the immersive storyline while admiring the beautiful atmosphere around you. Compulsion Game's takes you (the player) through the highly seductive landscape that constantly surrounds you. The true strong point of this game would certainly be the possibility to shift from the real world (3D) into the shadow world (2D). The puzzles throughout the game require you to use each world effectively in order to complete. The game also utilizes a high quality jazz soundtrack which helps the game become more immersive for the player.Pros; Unique Gameplay, Solid Storyline, Stable Inferface, Artstyle.Cons; Short 5 hours of gameplay time, can't remap controller keys.Overall Rating: 9/10			"

												Gone Home, take some lessons here. This is how you intersperse a 'deep' storyline (I'm using this here both sarcastically and seriously) with some engaging and creative gameplay. Not just walking around and picking up♥♥♥♥♥♥Contrast brings a rather unique, at least for its time, concept of manipulating shadows as a platforming mechanic. The character cast and tropes they embody, and how that plays with each other is something I've yet to see in a game.This game is not without cons though. I felt the shadow mechanic could've been explored alot further, which ties in to my next point. It can be finished in 2-3 hours, more if you do all the extra collecting/slight exploration. The game is way too short to justify its full $15 price point. Get it on sale at $5 or less for maximum value. But do get it.			"

												Take a moment here to remember your childhood. Remember how afternoons after school could be filled with fantastical worlds brought forth from the trees, the rocks, the tall grasses in the backyard or the field near your neighborhood: all you needed was your imagination. Remember as you went to sleep at night and stared at the shadows in your room, sometimes in wonder, and sometimes in fear of the shapes they made. Remember how life could be magical in the most ordinary of things and how, as you grew older, you longed for the days when reality didn't have to be so damned real all the time: homework, bills, politics, relationships, family...That longing is at the heart of Compulsion Games' lavishly realized and gorgeous platformer adventure Contrast. Set in 1920s Paris, it paints a dreamlike world of cobblestone roads, nightclubs, and carnivals, all of which will at once remind you of Bioshock Infinite's art deco atmosphere, the simple drama of Hollywood's Golden Age, and with perhaps a helping of the musical Cabaret. Didi is the young daughter of a quarreling nightclub singer mother and a sometimes-there father who is trying to strike it rich with some shady investors but, as often is the case with shadiness, never quite seems to get a break. Didi copes with all of this with the help of the player in the form of Dawn, Didi's tall, waifish, silent imaginary friend, and the game leads Didi and Dawn through the nighttime town trying to help her family with their woes. To say any more of the plot would be a disservice to you, so let's move on to the gameplay.Anyone who recalls making shadow puppets on the wall as a kid will instantly feel in tune with the core mechanic here which involves Dawn's singular ability to become a shadow on the wall, quite literally. There is a sense of astonishment every time the game opens up a new platforming section because it is all done with light sources: streetlights and spotlights are switched on and suddenly and quite beautifully make the most ordinary setting, like the facade of a storefront or the walls of a hotel, into a visually striking obstacle course for Dawn to traverse. While sometimes the gameplay could occasionally be a tiny bit tighter, it never gets old to ""shift"" into shadow, and you will be challenged to think in some strange ways to solve some of the puzzles in your path. This is a mechanic as new and different as Portal's portal gun and it's something you will remember long after Didi and Dawn's story has concluded.That conclusion, unfortunately, comes much too soon as this game is quite short on the order of four or five hours, although you could spend a long time marveling at the charming art style of the characters and the setting of the moonlit Paris suburb, not to mention looking for and gathering each of the areas' collectibles, which add little distinctly artful flairs to the main story here and there. Normally I would find this too short of a game, but I can't bring myself to complain and here's why. A lot of story-driven games want to say and do a tremendous amount of things in the course of their stories, because, understandably enough, the developers want to have as many opportunities as they can to wow the pants off you with crazy setpieces and wild spectacle. The trouble with that is they almost always seem to get off course somewhere along the line and it can feel like a total sensory overload that in the end leaves you reeling, and not always in a good way. (I'm looking at you, Bioshock Infinite.) But Contrast has a single story to tell through Didi's young eyes and, without distracting you with twenty different characters and eight bizarre environments and thirty different weapons, Compulsion Games excels at telling it, a very ordinary, touching, human and absolutely enchanting story. One of my top games of 2013 and I very much hope it receives the wide recognition it deserves in 2014.			"

												Contrast is a puzzle platformer game which is set in a noir athmosphere. The game is about shadows and you proceed in the game by utilizing light to cast different shape shadows to create walking ground. You are a person named Dawn and you're an invisble friend of a little girl called Didi. You aim to help her with her problems such as finding out what her parents are doing.Contrast is running on Unreal Engine 3 so the performance is good and you can do some tweaking of things via the config file if you want to. It is somewhat annoying how you are being basically just funneled in the game majority of the time. Didi runs somewhere and you're supposed to follow her. Though, you do option to decline and instead hunt for some secrets and collectibles which help you with locked devices and tell more background to the story and kinda enlighten the events which are currently happening.Game is really short. According to steam I finished this just in 3.6hrs. So I'm not really sure if I could recommend this at the retail price of 14,99€, since the experience doesn't last that long and there is no additional things to make it last longer, such as difficulty settings or some extra modes. I'd say.. get it if you can get it for atleast 50% off because the lenght really is short. Then again.. considering how the story goes.. It might not be bad thing that the game is so short because you can actually ""buy"" the story still. Maybe if it went on for longer, it would get tedious?So final thoughts.. Get it from a discount, play with a pad or m+kb (I played it with a ms xbox360 pad and it worked well) and enjoy it.			"

												Contrast is a good game for people who are just starting out in the puzzle genre, but the more experienced puzzlers will not face any big challenges when playing this game.The shadow mechanic is interesting and the puzzles are fun, but there aren't very many and they aren't hard either. I was expecting something more and a lot harder. The larger puzzles still only take a few minutes to solve. If you're looking for a real puzzle game, you will be dissapointed. However, the atmosphere of the game is great: the puzzles tie in nicely with the story, the collectibles (documents and photos) are actually worth collecting, as they add some background to the story and the story is quite funny at times.If you're looking for a challenge, this game probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a nice story with a bit of player interaction, you'll most likely enjoy this. However, I'd suggest you wait 'til the game is on sale, as you'll easily play through it in under 4 hours.In short: Are you looking for a good story? Get this when it's on sale, it's very enjoyable but too short! Are you mainly interested in puzzles? Better look for a more dedicated puzzle game.			"

												An interesting puzzle platformer with an shadow dimension mechanic allowing you to use light sources to shadows that you will use as platforms to move around in the levels. It has so much potential with an interesting and fairly unique mechanic, a half-decent story and an interesting setting but sadly the game falls short of what it could have been and I think its due to lack of polish and at time inspiration (some parts just feel very ""meh"" and uninspired).The achievements are decently desgined with a heavy focus on finding collectibles (which are really easy to spot) and just beating the game. There are only a few missable achievements but they can easily be reached with the use of the chapter select.Time to 100%: 3 hours "

												Contrast is an exceptionally good game, if you enjoy what it does. The sterotypical 12-year-old Call Of Duty player, or the stereotypical Madden-fanatic dudebro, are not going to like this game, nor are they going to understand what makes it so cool, or so fun to play.But if you're the kind of gamer who can appreciate beautiful visuals, innovative gameplay, and a story-driven experience, Contrast is definitely worth a look.First off, the artwork in this game is gorgeous. It's a stylized, animated style which summons up a surreal Jazz Age Paris (?). It's affecting and evocative and surprisingly detailed.The game's shadow-shifting mechanic is novel, and the puzzles I've encountered thus far are unusual, but not frustratingly so. The story's the thing here, in the end, and the traversal puzzles and the jumping are just what you do while moving through -- and moviing forward -- the plot.Ultimately, this is a game which tells a story. It's told mostly through cutscenes, but the voice acting is generally superior, and the writing is solid, which keeps it all interesting. As has been said, there's a vaguely Bioshock feeling to the storytelling -- there's a mystery unfolding, and a faint air of tragedy or melancholy surrounding events, as if something sad is about to occur, unless it can be outrun or outthought.You play as the shadow-shifting ""imaginary friend"" of a little girl named DiDi, whose parents are on the edge of serious trouble. The game doesn't fully explain itself at the start. and certain events make you wonder if the often surreal landscape you move through is simply reality colored by a young girl's imagination or something ... else ... yet to be discovered.The game isn't perfect, of course. The shadow-shifting mechanic doesn't always activate as intended, forcing retries of a jump puzzle sequence. Also, for Steam PC users, the controls for this game were clearly designed for consoles, so if you have a USB game controller hooked to your PC, you'll almost certainly have a better time using that.And again, the puzzles and the narrative style of Contrast will not appeal to every gamer, but if you're intrigued, I'd say take a look.Contrast may well be a flawed gem, in some ways, but it's still a gem. Gamers often say they want ""something different"" in their gaming. Here it is. Recommended. "

												The basic idea is new and interesting, which is why I voted for it on Greenlight back in the day. But in the end I can't recommend the finished game. Its main problems are:Negatives:- The gameplay constantly gets interrupted by cutscenes. And by that I literally mean every 10-20 meters of walking distance. It's as the makers couldn't decide if to make a movie or a game. - Didis' dialogue and ""hints"" are often annoying and not helpful-Setting up the shadows (by moving lights or objects) in a way so that using them for advancing is possible often takes longer than it should. - The puzzles did not give me the feeling of achieving something by getting them right. They're pretty ""meh""- It's pretty short. I completed the game in 3 hours without dragging the playtime by doing all the achievements or finding all collectibles.Positives:+ The music is very good and fits the mood+ The artstyle and character-design is nice to look at+ No bugs, besides shadows very rarely glitching a tiny bit+ The shadow-world is a innovative idea+ Controls are alright with X-360 pad			"

												This game throws you a curve ball, and it is awesome! The game itself is shocking short but for its small size it throws a sucker punch ending. In truth it only took my a couple hours to get through this game and get a majority of it's collectibles but in my opinion, this game is worth the money you spend on it. It has a unique and artistic style on how they approach the characters and maps, not including the extremely unique way of game play. I have seen and played regular games that focus on realism and games such as Limo that focus on shadows, but I have never played a game that focuses on both! I give this game a 9 out of 10 and recommend others play it. On a side note, if you play it you should attempt to find a majority of the collectibles because it helps with the backstory of the plot but it is not needed.			"

												While Contrast's gameplay is very interesting and unique, the game itself is very buggy, and may result in the player having to replay large portions of the game after getting stuck. There were many times in which I got stuck in walls and objects which disabled me, forcing me to revert, but I could only revert to the beginning of the last chapter. This meant that the entire chapter had to be replayed, including the collection of the luminaries. Many puzzles were far too easy, and often seemed as if the solution was directly given to the player. The game seemed choppy and could have had much more fluidity. Contrast was fun when there were no bugs interfering with my playthrough, but rarely was I fully immersed in the game.			"

												Who would love a game that mixes the atmosphere of Mateusz Skutniks Submachine, Film Noir, The Prestige and Art Nouveau, wraps it up in a neat story, and built a platform puzzler around it with innovative gameplay? Hands? Everybody? Thought so.But you'd be wrong. No matter how much this game pushes all the right buttons in atmosphere story telling and art, the gameplay itself is so lacking that it manages to make a mediocre, maybe even downright bad game with all these wonderful ideas and this amazing artwork. The innovative gameplay soon becomes a gimmicky, and the only times it becomes really challenging, it is because you're struggling with the controls.The engine and gameplay glitches are jarring enough to make you lose immersion - at one point I managed to get the camera inside the protagonists head; her eyes sure look freaky from the inside. All the stunning backdrops in the world, and the artwork, again, do deserve the highest praise, do not a game make.The plot is mediocre. It more an outline for a stroy than a story. It could be completely told in maybe three paragraphs. While the reveal at the end is nice - I was surprised, though all the hints were there - it just doesn't have enough flesh on its bones to be really much of a story line at all.I wanted to love this game so badly, but in the end, the mechanics are so lacking, the game is so glitchy, and the plot is so much of a sketch rathery than a story I can't in good concience recommend this game. Development team, please, make a better game next time, becaue I'd love to play it.			"

												Contrast has been sitting in my Library for a while.  It always looked interesting, but never made the cut on new games to install.  Eventually, it made it on my Hard Drive.  And I'm glad I found the time to play it.  The game offers a unique light and shadow gameplay gimmick.  Your job is to help Didi find her parents and help them through the night to find success and hopefully more.  The story, which is played out entirely in shadows on the wall isn't anything to write home about, but because you are forced to witness it and interact with it at times it means that you will know what the story is and it works well for the game.The platforming is good, the animation is smooth.  I will say that the camera was a bit of an issue at times and that the 3D transition into 2D shadows can often times become a bit tricky, but never impossible.  The puzzles were great, never too difficult to leave out to dry, but difficult enough to at least make you think.The game is rather short and all achievements are easily accessible.  However, the ambience that the game sets with its jazzy tunes and its french influence makes for quite a fun ride.  Definitely a game that I would recommend for those looking for a good platformer to play.			"

												Contrast is a game with a solid idea and little substance to back it up.The core shadow shifting mechanic is clever and well designed.  Manipulating light sources to move shadows around is intuitive and adds some complexity to the puzzles.  Transitioning in and out of shadow is fluid and also fits well with the rest of the platforming.  That being said, the clunky physics will frequently and unexpectedly push you out of shadows, often times due to a poorly designed obstacle location.The highlight of the game is clearly its fantastic art design.  The surreal Parisian-noire tone is presented well, covering everything from the lighting to the architecture.  Once you've accustomed yourself to the art design however, there isn't much more to the game.  The story is charming but rather predictable, the environments are small and sparse, and the puzzles are short and straightforward (complicated only by the aforementioned shadow physics).  Most irritating for me were the constant fade-to-black mini-cutscenes, which take away control from the player and ruin the game's pacing.The pop culture geek in me got a kick from the various movie easter eggs (Casablanca! Back to the Future! Fight Club!), but otherwise I was left disappointed.  The premise shows a lot of promise but I wish the developers had done more with it.			"

												Ended up getting this because the mechanics looked interesting and it turned out to be a great (and underrated) little gem. Your character is a woman with the ability to shift between the tangible world and the shadows. She watches over a little girl and her family while navigating a strange city in a parallel universe, where the inhabitants are shadows and your character is invisible to all but the little girl.The game is a puzzle-platformer and your character must use the shadows cast by real objects (and people) to achieve her goals. This often involves moving light sources in such a way as to line up shadows just right to reach a ledge or time a jump over the shadows of moving people. The mechanics aren't perfect, but for the most part, the flow is smooth and fun.The graphics are detailed and unique, with a moody, jazzy soundtrack and a very endearing storyline. Definitely recommend this.			"

												This is a beautiful game from every angle.  If you love the 'film noire' type setting, this game is spot on.  The ability of Dawn to move between 3D and shadow was brilliant!  I wasn't too sure at first how they were going to incorporate it into the gameplay and not make it clunky, but they managed to pull it off.  The puzzles aren't too hard (although I think I impaled myself on the bamboo at least 10 times), which is great for a casual gamer.  Take your time and enjoy the scenery, the beautiful voice of Didi's mother, and prepare yourself for a story that will make you laugh, might make you mad, and maybe even a tear out of the corner of your eye (just move your beer).

												For the longest time I can remember, I have wanted this game. I recently bought the game while it was on special and have been very, very disappointed with it. Let me explain:The game, overall, has immense potential. The plot was quite interesting (for an 70's/80's setting), but you keep waiting for that 'oomph' factor that never arrives. Instead, you're reduced to a puppet who follows the instructions of a little girl who ultimately, towards the end, becomes very annoying.Your character learns some valuable skills, which you will probably never need to use ever again. Its just disappointing. Certain skills (like dash) you might need later on, depending on how you play really.The controls are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ABSOLUTE.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You think I'm joking? Go ahead and play this game and then join me in saying its♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it is. I don't know about those who used a controller, but for anyone using a keyboard, I'm so sorry. I can imagine what you may have gone through because of this game. The camera IS WORSE. Its terrible. Absolutely terrible. I can rarely turn a corner WITHOUT the camera making a 360 around me. I honestly need to pause and regather my surroundings before moving on. THE SHIFTING. OMFG. The shifting in this game is an absolutely wonderful concept but you'll rarely need it for any good purpose. You only need to shift to move objects, solve puzzles, and very rarely, to attain items. THAT IS ALL. To make matters worse, sometimes you will get stuck as soon as you shift, unable to move at all, OR you'll suddenly be thrown out of your shift (this is often not going to be your fault). The game is set in a very surreal map that's sloppily done. You can easily glance through walls, end up in several hundred glitches, die making a very small jump, think you have discovered a secret area where you might find an item only to discover that its a dead end that the developers left to screw with you. Haha. Screw this♥♥♥♥♥♥In all faireness, Contrast is an exceptionally interesting puzzle game which I would have highly recommended, however, as it stands, I'm afraid I cannot. Like many others have mentioned, if you do find this game on sale (75 - 95 percent off) then grab it and give it a try, otherwise, you're better off saving that cash for something else.			"

												It's good, but you should know what you're getting into. This is not a head-scratcher. This is not a sprawling adventure that will fill hours of your life.This is a charming, light puzzle game that you'll finish in a couple hours (In my 3h of playtime I've even got all the achievements, and I had to replay a section for one of them). For its price, I think it's more than worth it, however.			"

												Now this is an interesting game.Contrast, a 3D platformer puzzle game in a noir style. There is not much to say about that, it's simply beautiful, it really gets you in the 40s mood. Same goes for the soundtrack, amazing and enjoyable to listen.The story is very original and complicated, but not too hard to understand (I'm looking at you, Bioshock Infinite). The characters aren't much ""characterized"", but they make their part good, thanks to the great voice acting. But there is a problem. Big problem. At least for me: Didi, the little girl that follow you around it's pretty tedious most of the time, and you have to deal with her for the whole game.Game's kinda short, only took me about 4 hours to finish, even tho I got stuck thinking in a bunch of parts.But here's why this game sometimes gets really annoying: the controls are TERRIBLE. Just touch a key on your keyboard or move the analog stick on your controller and you'll see the protagonist flying away with a turbo speed; this makes her hard to control, and it's the main thing since it's a platform game. You'll find yourself make the same platforming stage over and over again for this as much as I did. This calls for ragequit or howls of rage. (btw I recommend you playing this game with a gamepad, or else you're gonna have a bad time).Final Score: 6.5/10It's a very nice game, enjoyed my time playing it, expecially for the sweet music. Got this game for 5€ with a sale, and I feel that's a great price for it, money well spend.			"

												This game is targeted at a very niche group of people. Best to describe it as ""inspiring"" After finishing it you will feel like putting on a record of some old french chanson, grab ""Mario and the Magician"" by Thomas Mann and spend the rest of the evening reading and thinking about the lost world of circuses, magicians, and cabarets. If you have the slighest doubt about the world shown in the trailers, or you find yourself not interested in the world of the 1920s cabaret-world at all then my advice is to stay away from this game. You will simply not enjoy it based only on the gameplay or story because it has it's flaws (quite a few unfortunately). I made a pros and cons list just to show it in detail.Pros:- absolutely amazing, beautiful world. a true artistic masterpiece.- brilliant soundtrack, there are a very few games that come close in quality and execution.- great sound design (I'm talking about the fade-outs, reverbs and use of filters)- an interesting (but poorly executed) content.- tons of potential- interesting characters- puzzles requiring ""out of the box"" thinking.Cons:- horrendous glitchy gameplay with a tons of bugs (rage inducing at times)- glitchy and shaky camera movement- unresponsive controls (I played with mouse+keyboard)- mediocre story- a small game world, invisible walls not really meant for exploring (except for a few collectibles)- relatively short game time (3-4 hours including collectibles)As you can see I personally enjoyed my journey with ""Contrast"" but I'm sure it's not going to be a mainstream success. If you still feel like buying it after reading this review then I'm sure you will love the game (knowing what to expect)			"

Didnt quite understand the ending, Its probably just me but it went over my head. Not the usual to have a 20's-30's theme setting, So thats quite enjoyable. The songs were well sung and its a really pretty atmosphere. I'll give it 9/10 i only wish the ending could be a bit different and the whole game longer.			"

												Aesthetically sort of.. French.. Words like noir, burlesque, voudeville, cirque come to mind. Very pretty.Gameplay wise, it is a puzzle platformer, changing perspective between 3D third person view and flattening yourself into 2D world of shadows. You jump around, interact with items like crates and light sources, use shadow world to bypass something you couldn't in the 3D world, push story forward. Pretty enjoyable mechanics. Ultimately not very hard, and not very long, but quite fun.If you want to know how it is to be an imaginary friend in a mind of smart, but very disturbed child, this is it ;) However, it's not necessarily that. I'll let you decide.For bonus points, it has Adam Jensen and William Taggart from Deus Ex: HR (okay, I mean respective voice actors) and lots of movie references.			"

												What to say.... here we have a nice little precious gem. If you are tired of mainstream games where you kill &shoot and would prefer something more arty and different then you should try Contrast. It's a 2D/3D platformer with fascinating story and catching narrative. It's like reading a little child tale. The setting is very fascination resembling Paris (France) of the 1930s with a little bit of Noire style. Although it appears to be a game for kids in reality is not. The thematics and the deep sarcasm inside this game are designed for an adult gamer. The game itself is not very long (like every indie game) but the refreshing gaming mechanics (in the platforming part) united with a catching story and athmosphere are going to keep you attached to the game until it's finished, like the good child tales we were used to read when we were kids. If you want something different this is definitively the game for you.			"

												The game has style and an interesting system in the shadows gameplay, but the story ended up feeling a bit weak while the gameplay isn't as tight I wished it to be. I had to redo some parts because I'd get thrown out of the shadows when I shouldn't, for example.Speaking of style, the game has it not only visually. The music is quite nice too and I liked the voiced work.The collectibles add some nice background info, which makes trying to get them all satisfying and the way they are presented adds to the charm.It's not a long game (took me 5 hours to complete it, and I restarted the first Act to get all the collectibles since I had missed one the first time around), though I wish the middle part was split in two since the 2nd Act felt paced a little worse/felt a bit more.... loose compared to the 1st and 3rd.At the end, I feel the game is worth to be played/experienced, but I'd only recommend to buy it for at least half off, if not less.

A Child's Imagination Come To LifeMy boyfriend grabbed this for me because he knew I'd been anticipating this game since it was announced. Contrast is a noir-mystery that's filled with creativity, empowering messages, and gorgeous graphics. You play Dawn, a picturesque, fashionable, speech-impaired woman who can fade into the shadows, unseen by the colorful characters that walk among your partner in crime. You're there to aid Didi, a brave, optimistic, imaginative young girl trying to pick up the pieces her broken family leaves behind. The still life of everything around Didi and Dawn are metaphorical in that it makes the situation seem dark and bleak until you play through the puzzles and breathe life into everything.I would have had a problem with the length had the story not been executed as well as it was. The mechanics are unique and unlike anything I'd seen before and it seems like they've fixed all the glitches fans mentioned. I also used a controller so shifting from 2D to 3D and vice versa was done with ease. About midway, I started wondering who Dawn was and how she spawned from Didi's mind and was left with a treat in the end when all of my questions were answered.This game has a lot to offer and if you ever get a chance to pick it up, do it.9/10			"

												Contrast is a pretty relaxing & beautiful Indie game. As the game suppose to be, it is mainly about puzzle solving, or in a ""Contrast"" way to say --- Shadow walking :)The game is a bit short, so if you anticipate a long run, it probably will NOT fit your requests, I got a whole walk-through with all achievements done within 10 hours. I highly recommend you to purchase it on a sale.But please don't get me wrong, apart from the length of the game, it is a fabulous one with gorgeous graphics, attractive storyline (make me go back to my childhood somehow lol), marvellous music, and fantastic ""contrast atmosphere"", it will please you if you are ready for a light breakfast of vantage video games.Scarlet's Score: 7.9/10			"

												This game, without the glitches and bugs, is a 4/5 easy. However with all the little bugs, glitches, and invisible walls I just couldn't enjoy it. 2/5 in the end.I wanted to love it, but there's only so many bugs you can take.The environment is amazing and surreal, visuals are cool, the shifting concept is very unique, and the gameplay is basic but solid.The downside comes when you start actually trying to complete puzzles or shift into the walls, Dawn (the character your play as) constantly jumps out of the walls, gets stuck on little edges in the shadows, or cannot jump due to invisible roofs or walls. The camera is a bit all over the place too, zooming in and out as you run and slow down and doing huge pan events for various reasons. I've never gotten motion sickness before from a game, but like some other people, this game did indeed give me motion sickness after about 30 minutes.Its about a 2 hour game that takes over 3 and a half hours as you have to try sequences over and over and over again because Dawn keeps glitching out of the walls or getting stuck on elements in the environment :(			"

												Contrast is small, but it makes big in our hearts.We take the roll of Dawn, a shadow presence only seen by a small girl named Didi. The youngster is curious about the world, and has a dream; bring her family together.While we use the shadows to solve puzzles and protect Didi, we get ourselves wrapped in a plot to help Didi's family, or what's left of it. A father who is involved in shady mob-business, a mother who sings at a club, and a strange magician who is somehow related to Didi. A beautiful plot within an even gorgeous 1920's atmosphere, full of hopes and dreams disguised in the deadly shadows of the alleys.Although the puzzles start on an easy way, it soon requires you do make use of your grey cells, and when you’re really enjoying, it ends...! Collecting achievements is fun, and will maybe give you a reason to go back a second time.Overall the game presents a nice experience, with a nice soundtrack that take you back several decades to an era of glamour.I give it a 7/10. It's amazing, but short. Twice the length, and it would be a solid 9!			"

												Recommended with some reservations.....“It’s as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan’s Labyrinth”VENTUREBEATNo, just no. It's as if Echochrome II & Rain dry humped to an episode of Sesame Street. The game from a conceptual point of view has so much in it's favour - noir setting, the shadow based puzzles, a storyline & characters which have potential to be interesting. In my eyes however the noir setting and general atmosphere is flat and lifeless given the themes and what they had to work with. The shadow based puzzles are simplistic and clumsy in the majority of cases favouring artsy fartsy stylings over the kind of truly satisfying, mind bending puzzles you'd get from say Echochrome/shift, Portal or Swapper. The storyline almost offers redemption with gray areas being left for the player to fill in the gaps based on scraps of information gained from collectibles, info within the lighthouse and the game ending.That said, this is a positive review. I played to completion & enjoyed it - the metascores are correct, it's a 6/10 game which had huge potential but falls short in so many areas and relies heavily on styling.			"

												I had much higher hopes for this game. The premise is neat - you control Dawn who can literally ""shrink into the shadows."" However, the execution is poor; the controls are clunky; the story is cliche; the writing is atrocious; and the voice acting is grating.The game is broken (intentional pun) into three acts and tells the story of Didi who is the only one that sees Dawn. While you can shrink into the shadows, the lights only light up in the areas where there is a puzzle. Everywhere else, there are no shadows. Given some of the platform jumping needed for the puzzles, the controls are wonky. They are extremely loose and the camera wanders which makes the POV confusing. Sometimes you will do a puzzle and the camera is in one location. The next time (because you fell) it is located differently and can't be moved to a better location because it is stuck or something.There are collectables in the game that are easy to collect. They are usually in your path and have blue sparkles swirling around them. In addition, there are several luminaires in the level. These are balls of lights that can be used to power equipment. These are spread through the level - some in your path (enough to finish the level) others in harder to reach areas. However, in many cases if you don't get them you can't get them later. In order to get full completion, you have to start over. I did this several times. Frustrating...There are no people in the game, other than Didi. Key story points are told through shadow figures. (My wife saw Didi's mom and made a comment that she wouldn't be able to stand and likely would end up on her face she was so top heavy.) This is interesting enough, but the shadows clip through the environment. Along with the voice acting, I was pressing the ""Y"" button to skip them. Some special swirling items activate ""special"" shadow show puzzles to flesh out the story.Its not all bad. Some of the puzzles are clever. Act II is pretty neat. Didi needs to fix a circus for her dad. And as I said, the idea has potential, just poorly executed in my opinion. It is hard to recommend this game, especially at full price. Wait for a sale. A good sale and don't expect too much.			"

												Contrast is a stylish platformer that doesn't entirely manage to convince. Let's start with the graphics. They\re quite stylish, '30-'40's style, but they're also a bit dark sometimes. As a result fine details aren't sometimes clear enough. Nothing gamebreaking but a bit disappointing. And while the game makes you think the world is open there's usually only one correct path to follow. You can run around a bit and try to collect orbs or collectibles, but it's nothing fancy. Where Contrast shines, however, is the fact that it allows the main character to use shadows in order to solve puzzles. It's unique and usually works quite well, but there were a few times where the game got glitchy, getting the character stuck in the environment or switching to your 3D form while still using these shadows.There's also a story which is actually fine, just not very well realized. There's a connection with the little, physical girl but whenever there's a shadow conversation it's hard to connect with these characters, because they're just that; shadows.The music is actually well done, with some nice jazzy tunes in it. The voice acting is also done extremely well for a game of this caliber.The game ended after about 3 hours, which gave me mixed feelings. I kinda wished it was longer, but, you know, bigger and better. But because it's not I was actually glad it was over. It felt a little bit too gimmicky. Which is a shame, because you can clearly see the game was created with passion.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												FIrst thing you need to know: this is a very short game. Even taking it slow and going back for 100% achievements I only got about 4 hours out of it. On that basis alone you probably want to wait for it to go on a pretty major sale. In fact the length of the game is one of the main reasons I'm not recommending it. For a game to be so short I feel that it needs to make up for it by being either increadibly good or extremely original. Or very very cheap. I seem to be in the minority, but I don't think Contrast quite made up its length on any of these.As far as the game itself; it was fairly good but there were a few things I felt let it down. The story was a little childish, naive, and predictable. While it delt with some darker topics, things turned positive way too quick to seem real or satisfying. The world in which the game was set was interesting and had some great ideas, but also suffered from a slight vagueness which I think was meant to be mysterious and intriguing but didn't ring true to me. Personally  I'm used to my fictional worlds being a little more conrete and storylines a little less sickly sweet, but given the other ratings that seems to be a matter of taste.The platforming integrated with the shadow mechanic which the game centres around was both novel and enjoyable if straitforward. The levels were fairly pretty, and the jaz theme throughout suited it very well, but they were also quite small and sparse. Honestly if it was longer (both for playtime and to stretch the conclusions to storylines) it could have been a very good game. As it is, it turned out fairly good but not something I'd recommend. Excepting on sale.			"

A Cute, enjoyable Noir gameContrast is a fun, neat little platformer. In Contrast, you play Dawn, the silent 'imaginary' friend of a young girl named Didi, whose mother is a cabaret singer. Throughout the game you help her solve puzzles and get past obstacles by using Dawn's ability to 'shadow walk' in 2.5 style platforming sequences.While the game is not a technical marvel, Contrast oozes atmosphere. Inspired by a 1920's vaudeville style, the game features impressive if somewhat linear levels. The choice to make almost all of the characters actually shadows of themselves thrown on to a wall Dawn is platforming across is a very nice touch that allows for almost all of the story to be explained while you're playing the game, so cutscenes are down to a minimum(in fact, there are only two or three actual 3d models of characters in the entire game, one of them being Dawn, the player character) while giving you something to pay attention to in cooperation with the gameplay.Gameplay wise, Contrast is fun, but is hampered somewhat by glitches and clipping issues. Some parts can be aggravating simply because Dawn clips weirdly into a shadow or hits a part of a wall that randomly ejects her from her shadow persona, usually over a bottomless pit that resets you at the start of the current section. Despite this, the shadow puzzles are well thought out and interesting, and despite hearing a lot of complaints in the reviews on the camera, I found that the developers managed to make the camera do what the player wanted(many times I found the camera 'locked' to a certain axis, which made platformer easier and highlighted spots I should be focusing on). There are many times when Dawn got caught on pieces of the level, or clipped at the edge of a shadow and simply threw me back out again, failing the puzzle. However, these issues were minor enough that there were only one or two times I truly felt the game was entirely at fault. Contrast's level design is pretty solid, though very linear, with the world well conceptualized to mix between shadow movements and 3d overworld sections, which serve to move you from one section to another. Occasionally I did find sections where it wasn't clear where I was supposed to go(In one, I had to resort to a walkthrough simply because the game's lighting hadn't highlited a jump point properly)This is not a very long game, but I think I like that(the entire game and all collectibles took a few hours at best). Not every game has to be 60 hours of content. Like a movie, this game has a story to tell and it's good at pacing itself for that story without dragging. The best description I can give for the playthrough is 'comfy'. It's not particularly hard, but a few of the puzzles make you think. And that's really Contrast's largest failing, in that the game is relatively easy for these sorts of games. I think this is by design, as it feels like some things were made simpler for a younger audience. Collectibles are sprinkled directly in paths you'll be heading anyway, and simply add little flairs to the story exposition wouldn't be able too, so I have no complaint with them.All in all, Contrast is a pretty decent buy for the price, though some leery of its short play time might want to consider wishlisting and waiting for a steam sale.ProsNovel ideaInteresting StyleChildren-friendly gameplayConsOccasional glitch/clipping issuesShort play time.No replay value.

												Contrast is a 3D puzzle game with platforming elements. You play as Dawn, an acrobat and circus performer, and also the imaginary friend of Didi, a little girl living with her single mother in nearly 20's. Didi likes to sneak out with Dawn at night and follow her mother to watch her perform at the cabaret club, and there the story begins, so I'm not gonna spoil you.The main hook of the game is Dawn's ability to shift into the world of shadows, changing to a 2D silhouette. This mixture of 3D and 2D are just awsome. Who ever thought about making a game like this? This concept is just awsome, and the story and picture style that is completly an art, the characters itself, make a complete pack. I've never seen something like that.OOOOHHHH, I MUST MENTION THE SOUNDTRACK. the soundtrack fits perfectly to the ambiances, and it's just aaaaaaaaaaaaawsome, I LOVED IT.I wish with all my heart that they make a sequence in the future!

Initial ImpressionsContrast has quite the draw with the art style and the shadow mechanic. They combine particularly well for the noir atmosphere and also greatly accentuate the shadow play storytelling.Current ConsiderationsThe voice acting is fantastic. It reminds me of some older films that I watched growing up. While the story itself isn't anything new, to see the drama unfold as a proverbial fly on the wall makes for interesting storytelling. Though perhaps ""shadow on the wall"" would be more apropos.Future FixationsI played through the game in english and did a brief replay in french to glean some extra emotional context. I had heard enough of the game to want the soundtrack and mayhaps to dig out some old jazz songs to listen to later. Much like the game's titular song; the game is unfortunately short, wonderfully sweet, and oh so splendid.			"

												If I recommend this? Yes! The Graphic is great, the Story is good, the Gameplay is awesome, the switch between 3D and 2D is greatly done and I just love the Game. Sometimes, I have Moments when I'm like ''AAAAAH why this SH*T didn't work now'' but I'm not sure if the Game is bugged a bit or I'm just impatient in that Moment. Overall 10/10 - the Gaming World needs more such Games!			"

												This game was fun, but I'm not sure I'd want to pay full price.The music is really good, a lot of jazzy songs that fit the style of the story very well.The story is interesting, and while the writing is occassionally cheesy, overall it is engaging and interesting.The gameplay mechanics are unique in my opinion, but they are also poorly implemented at times.  The ability to shift between the real world and the shadow world was a good idea, but the controls often feel clunky and unresponsive.If you can pick this up on sale, it's a fun few hours.			"

												Very short game -- 3 hours.  It's well-guided, and by that I mean intentionally directed, so it's not like you can get lost or take much longer.  That said, it was fluid, gorgeous, and a fantastic concept -- in exactly the same way that the original Portal game was.  An example of an innovative and creative game mechanic.  I'm wishing for much more.  Whether or not it's worth the full price, it's definitely worth the discounted price.  And the jazz music is perfectly my style.			"

												This game won my heart. Few games can be considered a visual and audio delight such as Contrast is. It is definitely not for everyone, not action packed or with potential cliffhangers but it’s by far a star. It’s the result mix between the 20's- 30's atmosphere, the vintage representation of the decadent circus life, the dream shards of a Parisian street, and the film-noir instrumentals. It has clever and most importantly aesthetic puzzles, playing with memories and shadows. It does however have its disappointments: few bugs and glitches that may at times annoy the player a bit. I also heard that people have problems playing the game itself because it freezes (it happened to me as well but only on short period of times) and crashes; and of course, the biggest problem of the game is that it’s too short. I would have adored to spend more hours of gameplay; not only that but because the game is too short we have to take the characters as they are, with few information about them and we have to adjust to the ‘momentary’ feeling of the plot. In what concerned the characters and the story telling: it’s a great plus. Until the end it makes you wonder what is reality and what not, what is fantasy and what is science. You get to see all these interesting side characters and discover that, in truth, the story is about them. It’s a game perfect to play during the evening and I encourage anyone with a bit of taste for the aesthetics to try it.			"

												For a 3D platformer the games controls are, to say the least, lackluster. There's a jump, a dash, and the ability to merge onto walls that have light on them. Aside, from these there's the ability to dash in the air and that's really it, unlike most other 3D platformers you don't really have a progression with more abilities added on or building on concepts. Luckily, it doesn't have the same issue as many other 3D platformers in that the camera doesn't fight against you a lot, though there are still moments of it.If you like to go fast, the dash is slightly faster than the walking speed so you'll probably end up just spamming the button to move around (With the exception of going down slopes as the time it takes to fall after each dash on the slope is often longer than just walking down.).The puzzles are often very easy, almost as if this game was designed for children. With the final level being an exception. In that chapter, instead of being too easy the puzzles are then made to be super vague and it seems like this portion was rushed as it lacks in polish compared to the rest of the game.As a bit of a side note, I managed to bruteforce my way through most jumping puzzles by abusing the dash in the game (You can dash as you unmerge from a wall and this lead to dashing while merged on a wall then unmerging and dashing.)By contrast, the story is very mature with a lot of talk about divorce, murder, and the like (Spoiler: There's even a scene where the little girl's mother attempts to kill her husband.). So that assures me that this game isn't meant for children. Like it's been said, this game can be 100% in a very short time. I beat the game with around 80% completion in about an hour and a half. It then took about another half hour to tie up the other achievements I missed. So you will not be getting a whole lot of time out of this game.I'd say there's one thing that makes this game fall short and that's it's lack of freedom and lack of replayability.Now let me explain what I mean by lack of freedom, the game feels like it might be an open world, or even Banjo Kazooie or Mario 64-esque hub world with stages, at first, but you soon realize it's a linear story with chapters and many many invisible walls. In the first area if you explore you can find the secret room with the donator names and I was hoping there would be more secrets like this as the game went on, but no that's the only really optional area in the game. Aside from that there are the lumes(?) spread around in the world and a completionist would want to go an collect those, but you only need about half of the lumes in a given area to proceed. This brings forth the question, why are there so many when you need so few?Onto the lack of replayability, the whole reason to play this game is for the story. The gameplay is decent, but what is going to keep people playing is the story of the game. Once you know the story there's no reason to come back to it.I was going to go back and try a speedrun of the game, but the amount of cutscenes and unskippable dialouge killed it for me. I'm certain there's plenty of ways to break the game, skip event triggers, and the like, but I don't want to put that much work into a game that, frankly, I don't like that much.			"

												The Contrast Collector's Edition was gifted to me for $4.99.Now, Contrast is a relatively short indie game with a few glitches here and there. Puzzles may take some people a long time, but for the most part they were easy and entertaining (in my opinion). I would not buy Contrast for the base price, however at a discounted price, of course I would, no doubt.The storyline is quite deep and a complete analysis of what's going on/has gone on/will happen will take forever because of the unexpected plot twists. Again, like some Indie games, the focus was on Dawn, the supporting character you play. Technically the main character is Didi as she is the one you're helping. I still have many questions and am quite frustrated because my questions cannot be answered. I would love to have some sort of a sequel of this pleasant Indie game which focusses more on Dawn and Dawn's predecessor (Aurora). I want to know more about the Shadow World and how it works, along with information about Didi's interactions, and why no one in the 'Shadow World' can interact with Dawn while she is a Shadow etc. But a good game, just like a good book. leaves the player with unanswered questions that you feel a burning need to get answered...I hope the new game that Compulsion is developing will focus on the Shadow World. There is a giant plot twist at the end of this game, by the way! I give this game a 8/10.			"

												I only purchased this game because the little girl was named Didi and what I got in return was so much more. Beautiful music, stunning views and a gorgeous Player Character. The noir atmosphere made me want to listen to Jazz music, drink whisky and smoke a cigar or two. There were some moments in the game where the shadow mechanism made me salty as fook to the point where I wanted to swallow a grenade, but eventually I got passed it. The collectibles were fun and the witty achievements were cute, but the development of the overall story as whole won it over for me. I just wish it was longer and a little more in depth with the ending.			"

A very well presented and unique ""game noir"".I really like the story and style of this game! It's like it's been made by Tim Burton, Tom Waits, Jim Jarmush and Walt Disney.^^Summed up, the story is about a little girl named Didi and her imaginary friend, Dawn.You play Dawn, who can walk in the shadows and uses this ability to go to places where Didi can't go. All people, except of Didi, are seen only as shadows. Thus you sometimes experience pieces of the tale by climbing silhouettes of e.g. Didi's parents while fighting.There are some - more or less difficult - brain twisters to solve...Most of them associated with swithing fromshadow to shadow or placing lights the right way, so that the shadow casted by the environment helps you to reachthe next location.The grafics are fine, but could have been better. Especially the textures and antialiasing! All in all this game is just the right game to play now and then or while another more time consuming one (For me Witcher 3). "

												Horrible playing, amazing concept and story5/10------------------------------I really really wanted to like this game.  But it just... is not that good. The concept, the art style, jumping between to worlds seems amazing and in fact really is but on the other hand playing is totally frustrating sometimes.Thing is you start this extremely weird looking game and be like ""oh god this looks awesome"" and after some time you discover that you can switch between 2 worlds and you go ""that is AMAZING"". But after that you really play it and it is just HORRIBLE. Every 5 minutes you get into the moment when you know what to do, how to get there but the game is somehow broken and you just cant do it. Massive bugs and awful checkpoint system make it a bad game.When you 10 times fall from the ledge and the girl tells you for 11th time to ""hahah i know what to do..."" and repeat that same monolog she already did 10 times.. you just wanna throw a brick in her face.Contrast has looked sooo amazing at the store page so I've bought it in sale for like 5 € and I would really regret buying this game if it was at the full price. I have had to convince myself to give the game another shot to finish the story but it was for the purpose of finishing the game and not enjoying. There is a little chance for you to enjoy the game but for me it was just a horrible experience which is a shame because i mostly love these arty, weirdo games. "

												A short (~4 hours, with all collectibles) romp through 1920's vaudeville culture that tells the story of a broken family trying to pick up the pieces of shattered dreams, and a little girl trying to make the best of everything, in spite of it. The game is short, to the point, and entertaining, though slippery and squirrelly controls at some parts give a bit of frustration to some of the more precise platforming moments. Puzzles are mostly simple and serve just to break up the platofrming flow, which is nothing super timed or intense. There is no combat in the game whatsoever, despite what the trailers obtusely hint at. It is pure platforming. The game is very linear, with side treks purely for collecting objects that lend a bit of backstory to the events that occur in the game.Everything in the game comes together to emphasize the environmental aspects, pushing the circus and performance aspects with heavy jazz and lounge singer themes, and it all comes together wonderfully. Some story bits at the end seem to have been left intentionally vague and up to interpretation, and it causes a bit of heas scratching as to how things ""actually work"", but it's nothing that detracts from the actual experience.An easy recommendation for almost anyone.

I really don't want to give away anything from the story as I thought it was brilliant and should be discovered by the player. Enjoyed just about every moment of it (except 1 or 2 puzzles took me too many frustrating goes but I got it after about 10 minutes)A great idea to jump between the 2D & 3D world (or should I say 4D).Loved the music, just bought the soundtrack & will be reliving the 1920s atmosphere once again.Definitely recommend to all gamers. For a game under 4 hours, you won't walk away disappointed. "

												Contrast is a truly wonderful experience, that transports you to another realm that is itself a homage to the artistic beauty of the early 20th century.The name of this game alone should signify the degree of thought that has gone into justifying the protagonist's ability to fade into and out of shadow, for it really is a masterstroke as far as artisic licences go.While it has some minor issues, don't let that detract from the game's real 'pièce de résistance'; its amazing artisty and aesthetic design.My video review:

												Contrast was really a beautiful experience. Glad to have discover this great game with the Focus Creative week sale. The graphics are extremely pleasant and will bring you back to the 20's nostalgy, with a beautiful mix of influences, from the Vaudeville to the parisian streets abundant with Art Nouveau and Art Deco building, passing to the Film Noir. The Gameplay is addictive and original; (I suggest to use a controller for a better experience) permitting you to pass from the physical, 3D world to the shadowy's in 2D. The OST is astonishing and will please for sure to every Blues/Swing/Dixieland/Jazz Manouche fans and emphasize your immersion in this unique world. The game, sadly, is super short... It would have deserved a longer story! But in the end, you'll definitely love it! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Contrast fut vraiment une belle expérience.

Amazing journey through shadows...It's about: helping charming little girl (yep, Telltale has created a trend); solving puzzles. Why you should play this: fresh concept: switching between 3D and 2D worlds helps you go through levels by solving puzzles, the core of each puzzle is creating a shadow from the object by moving a source of light; it's incredibly stylish: the atmosphere of the beginning of 20th century, cabaret, circus – all that covered with the thin layer of noire and touching main theme;  it offers simple, but intriguing story about human fears and desires, mistakes and regrets, renown and family, desperation and relief; you like Portal series and missed to play something similar; you like puzzles and platformers.Why you may not like it: you don't like charming little girls and hate to help them; you fed up with stories about family importance; you may find ending too corny: the atmosphere is charged with mystery (or even tragedy), but final turns around a fairytale; it's short: 4 hours to meet credits, maybe it will take 5 hours to get all achievements; there's no zombies to kill.Do yourself a favour – spend 4 hours of your leisure time by playing this game: from start to end without break… The feeling of journey, the bouquet of mystery, the world of dreams, memories and shadows won’t let you be bored. It’s like a flash of falling star – bright and momentary, but something to remember. "

												While the ideas that drive Contrast are fantastic, the execution of this game is somewhat lacking. It's not a terrible game by any means. The music and atmosphere are enough to keep you entertained, and some of the puzzles are cleverly designed with both 2D and 3D in mind. However overall this game never amounts to more than a resounding ""meh."" Many of the puzzles offer too much frustration for too little of a reward, and for a game as short as this (around 3 hours) most of your time will be spent watching cutscenes. Even the story leaves much to be desired, leaving off just when things start to become interesting.If the atmosphere of the screenshots and trailers seems appealing to you, I definitely recommend this during a sale. Other than that though, I hate to say it's really not worth the effort. 2/5			"

												I had high hopes for this game and was really disappointed. I really like the surreal environment, the music and the 20's settings  but the execution is awful. The controls feel clunky, the jumping does not feel right, I know she has big legs but with just a push of the button she walks half of the screen, she is allover the place. The voice acting is meh, the object interaction is bad, she can interact with an object even when she's a meter away and facing the other way (she reaches out with her hand and the door opens behind her).You can take it during a sale if you want to play it for its aesthetics but I wouldn't recommend even that.

												The Idea is sound and unique. A 2d and 3d world to play in is nice, the controlls and shadows break the game however to the point of near unplayability. the controlls are chunky, and random in the amount of movement produced by a control being pressed. the shadows are unpredicable and do not always hold the avatar correctly. The player is often forced out of a shift by an unknown force often enough to stop being focused on the story and more on the task of overcoming the glitchy puzzles to move forward.			"

Why you should play this: fresh concept: switching between 3D and 2D worlds helps you go through levels by solving puzzles, the core of each puzzle is creating a shadow from the object by moving a source of light; it's incredibly stylish: the atmosphere of the beginning of 20th century, cabaret, circus – all that covered with the thin layer of noire and touching main theme;  it offers simple, but intriguing story about human fears and desires, mistakes and regrets, renown and family, desperation and relief; you like Portal series and missed to play something similar; you like puzzles and platformers.Why you may not like it: you don't like charming little girls and hate to help them; you fed up with stories about family importance; you may find ending too corny: the atmosphere is charged with mystery (or even tragedy), but final turns around a fairytale; it's short: 4 hours to meet credits, maybe it will take 5 hours to get all achievements; there's no zombies to kill.Do yourself a favour – spend 4 hours of your leisure time by playing this game: from start to end without break… The feeling of journey, the bouquet of mystery, the world of dreams, memories and shadows won’t let you be bored. It’s like a flash of falling star – bright and momentary, but something to remember. "

												Late 2014, local bar in the middle of who cares USA. I was sitting at the bar alone, like usual, watching as groups of people all around me were having fun and drinking. Some were catching up with old friends like Half-Life 2 and remembering the good old days; others were becoming well aquainted with the new guy in town, his name was Far Cry 4 and he was busy wowing people left and right with his fantastic adventures. Yet in between seeing someone introducing themselves to Octodad with hysterical laughter and another person meeting Bioshock Infinite for the first time, a young lady caught my eye. She seemed different, almost as if there was a charm to her existence that pierced the heavens with her classy look; it's as if she had just arrived in town, yet I could have sworn I met her before.I asked someone sitting at the bar next to me who she was. The response was worse than what I had expected, ""Oh that's Contrast, lovely girl; I heard she's pretty cheap too but I wouldn't risk the missus finding out so I don't know personally."" What a dissapointment, I must've seen her standing on the side of the road one day; and to think, for a $15.00 I could've gotten to know her better, but I was a taken man myself. I place heavy emphasis on the WAS. My night wasn't getting any better, I was lonely, depressed, I needed to feel something again and I figured she would be the one.I walked up to her and introduced myself, she hardley seemed interested in what I thought of her, yet her artistic nature spoke volumes to me. ""What's a classy platformer like you doing in a bar like this?"" She turned away from me, almost as if she was preparing for the onslaught of abuse I had planned for her. ""Do you like platformers?"" her voice was shaking, she felt the judgement of the whole bar raining down on her as we talked. I leaned in close, grabbed her shoulders and whispered, ""I love platformers."" She turned back around, her face was stone cold but I could see into her eyes, they were filled with happiness and ecstasy; I must've been the nicest person she's met in years because she said, ""for you it will be $3.00."" Now I may not be a detective, but from the way her eyes rolled towards the ground, I could tell she already regretted dropping the price for me. That didn't stop me from accepting the offer, but I did feel like I should give her more anyways, just so she feels better about herself.We head back to my place, this couch has seen much action but this was a rare exception. How could someone of this beauty and elegance possibly put up with her lifestyle. Just before I turned off the lights, I touched her back and brought her close, I could hear her breathing intensify. But she didn't bring me in closer, she pushed me away; she answered my confusion with a question of her own, ""can I sing for you first?""""What?""""Most clients love it when I sing to them before... we get down to business.""A little confused, I figured it would be best if she was as comfortable as possible before we began, so I gave her permission.

. As she started singing, I got mesmerized. Her story was strong and to the point, she has been hurt, perhaps that's what lead her down this road; her voice was beautiful, the song was perfectly put together, slow, smooth and reflected what to expect from this game.Contrast is one of a very small group of games where I feel the artistic vision is met to my satisfaction and doesn't appear to be trying too hard or too little to get across what it wants to portray. You view the situations that happen throughout the story both through the eyes or an innocent child and your own personal observations, giving the game a sort of dual perspective that leave the second part entirely up to your own observations. There is a plot twist as well that leads to a revelation I couldn't even fathom feeling for myself, leaving my reaction up to what the child felt when everything was revealed to her. The bond you have with the child as you play all while being a silent observer of the story made me feel different from other games, almost like another game I played recently and would love to play again (not going to mention it here).Other than the story, the gameplay and graphics seem to compliment eachother really well. The game takes place in  a Noir styled France stuck in a sort of purgatory where people can switch between either being a shadow or manifesting themselves in an actaul human form. I know, that sound weird, but the shadow swapping leads to some really cool ideas when it comes to the puzzle sections. You will occasionally have to think while moving objects in the third dimension in order to create and modify shadows in the second dimension in order to reach new areas. It can be tricky at times yet feels very satisfying when you succeed at some of the trickier puzzles.Yet, at the end of the day, the time I spent with the lovely lady was short lived. 2.9 hours on record is a bummer considering I actually went out of my way to collect as many of the hidden collectibles as I could find and still beat the game short of 3 hours. The world is very interesting, the gameplay is challenging (despite the controls feeling a little off) and the story is realistic and a little troubling, but in a good way. At the end of the day, I would recommend her to anyone who likes puzzle platformers, just be sure treat her the same was I did, or she's not worth your time.			"

												Once again a gorgeous concept with poor implementation.Controls are distorted, camera lives it's own life, physics are ugly. On top of it there is a bunch of bugs I faced. I stuck in textures right in the 1st room at the beginning and had to restart the game. Later I jump somewhere but instead of dying I stuck in an invisible texture and had to restart the game again. And later I somehow end up having right-click skill particles around me permanently.

												Well, I really wanted to like this game. The art style is great, innovative storytelling, fun gameplay mechanics.But...The PC KB/Mouse controls are TERRIBLE. Not at all intuitive. And fighting with the controls is even tougher when some of the game mechanics break. There were three times I had to watch videos to complete tasks that I was actually doing correctly. THE LAST STRAW was when I fired it back up just now, and my progress is gone. Done with it.Also, I left the game on by accident a pretty much a full day. I have about 3 hours playing.			"

												Contrast is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a noir like city.You play as a shadow that has the ability to shift between 2D and 3D worlds, you help a little girl to chase her parents, but things get complicated along the way. You get to know stuff you weren't supposed to, like who you really are and what a shadow is...Note. My review is probably biased, I felt in love with this game since the very first time I read about it, I hope there is a sequel someday... I seriously love this game.★★★★★ | Loved it "

												Contrast feels like a half-finished game that got pushed out the door because the developer ran out of money. It has a few neat ideas, but it never executes well enough for them to shine.Controls are passable, but not very satisfying. You don't feel very connected to Dawn, your character. It feels very 90s PS1 3D platformer, and not in a good way.The primary mechanical hook is the ability to step into and out of shadows to traverse terrain you couldn't ordinarily cross. It's interesting and there are some good puzzles, but like everything else in Contrast it feels unfinished. It's very easy to accidentally fall out of shadows and back into 3D, and some puzzles can be difficult only because it's hard to get the right angle to make a jump and stay in 2D.Any flow you might establish is ruined when the game constantly takes control of the camera so Didi can yell at you or tell you to follow her. I found this very annoying.The story is paper thin.There are a lot of sequence breaks, noclip glitches, and invisible platforms. If you're looking for something fun to speedrun, Contrast might worth a look for that.Check it out if you catch it on sale, but it is in no way worth $15.			"

												There is a lot to like about this game. It has an interesting story, and the 'noir' atmospheric setting works well with the game and it's main mechanic - being able to enter and move using shadows and light.The puzzles are fun and strike a good balance of difficulty, while the collectibles / achievements are not too obnoxious to find and add a little replay-ability - I was able to find most collectibles during my first play through without hunting around too much.The story is also interesting and keeps everything moving along nicely.However, there are a couple of criticisms. Firstly, what some might see as a fault is the short length of the game. It only takes around 3 hours to fully complete (including achievements) although some might play faster than others. Also, although I didn't experience any glitches, the puzzles where you have to carry objects while sometimes interesting do slow the pace of the game down a bit.My biggest criticism is the abrupt ending. Without spoiling it, I will say that the game ends quite suddenly and while I knew the end was coming I was expecting there to be some explanation for how / why events were playing out.Overall I would recommend this game, despite the criticisms it is fun, but I would only really buy this game during a sale as I don't think it is worth the price without any discounts.

												This is a fantastic puzzle/platforming game that has some unique gameplay elements, a great story and wonderful voice acting. You play as Dawn, who goes around helping a young child named Didi fix various things in an attempt to save her father from trouble and resolve some turmoil with her parents. You’ll also uncover some twists along the way. The time period, art style and graphics are all very well done. It’s set in the 1920’s and it captures that vibe perfectly. Gameplay is unique, well implemented and fun. You’re able to transition from 3d space to 2d shadows. If you switch to shadows, then that becomes the ground or “physical” part of the world and allows you to traverse areas that wouldn’t be accessible otherwise. Shadows in general is a massive part of this game. The story is told via silhouettes and you even have to solve some puzzles while a silhouette scene is going on by using their moving shadows as a way to reach higher areas. It’s really cool. The puzzles serve up a small challenge. Nothing hard, though. With a little bit of thought, you’ll be able to solve them. Voice acting is terrific. Every character is unique and has their own personality.This game is very short. I logged about 4 hours to complete it will all achievements. The controls (I used a 360 controller) are decent. Character movement can be awkward at times and felt like they could use more polish. Pros+60fps+Great gameplay with shadows+Engaging & interesting story+Solid Music+Terrific voice actingCons+Short, about 4 hours+Character movement sometimes awkward8/10 Very good "

												Short Version:---------------------+ Nice visuals+ Nice music+ Unique game mechanics+ Interresting puzzles+ good story (not great, but ok)- Short playtime- Can get a bit frustrating if you have to try some things over and over again[ Hint for german people: ~ Voice acting is english, subs are german ] Recommended? Yes, but only if you can get it in a deal Long Version: ------------------- This games is something different... It's some kind of a puzzle game with a good story, nice visuals and great music. Didi wants to get her father back to her family and you have to help her. To do so, you have to fix some things and open the way where didi is not able to get through. The interresting thing here are the game mechanics. You have to move objects in front of lights sources to change the shadows on the walls. Then you can step into the walls so that you can move along these shadows. You have to take objects with you when you are a shadow on the wall, to bring them to the place where you need them. And so on. Thats quite unique and a pretty nice idea. It is really fun, to figure out which step you need to do next, to solve all these puzzles. BUT: I finished this game in about 3 hours with almost all the collectable items (I missed 2 Items somewhere) This is a bit short in my opinion and this is the reason why I would recommend, to buy this game if you can get it in a deal and not for the full price. So if you can get it for cheap and you wanna try something different and you like to solve puzzles then buy this game ;)			"

												Contrast is a 4 hours game (maybe 5 or more, if you like to wander around like me) and despite being too short for my like, it's very enjoyable. The story is simple and you won't spend more than 15 - 20 minutes in a puzzle, plus beautiful aesthetics that make up for the only negative aspect I found: sometimes you shift out of the shadows even if you didn't want to, so you will die a lot of times or just start again.

			Views: 133		

			Today we take a look at Contrast, a game focused on solving puzzles as you meld between the 2d and 3d worlds at the press of a button. How does it stand up? Stay tuned.		

""From the get-go, the life of young Didi will ensnare you, as her busy, workaholic mother and get rich quick scheme loving father will constantly be at ends.  In a seemingly never-ending struggle to bring her parents together again and keep them that way, Didi and Dawn will be placed in positions in which they can come to the rescue, fixing familial situations which would otherwise end their tumultuous little grouping in a heartbeat.  Contrast’s plotline can be both depressing and heartwarmingly joyful at the same time, and it WILL be the reason why you keep playing the game from start to finish.""""To tie it all together, Contrast comes equipped with some soothing, noir-themed visuals, and a beautiful setting that stands as an amalgamation of the shadow world, as well as the real world.  Over the course of the game you’ll venture through places such as cabaret theaters, seedy taverns, decrepit carnivals, observatories, and shadowy alleyways, all of which invoke a feeling of wonder.  By throwing in some really top notch musical talent, Contrast’s atmospheric merits are almost as good as it’s impeccable storyline.""			"

CAUTION - Biased Reviewtldr;If you appreciate detail and aren't in a hurry to find some kind of FPS game, slow down and give CONTRAST a try - it is art-music-fun all-in-one.10/10Why Biased? Because I didn't like it...I loved it! I go into a lot of games like a misanthropic, glass half-empty, cutscene skipping sort of Gamer xD. ""Let's hurry up and get this finished,"" y'know?!From the opening scenes in CONTRAST, I was mouth-agape WOWED by the unbelievably high quality artwork and smooth jazz music in this game.Pros:- artwork - blown away by the use of loud colors one moment and stark monotone the next, with incredible contrast and shading. This was too beautiful to be just a game. BTW IMO - captured the golden age of Art Deco perfectly.- music - set the mood throughout and was also impressive enough that I will be looking to pick up the OST at some point in the future. (And I Never do that <grin>)- gameplay - fairly challenging use of combos for me that usually required multiple attempts to 'get it right', like when using jump / dash / shift all together. Admittedly I'm a spaz with a controller, tho.- Flawless Controller Support I used Xbox360 PC controller- Stable Graphics- 100% Achievements nothing here to slow you down if you are Achievement Hunting. I got all but 2 on the 1st run-through, and they were easy to pickup using chapter select after I completed the game. FINCons:- Game Length it was probably about right length for this story, but I just hated to see it end & wanted more, moar, more xD.- Niche Game understandably, this game will not appeal to everyone, but it should LOLHope you found this helpful - Cheers			"

												Contrast is a good game. Nothing more, nothing less just good. It's a complete game, but it also feel like its EXACTLY wanted the devepoer wanted to accomplish. While platforming is the main gameplay component, and its ok, its the story that is the real focus and that focus is easily highlighted by the biggest suprise, game length. I would have easily guessed there would be 8-10 hours of gameplay as most platformers fall in that range, but searching every corner, taking my time, reading all the notes, etc my total time is right at 4 hours. Could it have easily been 10hrs, yes. Did i want to spendmore time in this world with these charcters, definantly. I have never measured a game by its length(wink!) and neither should anyone.

												First I want to comment on the main story being nothing more than a family struggling with love from time from time. I get that the game is supposed to be ""art-like"" with the dark noir atmosphere and lurking shadows but I really want to learn more about what's going on in those two worlds! I feel as a player I want to know a bit of backstory when going on the big quest but I guess I can't ask that when the game is supposed to be a big odd puzzle with shadows jumping around on buildings in love. Besides the story the gameplay is really original like no other game with the unique mechanic and odd puzzles that are very hard to solve from time to time, though I really wish the story would carry the game as much as the atmosphere does. With that said, if you want to have a hard time solving puzzles (atleast I think it's a challenge), and be in the spotlight from time to time as a lurking shadow in Paris among other awesome places jumping on everything you can jump on as well as shadows, then this game is for you! I would give it a 6/10 because of the game not being fitted for my need of a solid story, but if you don't care about the story balancing the gameplay that much then this game is a good choice! /Sow			"

It's stylized (in a very Parisian way), has some great voice work, and will leave you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled. The gameplay is experimental, yet simple. The use of light and shadow to shift from 3D to 2D and back works wonderfully, and forcing your brain to think in multiple dimensions leads to the best kinds of puzzles. There are just enough secrets and collectibles to keep things interesting and promote exploration without being annoying in this small but well-realized world. You'll notice jokes and easter eggs in the background while progressing, and it's rare that you'll ever feel lost.My biggest gripe is that the controls are just clunky enough that a few spots requiring precision movement can be very, very frustrating. I rage quit twice as a result.The short and sweet story is totally worth the time, invisible walls and all. All the collectibles and optional dialogue only serve to enrich the experience. You'll think you know where things are going and then a big reveal will twist everything around. Luckily, every new story point makes sense, and they don't come out of nowhere - it's simply the process of learning more about the characters. And the ending is just complex enough to be satisfying while opening your mind to multiple possibilities.Contrast takes high-concept ideas for both gameplay and story and manages to fit them all into a neat little package. It makes for a cohesive, fun, and memorable game.			"

												Great game, very artistic and fun to play. I really enjoyed the enviroment and the puzzles but I wish it was a longer game, because it felt very short. It remind me of Limbo but set on a noir-style with third person gameplay as well. I recommend it, despite the reviews from it weren't that great from gaming websites, I thought it was a wonderful game.			"

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: 3D Platformer/PuzzleThe Good+ Nice noir art style+ Realistic lighting effects+ The main gameplay mechanic allows you to transform into a shadow and platform on other shadows. By  manipulating real world objects you can create new shadows and reach new areas. + A good story that gets more detailed with each collectable you find+ Easy achievements + Soundtrack  The Average:The puzzles are a bit easy, I would have liked a bit more challenge given the cool gameplay  mechanic. The Bad:The game in incredibly short.

												Contrast is a strange beast. It's a platform-based puzzle game set in a surrealist, steampunk, early 20th century paris-like city. The player controls Dawn, the imaginary friend of the main character Didi, who has the titular power of being able to switch back and forth from the physical world to the shadow world. The player uses this ability to solve the many puzzles that are conviently wrapped around the story line. I don't want to delve too deep into the lore of this story, since most of its value comes from its twists (which is bad enough that I'm addressing), but it is something to witness. I wish that the game explored certain aspects that I felt needed developing, and the ending was a bit lackluster.I have two main quips about this game. The first is its glitches. Sometimes when doing certain puzzles in the shadow world, the game will inexplicably pop you back into the physical world. Puzzles like these just require trial and error, but in a game where the main goal is to challenge the player's smarts and not their patience, it has no place. The second quip I have is the length of the game. It only took me three and a half hours to finish this game, and I usually consider myself as someone who plays through games very slowly. Since I actually got this game as a gift from a very generous friend (thanks BOT Mathew :3), I'm not that mad about it. However, if you plan on buying this game, ONLY GET IT ON SALE. It is definetely not worth a full $15. Other than that, I love this game. The controls are great, the visuals are engaging, and the collectibles give an excuse to marvel at such a beautifull world. TL; DR: A very pretty game with an interesting story and even more interesting puzzles, yet can get a little buggy at times and is too much for its price considering its length. A must get game while its on sale. Can be considered one of those ""art"" games.Overall Score: 6.5-7			"

												Contrast is a game that seems like it should be amazing, based purely on the premise, mechanics, and art direction alone. And while I do still recommend it (to a point), the final package ended up being a tad underwhelming. But let's start at he beginning. There is a lot of good to the game, specifically the elements I just mentioned. The setting (early 20th century Paris) and art direction are very interesting, and there are lots of cool things to see throughout the journey. You play as Dawn, the acrobat ""imaginary friend"" of a young girl named Didi. The game revolves around Dawn's ability to transform from a 3D person into a 2D shadow. As a shadow, you can maneuver along any other shadow, as if it were a normal platform. Puzzles generally involve manipulating light sources to create navigable shadows, and then platforming your way through those shadows to reach new areas. The story, without revealing much, is just OK. It involves Didi's lounge-singer mother, her loser father, and a mysterious magician named Vincenzo. There's nothing wrong with the story, but it's also nothing mind-blowing, for the most part. And that sort of sums up the game as a whole - merely adequate. The main gameplay hook of transforming into a shadow, while cool, just isn't enough to sustain a whole game in its own. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of neat segments and cool applications of the idea. But after a while, you'll start to get the feeling of ""been there done that"", only in a new location. Not to mention, most of the puzzles (such as they are) are very simple anyways, there's not all that much meat on the bone in terms of challenge or completely fresh ideas. I am not sure they even could have added anything more to improve the game. As I said, it's perfectly adequate as-is, and definitely doesn't overstay its welcome. I just have this nagging feeling that there were missed opportunities for additional puzzles or ways the shadow mechanic could have been used. Maybe that's unfair, but so be it. Despite all this, I actually did enjoy and have fun with the game overall. I just feel that maybe with a bit more development time, it could have been better. But what's here is definitely an interesting experience, and worth checking out if the atmosphere or shadow mechanic intrigues you, as it did for me. The entire experience lasts around 5 hours or so, so also keep that in mind when considering your purchase. I would say hold off for a sale, unless you really feel the need to check it out right away.My only real complaints would be for technical issues. Specifically, the game lacks many of the customization settings one would expect in PC games, such as video options and the like. Personally, I had an issue with the lack of an option for x-axis inversion for the camera controls. And while there is still no solution patched directly in game (at least as of the time of this review), for the record, I wanted to note that the developers actually responded to my request within minutes and provided a configuration file fix that could be changed manually to implement that feature. While it wasn't the ideal solution, I really appreciated their responsiveness, as it allowed me to play the game the way I wanted. So kudos to the developers for that. Which reminds me - I definitely recommend a gamepad for this one.			"

												For the full price - forget about it. When there is a  big sale   on, something around 75% off - still think twice. The The whole game is a series of disappointinng shortfalls. Here's my story explaning why:I noticed Contrast over a year ago and the concept of the game, coupled with what I saw on the trailers and in the screenshots, had me really wanting this game. The price though was a bit steep, so I only got it on sale recently. And I'm mighty glad I waited. Without further ado, here's what's wrong with the game.First of all, the story feels like scribbled down on a knee five minutes before the writers had a deadline to submit it. Nothing to keep the player interested, just a generic tale of a child and her parents don't quite form a perfect family. The characters, save the protagonist, are shallow, one-dimensional and there's little reason for anyone to form any sort of emotional bond with them. The only chance of livening up the plot  when the player discovers collectibles pertaining to Dawn and Vincenzo in the last act  is merely reduced to finding some collectibles and one scene just before the credits.Secondly, the gameplay is, to put it bluntly, rubbish. Platformers in the 90's offered better game mechanics. The fantasticly promising concept of manipulating lights and shifting between shadows and the 'real' world is there just so you can jump on some platforms and move one or two boxes around. Nothing else. And one more thing here: the player character gains some skills for no apparent reason and then hardly ever uses them.The controls are simple but even there you can find an issue, as the shifting mechanism often has a mind of its own and Dawn gets thrown off the platforms without the fault on the side of the player.Graphics. To be fair, the game looks alright. Nothing remarkable though. The models are edgy, locations deserted for the most part (I'm talking here about items, not characters - the lack of the latter is just part of the game) but the overall feeling is positive. The atmosphere in the locations is nice, kind of gloomy and decadent at the same time. On the other hand, the animations is where the game should deliver and fails completely. The protagonist is said to be an acrobat. Therefore, her moves should be fluent, graceful and light, which they only are when the character is walking slowly or standing still and I'm not convinced that this should be the case in an action game. The animations of Dawn interacting with objects or moving stuff, as well as thhe animations of all other characters feel terribly outdated.Finally, the music, where the game promises much but delivers little. Despite what you might think having seen the trailers, there is in fact very litle music in the game. Soundtrack activates only when the player apporaches a certain location. Truth be told, the best piece of music was the one in the main menu. Character voicing is just wrong, its highlight being Dawn, who simply says nothing throughout the entire game.Fortunately, Contrast is a very short game, in jusr 4 hours I manged to obtain a 100% playthrough. I say fortunately because I could not bear any more of the feeling that there's a game that could have been brilliant and turned out mediocre. Pros: Great noir setting Fairly good graphics Some nice music Great protagonistCons: Light/shadow manipulation reduced to one power Uninteresting, unoriginal storyline All other characters except the protagonist Very short Animations from 15 years ago Gameplay from 20 years ago Imprecise controls Wasted potential everywhereA final note: the ending hints, rather obviously, at a sequel. Unless the developers do some serious work to deliver a more complete experience with a story and gameplay to match its lovely graphics style its going to be, at least for me, a flop. So a word to the producers: Please, please do it right, because I so want the concept to be given the game it deserves.			"

The graphics are amazingly beautiful, the colors work really well with the concept and I was, as a noir fan, intrigued from the start,2. The concept itself being the 4th dimension is mind-blowing to me. I really do think this game tried to reach a deeper level.3. There were some really good and unique puzzles that I really enjoyed.4. The very last minute of the game threw me for a loop.BUT4. The environment seems really odd at times. ""Lifeless"" as they say.5. The gameplay is unbearable 50% of the time. Glitchy and non-sense.6. THE STORYLINE. Ok now, my problem is here. The storyline is so weak it's almost ridiculous. There was so much potential in it that it makes me mad how the ending seemed rushed and overlooked. The storyline just didn't click for me at all. SO OVERALL:-If you are looking for a groundbreaking story, this is not the game for you. -f you want to enjoy a totally unique noir universe with really good puzzles (and you don't care much about the gameplay), try it out.

												Nicely styled art direction, a solid core mechanic, and a well paced and well told narrative are what make video games unique and interesting and Contrast has these in spades. Beautifully designed, this is an excellent showcase of developer talent and I hope to see more from Compulsion Games.Contrast follows Dawn, a mysterious woman with the ability to meld into shadows, as she accompanies Didi, a bright young girl who won't give up, on an adventure through the abstract and shadowy reflection of the 1920s. The game itself is short, I completed it in 5 hours but many of you might take less time. As with any game with a similar length, one can't talk about the plot without giving anything away and playing the game for any amount of time will plunge you straight in.The main mechanic of this puzzle platformer is the ability to shift into two dimensions and move along the shadows as though they are solid objects. Perspective puzzles are a favorite of this game, as are weighing down switches with boxes. Admittedly the controls, while mostly solid, are sometimes fickle. One puzzle towards the end took me much longer than the others; not because it was hard to figure out but because it was difficult to wrestle the object into place. one aspect of the game I felt could be done better is the collection of Iluminaries, objects used to power the machines in the game. while there are a surplus of them in each level, the game has a nasty habit of locking doors behind you. So in theory, if you failed to collect enough of these things when you had the chance then progression becomes impossible; though this was not the case for me, be sure to follow your instincts and deal with the main objective last.At the end of the day I think this game has a lot of ambition behind it and, despite a few hiccups here and there, was very tight and well designed. The game does feel a little bare bones but as with the hiccups I'm expecting that the next game by the Compulsion will solve these issues. I can definitely recommend this game and others from this up and coming developer.			"

												Pros:- Great art style and music- Good story- Very interesting concept of playing with light and shadow. Puzzles come in good variety and they're not too hard. - Short and sweet. The game doesn't overstay its welcome.- Runs without any problem (My PC: i7, GTX1060, 32GB RAM, Win 10 64 bit) Cons:- Bad collision detection on many platforms. It makes the game kick you out of shadow and fall to your death from time to time.- Sometimes it's unclear where you should go or what you're supposed to do.- No replay value (unless you want to get all the collectibles you missed on the first run)Conclusion:Recommend for puzzle-platformer fans.

												I can never tell when a game will click with me. Contrast is one of those that I didn't think I'd like, but I did.The setting of the game is well-realized: art nouveau/art deco with a jazzy early 20th century theme. It was a fantastic change of pace from the usual common game themes, and it was well done here.As well, the mechanic of shifting into and out of shadow to complete platforming tasks was a neat twist on the usual platforming mechanics. I'm not a big fan of platformers (and this game didn't change my mind) but the novelty of this at least made it feel unique and somewhat fresh.The story was a nice noir concept, and it doesn't get in its own way with crazy twists - it exists and is fairly comprehensible, while suiting the game and its mechanics.As for downsides, I found the gamepad controls to be a little ""loose"" and slippery - movement felt overly-sensistive to me, and I sometimes had trouble controlling my jumps. There were a few puzzles that are not intuitive, but that's OK I suppose - the game isn't meant to be a complete cakewalk.I'd definitely recommend this if you're in the mood for something unique and noir and platform-y: 4 out of 5.

												Pros:+ Cool concept+ Nice soundtrack and graphics for an indie title+ ~50% of the gameplay is pretty good+ Voiceovers+ Most puzzles are excellent and pretty straightforward+ Easy 100% achievementsCons:- The other ~50% of the gameplay feels a bit empty because of the lack of BGM/BGS (which kinda breaks immersion)- Confusing story- Why does the protagonist (Dawn) never talk? And furthermore she has the least character development, I still had 0 idea who she exactly was after finishing the game.- Glitchy gameplayOverall: Not bad for an indie game.			"

Puzzle-Platforming, Film Noir Style.Contrast is certainly not for action junkies, nor for gamers who aren't all that interested in storytelling, but for me this little gem from Compulsive Games makes for an excellent puzzle-platformer.The big mechanic here is the ability to shift into silhouette form and solve problems with shadows.  It's remarkably adept at holding player interest because Contrast gives us so much to do, from simple platforming to complex object manipulation.  The 3D platforming elements are minimal, though there is a fair bit of 2D-3D shifting in certain sections to keep players on their toes.Our intrepid developers have done very well with the Unreal Engine, bringing a dreamscape 1920s world to life with a unique art style that makes full use of a specially commissioned Jazz n' Blues soundtrack.  This game treats us the way a lot of independent titles should: like intelligent people who don't need a compass pointing towards every objective, or a full explanation for every plot point.It isn't Braid or Portal by any stretch of the imagination, but it is an indie game that has been built with careful attention to detail and a clear love for simple ideas that lead into complexity.  A potential downside is that it's too short.  That said, I paid full price for the Special Edition and I'm not regretting it.  So, action-seekers stay away.  Thoughtful types who enjoy their puzzles with a twist of atmosphere - welcome!Still not sure which way you're swinging?  Watch my full video review here: http://store.steampowered.com "

												I was intrigued by trailers and description of this game, but I'm pretty sure I fell in love with ""Contrast"" at the moment when I heard main menu music. Charming, velvet woman voice sounded like a promice of something sweet, precious and slightly dangerous... And all of those things create the world of contrasts, in which our heroine, Dawn, helps her friend Didi to find out her family's mysteries. I really love atmoshpere of ""Contrast"", dark streets with neon signs, unseen colors which blossoms in the streetlights (when graphics set on ""low"" worls appears much more colorful; I like darker city better, but I think it's interesting to play with both settings - just to see differences and to decide which world you find suitable for this story). Little things you will find - photos, newspapers, letters, etc. will make you better understand Didi's parents and the whole concept of traveling between 2D and 3D realms.Puzzles are not very hard, but quite nice and sometimes rather challenging.  I love almost all of them (except some parts of shadow theater).I like that the game has quite opened ending, and I like that there still are some questions left to be aswered by the player themself.Only one thing I didn't like in this game - I had leave game too soon to my taste. I'd love to spend a few more hours with Dawn and Didi. And I think so will you after playing this great game.			"

There's not a lot of new ground being trodden, and some technical limitations (no AA, no 3D support), but it was a really enjoyable 3-4 hours.			"

Posted: January 12, 2014
												Intro:Well I first noticed this game shortly after I started playing Bioshock Infinite. It cought my eye because of it's art style. After watching the trailers, I added this to my wishlist and purchased it during Winter Sale.Well I'm not sure how to rate this game. It's really well done in the visual and aural departments. The atmosphere really transports that 20s France feeling. But there are some things to be improved.Graphics:Not much to rant about. Maybe that's because im easy to plese with graphics, as long as they just fit together. But there are some glitches, especially on movable objects (crates and balls). The puddles on the streets look more like ice than water. That's because there is no added effect if you walk through them.Audio:Also nothing to really complain. The music is well done and fits the scenery. I really like the track that runs during the menu screen. The voice acting is okay except for Didi. Her lines just sound ""strange"" every now and then.Controls:My main complaint. It just feels like one of those early cheap 3D games. I often had problems judging how far I could jump. It just doesn't feel right. But I got used to it after a while.Gameplay:You spend a lot of time shifting into the shadows to acomplish your tasks. Sometimes the engine seems to have problems if the surface you are moving on is not even. If there is a corner, that's also a problem sometimes. But at least once the game forces you to go around a corner (which is evenly lit), so it cannot be intentional that the game throws you out of the shadow realm. Sometimes there are new things to consider when solving puzzles. Unlike in many other games you are not shown that those concepts are there. Like shifting certain objects with you or moving objects using spotlights. I'm not really sure if this is a good thing or not. But I really liked finding those things out by myself. Maybe some optional hints would solve this ""problem"" for both sides.Story:To make it short: No epicness, no world rescue, no over the top characters, no ""only he/she can do it"". But nothing that special either... but as there hasn't been a story one could call ""groundbreaking"" or ""has never been done before"" in the recent past, I really like that simplicity.Conclusion:An artistically nice game with a few control hiccups that doesn't do handholding and is solvable without the use of walkthroughs or FAQs. Tells a down to earth fantasy story without uneccesary epicness. Buy it if you like artistically interesting games that don't neccessarily appeal to the masses.EDIT:What I really forgot:It would've been nice if there was some more interaction with Didi. She often just stands there and does nothing. It only was about two times that she assisted you in one way or the other. For example: the screenshot where she lights the way with a lamp? Never happened.			"

 Great concept with beautiful graphics  The game is a work of art. The noir theme set in France with soothing jazz sets a great stage.  I found some puzzles very difficult with the glitchy controls.

												A fantastic little platformer I strongly recommend to anyone who likes Jumping Puzzles, the 20s, unique art direction and a story that is not about shooting people. Didi is adorable. The voice acting is great. The ""gimmick"" of shifting into shadows has been done very well and the game lets you enjoy the ride, without killing immersion even when it takes a moment to say ""Hey you can use the right mouse button to do this"". Yes, it plays well with keyboard and mouse.Apparently it can be a bit short, with people having finished it in 3 hours. When not playing it in one sitting and collecting all collectables, it can and will take longer. Sadly that is also because of a clumsy autosave feature that will have you replaying some things.All in all though a great project I am happy to have bought.			"

The setting, the character design, the music, the atmosphere - all are spot-on.It's more puzzles than platformers, and the puzzles have a habit of looking terribly difficult at first, but aren't too hard to figure out, and solving them made me feel all smart and smarmy :)Platforming gameplay is easy to pick up on, controls are fine, it's good fun. Only negative points are it's length (3.5 hours left me craving for more !) and (and this is a minor nitpick really) the fact that the black screen before cutscenes last just a little bit too long.All in all, great experience, well worth the money, would absolutely buy again.

												As someone who mainly plays games such as League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch or Terraria - all in all Multiplayer oriented games - it is rather rare for em to0 just be amazed by a game solely for soloplayer experience. Contrast was one of these games.The game is mostly focussing on the narrative, making you uncertain of how the story falls in place and even questioning your own existence as a whole until slowly it starts to fall in place like pieces of a puzzle. The atmosphere of the scenery surrounding you while playing gives you the feeling to run around in france during the 20th century mixed with Steampunky assets and apperatures.The gameplay itself is pretty self explainatory and straight forward. Blend into a wall as shadow. Move around. parkour. Solve riddles due to that. Sadly, the shadow mechanic is not that consistent throughout the game, screwing you over from time to time, pushing you out of walls for basically no reason before the next time you try letting you through instantly.If you like lighthearted riddles and parkouring as well as a nice narrative and aesteticly pleasing Steampunky landscape, I can only recommend trying this game out as quick as you can.10 outta 10. Will play again. (Sorry, I had to)			"

												Although short, Contrast had a strong grip on my attention right from the ""Start Game"" screen; the amazing background music sets the mood of a 1920's noir ambience and the game's aesthetics were really beautiful (especially the lightings and the sky!). The game's unique art and playstyle of shifting in and out of 2D and 3D was what really caught my interest, and so I got the Collector's Edition of the game (worth every penny!). Tricky to maneuver jumping and shifting at some parts, but once you get the hang of it, Contrast is really cool! To sum up, Contrast is a short but really beautiful and unique game with a decent story line (if only it was a little longer). Contrast 2, maybe? *hoping* :)			"

												Honestly this game had so much more potential than it lived up to. I was really intrigued by the shift between the 2D/3D world, and the surrealist/psychological undertones, but those ended up being all for show. The game felt like a tease to a really engaging story and felt so underdeveloped and rushed. It was hard to really like it because the plot felt rushed in the beginning with hardly any build up and ended really abruptly. It was really a let down and I wouldn't play it at all.			"

Also the amazing dubs professional as films. Switching between shadows and reality is a quite new idea of game. It runs well even with fascinating lighting effects and scenes. The puzzles need to be considered for a while but won't take you too long. And it's not hard to get all the achievements.Highly recommended the game since it's still on a discount now. If you want to order it, don't forget the soundtracks, you maybe regret of without it.			"

'Contrast' is a fantastic 'adventure'/'puzzle'/'platformer' which tells an interesting story and has great potential to a sequel.Desc:You are the 'imaginary' friend of Didi named Dawn. As Dawn you will help Didi by solving her family problems. Her mother Kat is a hard working singer who tries to help their families survive. Didis father Johnny Fenris gets himself always into trouble and left therefore his family, but he want his family  back. At the end you will help Johnny to get his lovely family back.Pros:+ very nice concept+ great story telling+ awesome scoring+ unique and vivid characters (especially Didi, where you get the feeling she is real)+ good soundtrack+ amazing realization of the concept (smooth switches between 2D and 3D)+ interesting feeling during gameplayexample: you are asking often yourself who is really in the shadows you or them and are the shadow the death or the life?(+ steam achievements)Cons:- controls (at default) are too sensitive (acting like a bunny on the run)- collision detection is sometimes annoying (2d)example: you are in the shadows, but you will be blocked by 3d objects (out of the shadow) that are above you, whereat you should only get blocked by shadow objects- collision detection is sometimes annoying (3d)example: you are standing in front of a chest and you can't jump on it, but you are able if you run towards it -.-(- with 5h a short play time)(- no demo )Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because this game will present you a great story embedded in a very cool concept, which works very well.9/10 "

The game's unique art and playstyle of shifting in and out of 2D and 3D was what really caught my interest, and so I got the Collector's Edition of the game (worth every penny!). Tricky to maneuver jumping and shifting at some parts, but once you get the hang of it, Contrast is really cool! To sum up, Contrast is a short but really beautiful and unique game with a decent story line (if only it was a little longer). Contrast 2, maybe? *hoping* :)			"

												Bravo!  Encore Encore!Spectacular in every way.  Great story, terrific platforming and puzzle solving elements.  No penalty for death.  Wonderful characters.  Great art.  I generally don't like puzzle platforming due my short frustration fuse.  But Contrast was just perfect.It only took four hours to complete, so my only complain is that it is too short.  Probably not worth it at the list price of $15, but on sale, it was worth every penny.I LOVED this game! "

Shadow mechanism can be clunky but I found it enjoyable and nice. Story as well as the ending are just great. I feel like there's so much that can be told about the universe. Hope there will be a DLC or sequel. It can be short for some people but I feel wanting more and on the other hand - satisfied.			"

												Fun, intriguing and esthetic pleasing platformer!Contrast is a game that focuses on a handful of characters, their trouble and individual wishes and does a great job at it, it takes place in a weird world where only your character and a young girl is represented as you would expect, everyone else appears as shadows and speaking of shadows - You have the ability to enter shadows and must do so in order to solve various puzzles and progress to new areas.Pros+ Beautiful and intriguing esthetics+ Well told and well paced story+ Characters you bloody care for!     Some characters represented as shadows have more    personality than fully represented characters in other games    No seriously!Cons- Minor issues on launch- Quite short... 3-6 hrs I hear most complete it on, personally did 4hrs first runBottom lineIf you like slow paced puzzles, well told story, interesting characters and beautiful esthetics - BUY this game!Hell, get the Collecters Edition the devs deserve it!On a bottom note it seems the Devs actually takes the time to read, reply and actually listen to its community - holy hell Batman how often does that happen!?Also don't get fooled by the launch trailer this is NOT an action game, its a slow paced platformer and its better for it!(oh and in case you think I can't spell properly : Esthetics and Aesthetics is the same thing, one is English the other American (as far as I know)! just FYI :)BUY THIS GAME!

												Fantastic asthetic & Great concept let down ever so slightly by lack of difficulty, minor bugs and some flawed controls. Contrast is a charming game but it's strengths lie in it's ideas and environments and not so much in the characters or gameplay, it's also fairly short with me finsihing the game (without 100% collectables) in just over 3 hours. It's far from perfect but if you look at the screenshots and think you'll enjoy it and don't mind a game the priorotises the in game world and visuals over actual gameplay you'll enjoy yourselves but as a game it's kind of average.

												What a strange game this is. Is a bad game? No.  If you like light (no pun intended) puzzle games with an Ok narrative an good music and art direction you are going to enjoy this. Is short, the mechanics are pretty clear aside of one puzzle, with an easy solution if you just ignore what the game is teaching you up to that moment  (what is doing is introducing a new mechanic), but is nothing really horrible in the grand scheme of things, the collectibles are pretty easy to spot (some are tied to the story of the game wich is something that i really don´t like in games but in this case it kind of didn´t matter really much) and you are not gonna be heavily challenged by it.  If you are not in that side of the playing field,  this game is not for you        On the other hand, when i finished i couldn´t shake the feeling that this game somehow loses the opportunitty of being something really special, because it has a lot of potential, puzzles could be more interesting and the story coud have  packed a lot more punch in the emotional side.  I know that is a little unfair to punish a game for what it could have been an it isn´t, but some games show hints of what could have been an amazing experience and you can avoid that kind of sourness in your mouth,  but, like i said, if you like this kind of games and have little time in your hands to play or you want some palate cleanser between more intense experiences this is a game you should enjoy, i certainly did it, but damn, it could have been really good			"

My Impression:I heard about this game from watching the trailer of another game from the creators of this (We Happy Few). The artwork of Contrast depicts a Tim Burton movie with sex appeal; a seductive world of light and darkness. Contrast adds a unique feature that allows one to shift between the striking 3D fantasy world and the mysterious 2D shadowscape. I was intrigued...Positive:+ Amazing artwork accompanied with amazing voice acting+ The story compliments the artwork with a jazzy soundtrack that is a pleasure to experience+ Fun puzzles that are challenging but not impossible, fun for everyone+ Shifting between 2D and 3D is a fun new feature introduced to platformersCons:- Too Short- Story seems rushed- Awkward save features- A little too linear(a lot of the negative reviews are from 2013-2014 and complain about bugs, most if not all seem to be fixed)I purchased this game in a bundle and really enjoy it. I don't think I would pay $14.99 for it because of the length of the game, but if you can get it in a sale or bundle, it's a must try. Simply put, Contrast is a simple, yet poetic game of shadows and light.8/10			"

												Just finished it and I loved it. I was looking for something different and this filled the spot. I love the jazz and laid back feel of the game. The artwork is very nice too, all the posters and what not. Some people claim the storyline is 'too bland"" but I found it very intersting, more so the whole setting of the game than the dialog. I don't want to ruin it but even watching the trailer you will wanting to know what this ""shadow world"" and how this little girl is coexsisting in each world. The puzzles were good, not too hard, not too easy. I'm not an ""artsy"" person but I loved the artistic feel of this game. My only complaints are 1. I wish there were more graphics settings like MSAA, not a must though. 2. The little girl's dialog sometimes was sporadic and didn't flow. 3. Controls aren't perfect, a little stiff. Some people are complaining it's a short story but I spent 5 hours collecting luminaries and collectables. For $15 it lines up fine with $60 games that have 12-15 hour campaigns (or generally less it seems now days). Bottomine: Buy it.			"

												Ein wirklich sehr schönes innovatives game. Man steuert den Charakter in der 3D-Welt und kann in die 2D-Welt (Schatten) wechseln.  Die Rätsel sind nicht übermässig schwer, vielleicht auch etwas zu leicht.... Das ganze ist sehr atmosphärisch, schön inszeniert und mit gelungenem Sound. Leider weist das Spiel noch einige Fehler beim Wechseln zwischen den beiden Welten auf. Gebe aber trotzdem Kaufempfehlung!A really nice innovative game. You control the character in the 3D world and can switch to the 2D world (shadow). The puzzles are not overly difficult, perhaps a little too easy ....

												Contrast is one of those games you really want to be good, but then just isn't quite.  The Tim Burton-esque setting and neat shadow puzzle platforming you get to do is interesting for a while, and then the game ends.  In retrospect you then realize you listened to shadows talk to each other more than you jumped from one place to another and wish you had done something else.  Not worth it.			"

												The idea of using shadows as platforms is an interesting one; shifting your character back and forth between shadow and light adds new variety. The 3 hours of gameplay doesn't allow enough time for this idea to evolve. Most ""puzzles"" end up being nothing more than jump - shift - jump - shift. To make matters worse, platforming is a bit clunky. I felt like my character was alittle too big for the world. Missing an easy jump and falling to your death is infuriating, but the game is really forgiving, almost always reloading near the last jump. The main plot, although nothing more than a mellowdrama, hid behind it the more interesting subplot of the player's identity. This, sadly, is only hinted at in clues in the environment and pointless 'collectables'. Then the game ends, not really concluding anything, even the main plot.  I really wanted to like Contrast, but there isn't enough of a game here to recommend to anyone.			"

												Contrast is a 3D puzzle\platformer that takes place in a world full of magic, cabaret singers, and burlesque shows. It utilizes a 1920's 'French Noir Film' art style that is unlike any other game I've played. The character design is beautiful, the voice acting is amazing, and the jazzy soundtrack fits the world perfectly. I can't stress enough how much I love the look and feel of this game. Yet, I can't recommend it, which is particularly disappointing considering how much there is to like here.You play as Dawn, a woman trapped between the worlds of light and darkness, and who cannot be seen by anyone except for a little girl named Didi. Didi's parents have broken up, and with the father out of the picture, her mother works at a nightclub to pay the bills. This, of course, means nobody is watching the little demon-spawn and it's up to Dawn to keep her out of trouble. Easier said than done, since she insists on roaming around the city at all hours of the night, refusing to listen to reason, and all you can do is enable her.The entire game revolves around a shift mechanic that allows you to become a shadow, an ability you will need to solve puzzles and progress through the game. Adjusting light sources to cast shadows to interact with is this game's bread and butter, and you'll be doing a lot of it.The problems with Contrast start almost immediately. While the puzzle mechanics are unique and interesting, they are a bit buggy, and simple platforming can be difficult with controls that don't feel tight or responsive. Dawn has a tendency to get stuck in the environment and other shadows as well. There are even a couple of places where dropping an object in the wrong spot could result in the player not being able to progress further, forcing them to load the last checkpoint. Once the game defines the parameters on the first couple of puzzles, it doesn't change them up much and they can become repetitive fast, which really shouldn't happen in a game this short. Which brings me to the biggest issue Contrast faces. The entire game can be completed in under 3 hours, and the ending is exceedingly abrupt. All of these issues combined leaves me with a feeling that the game is unfinished. Almost as if Compulsion Games ran out of money for the title half-way through development. Obviously, I do not have firsthand knowledge that this is the case, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm playing an Early Access game, and not a full release.Altogether, Contrast is a game that should have been a one-of-a-kind, beautiful experience. When a bad idea becomes a bad game, it's expected, but when something that starts off this amazing falls flat, it's all the more frustrating. I expected better, as did most gamers, and in the future I hope Compulsion learns from their mistakes, and releases games that shows us all what they're really capable of.			"

												My suggestion: wait for a sale.I feel so saddened that a game I have been tracking since initial release wasn't what I expected, at all. The concept of the overall storyline is interesting with the main character, Dawn, jumping between a shadow world and a 3D world. However, the game mechanics are sloppy and sometimes so bugged that it can ruin the game. At one point, the little girl, was a static figure and simply slid across the screen for an entire Chapter. Other times, Dawn seemed to hit this invisible wall when doing different jumping puzzles, making some jumps almost impossible to do smoothly on a first run.The puzzles themselves were interesting and sometimes frustrating - which is always good. However, they sometimes would get so buggy...My other main issue with the game was the general graphics of the shadow people. They were exceptionally blocky and I felt that the developers had gotten really lazy. I could see seams on forearms and their mouths never moved even if they were deep in conversation. I felt like they were more like puppets than people.I also realized, after game completion, that there were significant plot holes surrounding some characters. I have no intention of spoilers, but it is really frustrating when a game feels incomplete in their storyline. For the full price, it is not worth the four hours of gameplay. I highly recommend that you wait for a sale and buy it on a whim. I loved the concept, the voice acting (Jensen from Deus Ex anyone?), and the film noir style of both music and setting. However, between the bugs, the blocky animation, and the weak ending, I really felt cheated.			"

												We should adress the good first, because what's good about this game is really good. The setting and tone of 1920's noir is brilliant and it shines through in every area; it feels like a mixture between the Sierra Madre and Bioshock's Rapture with the unique lighting, it is one of the best looking worlds ever seen in a game. Additionally, the voice acting is pretty solid and its interesting how you never see the side character, but you see their over the top body language in their shadows, which is quite entertaining in a Vaudville/Groucho Marx way. On top of all of this, the story is pretty good and surprisingly charming. However, that's really the end of the good stuff. Like Limbo, contrast has a really good idea, but fails to do anything interesting with it past the very first puzzle. Almost every puzzle is a varitaion of pressing a button to make something in the room move, which creates a shadow ramp. Unfortunatley, there are two big problems with the shadow platforming, which is supposed to be the star of the show. The first problem is that you will periodically stop being a shadow. You'll be standing somewhere and if you hit something (because shadows act like solid objects) you might instantly get out of shadow mode. The second problem is that the platforming is pretty shotty with landing detection and there are times where it looks like you should be able to make it, only to clip through the shadow, meaning you have to start all over. This is especially problematic during the second act, where you have to climb a massive building using the shadows of a carrosel to climb a large rotunda. If the platform detection messes up at all, you have to start all over. Additionally, there's an entire section of this game that is a direct ""homage"" to Limbo. A section in which you run away in a dark shadowy world from a giant spider. This amounts to about 1/10 of the whole experience, which really shows that the developers were running out of ideas at this time.Because of its incredible short length of about 3-4 hours, its boring and repetative puzzles, and its buggy gameplay I can't reccomend this as a game, but I can recommend it for its story and style			"

												Disappointing for such a game that really could have been amazing. The general premise of the game, both story-wise (Didi and parents) and gimmick/mechanics-wise (using shadows to navigate and solve puzzles), was interesting enough for me to give the game a shot in the first place. I also enjoy the noir style and going back almost a century ago to a different type of world.However, the game really let me down. There's just too many issues that all stack up against it, and the quality of the game seems to bounce back and forth as you play. The story starts off without much information, though I did get into it once I started picking up what was happening. But there are a lot of weird background details that are never explained at all, and nothing much seems to fit together. I also did not think there was much of a climax, and the ending of the game felt very cheap.There is no real environment to the game, as the world is weirdly disconnected and with missing areas and emptiness. Basically, there is no ""life"" to it, is a better phrasing. You just go through hollow areas to get to the next mini-cutscene, and then solve a puzzle. While the visual art style of the game great, and some places look very beautiful, the lack of anything actually inhabiting the areas ruins it. And though the game's gimmick, as I mentioned before, is dealing with shadows, I didn't enjoy every character except you and Didi being shown as shadows. It just felt cheap and as if the developers didn't want to do that design. It only furthers the lack of ""life"" in the game. And the dialog and sound of the game also was nothing special. Nobody gave any performance that was great, and I think a good few scenes actually lacked any good emotion.Then you have the mechanical problems, showing that the game wasn't fine-tuned or even tested that well. Your character's movement is pretty far from good, and I often found myself glitching around, especially when you are in the shadows. One of the things about the shadows is that if certain moving shadows are about to crush you, then the game pops you out of the shadows, which is understandable; however, I found myself popping out of the shadows at random points without anything touching me, causing me to fall down and making me start parts of puzzles over and over again.When it comes to Didi, who you are following around, they were very lazy in her movement as well. I would often see her animations entirely stop, so she would ""walk"" without any motion. She doesn't move her mouth when talking, at least as far as I saw. And half the time you were supposed to find her somewhere, I would walk into the room or area and see her in ""generic 3D model"" form, standing in place with arms and legs rigidly stretched out as if someone is in the middle of editing her design.And in terms of actually playing, it seemed like ""Saving"" didn't actually mean the game was saving, whenever it popped up. At least twice, I exited the game to stop playing after it had finished saving, and I came back each time to find that the game jumped back at least 10-15 minutes, so I would have to redo some section. For instance, it did this in one of the carnival areas after I completed it and then quit the game.Finally, the length of the game - it is way too short, and with all of the issues, it all made it even worse. I don't know if the developer just didn't have enough money at the time, or they just chose not to clean things up or test enough, but the game is very lacking in pretty much every area. It could have been a really great game if they had put in more work.			"

												Contrast is a sometimes...frustrating game.  But ultimately rewarding.   The pros?  Where to begin!  Absolutely top-rate storytelling (this could almost be a film), sometimes ingeniously clever puzzles (though none so hard that one just throws in the towel), gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound, and a genuine sense of child-like wonder which seamlessly blends with the harsher realities of the adult world.  Think Tomb Raider meets Limbo (that is to say, both 3D and 2D platforming elements, effortlessly combined), with a story and direction worthy of Tim Burton (the earlier one, that one that made the good films before he became such a predictable hack).  Oh, and it's nowhere near as painfully LLLOOOOONNNGG as all games seem to feel the obligation to be these days (or in other words, it doesn't ""overstay its welcome"").   Now the cons.  Some of the platforming elements are PAINFULLY pedantic...one teeny, tiny miscalculation in where you place a lighting rig (this game is all about shadows), and you could very well waste the next forty seconds running and jumping to a point just to realise you ain't gonna make that final jump.  And then it's ALL the way back to the start of the puzzle again.  And there's some reflex-based moments of timing which become frustrating thanks to the sometimes ill-responsive controls, though fortunately, these bits of the game are at least few and far between.    Honestly, though, none of what I've just said would be all THAT much to grumble about, if it weren't for the POSITIVELY DIABOLICAL SAVE SYSTEM.  Why does nearly every modern game have to insist that if someone switches it on, they'd better be ready to sit there non-stop for HOURS?  Do they not know that some of us have JOBS?  LIVES?!  That we CAN'T necessarily invest two hours at a time into conquering A WHOLE FREAKING CHAPTER before switching off and going to bloody BED???     But as I said earlier...sigh...at least this is one recent game which doesn't feel the need to give us a non-linear plot full of extreme repetition, constant backtracking, and an ""open world"" which takes 180+ hours to explore.  Short, and on the whole, very sweet.  But man oh man, do these game designers EVER test their own games, or better yet...give them to NORMAL people to try out before commercial release?  It's a good thing I don't have a ""life"" to spend precious time on, or I'd just about give away this whole ""gaming"" lark altogether!Verdict: 9/10.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago, but I haven't played it then. Few days ago I finally decided to check it out and the game charmed me. It has really amazing cabaret/noir style atmoshpere and awesome matching music. Gameplay itself is pretty innovative too. You need to switch between 3D and 2D mode platformer. It is very interesting that in the 2D mode, you can move only on the ""shadows"" on the walls and flat objects. Shadows can be created by yourself through interaction with various objects in 3D mode. You need to use appropriate arrangement of their relation to one another and to light sources, so in the result you can move on them in the 2D mode. The biggest downside is the length of the game - finishing it in almost 100% takes only 3-4h. Also, the ""puzzles"" are fairly simple. It's a pity that the authors failed to further develop the aforementioned theme, because the game had great potential. Nevertheless, I sincerely recommend Contrast, especially in some more accessible price.8+/10			"

												Very good but also very short, the storyline isnt anything special but the idea of the game is great, as you follow the story you come across situations which require you to switch to a shadow and figure out how to progress further by using the shadows on the walls, its not very complicated and does seem to be more of the same as you go through the game, but it is different and enjoyable, just needs to be alot longer and with a better variety of challenges etc.Overall a good game worth trying out, and with easy achievements too.

												On paper Contrast seems like a really cool game: a puzzle platformer where you can switch between being a physical person and being a shadow on the wall, using the shadows of other objects to get where you need to go. Couple that with a jazzy nightlife setting, and you can't go wrong, right?Unfortunately that is not the case. The platforming was often really frustrating and the game was fairly buggy. I found a few places where I could melt with a wall or I would have to jump three or four times to make it onto a ledge that was well within reach.The story was alright. You play as Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl named Didi. Didi's parents are separated and she sneaks out in the night on a regular basis to watch her mother sing at a club. Dawn helps Didi to progress past obstacles and fix things, and hopefully eventually to reunite her family. Dawn and Didi are the only ones who appear as three dimensional people in the world; everyone else appear as shadows on the walls, and are often parts of the platforming that the player has to perform.In a lot of ways I am glad that the game only took three hours. I wish I could recommend Contrast because it has the makings of a cool, unique indie game. But it just wasn't made well at all. Don't buy it.			"

												I can recommend this game - with reservations. It's way more of an audio/visual experience than a ""good game"". The puzzles are fairly basic and the jumping feels floaty and imprecise at times. Having said that - it's something of a masterclass in world building. It's a game world I wanted to explore and know more about. The voice acting is all terrific (though having the voice of Adam Jensen as the doting father unnerved me - I was waiting for him to start snapping necks any second), and the game looks sharp despite a complete and noticeable lack of anti-aliasing. Worth it for a sale price. You can power through it in about three hours and I think it's worth it to see the intoxicating world this small 7-person team has built.			"

												This game will be exceptionally fun for fans of casual platformers and story driven games. Fans of the Portal series and Bioshock Infinite will enjoy the puzzle/story combination.The visual style is gorgeous, a 1920s world that feels both occupied and isolated provides a haunting yet compelling atmosphere.The gameplay dynamics are unique and enjoyable. Solving puzzles by entering, manipulating, and interacting with shadows (moving from a 3D to a 2D plane) provides a sometimes challenging, but always entertaining gameplay element.The only minor complaint is that it feels a little short with a completion time of 4 to 5 hours (even after finding all the collectables).

												I really wanted to like this game, had it on my Wishlist for several weeks before release, was so happy when I finally installed it, and have attempted two separate playthroughs of it.  But it just fell flat. After several game breaking glitches that required a complete restart and struggling with glitchy game mechanics, I gave up.  I was engaged by the story and MAYBE finding out what happens is worth it to some, but not me.			"

												Contrast's charm is evident from the moment you start the game. As soon as the first title screen comes up and you hear the stylings of 1920's blues, you know you're in for something different. Contrast takes place in an atmospheric France, 1923. You're a mute acrobat that can merge with shadows and you're followed by a little girl named Didi. Didi is the star of the game, her perfectly casted voice actor and her adorable lines will have you thinking ""Who the hell is Ellie?"". The noir aesthetic is reminiscent of Dishonored meets Bioshock meets Boardwalk Empire. The acting, story and scenery feel authentic to the era. The gameplay is perfectly simple, though the puzzle aren't much of a challenge. The past three years have been landmark years for the downloadble/indie game scene. The quality of absolutely great and relatively cheap titles rivals that of their AAA counterparts. Contrast is, without a doubt, a legend among it's peers; Bastion, Braid, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Castle Crashers, Guacamelee, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Journey, Magicka, Mega Man 9, rain, Shadow Complex, Skullgirls, Stacking, Super Meat Boy, Terraria, Torchlight II, Trine and more. In my opinion, the game tops most of those. There isn't much to say about the game's flaws. It's unfairly short; I collected every collectible, completed all of the achievements and still clocked in at 4 hours. A gem like this deserves to be a lengthened experience. Aside from the game's length, there is a clear lack of polish. Had Compulsion Games taking more time to test the game, we wouldn't have to be putting up with invisible walls or floors. While they weren't too frequent, they were uncomfortably noticable. At one point I left a building, turned around to go back into the open door and couldn't because of an invisible wall. I walked forward a bit and came back and was able to go back into the building. Though I am convinced these blemishes are related to an overbearing publisher wanting to rush their investment out,  small details like these and the game's length are the only thing that keep it from being a perfect game in my book. Anyone looking for a unique experience, pick Contrast up. It will definitely continue to go on sale, so do yourself a favor when you see it marked below it's normal price of $15.99. Games like this, from independent developers are on the rise, and as gamers it's up to us to support their new ideas in an effort to show the multi-million dollar publishers/developers that bigger isn't always better.

												A short game with an interesting concept, contrast is a puzzle platform game based around lighting effects.The story revolves around a child Didi and her silent shadow jumping imaginary friend Dawn, to whom you control. This game is rather mature and deals with many adult situations from day to day life. Set in a noir mid 1900's city, the ambient is that of night clubs, bars and cabarets. Most of the story events are told through the silhouettes of the secondary characters sometimes having the player be prompted to intervene.All gameplay revolves around Dawns abilities. In shadow form she moves on a 2D plane where she can reach difficult locations and resolve puzzles, like taking a heavy object from the ground to a higher location made possible via the 2D shadows. Very rarely is the objective or next point of interest not made clear, but deviating from the path has it's own reward on finding more story elements, like memories of past events and collectables.Sound is a positive, each location has its own themes and sound effects that plays really well with the way the narrative unfolds, considering that most the story is told via silhouettes the sound becomes rather important. Voice acting is pretty solid and old timey that fits the time period.The game does end with a sort sequel bating, and unanswered questions, one of which is made right at the end of the game, which for me is a negative but not so much that I couldn't recommend this game.If you like perspective puzzle platformers, early 20th century noir visuals and a bit of drama, I can recommend this game. It's not the most original game out there, but what it does it does well and certainly has its more charming moments that stick with you.			"

The game isn't long, a few hours will see you through the whole thing, but it's a rich and amazingly visual trip, with some clever platforming and puzzles that make great use of light and shadows.If you want to see something innovative and an experience that doesn't come along too often, grab this game and give it a play.

												TLDR: Interesting game with interesting ideas, smooth gameplay and a lovely story-presentation. Unfortunately too short and expensive (when not on sale) considering the amount of content it offers, but still worth a try.Full review:A short (REALLY short, finished it with 100% of the achievements in under 3 hours) platforming game which in a way reminds me of the Portal games since, as one of the game's achievements references to by name, rather than thinking with portals here you are ""Thinking with Shadows"". Can't reach your objective in the 3d perspective environment? time to start looking for a way to make the shadow of objects, buildings or ""people"" (even tho they are invisible to your eyes) help you, so that you can then shift into the walls and do 2d perspective platforming with the shadows. The fluidity in which you do this change between the 3d world and the 2d shadows is very smooth. Yes you will run into a few ""buggy"" spots but they are few and don't really break the gameplay.Story-wise, it is a charm. You could consider it 2 stories, one of the young girl Didi's desire to be with her parents and to make them be happy, which is the focus point for most of the game's lenght, and a more subtle one which springs up near the end related to Dawn, the character you control, about who exactly is she and why she has the powers she has. Mind you, its not the best story ever but it works well for the game and the way it is presented is pretty good.Again, short game and expensive considering the amount of playtime it can offer (I'd recommend buying it when it is on sale with a 60-ish or more % discount) but what little you get is in my opinion quality content worth checking out. Hopefully we see a similar premise, or maybe even a proper game sequel, in the future from this developer.			"

PROS:+ cool concept of switching between real & shadow world+ beautiful visuals+ great soundtrack+ nice atmosphere of parallel worldsCONS:- quite a lot of glitches- unpolished level design- somewhat mediocre storyComment:Picked this game up a while ago and finally got to give it a try. The beginning felt really nice, with beautiful visual art and design. As you get introduced to the concept of a shadow world and switching between realms the game seems even more great and interesting. This is only emphasized by a cool soundtrack that fits the visuals. However, then comes the mediocre story that gets you running from place to place behind a little girl, making the game very linear. But later I realised this is not that bad. Because the design of the short levels is, while pretty, very unpolished. Glitches and weird camera placement is what took a lot from the experience and made the game frustrating sometimes. You see, the game is easy, casual even. It is just the design problems that make it hard. Otherwise it is a cute experience if you look over the flaws and I can recommend it.			"

												This game is fun, unique, and a refreshing new addition to puzzle platforming. From start to finish, I absolutely adored this game. The controls are solid, the gameplay is challenging and interesting, and the cartoony film noir art style is a nice accompaniment to the overall atmosphere of the game. To me, this is one game that stands out for really taking a different direction: the way the story is delivered and the emphasis on lights and shadows really made for an unforgettable experience.My only complaint about this game is that it is short. It doesn't take very long to finish this game. I did it in one sitting. It's a game that cries out for a sequel because it has so much potential that, unfortunately, didn't make the first cut.Overall, this game is worth buying. I wholeheartedly recommend it.			"

												Contrast is a game with a great core mechanic that makes for interesting gameplay and storytelling and works pretty well with the film noir atmosphere.  The story is mostly a generic film noir story that only gets interesting when it touches on the core mechanic, but the level design and puzzles keep the game interesting.  My only major criticism is the game feels like it was rushed—as though it could have and was meant to have had more content than ultimately ended up in it.  That said, what you do get is still a good experience, and definitely worth the price if you get it during one of Steam's numerous sales.			"

												It's great. It's just... it's great. It's beautiful, it's creative, and it's lovely.I was asked if the puzzles got repetitive, because most of them are ""move box to thing."" And that is true, but the game was only a few hours long. If it went on much longer, I feel like it would have gotten repetitive, but as it was, it was the perfect length to not get boring. There were a few puzzles that were kind of dumb, where I felt like I was kind of cheating by doing it the way I was, because I couldn't figure out what it wanted me to do. None of them were really frustrating, and the one time that I looked up how to do something, it was simply because I overlooked it. I'm all about collectables, so it was really jarring for me to collect something, which was something like the 15th out of 20, when the previous one I had was maybe the 8th. Then later, as I progressed, suddenly I got those bits. It looked as if I had forgotten them, and the way they were ordered for the second half of the game made me constantly question if I got everything. There were also a few occational blips in the graphics, where it suddenly felt like an early Playstation game with how things moved or reacted, and I caught a couple T-poses if I got caught on something. Certainly nothing game-breaking though - just took me a step back from the magic. Sometimes shifting into the shadows would be aggrivating as well, and it just... wouldn't. I would do it again and again and suddenly it would work, and then it wouldn't do it again when I wanted it to. Frustrating, but nothing worth quitting it over Dispite these things, the game is lovely. The art is lovely. The world is lovely. I wish that there was more going on, a sequal in the same space, or something. Maybe a second episode. I want more of this world and this cool ability, but maybe with a different puzzle designer. I would totally reccomend buying it if it's on sale, that's for sure. It's absolutely worth the few bucks. Ful price, ehhhhh. Didn't quite fall in love with it, but certainly had a big crush on it and made it my wallpaper for a day or two.			"

												Even though I liked the game overall, the entire experience was somewhat underwhelming. It has a lot of unused potential.I liked the setting, art style, music, and most of all, the shadow-shifting mechanics. However, the entire thing feels like it needs a lot more polish to make it feel complete.The story is kind of simplistic, character development is... weird (like that one scene where one character changes their mind by 180°)... You get hints of a back story in the form of collectibles, but they don't really reveal any coherent whole.Then there are luminaries, which are still a mystery to me – you have to use two or three of them in each act to activate some kind of switch or whatever, but you can find a lot more of them throughout the game (like three times the amount you actually need). It feels like they were supposed to be used for something else that then got cut out of the game or something. And I still have no idea what they are at all.There are a bunch of references to parallel universes, both in the final cut-scenes, and in some collectibles, but they don't really converge on any conclusion. They feel more like a cheap excuse for the existence of the main game mechanic, just slapped on the game without trying very hard to give it actual meaning.Same with Dawn, the character you control – there are a couple of hints about her back story, with a “shocking” revelation at the end, but it fails miserably at making sense. Thinking about it, even her name is only mentioned a couple-three times throughout the entire game. That's about as much as you'll learn about her.As for the actual gameplay, it wasn't terrible, but not breathtakingly good either. As I said earlier, shadow-shifting has a lot of potential for interesting and challenging puzzles, and there were a few of them too, but sometimes, you shift out of the shadow due to a glitch, or because the “dashing” ability is too random, forcing you to restart the same puzzle again and again.The lighting, around which a major part of the game revolves, also seems to be made somewhat sloppily. It makes sense that detailed lighting and shading is disabled in areas far away from the playable character, but it gets reenabled too late – after you get into the area, suddenly, a light source appears just like that, with all the shadows. And the shadows themselves are quite glitchy as well – sometimes, your shadow on the floor doesn't match the wall at all, sometimes, your shadow gets stretched into the void... It's not that it doesn't work, but it only works well enough to make the game playable.Other half-baked gameplay elements include grabbing ledges, which only works on a select few of them (and has a weird animation where Dawn's hands are a few centimeters away from the surface she's hanging onto), using objects inside shadows (especially moving them by moving the light source), or using the same awkward “interact” animation everywhere.All in all, the game feels like an exciting demo of a potentially wonderful game. I don't think it's worth its full price, but go get it when it's 75% off. If I were to put this into numbers, I'd say 6/10.			"

												I first played this game in Target on the Playstation 4 as a demo, and found it to rather amuse me admist the staleness that consumed my soul as I waited my father to finish shopping for Theros knows what. Unfortunately, I at that time, and actually currently still do not own a PS4 and was not willing to invest in it for a single game....then I found Steam and purchased the game on there...eh here. It's a really low investment puzzle game that keeps you entertained with a really needy little girl, a weird family dynamic (like what's up with them being shadows), accurate and pleasant musiv given the time period it's set in, and well enough graphics that you won't rip your eyes out from the lack of. I haven't finished the game because I get bored of puzzle games after a bit, but if you do find the time, you should be able to beat it in a couple of hours and walk away feeling relatively pleased.

Although you only see the people through their shadow, except for Didi, you get emotionally drawn in the story.The main power of your character is swifting in and out of the schadow, and the puzzles are neatly build around light and shadow.To show how good this was, I can only say, that I compare the feeling, fun, and mood of this game with Psychonauts, specifficaly the level, where you need to help the Painter, and the level of the Milkman. If you loved those levels, you will enjoy this game aswell			"

												Unique and very interesting puzzle game with 2D, 3D elements. Beautiful graphics (art), characters and an interesting story.Apart from having a very low number of bugs (getting stuck, objects hard to move) the biggest con in my opinion is that the game is rather short. I've spent around 6 hours to complete the game and to get all the achievements.Let's hope there'll be a sequel.7.5/10 "

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Now, it is quite short at around 3.5 hours, but if you missed some collectibles it can get you to about 4.5 hours. The concept of this game sounds quite cool, and in reality it is. The puzzles, at least for me lasted a bit considering I had to look up walkthroughs on half of Portal 2. I love the dual story line of this game! It deals with a young girls parents, and her ""friend"" helping her through some tasks (hopefully that didn't spoil anything). The graphics are quite nice considering the location and time the game is set in. All in all a very enjoyable game for the $3 I paid for on the Steam winter sale!+Great Puzzles+Appealing Story+Cool Gameplay+Very Good Graphics For A 2013 Indie Game-The Shifting From Shadow To Reality Could Be Improved.All in all 9.5/10 for a stellar game!

												There aren't that many games which would make me (or anyone) say ""Wow that was cool"" after they come to an end.This one did it to me!Contrast is an innovative game, taking some well known video-gaming genres and making from them something we haven't seen a lot lately (if at all), with its main downside of being very (!) short and perhaps a little rushed.The main ""punch"" of Contrast is the you'd play around not only in your old-regular 3D world but also in the shadow world, yes, you'd step into a wall and become your own shadow.Sounds simple, but fortunately Contrast doesn't just use the one and only gimmick it creates in order to try and make itself a good game, but also wraps it with some great graphics and sounds, interesting characters and a moving story in an exceptionally good noir atmosphere.Too bad you can easily finish this game in about 3 hours, and if you like to take your time like myself, and explore every corner.. You may reach 6 hours. No more.The game is also mostly not very challanging, and despite the interesting gameplay you can easily rush through the game, most of the time. And when you have some difficulties it would not necessarily be because of a challanging puzzle, but because some minor technical issue, as you may notice that the game and its mechanics aren't 100% polished.I'm aware that the developers are new, independent and small company. But at some points I did wonder whether that's the reason for  those few and usually minor flaws in Contrast, or simply because it was too rushed.Anyway, it doesn't hurt badly to my appreciation for this game.Because of its great artistic values, because of it being new and unusual and yet so good and engaging, it may even be worth those 15 bucks, and I'd definitely recommend this game.

												Having just started the second act of the game, I marvel at the fabulous use of light and scenery as a storytelling mechanic.  Though I often eschew platformer games myself, the story makes the platforming components an engaging part of the game rather than something leaving me dissatisfied.  The story so far is sort of haunting and certainly engaging, if predictable at times.  Though sometimes the shadow/reality transitions can be tough to gague properly, the game doesn't punish you overmuch for it, which is a definite boon to those short of patience.			"

												This game is a little hidden gem! It's been on my wishlist for a while now and I'm so glad I finally picked it up when it was on sale. It takes only four hours to complete, but I usually don't hold that against indie titles, and the length felt perfect for the story anyway. It's set in the early 20's (a time period I'm a total sucker for), and the art style is totally amazing and very impressive that they could pull this off with I assume is a smaller team and budget - it looks like a Dali painting of someone's fading childhood memory.So the art style immediately captivated me, but it doesn't stop there: the main game mechanic is a very neat idea: you can jump in and out of the shadow world, where it plays like a 2d platformer, and there are all sort of puzzles around playing with light, creating shadows and then using those shadows to traverse both worlds. There are some rough edges with the controls and the mechanic here and there, but mostly it's really fun.The story is also very sweet, and it integrates very well with the game mechanics. All in all, it's an almost perfect game for a a relaxing afternoon :)			"

												Pros:-Art style is wonderful-Loads of references and easter eggs (if you can catch them)-Gameplay, as in it's interesting-Voice acting (other than Didi, god her voice sucks)-Easy to learn-Presentation-Story (not astounding, but good anyway)Cons:-Pretty short-Gameplay-Price (I'd say 10 bucks more like it)Why is gameplay both a pro and a con? Because this game is very charming and wonderful, it's gameplay included. However, the same mechanics that really makes it interesting also damn it so badly at times. I mean ♥♥♥♥, I was wanting to break my moniter at some parts because the game would not function by its own rules. This happans at least 5 times throughout the game -- these spots where unless you're standing in pixel perfect spots, or jump at the absolute perfect moment, you'll fail over and over.However, other than the length and Didi's terrible voice acting, this game is rather quaint and very enjoyable. I think the voice acting and art direction were just so on point, again, except for Didi. It sounded like they recorded her in a school hallway.If numbers suit your fancy, I'd say about an 8/10.			"

												It's great. It's just... it's great. It's beautiful, it's creative, and it's lovely.I was asked if the puzzles got repetitive, because most of them are ""move box to thing."" And that is true, but the game was only a few hours long. If it went on much longer, I feel like it would have gotten repetitive, but as it was, it was the perfect length to not get boring. There were a few puzzles that were kind of dumb, where I felt like I was kind of cheating by doing it the way I was, because I couldn't figure out what it wanted me to do. None of them were really frustrating, and the one time that I looked up how to do something, it was simply because I overlooked it. I'm all about collectables, so it was really jarring for me to collect something, which was something like the 15th out of 20, when the previous one I had was maybe the 8th. Then later, as I progressed, suddenly I got those bits. It looked as if I had forgotten them, and the way they were ordered for the second half of the game made me constantly question if I got everything. There were also a few occational blips in the graphics, where it suddenly felt like an early Playstation game with how things moved or reacted, and I caught a couple T-poses if I got caught on something. Certainly nothing game-breaking though - just took me a step back from the magic. Sometimes shifting into the shadows would be aggrivating as well, and it just... wouldn't. I would do it again and again and suddenly it would work, and then it wouldn't do it again when I wanted it to. Frustrating, but nothing worth quitting it over Dispite these things, the game is lovely. The art is lovely. The world is lovely. I wish that there was more going on, a sequal in the same space, or something. Maybe a second episode. I want more of this world and this cool ability, but maybe with a different puzzle designer. I would totally reccomend buying it if it's on sale, that's for sure. It's absolutely worth the few bucks. Ful price, ehhhhh. Didn't quite fall in love with it, but certainly had a big crush on it and made it my wallpaper for a day or two.			"

												While the game is fun as a puzzler, it doesn't work as a platformer because of the sloppy controls of Dawn.  The music is great and the atmosphere is fantastic although the total game is very very short.  It will only require about 3-4 hours of straight play to complete.  For the price, it's a lot of fun with the expection being the poor controls.  I would recommend it though.			"

												Stunning visuals. Beautiful soundtrack. Challenging puzzles. 1920s noir ambiance. A bit of carnival, a bit of burlesque. This game is full of art, music and beauty. There is no daylight – only streetlights that bathe the cobblestone streets and alleyways. You are in a dreamlike world. Straddling the physical world and the shadow world, you must use various light sources to carve your path in the shadows to the other side. Though all but two characters are mere shadows upon the walls, their voices echoing around you, the game manages to pull together an interesting and captivating story… a story that becomes an adventure for you, Dawn, and Didi - the only one who can see you. Didi wants her family back together, and you are here to aid her using your unique abilities.At times, the gameplay mechanics are frustrating and glitchy. But overall, the game is challenging without being impossible. The puzzles are creative and clever, and they carry the shadow play throughout the entire game and encourage you to use it intelligently to either continue on your path or obtain necessary elements or optional collectibles. The immersion is consistent and flawless - you do not leave the world the developers have created until you quit the game. And even then, you may find yourself humming the theme song...Though it will only take you a handful of hours to finish, it would be well worth your while to give this puzzle-platformer a try. This game has heart.			"

The game has a beautiful art design and the music especially the main menu music is heavely. The gameplay of going in and out of shadow is actually a really interesting one. However, I feel like it needed a lot more development. Though it is still great grounds to build from if a sequel is to ever come about. The story is short and sweet. I adored the ending , it threw a curve ball right in at that last minute which was actually quite shocking and intruiging.			"

The brevity of the game very much works in its favour and the concepts on display here are promising for future projects from this team.  More money and time, this could have been GOTY contender for me.  As it is, it's just really interesting.

Unfortunately, I at that time, and actually currently still do not own a PS4 and was not willing to invest in it for a single game....then I found Steam and purchased the game on there...eh here. It's a really low investment puzzle game that keeps you entertained with a really needy little girl, a weird family dynamic (like what's up with them being shadows), accurate and pleasant musiv given the time period it's set in, and well enough graphics that you won't rip your eyes out from the lack of. I haven't finished the game because I get bored of puzzle games after a bit, but if you do find the time, you should be able to beat it in a couple of hours and walk away feeling relatively pleased.

												Even though I liked the game overall, the entire experience was somewhat underwhelming. It has a lot of unused potential.I liked the setting, art style, music, and most of all, the shadow-shifting mechanics. However, the entire thing feels like it needs a lot more polish to make it feel complete.The story is kind of simplistic, character development is... weird (like that one scene where one character changes their mind by 180°)... You get hints of a back story in the form of collectibles, but they don't really reveal any coherent whole.Then there are luminaries, which are still a mystery to me – you have to use two or three of them in each act to activate some kind of switch or whatever, but you can find a lot more of them throughout the game (like three times the amount you actually need). It feels like they were supposed to be used for something else that then got cut out of the game or something. And I still have no idea what they are at all.There are a bunch of references to parallel universes, both in the final cut-scenes, and in some collectibles, but they don't really converge on any conclusion. They feel more like a cheap excuse for the existence of the main game mechanic, just slapped on the game without trying very hard to give it actual meaning.Same with Dawn, the character you control – there are a couple of hints about her back story, with a “shocking” revelation at the end, but it fails miserably at making sense. Thinking about it, even her name is only mentioned a couple-three times throughout the entire game. That's about as much as you'll learn about her.As for the actual gameplay, it wasn't terrible, but not breathtakingly good either. As I said earlier, shadow-shifting has a lot of potential for interesting and challenging puzzles, and there were a few of them too, but sometimes, you shift out of the shadow due to a glitch, or because the “dashing” ability is too random, forcing you to restart the same puzzle again and again.The lighting, around which a major part of the game revolves, also seems to be made somewhat sloppily. It makes sense that detailed lighting and shading is disabled in areas far away from the playable character, but it gets reenabled too late – after you get into the area, suddenly, a light source appears just like that, with all the shadows. And the shadows themselves are quite glitchy as well – sometimes, your shadow on the floor doesn't match the wall at all, sometimes, your shadow gets stretched into the void... It's not that it doesn't work, but it only works well enough to make the game playable.Other half-baked gameplay elements include grabbing ledges, which only works on a select few of them (and has a weird animation where Dawn's hands are a few centimeters away from the surface she's hanging onto), using objects inside shadows (especially moving them by moving the light source), or using the same awkward “interact” animation everywhere.All in all, the game feels like an exciting demo of a potentially wonderful game. I don't think it's worth its full price, but go get it when it's 75% off. If I were to put this into numbers, I'd say 6/10.			"

												TLDR: Interesting game with interesting ideas, smooth gameplay and a lovely story-presentation. Unfortunately too short and expensive (when not on sale) considering the amount of content it offers, but still worth a try.Full review:A short (REALLY short, finished it with 100% of the achievements in under 3 hours) platforming game which in a way reminds me of the Portal games since, as one of the game's achievements references to by name, rather than thinking with portals here you are ""Thinking with Shadows"". Can't reach your objective in the 3d perspective environment? time to start looking for a way to make the shadow of objects, buildings or ""people"" (even tho they are invisible to your eyes) help you, so that you can then shift into the walls and do 2d perspective platforming with the shadows. The fluidity in which you do this change between the 3d world and the 2d shadows is very smooth. Yes you will run into a few ""buggy"" spots but they are few and don't really break the gameplay.Story-wise, it is a charm. You could consider it 2 stories, one of the young girl Didi's desire to be with her parents and to make them be happy, which is the focus point for most of the game's lenght, and a more subtle one which springs up near the end related to Dawn, the character you control, about who exactly is she and why she has the powers she has. Mind you, its not the best story ever but it works well for the game and the way it is presented is pretty good.Again, short game and expensive considering the amount of playtime it can offer (I'd recommend buying it when it is on sale with a 60-ish or more % discount) but what little you get is in my opinion quality content worth checking out. Hopefully we see a similar premise, or maybe even a proper game sequel, in the future from this developer.			"

												This game is fun, unique, and a refreshing new addition to puzzle platforming. From start to finish, I absolutely adored this game. The controls are solid, the gameplay is challenging and interesting, and the cartoony film noir art style is a nice accompaniment to the overall atmosphere of the game. To me, this is one game that stands out for really taking a different direction: the way the story is delivered and the emphasis on lights and shadows really made for an unforgettable experience.My only complaint about this game is that it is short. It doesn't take very long to finish this game. I did it in one sitting. It's a game that cries out for a sequel because it has so much potential that, unfortunately, didn't make the first cut.Overall, this game is worth buying. I wholeheartedly recommend it.			"

												A 3D puzzle platformer that allows you to switch to 2D on lighted surfaces, many of the puzzles revolving around this ability.The storyline is a fascinating scifi-noir mix, with a few loose ends that beg for a se/pre-quel. A lot of the detail is buried in the collectible documents throughout the game.Length-wise, I finished the main storyline in about 3.5 hours played, and it took about another half-hour to get 100% on collectibles and achievements.Beyond the collectibles/achievements, there is not a ton of replay value. I personally found the story intruiging enough that I can see myself playing through again at some point in the future.			"

												Wow. This game runs a little oddly on my setup, with some freezing issues and framerate skips, but other than that it runs fairly well. I loved the story of the game, it kept me engaged. I had to google some of the solutions to the puzzles and try at them for a few minutes each time only to discover that the most obvious answer was usually the best. Don't overthink this game, it's a treat. I kind of want to play through it again to get the rest of the acheivements now.			"

												This game is.... ok. I personally had no problem with the control but the puzzles and the idea of popping in and out shadows wasn't taken to its full advantage in my opinion. The Storytelling is well done and I thought that withholding information from the gamer made it more compelling. The fact I had to redo the entire last level due to a bug doesn't change the fact I enjoyed the game while it lasted. An average game, worth your time while on sale.6/10			"

												Contrast is a rather simple indie, platform/puzzle game about a young girl, Didi, and her (apparently) imaginary friend Dawn trying to help out Didi's father figure, Johnny, over one single night in a 1920's, jazz-themed city.You take control of Dawn and are given the power to switch between a normal world and a shadow world in order to advance in the city, solve some puzzles and collect bonus items, like luminaries and plot documents. The premise is simple enough, but the game, while being worth just 2-3 hours of platforming and puzzle solving, is able to offer you a decent but fair challenge, introducing new mechanics and gimmicks as the story progresses that manage to keep you on your toes. Furthermore, failing a jump or anything of the kind won't inconvenence you at all, given you have pretty much infinite lives/tries.The  strongest points of Contrast are a very charming art style, which heavily borrows from the 20s and jazz music, and an interesting story, which is able to engage the player even if not exactly long or overcomplex. As mentioned above, there are some collectables to be found, but hunting them doesn't extend the game's lenght substantially.It's also worth mentioning that Didi, the young protagonist, is one of the most berable, cute and useful child I've ever met in a videogame			"

I always take shadows for granted and it took me a while till it really 'clicked' that I can walk on then.Controls can be a bit clunky, however you can walk slowly with ctrl and everything is under control again. ;)Haven't found any faults yet!Cheers			"

												Contrast is a game with a great core mechanic that makes for interesting gameplay and storytelling and works pretty well with the film noir atmosphere.  The story is mostly a generic film noir story that only gets interesting when it touches on the core mechanic, but the level design and puzzles keep the game interesting.  My only major criticism is the game feels like it was rushed—as though it could have and was meant to have had more content than ultimately ended up in it.  That said, what you do get is still a good experience, and definitely worth the price if you get it during one of Steam's numerous sales.			"

												This game is a little hidden gem! It's been on my wishlist for a while now and I'm so glad I finally picked it up when it was on sale. It takes only four hours to complete, but I usually don't hold that against indie titles, and the length felt perfect for the story anyway. It's set in the early 20's (a time period I'm a total sucker for), and the art style is totally amazing and very impressive that they could pull this off with I assume is a smaller team and budget - it looks like a Dali painting of someone's fading childhood memory.So the art style immediately captivated me, but it doesn't stop there: the main game mechanic is a very neat idea: you can jump in and out of the shadow world, where it plays like a 2d platformer, and there are all sort of puzzles around playing with light, creating shadows and then using those shadows to traverse both worlds. There are some rough edges with the controls and the mechanic here and there, but mostly it's really fun.The story is also very sweet, and it integrates very well with the game mechanics. All in all, it's an almost perfect game for a a relaxing afternoon :)			"

												Contrast is a game for those seeking a story-driven experience rather than a lot of action or brain teasing. The game isn't exceptionally long and rewards taking things slow to view the environment and attend to the story surrounding little Didi's broken family.The main gameplay mechanic which the puzzles are framed around is that of shadow manipulation; the player character shifts in and out of shadows on the walls to navigate through the environment and achieve each goal. This mechanic is extremely well implemented and the puzzles flow very logically. Not exceptionally challenging, but still well worth a look for the engaging story and atmosphere.			"

The story is told in two ways, through playing and through collecting. You can find tidbits throughout the stages that reveal more to the main story and about what is really going on.The gameplay is quirky, it's got it's moments but it's really a basic platformer. Some of the 2D areas are really glitchy and you might end up repeating them a lot due to controls.I can recommended this as a game, but at it's price I say wishlist it and wait.			"

												This game had so much potential, but ultimately I was disappointed by it. With more work, this could have been a great game.Contrast is a game with a novel mechanic: the player moves between a 3D normal world and a 2D ""shadow world"" to solve platform puzzles. It makes for some really challenging puzzles, but unfortunately, this system can be buggy and unwieldy at times, making some of the puzzles much more difficult than necessary.The game took me three hours to finish. It's not a long game, and I feel that is its biggest weakness. It lacks the depth of a truly immersive story. At the end of the game, I was left wanting more. More backstory. More plot. More explanation. More puzzles to solve. I feel like so much more could have been done with this game to give the player a really good story.The story is set in a beautifully-crafted, dark, intriguing noir-20's/30's world with heavy steampunk accents. The level modeling and art are excellent, but the character modeling and voice acting leaves something to be desired. The actors are rather unpassionate and unconvincing.Contrast is a fun little game, and I definitely recommend it. However, I think it could have been so much more, and ultimately I was disappointed by its lack of depth.			"

												I seriously loved this! And I'm glad I didn't listen to the mixed reviews but instead followed my intuition.This game reminded me of an unexpected cross between Limbo, Life Is Strange and Bioshock Infinite with some Tim Burton influences (and a faint déjà-vu of Alice: Madness Returns during one of the levels), and on top of that, it's really well done! The only few and in between moments of frustration were some glitchy/fiddly shadow jumps and the solving of some non-obvious puzzles (but that's actually a good thing!). Other than that, I have no complaints whatsoever, except maybe how short it is: I played it through within one sitting of 4 hours. It's atmospheric and suspenseful and emotional and I REALLY recommend it! It does deserve a sequel (though I heard Compulsion Games are busy on another project now).			"

												Contrast is a very short game with flaws but it has a charming personality with some great high notes.Pros:+1920's noir aesthetic is really well done.+Many clever puzzles, shifting between the 3D world and a world of shadows.+Collectibles are not obnoxious.+Not terribly hard to 100%.+When the story is flowing well, it's pretty entertaining.+Fantastic soundtrack.+Mostly solid voice acting.Cons:-Only 2-3 hours of game play to see everything.-Some puzzle elements are pretty obtuse. Lots of ""huh, I didn't know that was a mechanic"" moments when solving puzzles.-Motivation for main character is pretty slim.-Sometimes the transitions between shadow realm and real world aren't clean, leads you to die or repeat sections often.-The story can hop around or drag, then it ends suddenly.-NPC girl you spend most of your time with is frustrating and pushy to no end. Her whiney screeching of non-sequitur commands was a grind.All in all I feel that this was a game that was aiming much higher than where it landed, but it didn't end up in a bad place generally speaking. There are plenty of fun bits alongside the annoying. Worth a pickup on sale, not so much at full price.			"

												Contrast is a 2D/3D puzzle platformer set in a surreal version of the 1920's.The unique mechanic here is switching between the normal 3D world and the the 2D world of shadows. Most of the puzzles in the game are based on this core mechanic in one way or another. Unfortunately puzzle quality feels rather inconsistent. Some of the puzzles make a great use of the shadow world whereas others feel rather poorly designed.Controls are probably the weakest link in this game. I was playing on a gamepad and overall the controls felt rather imprecise. In particular it's way too easy to exit the shadow world by accident. The game also suffers from a number of glitches like getting stuck in obstacles or walls.On a more positive note the artwork and the audio are great and fit the setting perfectly. The story and the writing are rather strong too. Unfortunately the game is fairly short, some more content would have been nice.Despite its flaws I'd recommend Contrast to any fans of puzzle platformers who are willing to put up with the rather poor controls.The good:- Switching between 3D and 2D is a clever idea- Great setting- Gorgeous visuals- Nice audio- Strong mature storyThe bad:- Poor controls- Some poorly designed puzzles- Little bit short (I took me around 3.5 hours to finish the game)- Very linear mapsThe ugly:- Quite a few glitches and minor bugs such as getting stuck in walls			"

Unfortunately the game is fairly short, some more content would have been nice.Despite its flaws I'd recommend Contrast to any fans of puzzle platformers who are willing to put up with the rather poor controls.The good:- Switching between 3D and 2D is a clever idea- Great setting- Gorgeous visuals- Nice audio- Strong mature storyThe bad:- Poor controls- Some poorly designed puzzles- Little bit short (I took me around 3.5 hours to finish the game)- Very linear mapsThe ugly:- Quite a few glitches and minor bugs such as getting stuck in walls			"

												Very underrated (and yet quite short) game. One of a kind 3D puzzler filled to the brim with amazing 20s vaudevillian atmosphere.Some puzzles/secrets felt a bit glitchy due to the nature of shadow mechanics and some required well developed spatial imagination (I wouldn't be able to beat it if I played by myself) but I'd give the game a strong 8/10! :)			"

												I seriously loved this! And I'm glad I didn't listen to the mixed reviews but instead followed my intuition.This game reminded me of an unexpected cross between Limbo, Life Is Strange and Bioshock Infinite with some Tim Burton influences (and a faint déjà-vu of Alice: Madness Returns during one of the levels), and on top of that, it's really well done! The only few and in between moments of frustration were some glitchy/fiddly shadow jumps and the solving of some non-obvious puzzles (but that's actually a good thing!). Other than that, I have no complaints whatsoever, except maybe how short it is: I played it through within one sitting of 4 hours. It's atmospheric and suspenseful and emotional and I REALLY recommend it! It does deserve a sequel (though I heard Compulsion Games are busy on another project now).			"

												Contrast is a very short game with flaws but it has a charming personality with some great high notes.Pros:+1920's noir aesthetic is really well done.+Many clever puzzles, shifting between the 3D world and a world of shadows.+Collectibles are not obnoxious.+Not terribly hard to 100%.+When the story is flowing well, it's pretty entertaining.+Fantastic soundtrack.+Mostly solid voice acting.Cons:-Only 2-3 hours of game play to see everything.-Some puzzle elements are pretty obtuse. Lots of ""huh, I didn't know that was a mechanic"" moments when solving puzzles.-Motivation for main character is pretty slim.-Sometimes the transitions between shadow realm and real world aren't clean, leads you to die or repeat sections often.-The story can hop around or drag, then it ends suddenly.-NPC girl you spend most of your time with is frustrating and pushy to no end. Her whiney screeching of non-sequitur commands was a grind.All in all I feel that this was a game that was aiming much higher than where it landed, but it didn't end up in a bad place generally speaking. There are plenty of fun bits alongside the annoying. Worth a pickup on sale, not so much at full price.			"

												A very nice puzzle 3d exploration/puzzle game.While not long, the storyline is emotional and engaging.The mechanics fit completely with the story, and the combination of 3d/2d with shadows is something I've never seen before. Most of the puzzles are fairly simple, but enjoyable nonetheless.I did occasionally have trouble with being automatically shifted out of the shadows, which sometimes made puzzles annoying/repetitive to solve.If the game looks interesting to you, I would recommend you buy it. It is a enjoyable experience, well worth trying out.			"

												This is one heck of a great indie game. The art style is simply amazing, the puzzle and platform mechanics are fun and innovative, the environment is very well fleshed-out and really gives character to the world. A nice heart-worming story, short and sweet but well worth the money if you want a taste of something that breaks the mold of all the popular adventure/platformer games out there. Just had a little trouble actually getting the game to run due to some game settings that don't allow certain graphic cards, but there is a quick and harmless workaround to get it going. Also forgot to mention the fantastic jazz and cabaret music that goes so well with the environment and greatly adds to the immersion into this world.			"

												Contrast is one of those story driven games, but it has enough platformer to be a bit challenging. Its more of a beginner platformer than an advanced platformer so if you are looking for hard puzzles you won't find them here. Its got a pretty unique game play style, and as the game is story driven, the plot is just amazing, and the whole feel of the world (as well as a few bugs) keep you on your toes the entire time. Its got that deep otherworldly feel to it while you are tackling pretty everyday(ish) problems in extraordinary ways. The voice acting is pretty amazing as long as you don't mind a LOT of it, you get attached to all the characters. And, I have to iterate, to enjoy this game fully, you MUST try to pick up the collectables and read through them as you go, as they are an integral part of the plot, especially later in the game, and you will get very lost very quickly plot wise if you don't. All in all, its a little rough around the edges but its got a passionate heart that will move you in story and in some really cleverly disguised, if not a bit easy, puzzles. Its very much an open to interpretation game, like Journey, and with art I think is pretty influential and amazing to the atmosphere in a cartoony yet gritty style with fantasy splashed on it in the most fascinating ways.

												This game is beautiful, it's amazing I love it so much. The puzzles are complicated enough for me to feel smart and stupid when I figure them out; the plateforming is well done a little clunky at sometimes but is fun to do. The city you are placed in is amazing to explore absolutly beautiful world you are set in. You can traverse between the shadows and the normal world. I am still playing the game I am unsure what the undertoned meaning of the game actually is and what is actually going on. But I am going to continue to play it and figure out what the story is. I love this game so much there is a steam punk vive and gothic under lining in the world. The aspect of seing everything from a perspective of a character called Dawn who is a ghost or shadow of some short it is extremely well made and the devs took a good amount of time with this game. I enjoy this game emensely and I recomend anyone who likes puzzle plateformers to check this game out.			"

												I'd consider ""Contrast"" one of the ""Indie gems"" of our time.It's a modern game with some fresh ideas, but also obvious roots in some classics.The whole design, the art, the music, the story, the levels, the mechanics, it all plays together very well, creating a rounded experience.The story soon became more intense than I expected, driving me forwards, wanting to know what happens next.The levels, puzzles and platform sequenses aren't very big or difficult, though sometimes there are little to no indicators what to do next, just a little exploration or trial should provide the solution.The main mechanic of using light and shadow is just amazing, used in various ways, keeping it interesting, only sometimes it seems a little rough/ glitchy.The only ""negative"" i could say about the whole game is that i would've wished for some more of it all, a little bit more story, a little bit more gameplay to go through, (even) more things that could've been done with the mechanics and a bit more smoothing out the little edges of the game. So i would wish for a bigger, second part, or a spinoff or something, but that's not even really a bad thing to say about ""Contrast"" itself.			"

												This is really a nice little game, easy to miss though as it seems to be a bit underrated.I really liked the 20's vaudeville/ film noir atmosphere, the design of the puzzles and the narration. The voice acting is also very convincing. And the game is unique with its mechanic of manipulating light source to solve the puzzles: this forces to think a bit out of the box.On the downside I wish there was more of it: with about 4 hours of gameplay, I felt the end was a bit rushed. I'll probably come back to it for the few details I missed during my first playthough, but there's not much replayability.One minor issue I had were some glitches: sometimes the controls can be a bit clumsy, and I got stuck 2 times in the wall and had to reload the game (bad collision detection I guess).

												Contrast succeeds at being surreal and cute at the same time. Cute only because of the secondary main character and her naivity.As a 3D platformer, it is very short, but boasts a wonderful art style that is also creepy in a Tim Burton kind of way.You play as Dawn, an 'imaginary' friend to Didi, the daughter of Kat and Vincenzo. Didi's adoptive father is actually this guy named Johnny who's trying to make a name for himself. The overall story has overtones of mafia involvement, magic, illuisions, etc. It has a very early 1900's feel to it but the world is so surreal with the city that the game takes place being on floating islands. And the clockwork systems and other stuff.The standout element is the ability to shift from the real world to the shadow world, similar to, I think it's Paper Mario where he can stick and travel on the walls. Or one of the Legend of Zelda's where Link actually does transform into a shadow of sorts. Well, it's like that. Dawn has that ability basically.I guess my only complaints would be the lack of ambient sounds and the length of the game. Otherwise, pretty good.7.5/10			"

												Okay game. Kind of short. 2 hours and I finished it. It's so simple I think I'll just go for the achievements. The story is a bit peculiar. Sometimes, you will be wondering if everything is in Didi's (little girl protagonist) head. You'll be wondering if you are playing Tim Burton's Psychonauts. You might be assuming that Dawn (shadow girl) is actually grown up Didi but the ending may change your mind. The ending is really interesting. The subtle hint with the hand is quite ""Hmmmm"". Multiverses.I would recommend that you get this on sale at a really low price. It's too short and it's not AAA. But it is ingenious.PROS1. Ingenious Use of ShadowsI love the way the shadow world works on the wall. It's different from games such as Soul Reaver where you alternate between dimensions to find missing pieces. Having a flat surface and light creates very interesting situations.2. DashingQuite fun to use. Fast to transverse the map. 3. PuzzlesVery nice. Loved the Solarium. Had to pause for a while to think of where to adjust the correct distance and angles to place the gears. Too few puzzles though and most of them weren't much of a challenge.4. Pirate ShipQuite funny5. Princess StoryLoved it, especially the ridiculous commentary when you fall onto the bamboo. Poor Fred.CONS1. Shadows and Rounded Surfaces, CracksBuggy. The shadows don't work well when it come to cracks and rounded surfaces. They tend to throw you out from the shadow world.2. Way Too Short2 hours is way too short. A slight waste of money. I was hoping for at least 10 hours. I was actually expecting Vincenzo's story, Knight's story, the gangster's or Salvo's story and a little more about Didi. 3. LuminariesWhat's the point of collecting all the Luminaries again? You only need 2/3 to power up the lights.NEUTRAL1. CollectiblesThe photos and news clippings are a bit ""meh"". They hardly add to the story since the game already tells you about them. "

While it has its share of flaws, i.e. gameplay feels clunky here and there, it totally makes up for it with surprisingly interesting characters and fantastic music. The game is short, and the end left me wanting more, but despite some frustrating moments, I just finished it with a satisfied feeling. I was really rooting for Johnny to get his act together, and I think, most people will. I got Contrast for a nice deal (during the Canada sale), so I'd really recommend you spend a few euros or dollars if the game is up on sale again. It'll be worth it.			"

												Contrast is short, has a few minor bugs and flaws. There was actually a lot that erked me. For example, the game screwed with my mouse sensitivity in game, so i had to tweak it so the camera wasn't making me dizzy. Also, it was a bit more demanding on my pc then i thought it would (but my pc is old. Any up to date pc should do fine). Fixed camera angles when interecting with objects can also be a bit obnoxious. However... for the flaws, this game was really enjoyable. It's a bit of soul food, makes you think and ask questions. It feels substantial as far as the story and the world is concerned (Some say gameplay is lacking challange, but for me it lacked a lot of the frustration that can come with some puzzle games with obtuse solutions. For example, the secret star solutions in Braid, one of which requires you to do nothing but wait for nearly 40 minutes or so). The art is fantastic, definitely different from what i've played recently. The Music and overal sound design is wonderful, though the voice acting isn't the best. Contrast is one of those examples of ""Games are Art"" while still being a game, as opposed to a tour with some narration over top. If you don't mind a short, but fufilling experiance or some so so gameplay, and you want a great story, world, and overall aesthetic then pick up contrast. If you want something challanging, lengthy, and a bit shallower (i.e. good dumb fun such as Painkiller) then look elsewhere. A game for when you're in the mood, and a damn good one if you end up playing it in that mood.			"

Short, but not too shortContrast tells the story of a little girl named Didi and her seemingly invisible friend Dawn, who is literally living in the world of shadows. The story is set sometime in the 1920s and takes place in a wonderfully crafted and stylistically consistent world that looks like a mix between reality and dream.You as player take on the role of Dawn, who is not only invisible to everyone but Didi, but can also shift between the 3-dimensional realm of reality and the 2-dimensional plane of shadows, where ever there is a bright light on any large enough surface. The feature is well-implemented, and most of the puzzles are cleverly built around this feature; the way it forces  the player to view things and think about them differently reminded me of Portal 1 and 2 - in a good way.The story, surprisingly, is far from being a fairy tale for children as there are some very dark tones to it. On the other hand however, Contrast is a fantastic example for a compelling experience that does not need unnecessary violence in order to work. Both gameplay and story work well together, and neither falls short.Speaking of short, the only short thing about the game is the time it takes to complete the story; for me, this was less than four hours. This is not to say the game is too short, however, as I found it to be just the right duration for the story to unfold. Any longer and it would've fallen into the same trap as so many other games that try to stretch the length of a decent story by diluting it with repetitive gameplay segments.So can I recommend this game? Yes, the story, gameplay and presentation (both visuals and audio) are definitely worth it. However, if you are unsure because of the short length you may wish to wait until it is on sale again.On a sidenote: When I started playing the game with a DualShock 3 Controller emulated as 360 Controller using MotionInJoy, the camera seemed to be a little oversensitive. After changing to a proper 360 Controller (cable) for the second half of the game, the camera seemed to be a little more controllable. Just a heads-up for everyone using a DS3. "

												A unique experience, however brief, that should not be passed up by anyone who's looking for a good story. The game is presented with a beautiful art style in a strange and enchanting city, where you play the role of an imaginary friend looking out for a girl named Didi. On your way you'll solve puzzles, shift into a dimension of shadows and explore the dimly lit city. It wasn't long before I knew that this would be one of the best games I've ever played. I can remember many games that might have a more satisfying conclusion, better structure and pacing, but Contrast is simply beautiful and engaging, and I could never stop to wonder why. It's a game that's been made with heart and soul, by developers who really wanted to share their vision and story with the player. And although it may not have been fully realized, Contrast is a simply marvelous mystery that I'll be recommending to my friends.			"

												Beautiful game with beautiful music. Contrast is a great platformer with somewhat challenging puzzles. Most are pretty easy until you get towards the end, then they are quite hard to figure out. Although it is a short game (I beat it in 3-4 hours) I would still recommend it because it is still very fun. I did have a few glitches when I played like being shot across the room if landing on something at a weird angle but I think it only happened a couple times. Achievements are also pretty easy to get. I got most of them without even trying and found all the collectibles exept one.			"

												Contrast is a nice puzzle game with an amazing atmohphere, a good storyline and great music.I need to say the gameplay/the control (technical side) was kinda frustrating. But i loved playing it. A fantastic point is that you can switch between the ""world of shadows"" 2D and the ""world of lights"" 3D.Its a new game genre, like a combination of Limbo, Alice: madness returns and BioShock.It took me 4-5h to complete, which is too short but still:A Game worth playing... don´t miss this one. :D			"

												This is a game I was interested on since it was in GreenLight, and one of the few games I've pre-purchased (afair it might be the only one). I finished it a long time ago, but my first pre-review was not complete so here I go:Contrast is beautiful (very beautiful) at both graphics and OST (as long as you like jazz music), original in its gameplay and not too long but neither too short (though an additional chapter would have been welcome).The negative point I would mention would be about some few - very few - animations and textures that could have been improved, however being an indie and, afaik, the first game of the studio, I think these little sins can be forgiven.But the main thing I really don't like, though is not about the game itself, is that even having pre-purchased it and existing no special edition at that moment, now I find that there is and that contains the OST (which I'd like to own), but with no option at all to upgrade to... imho this is not a very nice way to reward the ones that believed in the game (and no, iTunes is not an option to me).

												A good and enjoyable NOIR-like platformer game but a bit short in my opinion, you get to play with imaginary friend (female protagonist) of a little girl and help her to reunite her family (the plot twist in the end is really well done).-graphically it's really nice and well done with the unreal engin, got that 1920s french noir feel.-the gameplay is smooth and fresh, you have to solve puzzles by shifting between real 3d world and 2d shadow world but sometimes it gets on the nerves cause you gott be quick .- no bugs or glitches and crashes , at least for me .-you got 25 easy achievements and some cards to craft a nice badge-the only thing that i disagree with is the price of the game , 14.99$ is a bit too much for a short game ( around 4 - 5h to finish) and asking 19.99$ for the Collector's Edition that contain the soundtrack and some infos about the game (except for the soundtrack , the artwork and infos are pretty much mehhhhh).i recommend this game for puzzles loving gamers8/10			"

PresentationContrast is one of those games that's unique and memorable at the same time, as it drags you into a shadow world in the 1920s Paris in the role of Dawn, young Didi's best friend who possesses the ability of shifting between the 3D material world and the 2D shadow world, making Contrast one of most ideas-filled titles of this year. Didi is also the only person who can see Dawn, but the actions you perform around the city will have an impact on the real world that is seen as shadows from Dawn's eyes as well. Even though Dawn is an interesting character on her own that you'd definitely become interested in as the game goes, this is the story of Didi's parents, who are constantly arguing after Didi's father left and her mother is too busy working at night, leaving her unattended - a perfect opportunity for her to sneak out and fix things around the city with Dawn's help. The bad thing about Contrast is that it will end too soon, rushing through the events of the story just to get to the ending, and even though following the plot is satisfying as it is, there are lots of moments that could've been detailed more, making the game longer and the lasting experience more satisfying in the end. Without doubt Contrast nails its presentation, having a simple menu that will almost instantly take you into the action, while still offering you plenty of options to manage things such as collectibles or taking a look over your stats. Starting with the purely astonishing art work and the detailed characters and moving on to the shadows that have an important role in the gameplay, but offer an incredible visual effect as well, the game is constantly reminding you how awesome its core idea truly is. The problem with that idea however is that it hasn't reached its full potential, as the moment when you get most comfortable with the control and the idea of the game is the same moment the game will reach its denouement. There are so many ideas that are simply rushed inside the game, such as walking up the shadows of Didi's parents in order to reach a location and listening to their speech while doing so; those are the kind of moments that make Contrast feel unique and make you desire more out of this game.Rating: 9.5GameplayThe idea of shifting between the real 3D world and the world of shadows is without doubt one of the most unique and innovating ideas of this year and Contrast takes great advantage of this idea, creating some amazing puzzles that will leave you satisfied each time you complete one and move in to the next area, but the best thing about those puzzles is their deductibility, forcing you to analyse each one of them, but offering the solution if you stare at them long enough as it is sometimes more than obvious. Each new location you visit will introduce new puzzle concepts, some trickier than others, but same as the story those are rushed, never taking full advantage of their potential, as the game will quickly move from one concept to another, leaving abilities such as the shadow dash to be used only a few times in the entire game. There are the occasional glitches that will stop you from making a move in your first try, but there isn't any sort of time pressure on the gameplay so you have all the time in the world to find your way around a puzzle and reach your destination. The 3D world puzzles are enjoyable and the shadow puzzles even more, but the real magic begins when the game combines those elements to create some amazing areas that you will have to scout first, try different approaches and only then decide on a final solution that will take you to your destination, but all this time spent looking around an area is well spent as you will constantly be excited about where one thing should go or how the positioning of some objects will help you reach a higher point. Walking up the shadows of Didi's parents is an amazing concept as you get to listen to a part of the story while you're slowly making your way to a location that's related to that story, constantly keeping you on the edge about what's gonna happen next as you climb higher and higher and eventually reach a location that will unlock further mysteries. There is a lot of great stuff in here and because it is so great it leaves you with a thirst for more and unfortunately there isn't anything else.Rating: 8.5GraphicsContrast on the PlayStation 4 looks amazing, making the city of Paris come to life at night with the use of those same shadows that make the gameplay so enjoyable, as the little bit of light that is available in an area will reflect objects in the precise direction, something that affects the gameplay as well as the overall beauty of this title. Even if you only get to see Dawn and Didi as full characters, as the rest of the cast is seen as shadows, they are both incredibly detailed and fit into the world perfectly. The visual effects are okay, with a few things that could use some work, but what is really impressive is the reflection of certain things on the pavement of the street as it is wet and seeing that no matter where you go is impressive.Rating: 9AudioThe voice acting is top notch, as the entire cast including Didi, her parents and Vincenzo take advantage of some amazing voice work that truly helps sell the story and the emotional road it takes once you get to know Didi better. The sound effects are just as good, making the world come to life and give Dawn's powers a great background; the best thing however, comes in the soundtrack, as from the start of the game you will be greeted with a noire classic, a perfect fit for the city of Paris in the early '20s, and the list goes on and on as you progress through the game.Rating: 10ExtrasUnfortunately, the main campaign is the only thing that the game provides and that will be over in less than 6 hours, depending on how much time you take to solve each puzzle, and even though the game has collectibles you can find those easily in your first playthrough if you just look around, so unless you wanna replay the game a few weeks after just to relive the awesomeness, there isn't anything else to keep you around.Rating: 4VerdictContrast is one of the best experiences you can have this year, not only because it is unique, but because it works wonders, providing some great puzzles, amazing exploration and a story worth hearing, unfortunately that will only last a few hours, so if you were looking for something to keep you around your PS4 a lot more, this will come as a disappointment, but either way Contrast is a game worth playing at some point, even if it isn't your priority for the new console.Rating: 8.2Check out the full review and a lot more about Contrast at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=330 "

												    This game was nice , but sadly a bit disappointing. When you see the trailers and read about it your in awe of an act where you can influence the stage. An act by the great Vincenzo, a casted illusion of a large scape platform game. The game is horridly too linear, pretty straight foward you just need like 4 lumis and the game progresses for a short time before suddenly coming to the ending. I was saddened as I was expecting more depth, more platforms and more plot. The game is visually appealing and did have an amazing idea,just failed to execute on it unfortunately. If your looking for a good long enjoyable game I would reconmend not buying, its not even worth its discounted price(and I bought the Collector Edition). I do hope the designers of this game understand the meaning of platformers,2d/3d, story and the most important thing gameplay, not Ideas cause thats all I saw and it went to waste along with my money.Good story and graphics though.

												Contrast is a story driven puzzle-platformer game with interesting light mechanics where you manipulate shadows to create a path. Platforming is not very challenging so it feels more like eye-candy game with some casual puzzles .There are some minor issues with gameplay and infrequent glitches like getting stack but overall Contrast left a positive impression because it is such a beautiful game I am completely in love with the surreal artstyle and overall design of the stages . Enviroments are very exaggerated so it looks like you playing inside a dream or fantasy painting . The lack of characters is probably a budget problem but in a way it complements gloomy atmopshere that I very much enjoy .The story at first seems very down to earth but the ending kinda puzzled me in a good way . You actually use cutscenes as a platforming objects which is a cool way to tell a story .Despite the wird nature of this game it is not a hard game to play . Perhaps it depends on a person but I had no problems getting in and out of shadows when It was needed . There were few moments where it was a bit junky and I plummeted to my death but check points are very close so it was not a big issue .Perhaps my only serious problem with the game is the lack of music during puzzle sections . Contrast has some good music but it goes silent during most areas where you stay for 10-20 minutes . Maybe it is a design choice but I really hate doing puzzles with nothing playing in the background .I beat this game just under 4 hours but the quality of the stages justifies relatively short game . Also I will play it at least one more time just to collect all the clues but replay value is only held by the artsyle .Verdict 8/10 . Not every platforming game needs to be hard or complex . Contrast was relaxing and enjoyable experiance even if gameplay felt slightly lacking  . It may feel a bit empty when there is no music during puzzles . However overall Contrast's artistic vision and compelling story telling was worth my time .			"

												Disclaimer: I have mostly good things to say about Contrast, but the lack of polish on this game makes it so I simply cannot recommend it, no matter how much I wish I could. A post-release patch could easily fix all the issues I describe below, but two years after release and these are still problems; hence, thumbs down, albeit reluctantly. I was tempted to grab this game when it was first released, but I'm glad I waited. I completed the game in about 3.5 hours, so do the math and figure out what amount of money you'd be willing to pay. I would instead recommend a game like Papo & Yo, which also centers around a child with family issues and is of similar length with equally unique but different qualities. So, without further ado:Contrast is a platformer where you shift between the 3D ""real world"" and the 2D ""shadow world"" to solve puzzles. The controls are clunky/sloppy and you cannot remap your keys. This game was released in 2013 and the player can't remap keybinds? Hell, keybind remapping should be required; it's nearly an industry standard, and Contrast loses big points for lacking this ""feature."" This issue, combined with the dreadful controls, made it extremely frustrating at times. Near the end of the game, I died about a dozen consecutive times trying to jump a small gap. Was it my fault? I can't imagine so. I was very close to rage-quitting, but I knew I was in the home stretch. Fortunately, dying is pretty painless in Contrast, as you just respawn at some predetermined location in the game-world, and quickly at that... but even then, the developers barely put any thought into it. Sometimes to complete a puzzle it's easier to just jump into a pit than go back the way you came! I felt like I cheated during a few portions of the game, but considering how frustrated I was with the game by those points, I didn't mind. Ugh.By Act III I just wanted to get it over with... but not because I didn't enjoy the characters, visuals, style, noire atmosphere, or music, all of which are excellent (especially the songs performed by Laura Ellis on vocals!). The story is good as well, but nothing to rave about. Gameplay just became a chore, partially because there's zero hand-holding in the game. Now, I'm not saying I needed hints to complete the puzzles; honestly, they're all pretty easy. But near the end of the game, I assumed the puzzle I was completing had to be much harder than it really was... so I spent about 15 minutes trying to move spotlights to solve this imagined quandry when all I actually had to do was jump up a ledge I didn't know I could jump up. Oh, and one time I screwed up a puzzle and had to restart from my last save... but since you can't save manually and the game doesn't tell you when it auto-saves, it made me replay a chunk of the game. Sigh. Come on.One final nit-pick that really irks me: in Act II of III, there's a carosel puzzle, and once you complete it you can retrieve an item on top of the building... but if you don't grab the item when you're up there, you cannot go back and retrieve it, ever. I realize it's a small issue, but man... combining that with the lack of remapping and no real saving function and it's just too much. The developers could have created a wonderful experience for the player, but with the previous issues and the awful controls, Contrast is simply a shadow of what it could have been....get it?			"

												Pros: -Dawn's powers and design are pretty cool-Hidden Tardis-Going from 2d to 3d is a really cool concept-Parts of environments are destroyed and look surreal, but gorgeous.-The game is pretty short.Cons:-Didi is annoying-Almost every mission is about helping Didi's dad (also she has to have the worst parents in the world)-There's not really a plot. You help Didi and her parents with a bunch of stuff, but then it just kind of ends with a ""twist"".-Dawn's powers and what happened to her are somewhat explained, but not directly.-The game seems too short for 14.99Bottom line: If you care about story, don't get it. If you like platformers...or kids, go ahead and get it. I would strongly suggest buying it when it's on sale. There are other games for 14.99 or less that will give you hours of playability. This is not one of them. Some day I will replay this game to get all the achievements and the collectibles (i missed 1), but I won't anytime soon because I found myself angry and frustrated at the end of the game with the story and everything involving Didi, her parents, and the magician. I cannot express how disappointed I was after beating this game when it looks so good.			"

												The visual design is gorgeous, and the music is delightful, but the game play is needlessly touchy and too often tedious. To make it worse, the story is spotty in presentation and spends all its time on the least interesting parts of the ideas presented. Buy it only if it's on sale and you're a huge fan of the period setting. Even then, lower your expectations.			"

												Pros: -Dawn's powers and design are pretty cool-Hidden Tardis-Going from 2d to 3d is a really cool concept-Parts of environments are destroyed and look surreal, but gorgeous.-The game is pretty short.Cons:-Didi is annoying-Almost every mission is about helping Didi's dad (also she has to have the worst parents in the world)-There's not really a plot. You help Didi and her parents with a bunch of stuff, but then it just kind of ends with a ""twist"".-Dawn's powers and what happened to her are somewhat explained, but not directly.-The game seems too short for 14.99Bottom line: If you care about story, don't get it. If you like platformers...or kids, go ahead and get it. I would strongly suggest buying it when it's on sale. There are other games for 14.99 or less that will give you hours of playability. This is not one of them. Some day I will replay this game to get all the achievements and the collectibles (i missed 1), but I won't anytime soon because I found myself angry and frustrated at the end of the game with the story and everything involving Didi, her parents, and the magician. I cannot express how disappointed I was after beating this game when it looks so good.			"

												This game had a great concept and story, but the horrible gameplay ruins the experience. The ""interaction"" is buggy as hell, and the screwy third-person view isn't particularly helpful either. My field of view actually clipped outside the wall in the wall at the start of the game because the room is way too small for such a zoomed-out camera.Also, the game has random lag spikes at the worst possible times, and the graphics settings are extremely lacking in customizability. I could not get past a certain point in the game because it lagged literally EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME that I tried to make a certain jump, and so I couldn't switch back to shadow mode in time, and fell to my death. Repeatedly, until I eventually gave up.Also, the girl's dialouge is really really annoying and adds almost nothing to the story, especially when she keeps telling you the same lines over and over again. Honestly, this game was vastly diappointing and I very much regret buying it.The really sad thing, though, is not my wasted money but wasted potential. This game could have been SO much better, but as I've said, it wasn't very good at all.			"

												'Contrast' has you phasing in and out of shadows to complete puzzles, whilst following a little girl who is trying to fix her parent's troubled lives.Phasing in and out of shadows is a nice concept, but here it's poorly executed. I felt I was fighting against the controls the whole game. Often I'd complete a puzzle unsure of whether I'd done so legitimately, or by glitchi-jumping throgh an obstacle. Other times, puzzle solutions were obvious - but had to be repeated several times because the shadow phasing is so tempremental. It's also occasionally unclear what the objectives are until you stumble upon them.The art direction is good, the voice acting is great. The plot was somewhat dragged out, but enough to hold my interest. There was clearly vision here. It's a real shame most of the play time is spent beating your head against unpolished controls.			"

												I'm glad I didn't buy it at its full price, because even though there IS GOOD in it, the good is not enough to justify the cost.The concept is stunning, great atmosphere, the soundrack makes me wanna drink tea while smoking my pipe wearing an early 20's nightgown and the shadow/real world switching is such a cool idea. Also, I'm in love with Dawn even thought not much is said about her. BUT (and here comes the ugly part) how could they develop her character when they couldn't even properly tell the whole game story? Let me be clear: the story has a beginning and an ending (which I adore because I hate when they leave you puzzled) but it's told in such a rush you won't really find yourself connected with anyone. This game is short (or better: it would be but as I'm gonna explain next, it will gain longevity thanks to all the times you're gonna uncontrollably fail).There is something really wrong with the controls, I played with a controller and Dawn's movements were very uncomfortable. I tried using mouse and keyboard and it was kinda better but still, weird physics. It's not very reactive and considering you have to jump a lot and switch while rushing and jumping, that's a big no no for me. It got on my nerves, I fell so many times and had to run back and forth so much that I almost threw away the controller.Gotta be honest, I insulted Dawn so much that if she were real, she would have come find me and punch me.

												After beating the game, I can say that I don't find the game fun. Sure, the visuals are beautiful and the music is good. The morphing into shadows is a cool game mechanic  however too many times in the game is it easy to slip out of the shadows or something will knock you off. Sometimes jumping on to platform becomes tedious work, you end up concentrating on to getting on to one platform so much it takes away from the beauty of the game and its concept. I find myself fustrated  more often then not, and when I'm not I am a little bored. Plus after a while I did get annoyed that the child was consistently bossing me around. SPOILERS DOWN BELOWAs for the story, it's hardly there. So you're Dawn (the tall shadow girl) who is the companion of Didi (little girl) for whatever reason Didi and you are friends, or at least Dawn feels a sense of responsiblity towards Didi for unknown reasons. You sneak out at night to see her mother perform in Act 1. In Act II, it concentrates on helping Didi's father figure because its clear he owes the mob money and he is using a broken cicrus to get money to pay them back. Then in Act III, Didi's biological father is performing at the circus and Didi ends up following him to his workshop in hopes for some connection. Then in the final act you have to turn on the lighthouse to light up the stage where the biological father is performing. Then in the ending there's this big happy dysfunctional family scene where mother takes father figure back meanwhile biological father offers Didi a chance for them to connect too as family. Keep in mind through out the whole game Didi and Dawn are the only 3d people everyone else is a shadow on the wall. The biological dad morphs into a real person and places his hand on Didi's shoulder, she gasps exclaiming she thought Dawn was the only one capable of that. The last scene is the biological father thanking you (Dawn) for taking care of Didi.Prior to this point if you were looking through the collectables, its set up to make you think Didi is mentally ill and that we are playing as some imaginary friend or demon/fairy. So its an interesting twist because it does change your perspective on what the story is. Because we are never really given the whole story most of it is for the player to piece together and make decisions. And in the end, you don't know who Dawn is as a character, or whiy she has a relationship with Didi, you don't know why the biological father can morph in and out of shadows or while he knows Dawn, the question of why is everyone a shadow expect for Did is never really answered.There is one collectable that is a old time picture of Didi being a shadow on a street of real people, which could suggest she's the true shadow person but then it goes into hay wire with what occurs in the game.If you still want to play after reading this be my guest, I just feel that the take away from the game wasn't impactful enough to make my eariler fustrations worth the trouble.

												I was very disappointed with this game. I wouldn't say it's bad, but pretty much everything felt underwhelming or out of place. You would think that in a puzzle platformer the platforming would be really fleshed out and feel good, but in reality it's super clunky. Even the 2d bits once you enter the shadows feel bad and bugy. The dashing ability makes no sense. Why would the players character be able to do that. Maybe if it was just for platforming and mobility, but you are braking fences with that ability. It's just silly. Same goes for the players ability to carry big boxes like they are made of cardboard. As game mechanics they are fine, but they don't feel right in the games world.Considering the length of the game I think it could have benefited form just flushing out the basic platforming and shadow stuff and leaving out all the other tiny mechanics. In my mind having a solid platformer with a shadow gimmick would be much better,  than a clunky platformer with a bunch of flimsy mechanics that are used only handful of moments in the game. Moving objects to manipulate shadows was very interesting, but again, it was used only two times in the game and wasn't all that sophisticated. It would be so cool if the game had a bigger emphasis on this aspect. The story is nothing special either. It's very simplistic. I really didn't care about it. It was frustrating that the mystery of why only the players character and Didi have physical bodies is addressed only at the very end of the game. The only positive aspect of the game is its aesthetic. The Art Deco/cabaret stile is relay cool. And some of the level design visually is very interesting. Though I was a bit disappointed that in a game about shadows the shadows them selves ware a bit ugly at places. In conclusion - get it on sale if the screenshots look really tempting to you, but stay away if you want super tight gameplay.			"

												A game built around a couple good ideas--setting, shadow mechanics--and not much else.The gameplay the entire scenario is built upon can, more than anything else, be described as simply glitchy. It bugs out constantly, leading to unfair deaths or do-overs. Some puzzles, like Vincenzo's workshop, are absolutely agonizing because of this.The setting is nothing more than an idea: Cabaret. That's it. Nothing more.The developers seemed to have desperately built everything in this game on those two ideas, turning them into nothing more than gimmicks. The story is nonsense--a mash-up of heart-felt cliches and sexist family drama the player will not care about, with random (--wrong--) references to Einstein and generic ideas of science floating in the background. I guess it's meant to add depth to the universe they're creating, but it doesn't help when a handful of the world-building collectables are called nothing more than ""Science Drawing"" and are literally just nonsense symbols and images.The story also just gets in the way: I can't count the number of times I'd move a few feet and have control taken away from me, so the camera can do a stilted, early PS2-era swoop over the surroundings, complete with lots of janky start-stop moments. Speaking of, the controls--movement and camera--also feel like the platformers (e.g., MDK 2) of the early '00s.Whatever. Everything wrong with this game comes from its creation. It's clear the general ideas of the shadow mechanic and gimmicky cabaret setting were steps 1-10, and everything else was an afterthought.			"

PLAY Contrast? MAYBE. The world, characters, and story may intrigue you, but game mechanics drove me nuts.Pros+Unique, and smooth art style+Jazzy, 1920s art direction+Adorable (though, somewhat too talkative) child main character+Good Soundtrack+References to games and movies+Adult ""Inside"" jokes+2560x1080 Resolution Option (Fits Ultra-Wide Monitors) fineMids=Unique shadow platforming mechanic that becomes fustrating=Potentially interesting storyCons-Parts of level gemotry where you can get stuck-Major crashes-Terrible Checkpoint system that eventually made me stop playingOverviewContrast appears to be a fairly cute story about a daughter born out of wedlock that can speak with a potentially imaginary acrobat, controled by the player that can phase out of reality and into the shadows to platform across the world. There is something else going on in the world than just convienent lighting, as other humans are invisible except for their shadows, only Dororthy can recognize the acrobat and their are strange anomalies in the world, such as a giant chasm of space seperating a road to a town cinema. Unfortunately, I didn't get far enough to see the end as I grew fustrated with the gameplay - so I will probably watch a playthrough. Thankfully, this game is nowhere near as pretentious as Papo y Yo.FrustrationsThis is a floaty platformer, much like Trine or Limbo, though there were many times I either missed jumps or fell during platforming because the ""Rush"" move didn't work or over shot my jump. The game gives an impression of a simple indie platformer, and for the most part it is, but there were so many instant-death moments in the game that wore thin after the 20th time. I got to a point where I had to save ""Fred the Knight"" in a ""shadow story telling"" sequence and the game straight up crashed when the dragon's fire hit Fred. I'm not sure if it was supposed to Kill Fred or activate some sequence or cutscene, but the game immediately locked up my PC for a solid 15 seconds (I was sure to need a Hard reboot soon), then Windows came back up and shown that I was disconnected from Steam. Again, I don't know if that disconnect triggered some sort of glitch (maybe it was about to register an achievement, but I was offline and the game crashed),  but thanks to the irritating checkpoint system, the game took me back to the start of the level, requiring me to walk all the way back to the area and replay the entire sequence again. Mind you, there were two other story telling sequences I had to complete before then. Plus, earlier in the game, I got stuck in level geometry and had to restart from my last save. To my surprise, it damn near restarted the whole level and lost all my progress in the part of the circus that I was trying to repair. The death at the dragon was the final straw for me and I lost all interest in playing this. ConclusionI'm sure other, less demanding gamers can get enjoyment out of this, and honestly, I want to see more of the story, so I will watch the remainder on Youtube. Unless you absolutely adore what is going on here, I suggest you do the same. Value your time and money. I bought this on a deep discount for $3.74, but I could have done without doing so.			"

Product received for free
												Contrast this is a game platform and puzzles with Noir ambiance. Developed by Compulsion Games and distributed by Focus Home Interactive. This being launched November 15, 2013.The protagonist in the game is called Didi and control her friend Dawn imagine. Maybe count it sounds strange, but although we control another character is that Didi has its story developed throughout the plot.The gameplay takes place across the various puzzles using the special power of his character, through the shadows. Manipulating some objects or even following the right time some shade.In the course there are some collectible items which are varied and the only thing that sets the brightness is involving them, these same collectibles can help better develop the story. There are also lamps which must be found to continue the gameplay in certain parts.Things that caught my attention in particular:- The story can exercise certain weight on the player.- The songs are a special touch, especially those that are accompanied vocally by Laura Ellis, other songs are only instrumental. It is two: Kat's Song and House On Fire.This is a relatively short play, about 3 to 4 hours and may complete the game. His story though short, is really interesting and even shocking addressing family problems. Although I think the game is worth, I must stress that faced many bugs that can yes frustrate me. Things like invisible floor and ghosts areas (appears to be ground, but when he stepped on the character falls and dies) are constant throughout the game, jumping on objects that should not also happen. There are parts in the game that can move forward without following the right goal, not by decision of the player, but recurring errors in the game. Some falls are the checkpoint out of place, even if the fall occurred in the same place, and there times when the game crashed and advanced parts that I had not explored (mainly mean the theatrical part). Finally, there is another bug which I believe to be the most frustrating, I think not received certain achievements in the game even after going through the areas indicated. Finally, despite everything bad that happens can not say I did not like the course of the game, but unfortunately so many problems so make me give negative.Not to be unfair, if not call the various problems you may face, a chance to play and if too frustrating use the refund.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit  steamified [steamified.com].

												This was a game obviously made by art students who were more interested in being artsy than worrying about gameplay. It's a novel concept, but too heavy handed. The cutscenes often take you out of the game when they easily could have been included as part of the game. Multiple elements seem like they were added in after the fact to make the game slightly less tedious, like searching for the collectable lights. I was really wanting to like this game, but it just could not deliver.			"

Except for timing of some jumps, I had no issues with controls. No complaints about camera movement either. Length is perfect (I like short games). Overall, a unique game that’s well worth your time and money. Highly underrated.BTW, the save system is limited to milestones which are quite far apart. This why I just left the game minimized between sessions and the reason for the longer than usual game time. I estimate it was about 4 to 5 hours of actual play.			"

An incredible looking world that brings the 20's jazz/circus noir look into a hibrid dream/imaginary world, a great gaming concept with a lot of potential for fun, compelling and complex puzzle solving and an interesting plot with the potential for plenty of depth, growth and heart breaking/warming scenes was not nearly enough to save this buggy overly simplistic and mindnumbingly dull game.

												To put it simply, Contrast is a game that follows a little girl through her beautiful, broken world.In Contrast we take on the role of Dawn, the imaginary friend of the character Didi- we go on an adventure with this little girl who is trying ever so hard to just put her family back together.Contrast features a wonderful Jazz soundtrack that really brings a lot to the game as a whole. The voice acting is full of emotions in both the English and French translations of the game. The voice acting is well recorded and well cut. 5/5The visuals in Contrast are some of the best to come out of Greenlight. This near unique art style really gives the game some flavor. Contrast has top quality visuals both in it's 3D, and 2D worlds. I have yet to encounter fuzzy or broken models/textures. 5/5The story is brilliant and the execution is just as wonderful. Though many complain that the story is ""too short"" we need to remember that length does not dictate the quality of the story. Contrast's story is about bringing a broken family back together. The story has all elements of a story, a great intro, tense climax, and an interesting conclusion. Watching the world change as the story progresses is simply fantastic. 4.5/5Mechanically, Contrast has a few issues- though the game does contain a brilliant feature where the character has to work through both 2D and 3D worlds, this proves to cause some of the major problems in the game. In the shadow(2D) world, the gameplay is relatively choppy- whether the character will execute commands correctly in this state is hit or miss. We can regularly see the character pop out of the shadow world for no apparent reason what so ever. This is not game breaking, but does cause some frustration when attempting more complex or multi-step puzzles. 3.5/5I believe that this game could also use some optimization with the keyboard/mouse. For me, it was a little tasking making the settings work with my hardware. This has no impact on the final rating.Final rating – 18/20 or 90%   - I would suggest getting this game.			"

												The game's title perfectly encapsulates my play experience, which alternated between delight and frustration. The story follows a young girl named Didi, and so do we. We step into the shoes of a mysterious young woman called Dawn, who assists Didi on her quest to mend her broken home. The story is generally well executed and the art style and music help sell it beautifully. Steeped in early 20th century vaudeville aesthetics, the game's mood is warm and magical, but the over-the-top theatricality often seeps into the dialogue, at times causing it to come of as trite rather than impactful.The main conceit of the game is that Dawn exists in a sort of parallel world, and her only connection to the real world are Didi, who seems to exists in both worlds, and the shadows. Dawn has the ability to literally become a shadow on the wall, and most of the gameplay revolves around using this mechanic to solve puzzles and execute jumping challenges. Shadows are also the only way in which Dawn can see people besides Didi, and the game's most inspired moments combine moments of shadow-puppet storytelling with actual gameplay. Unfortunately, these moments are far and few between, and most of the challenges are fairly mediocre, with the shadow-shift mechanic adding little but a bit of flavor. My biggest disappointment is how often the game interrupts the flow of gameplay with little cutscenes, sometimes wresting away control of your character simply to execute a camera pan and deliver a line from Didi.The game shows great potential, but falls short in execution. Aside from the issues already discussed, there are the occasional technical issues, such as graphical glitches, erratic collision detection and at times wonky controls. A more rigorous synthesis of gameplay and storytelling could have elevated this game out of its mediocrity. However, its charming style and rare moments of inspiration make it worth a look should you find it for cheap (e.g. during on of Steam's many sales).			"

												I was excited about Contrast. When I finally got it during the summer sale, I was happy. I played through it, and I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed. I didn't like how Dawn moved around in 3D mode. It was hard to control her I felt. She almost moved too fluidly. I also didn't care for the story. It was just...strange. Also, this game is way too short! I finished in about 3 hours, but it really felt shorter than that. All of a sudden it was over.Despite all it's negatives, Contrast does have positives. I loved the transitions from 3D to 2D and vice versa. It is done so smoothly, and the platforming was very innovative I thought. I also loved that Didi was the only person besides Dawn in the world. Everyone else appears as shadows. The music and setting are cool as well. Dawn doesn't speak, but Didi does and I found her character kind of annoying. Also, Didi's father is Adam Jensen. I found that distracting. Buy this game if you can find a good sale.Also, no jump scares.			"

												This is one of the most well-imagined games I have ever played. The art style, the concept, the characters, the storyline, the soundtrack; everything is phenomenal. I was drawn in instantly. Unfortunately, I found it a bit difficult to stay immersed at times. The gameplay is quite buggy. I'll admit, it has gotten better than it was the month after release, but I still feel like it could be better. Interacting with items is difficult to initiate and rather imprecise once you do, making some puzzles a bit more difficult, not to mention frustrating, than they otherwise would be. Another minorly infuriating aspect was the save system. You cannot manually save. The game saves automatically after solving certain puzzles or reaching a crucial plot point. The problem is, you never know which puzzles it saves after unless you're paying close attention to the corner of your screen. I was so fed up with having to do certain parts over that I abandoned the game for weeks at a time several times. All of that being said, I still truly enjoyed the game. The positives definitely outweigh the minor glitches and I am recommending this game to everyone. And who knows, they may fix the save system and wonky item interaction at a later point.			"

												A small indie game that is not only great to look at but also being played.It has two unusual leading characters - a young girl accompanied by an adult woman -, is set in a rare environment (France 1920s) and always tries to reward you with a snippet of story after you complete a puzzle. Puzzles get repetitive after a while as in any platformer but it doesn't manage to reach the point it gets bothersome as the game isn't that long, circa 6 hours without chasing collectibles and occasional hiccups. I haven't encountered any bugs (W7, i5-2400, ATI HD 6870 1GB, 8 GB).If you like Braid, chances are you will enjoy Contrast too.			"

												Contrast was an interesting take when it comes to puzzle platformers. It has an emotional tale that may touch some or leave others wondering if it was worth the journey. I am with the latter. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad game, just not my cup of tea. I would still recommend it for those that want a short and sweet experience. From a technical perspective, it kept on crashing on me for some reason, but otherwise it is an okay game.			"

												This game, like any, certainly has its flaws. However, two of these flaws are grand downfalls to the game. It's puzzles are too easy and the game is too short. I beat it in roughly three hours -- and I am the sort to expore EVERY nook and cranny of a game like this, if that tells you anything. Despite all that, if you can wait until this gets extremely cheap during a sale or something, by all means give it a shot. It's a wonderful experience if noir-inspired art, jazz soundtracks, and creative approaches to puzzle platforming are your thing.			"

												Overall Score: 8/10My advice: If you like a good puzzle/story driven game, buy it.Genre: Third person puzzle platformerContrast is a short, sweet, stylized adventure with an intriguing story and a fascinating concept. It only took me about 6 hours to finish the game with all achievements, so don't come looking for an exceptionally long playthrough. The story it tells is worth experiencing nonetheless. The story follows a little girl named Didi and her mysteriously invisible friend Dawn, who you play. The girl's mother is a singer at one of the local clubs, giving Didi a chance to sneak out at night and try to learn more about her father, her family, and ultimately, the origin of Dawn. As Dawn, you have the special ability to enter the walls around you, walking atop shadows to help Didi during her strange and dream-like adventure.As you can imagine, there are quite a few puzzles to keep you occupied, but not as many as I would have liked with such a fascinating concept. The music is fantastic, as is the stylized atmosphere, but what really ties things together are the story. Almost the entire story is told through the shadows and the things people leave behind, and they still manage to craft an interesting arch for it all. If I had to complain, though, harder puzzles would have really made this game a lot more fun, and the occasional frustrating glitches shaved off a point in my book.Still, for this kind of price tag, it's a crime not to pick it up.

												A great platforming\puzzle game for people that are not into such.If I were to categorize players as follows Type1: Rarely plays video games or sticks to Iphone type of games Type 2: A regular video game player, but not into platformers/puzzles Type 3: A regular video game player and is into platformers/puzzle games and type 4: A diehard fan of platform/puzzle games.I would say that Contrast is for the Type 2 player, which is where I classify myself. The graphics and sound are excellent and the story is interesting, but the challenges are not over the top. I play games other than platform/puzzles, like RPGs, survival, action, shooters, etc, but the look and story of Contrast intrigued me so I got it and finished it (only took 3.5 hours) and it was a great experience. The difficulty was right up my alley and I felt good about resolving the puzzles.The voice acting, sound, music,etc are all excellent. I normally detest games with 'collectibles' and will usually ignore such in games, but in Contrast the collectibles were easy to come across and, towards the end, they really open the story and shed some light (pun!) on the background of the character you are playing, Dawn.Overall I would rate this game pretty high, say 8 out of 10. Especially because it is so short, I can see myself playing it again a few months from now.Edited for typoes.			"

												This game is short, painfully so. I say this because it's a great game; you just want it to keep going, but then you beat it, and you just have to play it all over again. It's additing, that much is true. It's got awesome artwork and music, and the story is, well, I don't want to spoil it, but, wow, that's an interesting story to say the least. I will say this about the puzzles, though, for the most part they are easy. Some of them aren't really difficult so much as they are tedious, but as long as you don't lose track of yourself as you're doing them, you won't have too hard a time.I just wish there was more to it; I think I'm going to go play it one more time, or eight.

												The idea is nice but... it quickly turns out that this is not a brain teaser but a horrific jump'n'run in the 2D world. Although for most of the riddles it is easy to figure out what to do one has to play the same sequence over and over again until he gets the correct sequence and timing of buttons to press to accomplish a task.Additionaly the controls are completely messed up (read the forum!). You push the left lever up / the girl runs backwards. Pull it down and it runs forward. The game tells you to push the X-Key but expects the Y Key / same with A- and B- Keys.  Same with the keyboard: Push W to run backward. Unplayable!The Controls are so messed up that you easlily loos all your progress without any warning. No way to select a scene to get close to where you've been. This quickly becomes very frustrating. If your looking for a way to waste your money this game is for you.What a disappointment :( "

												I really want to like this game, believe me, I do.I adore the music and the unique art style and the story is interesting, but the gameplay is so infuriatingly difficult at times that it breaks the immersion and makes me not want to play it. The shadow shift ability is very sensitive. If you run into something, or if you're crushed by something, you'll shift out of the walls and you'll have to try again or you just might die altogether. Not only that, but it's very easy to miss jumps when you're trying to jump over certain gaps (most are easy to scale, but there are a few that are just mind boggling). And there are also some puzzles in which you have to reach a platform in a small amount of time - and those kinds of challenges in games are always maddening. I'll play and I'll be mesmerized by the details and I'll want to find out what happens next in the story but then I reach a roadblock of a challenge and - after being pushed out of the walls, failing to jump over gaps and dying repeatedly - I get increasingly frustrated and then it's not about the story or the gameplay anymore, all the focus has shifted to that one piece that just doesn't seem to give if you don't get it just right. And after all is said and done and I can move on, I just can't relax and enjoy the game anymore and have to shut it off. A game is something that you should be able to enjoy and crave, but if it's frustrating - there's no point in trying; and that's a real shame. It's a good game if you're a big fan of challenging puzzles; but if you're looking for a fun game with a sense of ease and flow, you might want to find something else to try.			"

												Contrast has been one of the best puzzle-platformer games I have played. Love almost everything about it, the music/soundtrack, the ambience, the characters, though there might be a minor glitch in some parts of the game which generally doesn't effect the overall game. The puzzles were somewhat not easy, but not too hard either. It's just right for a guy that has low puzzle-solving skills. Really wish they had extended the story or added more details to some areas of the game but given it was an indie game, I'll pass it. This game is definitely worth to check out.			"

												TL;DR: Check it out.THE GOOD:• Gameplay:  Contrast is a truly unique concept; I can't think of anything that does something similar: shifting from a 3D environment to a 2D one using the shadows on the wall.  Shadows can sometimes be manipulated by moving light sources.  It's neat!• Story:  The story isn't masterfully told, but it is an interesting one, and I'm glad I stuck around to see it through to the end.• Art:  Contrast is beautiful to admire and its music is always a pleasant companion.• It's Indie!:  Support your local indie game developer!  Especially when they're doing awesome work like this!THE BAD:• Game Feel:  As cool as traversing the shadows as a platformer is, Contrast has a tendency to be real finicky.  On some puzzles, I would get so frustrated falling out of the shadows, I would question if I was performing the task correctly; in every case, I was.  It becomes easy to slip out from the 2D world and fall to your death, and not even be sure why it happened.  I managed to finish every puzzle, but I would have had a lot more fun if the mechanics had been fine-tuned a bit more.• Acting:  The voice acting could've been a little more convincing, but--  Ehh! What'r'ya gonna do?			"

												Contrast (video game) is a noir atmospheric puzzler set it in the 1920's. You play as Dawn, the imaginary friend to Didi, a 9 year old girl who's step father is trying to put together a circus. Throughout the game, you must help Didi help her father put on a good show.You morph in and out of the 3D world and 2D world of shadows, helping Didi by solving various puzzles. The gameplay was okay, there is a little bit of weirdness with the camera, but it wasn't too bad. It's a lot of parkour but the puzzles were pretty simple. The majority of what makes this game so good are the music, art and it's story. If anything, it's what makes the game worthwhile. Should be a quick and easy finish and will make for a good afternoon session.			"

I realized the game was not super well made when within the first 5 minutes of gameplay Didi, the only NPC you can really see, stopped using her walking cycles and just started appearing in random spots. I fell through solid platforms, jumped inconsistenly, and generally just clunked around.I'm disappointed because this could have been a really, really fun game, but it just left me feeling annoyed and ready for it to be over.

												Contrast is one hell of a buggy game but what I got out of it was something more. I was frustrated all the time when I played Contrast. I was always stuck in walls, lost in the geometry, and always felt out of control when I played. That being said, all of the bugs felt, necessary. The aesthetics of Contrast matched with the tone of the story and one's loss of innocence felt surreal. Playing as Dawn, who is thought to be Didi's, the girl who follows you on your journey, imaginary friend, the deconstruction of the world in what seemed like a total destruction of reality made sense. By the story's end, I cared about the cast and about Didi, no matter how annoying I saw her. As Dawn, I felt responsible for her sanity, trying to keep her whole in a world that doesn't seem right. Even with confusing puzzles and weird design choices, I had to finish this from beginning to end.Like, this isn't a Gone Home or a Proteus type of game in quality of build, but it felt right because of it. I wouldn't really recommend this game for the full price but this is definitely a game I would recommend on a sale. It isn't a tear jerker but its premise was so thought-provoking and engrossing that I felt like I got hit with a brick by the end of the game.  "

												A nice concept completely ruined by a poor and rushed development. Not only this game is tremendously short (4 hours to get 100% completion, including replaying a chapter to get a thing I missed!), it's also full of glitches and the so called ""secrets"" are ridiculously easy to find. Moreover, the plot is undermined by a fragmented exposition which is just too rushed and specious to make sense like it should and ends abruptly leaving little to nothing to the player.There were many good ideas at the base of this title and It's pretty clear that the developers had issues in the making of it, but even considering that and making an effort to appreciate its aesthetics it's nearly impossible to recommend Contrast to anyone. Not even at a sale price.			"

												From what little I played of Contrast I think it is rather nice. I like the style and the way Didi is 3D while her parents are 2D. My theory is this is actually Vaudeville-ception and the game is set in Didi's mind. didi's voice does grate and I VERY RARELY found the puzzles difficult but most of the time you can breeze through. But it still feels satisfying. Overall a very good game.			"

												I really want to like this game, believe me, I do.I adore the music and the unique art style and the story is interesting, but the gameplay is so infuriatingly difficult at times that it breaks the immersion and makes me not want to play it. The shadow shift ability is very sensitive. If you run into something, or if you're crushed by something, you'll shift out of the walls and you'll have to try again or you just might die altogether. Not only that, but it's very easy to miss jumps when you're trying to jump over certain gaps (most are easy to scale, but there are a few that are just mind boggling). And there are also some puzzles in which you have to reach a platform in a small amount of time - and those kinds of challenges in games are always maddening. I'll play and I'll be mesmerized by the details and I'll want to find out what happens next in the story but then I reach a roadblock of a challenge and - after being pushed out of the walls, failing to jump over gaps and dying repeatedly - I get increasingly frustrated and then it's not about the story or the gameplay anymore, all the focus has shifted to that one piece that just doesn't seem to give if you don't get it just right. And after all is said and done and I can move on, I just can't relax and enjoy the game anymore and have to shut it off. A game is something that you should be able to enjoy and crave, but if it's frustrating - there's no point in trying; and that's a real shame. It's a good game if you're a big fan of challenging puzzles; but if you're looking for a fun game with a sense of ease and flow, you might want to find something else to try.			"

												As someone who followed the development of Contrast with much anticipation, going as far as preordering it on steam, it pains me to say that the game is not good. What looked like a fascinating premise in a fantasical world intermixed with an amazing sound selection turned out to be only one of those things. Being a shadow becomes very boring very quickly, as the puzzles all end up revolving around a convulted system of controls that will leave you very very frustrasted. You will be afraid to enter walls. You will be afraid of messing up a button press. And you will be very afraid when you realize this puzzle will just continue to drag on with more complicated situations that faulty controls will only make worst. The only puzzle game I can think of right now that followed the same tune as Contrast is Braid, and by Jove does Braid make this game look like a joke. In Braid you can rely on your platforming abilities to carry you through a series of increasing difficult puzzles, which will truly reward the player for their abilities to think intuitively as well as perform proper platforming practices. In Contrast, you will struggle about a world with frustrating controls, little variation in puzzles, and little reward from solving the them. Little reward as in you will not care at all about the story because your willful suspension of disbelief will begin right at the start. The game takes place in France, and it makes a point to say so. What it doesn't explain, unless I understood world history entirely incorrectly, is that the world is floating in a vacuum of space. No explanation ever. No explanation as to why Didi, the girl you are escorting most of the game, sees the pit once but never comments on it again, as well as no one else commenting on it. Hell, in my opinion, the characters stopping to talk about the fact they live in a void would be more interesting than any plot point presented in this game. The story is weak, from the first moment of blackmail to the ending scene. The ending won't make you feel anything. You will be annoyed by Didi. You will hate every character that pops their ugly mug in this game. So what do you have so far? A messy universe with messy controls, a cast of completely unlikable characters, a character that is a young annoying child most of the game (Trust me, Didi is no Clementine, and you will go back to hating video game children after playing this,) in a story that is riddled in plot holes and does nothing to keep you interested in it. Oh, but the music is pretty at parts. I think I heard some of it over my continued groans over having to do another jump dash puzzle that would randomly throw me out of the wall to my death. Do yourself a favor, and skip out on this one.			"

												The game is supposedly worth it for it's story, but it's very clear how the developers try to get away with an extremly simple and eventless plot, in which practically nothing happens at all, and is only partially gullible due to it's heavily dramatic scenes - which doesn't make those less cliché; we've seen it all before. Considering this oversimplistic story, the game is overall boring, due to extremly easy and unchallenging puzzles. The gameplay time is barelly 5 hours long, but at least for me, that was mostly due to a very glitchy scenario and overall irresponse controls. I wouldn't say it's horrible, but that's only because of its lovely art direction and sublime soundtrack.			"

												Some nice ideas and visuals, but there's really not much to it. The game is quite short which is fine, but for a puzzle platformer there are very few actual puzzle/platform sections. And some of these can be more frustrating than fun due to clumsy controls, poor guidance, or just long waits for cut scenes (especially in the shadow puppet/princess part).Although the game world looks quite nice it feels very empty (although maybe this is the point) and you have some freedom to wander around but there is nothing to do or see until you are forced to go to that area later in the game.While not a bad game per se, unless you are looking for a short indie platformer reminiscent of American McGee's Alice with an interesting mechanic poorly executed, I found it to be dull and tedious and you are better looking elsewhere.There are far more enjoyable indie puzzle-platformers out there worth spending your money. See Two Brothers, Deadlight, Trine, Braid, Limbo, Thomas was Alone, etc...			"

												Maybe I'm just too quick to be critical of games, but sometimes you have to be in a world with hundreds of thousands of video games and lots of Triple A titles.For me, Contrast is the type of game that delivers a game mechanic that promises to be innovative and amazing, but fails to really deliver where it matters - namely, being able to use shadows as though they were tangible things. You start off as an unnamed woman walking around in a little girl's bedroom, and it is quickly conveyed that all living creatures (with the exception of one special little girl) appear only as shadows and you are invisible to one-another.Unfortunately, after establishing that you are this little girl's friend (by way of picking up a drawing she made with you in it), that's all the reason you are given to follow her off on a boring adventure of interacting with objects, collecting objects, and being pestered to do things and go places in order to watch cutscenes. It really feels like it's being forced upon me when I don't even want to follow this little stranger and watch her parents fight; I want to explore the world and be given my own reason for doing things instead - not because a child tells me to.So that was storytelling ruined within the first 5 minutes.Then there was the shadow mechanic - it seems cool in theory, but you end up using it to do very rudimentary platforming straight off the bat. Exciting stuff. Maybe throwing a few shadow balls would be nice, or knocking over a bottle, or knocking over a bottle's shadow using a ball's shadow! The first few minutes are where you really have to give OOMPH to this new mechanic, and sadly it's used only to run up shadow ramps (some of which are inaccessible until you have tagged along with your new friend so she can push a simple object for you and progress the story). Again - I'm feeling like this is off to a bad start. I hear the game eventually progresses to pushing boxes around, but manipulating an object to reach a high place is hardly an innovative improvement.And finally there's my last gripe - atmosphere. At one point within the first 5 minutes you also walk into a cabaret restaurant which is completely devoid of people and life. ""BUT WAIT,"" you say, ""people are invisible and appear as shadows!"" Well yes, this is true, but there is nothing to make this restaurant feel LIVELY. There are glasses of alcohol on tables and cigars smouldering away in ashtrays, and there is ambient audience music playing, but there is nothing to make it feel ALIVE. No swaying and sliding of chairs, no sloshing of alcohol, no strange poltergeist-esque atmosphere replete with drinks trays floating around the room; bartenders shaking tumblers and pouring them out, no cats in alleyways knocking over trashcans and yowling, certain conversations that dim and fall as you wander the room - there is nothing - and that is where this game really falls flat on its face. You walk into a dead room and your only objective is to interact with the flashing objects scattered around the room so you can progress the plot because an invisible woman keeps nagging you to turn on the lights.I'm sorry, I wanted to like this game, but it took 5 minutes to convince me that I hated it - all because there was nothing to try and persuade me into staying a while, looking around and really enjoying myself.Maybe somebody somewhere else will do it better one day - because this game isn't there by a long shot.

												The gameplay should have been kept in ""2D"" (wrapping around the walls, but 2D control wise). Instead, it tries to keep you in 3D (without the shadow puppet stuff) most of the time.The intriguing part of the game, using the shadows to move around, seemed like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the main part of the gameplay seems to consist of moving lights or boxes to create those shadows where you want (without much in the way of real solving). The actual platforming across them, is only difficult by it being nearly broken. A lot of the time, I wasn't sure if I had glitched my way through, or solved the ""puzzle"". Really, the only puzzle is that you have to place the box so that it's shadow forms a super easy platform jump. This is made harder because the ""targetting"" system makes it hard to actual lock onto the object you want to carry. When there is any actual puzzle that isn't an immediate solve, it's only really difficult because of the trial and error of moving the light as well as shadow generators. But there isn't really any lateral thinking about it, just move a few things around.The platforming, as a I mentioned is nearly trivial, made difficult only by the 3D controls being near broken, and the 2D having awkward physics (made worse by the fact that modern analog controls don't adapt well to it).When not in the shadows (which is most of the game) it is all the broken camera and awkward controls (made worse when the camera suddenly changes the perspective forcing a control direction correction) of poor late 90's platformers. You are always wasting time either because the controls messed you up and you need to recover, or because you need to keep running back to the objects to manipulate into position yet again. It is a shame, because the moments when you are using shadows made by things other than your own dragging boxes around (such as a sequence early on where characters are having an animated conversation, movbing their limbs all over the place), it is a hell of a lot of fun. If the game had been entirely this, moving from shadow to shadow as the scene plays out around you, I would have really enjoyed it.			"

												Contrast is a great idea that is never expanded to the fullest. The aesthetics are delightful, the puzzles are challenging and fair, but the game is far too short unless you're going for every last little objective. It's an engrossing story for what little there is. I really wish I could recommend this, but this game only lasted me a mere 3 hours in total. This game needs some DLC missions or some other expansion. It's too clever and beautiful to leave things as they are.			"

Moreover, the plot is undermined by a fragmented exposition which is just too rushed and specious to make sense like it should and ends abruptly leaving little to nothing to the player.There were many good ideas at the base of this title and It's pretty clear that the developers had issues in the making of it, but even considering that and making an effort to appreciate its aesthetics it's nearly impossible to recommend Contrast to anyone.

												This is the second worst kind of indie game.The worst kind being cheap ripoffs of whatever's popular right now (see: zombies, survival, crafting).This however is an overly artsy fartsy platformer with one single original idea - which cannot carry a game by itself.In the first hour or act you gain no understanding of your agency or place in the world and you begin to realize that you never will. The game just is way too much in love with its imaginary-friend-perspective of storytelling.And what do you do? Follow a linear corridor of boring puzzles. Yes the shadow walking gimmik makes them orignal, but the shallow world, fixed camera (starting in act2!), and dodgy controls really remove all joy that might have been had here.Oh and the ""Soundtrack"" are 15 tracks that amount to 20 minutes of samey music - and it's not even in FLAC format.Not even worth 5 bucks.

												This game is,in concept,a good idea. I was into it until I slowly discovered that the game mechanics are all over the place, some puzzles are made impossible by irritating bugs and the plot looks like it wants to be a complex and well-written story ,while it's mostly just there to indicate the next tasks to perform while feeding you exposition. It's cute. for sure. But things like the multiple cut scenes happening every five minutes as well as the fact that your character is devoid of all personality makes it so alienating as a player. I wish I could love this game. But it  feel like a pg-13 imitation of a darker and better game . Plus the environments are really naked, especially since your character can only see people's shadows. makes the whole game look like a ghost town, but probably not in the way they intended it to. there are very few obejcts that are lying around indoors to indicate the presence of a crowd. very little ambiance.I'm sorry for being so harsh.

												I have mixed feelings about this game.  While the concept is quite intriguing and I've never played another game like it, the shadow mechanics are rather sloppy and it's very short, taking place over 3 hour-long acts give or take depending on how fast you solve the puzzles.The game's main mechanic allows your character to become a shadow on any wall where bright light is projected.  In this form, other shadows become your platforms and obstacles and you have to manipulate and navigate them in order to solve puzzles.  It's a very cool concept for unfortunately not implemented all that well.  I found myself frequently popping out of shadow mode because I'd touched a small feature on the wall even though that didn't interrupt the shadows I was walking on and occasionally without any noticable cause.  Traversing moving shadows can be a bit problematic as well.The game looks pretty good and runs well, utilizing the popular Unreal engine.  The writing and voice acting are surprisingly high quality and tell the story well, accompanied by collectible items which you really need to take a look at to get the whole story.  Luckily most of them are in plain sight.The real disappointment of the game is its length.  I finished the game in one sitting and I want more, hopefully with fewer glitches in shadow mode.  I want it to be a full length game like Portal 2 with more difficult puzzles and more game mechanics.  Here's hoping for Contrast 2.While the game has its problems, I quite enjoyed it and am recommending it to others.  Just don't go into it expecting a difficult or lengthy game.			"

												The word ""contrast"" is quite distinct, when I hear the word I imagine spectacular colour palettes of vividly juxtaposed hues and shades. Unfortunately, the type of Contrast presented here appears to have rewritten the definition to fit its drab and dreary canvas. As if someone took the worst parts of the Psychonauts and completely desaturated the visuals, turning bleak a very uniquely bright and eclectic art style.Contrast is filled with wasted potential and, from the get go, riddled with visual and mechanical glitches. The shadow mechanics are often inconsistent and ham-fisted, causing many a sigh of frustration. If I fail to react accordingly I will often be forced to sit through the same piece of dialogue, waiting for that small window of opportunity to open, only to be forced out of the shadows because I gently touched the wrong thing at the wrong time. I feel my character is too large and agile for such a small set piece, it becomes quite claustrophobic at times.My main issue isn't the poorly implemented mechanics, but the lack of care I have for the characters within the story and the absence of any exposition that isn't told through the numerous collectibles found in the game. Thankfully Contrast is a very short game as it starts to overstay its welcome by the middle of the second chapter. How many puzzles must be solved by standing on the head of a person's shadow? I'd lost count.			"

												This is an amazing and short game!I absolutley love the story and the Characters!Controlls are easy to use and Graphics are amazing, its a very nice game and I can recommend it for anybody! But you should get it when it is on Sale. I completed the Story in 3.5 hours and therefor its a bit overpriced!I hope there will be more games like this or even a second part as its ending leaves some questions open.			"

												When I first heard about Contrast I immediately remembered the old PC platformers with gorgeous graphics. I then pre-ordered the game to get my hands on the illustrations and art that inspired the game. I couldn't wait to play the game.Disappointment is the word to describe what came when I finally got the chance. You play as a shadow character for a good part of the game and the graphics of the shadow-world are really unpolished to say the least.There are some annoying bugs on the puzzles that hinder playability and kill the atmosphere of the game.I don't know the studio behind Contrast but the game seems the result of amateur work and is miles away from other good platformers available on Steam.

But after having to basically restart the same bloody level for falling out of shadow at a moment where I was encountering no shadow obstacle whatsoever, I decided that enough is enough, and that a messed up gameplay that goes in the way of fun is not worth my time.

												This is a very pretty game, with a great atmosphere, strong gameplay that has very few flaws. Sadly the game falls short on story and character development, as well as length. There are really only about 3 big areas to explore, and although the puzzles in those areas are fun you feel you want MORE.  The music is also very good.If you are okay with the fact that Dawn never talks and most of the plot mysteries are barely hit upoun and never even partly explained, and all you want his is eye candy with decent gameplay, then this game is worth buying at this price (14.99)If you want more but are still interested, I would wait until the price drops by half at least. I don't know the reason why they took out the original murder plot and dective Dawn helping Didi solve the murder and save her mother/family, but what they but in place of that plot is pretty much junk. The gameplay time you will get out of game is 4 hours. But seasoned platformer gamers will likely get even less.			"

												If you are into Jazz, Contrast is worth playing just for the sake of the soundtrack.If the premise of a bluesy, gloomy, artsy, early 1900's Paris atmosphere - which this game reflects brilliantly - doesn't particularly appeal to you, you might want to think twice.Contrast's gameplay is entirely based around blending 2D and 3D, a good idea; fits well with the semi-magical atmosphere, but unfortunately doesn't feel like it's been used to the full potential. The biggest challenges lie in the 2D platformers, whilst the 3D part feels underexploited (and the keyboard controls clunky - this was clearly designed for a controller). The 3D world just serves as an aid to model the 2D world, or as a link to reach the next 2D surface. At some moments, you feel like it's almost there and regret what the game could have become if the 2D and 3D had been made to blend in a bit more crazily.Some of the puzzles are brilliant, some of them just about mediocre, but it all ends too soon. The game is extremely short (only 3 levels, count about an hour each). WIth no extra difficulty or challenge, with all collectible lying out in plain sight of the linear path, the replay value relies on just one thing: the really compelling atmosphere, characters, and the excellent voice acting.

												So this game turned out to be quite enjoyable even though it is unfortunately very short. You play Dawn a woman with the power   to shift from the 3D world into the 2D shadow world. Also Dawn can only be seen by her young friend Didi who also happens to be the only person Dawn can see as everyone else can only be seen as a shadow. The game is a pretty decent puzzle platformer, with a mix of 3D platforming and 2D when you shift into the shadows. This mechanic makes for some good puzzle sections as you need to shift in and out of the shadows to complete them. The visual style of the game is great as well with a sort of 30's noir vibe to the world Dawn and Didi inhabit, as well as a decent soundtrack to match.The biggest problem with this game is it's criminally short. I was left wanting more at the end and it really lets the game down.The Good:- intersting mechanic of shifting from 3d to 2d to complete puzzles- this game looks pretty good with a 30's Paris look to it-a good jazzy soundtrack that really adds to the feel of the game.The Bad:- Very short and i was left wanting more-Little replay value Overall this is a pretty good game which i enjoyed but it really is too short to justify paying full price. If it's reduced on offer and you like puzzle platformer pick it up. 6.5/10			"

												I would have to say Contrast is one of my favorite games. The art style, music and time setting are right up my street and the whole game takes place in a slightly surreal 'Alice In Wonderland' style. I'll explain. The world seems to be made of of floating islands floating in a night sky, it looks lovely but detracts the game from normality, that being said playing as an imaginary friend who can jump in and out of shadows ins't exactly normal so this floating island surreal-ness actually adds to the game, pushing it away from normal and closer to dream-like. As I have said the music is also fantastic if you enjoy cabaret style music. There are also some lovely other tracks later in the game, one of my favorite plays during the carousel puzzle. The whole jumping between shadows and normal world is an awesome mechanic. Not exactly new but it is still nicely done and it creates some interesting and genuinely challenging puzzles that stumped me for an embarissingly long time. One thing I will say is that it can be a bit trickey at times. The switching between the shadow and real worlds is tricky especially when jumping. If you don't time it right when jumping you will land half above, half in the shadow which gives you another 50/50 chance of clipping onto the shadow or being forced back into the real world which will probably spawn you into a death pit. After 6 or more times this gets annoying. The run animation is also odd too and the main character moves like she has a rocket attached to her back and strides like the Striders from Half Life 2.Aside from those 2 tiny nit picks the story is good, visuals great and soundtrack fantastic. Pick it up, play it and you'll be glad you did.Check out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Fridayhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg "

												Contrast is the differences seen when two sources of light come together. Similarly, Contrast (the game) blends its ligher and darker tones into a short, immersive experience with differences of quality that feel worthy of the price of admission, yet lacking in other ways. If anything is holding Contrast back from feeling complete, it's not just the gameplay itself but also the technical issues and the final act. This game will ultimately feel like it was two-thirds of the way done but never half-baked. Dancing in the DarkContrast is by no means a difficult game. Your average playthrough, depending on how many collectibles you go for, will take you somewhere from two to four hours.(I would strongly recommend going for the luminaries as they use the shadow-swapping mechanic a lot, which is the main attraction for this game.) Games like these with a narrative focus are fine. Sometimes games with little to no challenge other than my wits are relaxing, which this game never struck me as being overly complicated.However, the inclusion of replay value would have been appreciated as well besides tying up the loose ends of the plot.In Contrast, you play as an imaginary friend of the main character of the story, Didi. As you are a make-believe creation of hers, you are a surreal character to the mature events unfolding around you. This also means you are given supernatural abilities: The ability to swap in and out of shadows and the real world, the acrobatic fitness to traverse the environments, and a few other abilities (a dash mechanic and  the ability to use light orbs). The main focus is always put on the shadow-swap mechanic, which I think is its best quality. You aren't simply finding the well-lit areas to enter and leave new entrances. You are moving light-sources to shape the shadows on the environment, enlargening them and scaling them down, and you sometimes have to use the shadows' terrain to move real objects. Sometimes the technical limitations rear themselves into this mechanic, such as when you are going around corners and you might teleport out of the wall because of not rotating the camera. Or when you enter a wall with the camera on the other side of the wall. For the most part, this mechanic is well-thoughout and only at some parts of the game feels buggy. Unfortunately, the other gameplay aspects either feeled tacked on simply because other platformers have them or they are there because of the game's light/dark theme.The acrobatics shown on the first trailer on Steam are nowhere to be found in this game. (I watched it after I finished the game, and I felt that was worth mentioning because of how misleading they were.) I think the game could have benefited from more twitchy swapping sections lacking in the final game without making the game have a sudden difficulty spike. It would've also made the open-areas more expansive and well-worth finding the collectibles.The luminaries only feel necessary when the plot demands it, and there are more than enough within the area you are locked in to never worry about finding any more. In the end, I felt these were pointless other than for achievement purposes. The Shadows on the Walls Tell AllThe one thing Contrast nails almost flawlessly is its narrative format told through gameplay. Although the game deviated from what my inital expectations were--of a subconscious friend being there to aid the protagonist--I still appreciate the manner of the story told that is not too dark for kids and not too forced for adults.Do not write this game off as another tale of the loss of innocence. That's not what the game is about; it's about seeing the adult world through a child's eyes with an imaginary friend. The adult themes of vice, regrets, misfortunes and personal mistakes make the world intimidating while hiding away the faces and other details that would make things more clear.Characters other than Didi and Dawn are represented by silohouettes with distinctive voices and models. The side-cast are executed well, and the implementation of their cutscenes as platforming ""puzzles"" is an interesting way to keep the pace of a game going. This is a case where a limitation on the budget ultimately proved to be a great outlet for storytelling purposes, and it doesn't stand out with the rest of the game.Sadly, the one character you will be hearing a lot of is not the best actor, Didi. Dawn never speaks, and Didi will give you instructions on what to do and where to go at every point in the game.Didi is not the only obstruction from the otherwise fun, creative gameplay. Forced cutscenes showing key-parts of the room are triggered way too much to let the player figure out the puzzle, and the constant text-prompts for objectives are not necessary either. Both of these take the player out of the experience and they are not necessary. You won't get lost as the game is very linear and the areas are never that big.The story is split between three acts. Act 1 and 2 go hand-in-hand in terms of the game's simple, yet clever difficulty as well as the narrative tying in together. Act 3, however, intrudes upon an otherwise surreal story with realistic explainations and a twist ending that ends abruptly for no good reason other than to end the story there. The twist and darker elements within Act 3 are not a problem because they don't make sense. In fact, like with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, they might make too much sense for my liking.My problem is how they feel ultimately rushed into the game to give it a deeper meaning, and once I reached that point of the game I knew my early expectations were wrong. (It's a shame because I think having the PLAYER be an imaginary friend is the perfect explanation for a video-game.)The devs stated they wanted to keep the ending short and brief to leave the game open-ended. While I am fine with games that have ambigious endings on purpose, like LISA, I don't think Contrast left an ending satisfying enough for the player to be left thinking about.Except for what might have been in the story instead.A Flawed, But Ultimately Charming GameI wouldn't recommend Contrast for full-asking price as there is not enough content to warrant it (nor replay value). Nor is the game as finely polished to be liked by everyone. But Contrast is still a good game, which sees through with its ideas giving all its got while being in the spotlight. It's a game that won't make you cry in the end because of the emotional attachment you experience; it's a game that will make you cry because you don't want the curtain-call to be over so soon.			"

												Contrast is a highly ambitious game which just falls short of being amazing. The gameplay is unique and interesting given that the game allows you traverse between the real realm and the shadow realm which greatly changes how the player would interact within the world compared to a game which is just in the third dimension or just in the second dimension. While the puzzles are integrated nicely within the world you are placed in, the game is rather short taking me just under four hours to complete the entire game.The aesthetics and charm of this game brings back the feeling of a platformer back from the Playstation One era, however the game often has issues explaining the story and world to the player which is mainly due to the game being so short. However if the player is keen on collectable hunting, collecting as many as possible can give some very interesting and subtle insight onto details the story does not wish to make obvious.The voice acting feels stiff sometimes and often repeats itself, more often than not having the child explain to you where to go despite you already knowing where you have to go. However the voice actors in themselves are believable and well done, each reflecting the character nicely.Despite being a short game, 15USD is not a steep asking price for what this game offers if you are looking into a unique platformer. That being said, I would recommend waiting until a sale since 15USD can buy games with a lot more gameplay.			"

I wouldn't recommend this game at a full price since I have beaten the game in 2 hours (I have yet to unlock all of the achievements). This game was very exciting for me and I enjoyed the experience.

												Pros:- The atmosphere and setting are utterly fantastic, and the art is very good with a really interesting noir-style. The art direction is really solid.- The soundtrack is fantastic.- The puzzles are, for the most part, interesting.- The idea of hopping between 2D and 3D platforming is intriguing.- The story is interesting enough to be engaging for the whole length of the game.Cons:- The game is short, so if you don't get the game on a sale it might not be worth it to everyone.- The control is buggy and at times a serious nuisance. This may turn off lots of players.Overall, I wish the mechanics/controls were more polished, and the bugs worked out, but it's a solid experience with an intriguing hook and a story interesting enough to keep me engaged for the ~5 hours I played.

												This game does the biggest crime of game design repeatedly -- it takes control out of the player's hands.  REPEATEDLY.  NONSTOP.  You get a cool puzzle time and you do it and then CUTSCENE and you can't do anything but listen to a single mom fight with a deadbeat dad in the shadows on the wall then it takes like 3 seconds to give back control to you.  First it zooms in on the back of your character all cinematic pan-camera style when all you want to do is move.  God it's frustrating as all hell.  It's a cool mechanic, being able to turn into shadow.  But it's badly done.  Don't waste your damn time.			"

												Pros:- The atmosphere and setting are utterly fantastic, and the art is very good with a really interesting noir-style. The art direction is really solid.- The soundtrack is fantastic.- The puzzles are, for the most part, interesting.- The idea of hopping between 2D and 3D platforming is intriguing.- The story is interesting enough to be engaging for the whole length of the game.Cons:- The game is short, so if you don't get the game on a sale it might not be worth it to everyone.- The control is buggy and at times a serious nuisance. This may turn off lots of players.Overall, I wish the mechanics/controls were more polished, and the bugs worked out, but it's a solid experience with an intriguing hook and a story interesting enough to keep me engaged for the ~5 hours I played.

												For those of you who enjoy inventive platforms, or dynamic interestings story lines I highly recommend this game.Contrast brings to the table inventive gameplay with well crafted characters. As the story develops your emotions run with it a bit, and it makes it that much more fun and interesting.The collectibles bring extra elements to the story you wouldn't have known otherwise, so even if there wasn't achievements for finding them, they tie into this story extremely well and answer questions you wouldn't have even thought to ask. In fact, in Act III my mind was basically blown because the ending wouldn't have made any sense if I hadn't found every collectible, and after the first collectible, I wanted to know more so I made sure I grabbed every single one before the end of the last Act.The ending makes you want more! I won't tell you any of it, but I personally was blown away and left awaiting a sequel.But for those who worry about how the game handles, Its controller compatible and easy to pick up, and for those dedicated to the key board and mouse it can't be very hard to manage. It ran smooth and I didn't have to change any settings for it to work and faster. I was very satisfied in that regardThis group does an amazing job, I not lay in wait for a sequel, but for their other projects as well. I can't wait to see what other inventive ideas come next.			"

												Contrast is a very charming game if I do say so myself. Despite it having many glitches and bugs, Contrast has a very unique gameplay element. Every puzzle you accomplish makes you feel satisfied. The graphics are beautiful and the music is quite catchy. I wouldn't recommend this game at a full price since I have beaten the game in 2 hours (I have yet to unlock all of the achievements). This game was very exciting for me and I enjoyed the experience. The story kept me playing, the voice acting is top notch, and I think anyone who enjoys puzzle games or need something to play should buy this game. Oh and I give thanks to a friend of mine who gifted me this game, I really enjoyed it.			"

												Pro: distinct look, sane controller layout, puzzle game without fights, charming story, good flow, quite enjoyableCon: Fixed (and questionable) keyboard layout, no proper saving, no choice of character/avatar (liked the one you get though)In a nutshell: Casual game I replayed pretty much immediately after finishing the first time around. Would buy a second part.The details: Contrast has the good taste to let you think its riddles through, without pushing fight or flight at you while you're working it out. The puzzles of course for the most part aren't too hard, so the game develops a nice flow, all the while looking distinct and neat -- rare enough for a game that will also please the casual player. (In fact if you're stuck, you've probably either overthought things, or run into a bug. The latter are rare, but in the last act, I twice had to restart from a savepoint when vital items became impossible to interact with (one got stuck for no apparent reason, the other became intangible). Given that savepoints can be a good while apart, this is a bit annoying. (There is never a good reason not to have ""saving any time, as many times as you like"".)The story starts off as inoffensive -- somewhat basic, but not bad, and not getting in the way of the game's flow --, and gains charm with some minor twists as it goes along. Very ""children's book"", in a good way. (I'm not quite sure what earned the game the ""sexual themes"" label, by the way.)Act I and the endgame are the strongest parts of the game; Act II has (amongst other bits) a fairy tale segment that tells a nice enough story, but outlives its welcome -- rather than capitalize on Contrast's strengths, that segment looks a good deal like Limbo, and incorporates that game's trial-and-die gameplay. The actual tale told is amusing enough, but a bit repetitive. Less would've been more.Act III would have been fair enough, although the rare bug soured the experience a bit; there are also two moments where the game should've been more forgiving, or the controls more precise. I'm also still not sure why sometimes when I seem to do the exact same things, Dawn suddenly unshifts, while at other times she doesn't. Is it a bug? Is it an intended feature of the game world that wasn't properly communicated? All I know is it's frustrating -- and fortunately somewhat rare.The verdict:The game isn't too long (which I tend to consider a feature) and can be finished in a session or two (but ""an act a day"" might be best). Due to the short length, the verdict is,Ignore if you think you'd hate it;buy when it drops below 10,- if you think you might love it;buy if it drops below 5,- if unsure. ;)			"

												Its a hard decision of whether this is a good or bad game. It reminds me of Tom Clancy's The Division: it's incredibly mediocre. The game's mechanics look great and it seems to not take a lot to run, but I personaly have an entry level PC and had to turn the graphics settings down to low despite the characters already looking low rez. I like the art style and the story, but even that seems to be really choppy. A little more effort could've gone into the game, but instead it chose to try to copy the feel of A Story About My Uncle. In the beginning I had a lot of fun with it but towards the beginning of act two it felt like it was droning on. In my oppinion, this game could be summed up by the fact that it's a forgotten PS4 launch title, but I can see how some people like the game. Personal Rating: 6.5/10 Overall Rating: 7.5/10			"

												+ Great graphics, beautiful scenery and classy+ Compelling storyline+ Easy to learn+ Great puzzle solver- The game is extremely short, around 3-4 hours to complete- I found a couple of bugs where you could get stuck8.8/10 - I picked up this game when it was on sale and I must say I don't regret it. The visuals are extremely beautiful and without revealing any spoilers the storyline and story development is well prepared. It is ingenous how Dawn can jump in shadows to get through obstacles. Aside how great this game is, it does have it's flaws, for one, the game is relatively short and the gameplay can sometimes fustrate you if you're not a patient gamer. Needless to say the puzzles are well laid out so yeah I recommend you give this game a shot if you're a fan of puzzle solving games.			"

An Amazing MasterpieceI am impressed. No matter what your major gaming genre is, I think you will like this brilliant example of contemporary game art design. Also, not hardware hungry: Runs smooth here, on a mediocre notebook (Dual-i5 and GeForce 610M).Requires some timing & control skills though, but that seems doable to me, so far.An option to remap the control keys (incl. mouse) would be nice, which is missing. Experienced users may want to edit the ContrastInput.ini which can be found in ...docs/My Games...			"

												An interesting concept with promise, that sells itself short. The light puzzles are interesting and for the most part straight forward. The storyline is entertaining with a few nice hooks but also fairly straight forward. The art style is a unique with an abstract 20s themed world. The soundtrack including voice acting is very good. The game lacks some final polish to the controls, interactions with the environment and can suffers from occasional random frame drops reducing game immersion, which leave it as only a good - very good game/interactive story. This is a shame because the game had potential to be amazing. Worth picking up, even though you can finish the game in 2-4 hours. The developers show great potential, I look forward to their future projects (just remember that final polish to your game makes a world of difference)			"

For instance I think the twist about his dad not being his dad and being fanjesto's they put it after Act I and at the ending so it feels like they should just keeps the father bit at the end so it has more of a twist to it but I didn't make a game but I am just saying it would of gave me a more of a WHHAAAAAA!!!!!!

												Beautiful game with an interesting mechanic (phase between shadows and ""reality"") and compelling story. However, the clunky controls (no way to remap keys) make that phase-in-out mechanic frustrating. Combine that with easily missed collectibles and you get an awkward game experience. The pull of the story is far more compelling than the fun of the gameplay. I accidentally started a new game just after starting Act 3, and I had no desite to play through the fristration again, so I uninstalled the game.			"

												Contrast is a highly ambitious game which just falls short of being amazing. The gameplay is unique and interesting given that the game allows you traverse between the real realm and the shadow realm which greatly changes how the player would interact within the world compared to a game which is just in the third dimension or just in the second dimension. While the puzzles are integrated nicely within the world you are placed in, the game is rather short taking me just under four hours to complete the entire game.The aesthetics and charm of this game brings back the feeling of a platformer back from the Playstation One era, however the game often has issues explaining the story and world to the player which is mainly due to the game being so short. However if the player is keen on collectable hunting, collecting as many as possible can give some very interesting and subtle insight onto details the story does not wish to make obvious.The voice acting feels stiff sometimes and often repeats itself, more often than not having the child explain to you where to go despite you already knowing where you have to go. However the voice actors in themselves are believable and well done, each reflecting the character nicely.Despite being a short game, 15USD is not a steep asking price for what this game offers if you are looking into a unique platformer. That being said, I would recommend waiting until a sale since 15USD can buy games with a lot more gameplay.			"

												For once I didn't read enough about a game before purchasing...The keys are hardcoded...Settings-Controls shows you a picture of the keys they think you should use.. that's it.It probably took them more time making that picture than it would implementing custom controller keys.That's just lazy programming, and an absolute deal breaker.

												I dont think the mechanic is enough to carry the game because it gets rather stale very quickly. It really needs more polishing with the camera angels and the actual use of the puzzle mechanics. The story wasnt awful but it wasnt good either. I really dont think youd miss out on much if you pass this one up.			"

												To wrap things up, I would dare to say Contrast is a beautifully well-built game when it comes to design, graphics and color; however, the studio forgot they were making a game. It is a moderately fun game and a good option if you have some time to kill, but it is definitively not a game to die for.  Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

												Ok, so. This game is what I would  call a good ""sophomore effort"", in that it has some really good potentials: the character Didi is a likable enough character (though Dawn seems standoffish and unfriendly, especially for an avatar, and her raison d'etre is critically neglected), the concept of shadow-running is promising, and the set pieces are generally very good. The songs of the soundtrack, when there is any soundtrack, are very nice period pieces (1920's), much like LA Noire uses to establish atmosphere. In fact, a resemblence to LA Noire is strong from the title screen (though it ends there).  The use of shadows is very creative, and watching all of the family drama (I'm not entirely a fan of the non-existence of real people, just their shadows, though I admit it's a good concept) while they also pose the platforms you navigate is well done. Despite its promising start, it requires a considerable more polish before I'd call it great. The action and movement of Dawn, the avatar, is clumsy, sometimes failing to jump into shadows, sometimes not dashing correctly, rather often falling out of the shadow despite your best effort. This is a game requiring dexterous dual-joystick control, one for movement (which was by default absurdly inverted, and required some inner-game config editing to fix) and another for camera, and both need to move to execute the required jumps in places. The character model herself is rather unappealling, in running, turning, and standing. Like Papo y Yo (a game with a similar feel in playing), Contrast feels outdated even while you feel you should be enjoying it more. I suspect is has a lot to do with its use of the Unreal Engine, which (I can't confirm this, not knowing much about programing with the UE) seemed an unfortunately easy shortcut to making the game.  This is a game with such good story, concept, graphics, and voice-acting (for the most part, at least) that its central mechanism really unfortunately spoils it. Not to kick it while it's down, but it could really use some more polish in its foley effects and soundtrack generally, and mappable controls. Further, the puzzles are more tedious than challenging, such that, while you can enjoy the ingenuity of the shadow-running, the task you are given is not otherwise particularly difficult outside of trying to manage the game's physics.    6/10EDIT: Having just finished the game (I was only a little way from it before), Dawn's character is very very subtly explained, in part. But the ending was abrupt and poorly done. Short game, nice story, good atmosphere, bad mechanics.			"

												Set in 1920's Paris; the City of Lights is an ideal location for a shadow based puzzle platformer. Consistantly testing your perspective of lighting and which dimension you should be within. The game adds an interesting 3D world aswell as a constant 2D platformer which you have to vary between in order to complete puzzles. Having the power to slip between the open 3D world to hopping from shadow to shadow in 2D at your own will opens up some very clever puzzling possibilities.Throughout the game there's a gripping emotional story line in which follows the main little girl, Didi. As she is always trying to help out her close-to-useless father, having to deal with various mobsters, aswell as an illusionist puzzle master. As Didi’s imaginary friend, you can only see the shadows and hear the voices of the real people within the 3D world, in which Didi interacts with. But again within the 2D world there is great interaction of the real people's shadows and a fulfilling sense of achievment once you complete a puzzle.As with all medium to low budget puzzle games there are a few bugs/glitches but nothing you can't turn your head at. Some of the puzzels can be very cliche: move a box over a button = door opens. But there was a few interesting ones you'll have to think twice about.Overall gameplay was enjoyable and certainly made you want to finish the game, yet only being 3-5 hours long depending on collectables and the narrations. It’s hard to say whether Contrast looks better while playing as one of the minimalist silhouettes or running around in full 3D. The graphics are a key aspect of the game, being set in such a hearty destination the overly cartoon design looks great and is consistant throughout. 8/10 "

												I absolutely LOVE this game! I bought it on both Steam and Xbox One and completed 100% achievements on both. It's fun and just challenging enough to keep me thinking without making me want to throw my controller out the window! My only complaint is that it's VERY short. It took only took me 4 hours to beat it on Xbox (and a good chunk of that was spent stuck on one puzzle!) I would LOVE if they released some DLC to add to the story line, or at the very least a sequel. It's definitely worth the buy!Oh, and the Extra Life achievement... priceless! Thanks for supporting the cause!			"

												This is a good game with a mechanic that is reminiscent of the Shift games, which I think did it better. It could be because I played them first, or because I found the 3D to 2D in Contrast imprecise at times, which made some of the jumps pretty frustrating. It was also sometimes unclear how to set up the environment to successfully get yourself where you need to go, but I actually enjoyed how freeform these parts were and would have liked to see more of them, with a bit more polish.I really did like the atmosphere and setting, though I don't think the whole shadow idea meshed well with the rest of the game, and the locations felt more like they were pieced together based on how interesting they would be to play through instead of being used to create a cohesive narrative. Despite this, it was a very charming game with some interesting puzzles, and is worth picking up on sale to satisfy your curiosity.			"

												This is a wonderful game.  The story and music are really well done and the characters are incredible - if you are nostalgic for the big band, gumshoe era, this game is right up your alley.  Loading it is a little tricky as you will likely need a patch, but once you get it working there are very few hitches or problems.  The game play is unique with you playing a character that moves in and out of shadows and helps a little girl find her way in the world.  Most of the puzzles are fairly straight-forward and are somewhat portal-like in their layout.  I was able to solve most without assistance.   It is not a super long game but creates characters you will cheer for and love.  Gets a little metaphysical toward the end but doesn't attract from the story.  Definitely worth the price - not sure why such a lower metacritc score - was certainly better than a 66			"

												There are only 3 cons I could list for this game : Linear&Repetitive, Short and you need to ""get"" the main character to appreciate the story, otherwise, it will feel a bit dull and ininteresting.Now I'm done with the negative stuff, lemme tell you how this game is nice: I'm usually not into platformers but this one kept me interested due to the real/shadow plan duality. Use lights in reality to affect shadow and create new shadow plateforms, then switch back to reality to activate a lever ect...Another great thing is the game being enjoyable and controllable even when not using a controller. Keyboard and mouse are an okay combo for this game.Gameplay wise, it's good. Like I said in the beginning, it's linear&repetitive but not too much. The short lenght might be a con, it helps : short and repetitive is better than long and repetitive.But all that... It's not what you should buy the game for. Actually, it is a little but.. Man, the ambience. This game truly has a magical ambience. My rating : 73/100			"

												This isn't a game. It is interactive art. In the first few moments there's this song that pulled me in and intrigued me. I hit start and the graphics were so nice to look at. It was very immersive in those first few moments. That experience, I think, is worth the price when on sale. There is nothing to actually play however. I control the character in a very linear fashion and listen to the dialog as the story unfolds. With cutscenes every few minutes I'm never actually allowed to play. Then with all the things I learned from the tutorials I climb one tower with puzzles in and the game is through. So if you want an okay story with pretty things to look at then this is for you. If you want to play a game; look elsewhere.			"

												[Pros]-First of all, I really love the unique gameplay merchanic. You have the ability to jump in and out the shadows to progress the game and solve very well design puzzles.-Oooh!! I love the Puppet Theater part!!! So enjoyable!!! -The music is beatiful, especially the song of Didi's Mother. Suitable for the special world the developers created.-Likeable main character. Even if your character you control doesn't speak or doesn't show a lot of personality, if you pay attention and collect the extra items, you will learn more about her.-By the way, the Extra items you collect actually is woth finding. You learn interesting and in my opinion important details about the whole plot of the game and for the characters.-A surprise twist at the end of the game. Not a twist like ""HOLY SH*T SON!!!!! FDfkmdnmmsEDf!!!"", but more like ""very interesting. I need to learn more"". [Cons]-Didi..........shut the f*ck up. At first you where ok girl, I really liked you, but after 1 hour, your voice become irritating to my nerves....I really wished the main character had a voice so I had a break from Didi's yapping.-The shadows of the characters needed more work. This sound strange, but when you notice that the shadows don't move their lips [except Didi] and their hands movements sometimes are lifeless [except Didi again], you will understand my nitpick. -The controls are ok.....but at some point if you are not precise with your movements, you will see yourself jump back and forth from a shadow without wanted to do it. At some point I wanted to pass a moving gear while I was a shadow, but every time I wanted to move, I became normal and fall down.........20 times I think.....f*ck. -The story is ok, but not something very exciting. I was more interested in the extras, than the main story with the exception the ending.-Very short game. I finished in less 3 hours. -Very unsatisfying. Being a very short game, it let you with a desire to learn more about this world. I hope for a sequel to cover my curiosity for some details I wanted to learn.[Final Thought]I really liked this game, even with the some frustrations I had while playing it.However because the game is very short and a not very interesting story, I suggest you buy it when it get cheaper.With that said, I hope for a sequel for this game. Good work.7/10			"

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL!The music and vocals are of notable quality in both art and fidelity. A bit short, yet some of the puzzles seem to take longer than they should AFTER you have figured out it mechanic. Although you can also spend a lot of time playing with then dancing on shadows. There are also a couple of very arbitrary obstructions.  What I hope are typical growing pains for an ambitious project worthy of a SEQUEL!  I compare it to Trine(without the sleepy time story) in the way that Trine was a bit buggy, a lot control quirks but had a great core mechanic and atmosphere.  Then Trine 2 just nailed it.  What the first one could have been if they had the time and budget. Contrast 2 will be great. So get invested now.			"

Wonderful graphics, audio, and characters. It was shorter than I expected, but I enjoyed it a lot and really hope for a sequel. I am sick to death of fighting games, so a game with no fighting at all that was still fun, interesting, and different was a very pleasant change of pace. Its replayability isn't /too/ high, since once you've figured out the puzzles, it's easy to breeze through, but I would play through again simply because it was fun and I loved playing.

The game is quite beautiful and the scenes are fluid and well put together.

A handful of actually clever solutions aside, they are mostly jumping puzzles that require you to push a button to solve, or just time the shifts appropriately. Even with that, the game is fun. Which to me is what matters the most.The few puzzles that surprize you don't take terribly long to sort out, but you feel like you did something when you do.

A few rough edges in the interaction, but I'm sure that will be as smooth as the jazz in the sequel. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL!The music and vocals are of notable quality in both art and fidelity. A bit short, yet some of the puzzles seem to take longer than they should AFTER you have figured out it mechanic. Although you can also spend a lot of time playing with then dancing on shadows. There are also a couple of very arbitrary obstructions.  What I hope are typical growing pains for an ambitious project worthy of a SEQUEL!  I compare it to Trine(without the sleepy time story) in the way that Trine was a bit buggy, a lot control quirks but had a great core mechanic and atmosphere.  Then Trine 2 just nailed it.  What the first one could have been if they had the time and budget. Contrast 2 will be great. So get invested now.			"

												I highly recommend this game. I really enjoy the way the story is told as well as the unique gameplay mechanic requiring the player to traverse shadows. I am a big fan of the film noir atmosphere and the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. I have found myself listening to it outside the game as well. Seems to be a fair amount of gameplay for the price. Not too sure about replay value though. 7/10			"

												While this is a short little game (only an hour or two), I loved the art style and atmosphere. I enjoyed the mechanics with the shadow shifting and look forward to future developments and projects. If you're looking for a quick trip into a jazz-era game I'd definately pick it up. Also, if you're the kind of gamer that likes to 100% complete steam achievements for things. It takes only mild extra effort to do them all in one playthrough which is great.			"

												This game innovates by the integration of shadows into gameplay. Also most of the puzzles involve shadows in one way or another. Moreover, nice storytelling is combined with a beautifully implemented art style. The unique style is matched by the various locations and characters who greatly fit into the whole setting. Overall, Contrast provides very good entertainment for a few hours and is definitely worth taking a look.			"

												I got a new computer, so I decided to try out Contrast as my first game. I couldn't stop! It was a lot of fun - not too challenging, interesting storyline. Wonderful graphics, audio, and characters. It was shorter than I expected, but I enjoyed it a lot and really hope for a sequel. I am sick to death of fighting games, so a game with no fighting at all that was still fun, interesting, and different was a very pleasant change of pace. Its replayability isn't /too/ high, since once you've figured out the puzzles, it's easy to breeze through, but I would play through again simply because it was fun and I loved playing. All in all, I would very much recommend this game to anyone seeking a new game that's challenging, but not to hard, without any fighting, and a great soundtrack.			"

												Time for another Timeraider Reviews :P  (SMALL SPOILERS INSIDE, NONE STORY-RELATED THOUGH) (30-11-2014)So.. Contrast. Lets first get some things and negative points out of the way:The game is very short. About 3-4 hours, 4-5 if you want to get all the collectibles.I bought it during a 75% off sale, thus i cant judge well if it would be worth the full price. I would advice to wait for a sale .. like 50%-75% off :D Do keep in mind.. this is only based my normal 1 euro = 1 hour of gametime, nothing else.Though it plays fine with a keyboard and mouse and has not a single problem while using those devices, as always i would advice playing a platformer with a controller. (Game has amazing controller support btw, even switching from keyboard to controller in the middle of a tutorial text, the line will change the keys the text redirects you to)Now the good things:The music is amazing. The jazzy style with some sweet vocals now and then made me finish this game quicker then expected due to being able to play longer without getting bored.The atmosphere in the game is the other big part. It feels as if you got trown back into the past.. back to the time of the blues, gangsters and burlesque. Alot of the game being darker colored with not that much massively bright colored objects make it an amazing experience.Now the platforming. When i started playing i felt trown back into another one of my favorite games in the past years.. Alice: Madness Returns. A 3D world from third-personview with platform elements while getting you further into the story in between. Even though Contrast doesnt hold any combat, the platforming parts are quite active... it doesnt just stop with moving platforms..nooooo.. because Contrast has something else.. shadows. You are able to go into the light reflecting on walls etc. and go inside of your own shadow, allowing you to go alot further then just walking on physical objects. Combine this with being able to dash and be able to become a shadow even when mid-air makes for some exciting puzzles. Its not THAT hard but i can see some people taking their time at some puzzles for sure.The story is great. Because your own personage stays on the background, you get fully emerged in the story of the child you are taking care of. Lets just say it has some nice twists and emotions (Not as emotional as Brothers: A tale of two sons (of which im not afraid to admit is the only game in history that literally made me shed a tear for a sec) with a good plot (though it might be slightly confusing for some ;D). I wont spoil anything of the story so enough about that!Now the conclusion. Great game, nice controls, gameplay and atmosphere feel amazing and suck you in. Not supermemorable game that will change your life entirely but still a very very well-made game.I would rate this game 7.5-8/10.Not sure if i would pay full price since im a cheapass :P but at least worth looking into and certainly worth buying with any discount.Its on 75% discount till 2 December (2014) btw.

												I'll start by saying I paid full price for this game. Contrast is one of those games that could be a joy to play, if it didn't have those moments in game where clipping makes you restart your chapter. The graphics are excellent, but the game has difficulty knowing what it is - they list the 3d to 2d transisitions as a selling point, but it's by far the game's largest drawback. Well, that and the one song they replay over and over and over and.....While the game is fairly easy to play, there are moments when it is simply impossible to pass a puzzle for unknown reasons. Note that I did play this game offline, so my total hours played is incorrect. I quickly and easily made it through the game until I hit the ""carousel""  challenge. No matter what I did, I could not complete this puzzle as for no apparent reason the game would dump me back into 3D mode causing me to start over, and over and over. Am I doing something wrong? Perhaps, but you would assume after 3 hours of trying the same puzzle I would accidentally get it right once. I didn't. Compared to the overly simplistic gameplay of the rest of the story, this insanely difficult challenge made me stop playing. Simply put, I hate this game. Is it well done? Certainly.Is it playable? No, if you like a challenge and No if like a relaxing gameplay. Perhaps a means of skipping a buggy puzzle would have kept me playing (I'm sure it would have), the fact is there is no reason to continue. I'm not vested in the characters or the story. This game is all setting with almost no plot. There is no payoff for playing, especially when I could have spent the 3 wasted hours enjoying a quirky game like Kentucy Route Zero. I feel angry that this glitchy mess was funded by me as a tax payer in Canada (Canada Media Fund) and I'd like to see fewer tax payer funded games on steam - and more creativity being rewarded, because Contrast would not have stood on it's own had the developer not accessed Federal tax dollars. It's quite clear that this game was funded because of it's visual style, not it's playability or storyline. Contrast does nothing to enhance our Canadian image or enrich me as a Canadian on a personal level, no but we do know who it enriched. 99% of the developers on steam seem to get by without tax dollars. My hope however is that the development money was refunded to the tax payer out of the profits.  "

												Intersting game mechanic and beautiful to look at. Soundtrack is amazing and voice acting is great.However, the gameplay itself was lacking. Puzzles are extremely simple and it is only the execution which is difficult, which can be quite the challenge in itself given poor movement and controls. An extremely short game, with my run-through clocking in at only 4.1 hours. Not that there was much point to finishing, the story was predictable and dull.I played through to the end because of the beautiful graphics and the hope of some more wonderful music. Would recommend buying the soundtrack and looking at some fanart instead of buying the game. Very disappointing experience in my opinion.			"

												Background: Was attracted by the striking 'French' visuals and intriguing gameplay that put me in mind of the film and game of 'City of Lost Children'.The Good:* Oozes atmosphere with elegant visuals and design* Ingenious light based mechanics* Sound design is pitch perfect in all aspects* Cutscenes are brilliantly incorporated* A mature story that draws you in as it unfolds* Plays well with mouse and keyboard despite the very consoley feelThe Bad:* Some (rare) glitchy mechanics spoil the flow* Gamespeed/movement feels too fast on high powered machines* Too short (4 hours) and you want more Impressions: I was strongly put in mind of the films of Jeunet (like a cross of 'City of Lost Children' with 'Amelie') and was impressed at the inventiveness of the puzzles and that the developer resisted repeating themselves just to pad out the game. That said 4 hours will be enough for a run through and another 1 to pickup missing achievements.Some have criticised the game for not answering questions but the answers are all there if you listen, read the clues you collect and join the dots in your head.Recommended for: Puzzle fans and those who like ingenious but forgiving platformers.Conclusion: 9/10. Charmed me and tugged on my heartstrings from start to finish, just wanted more of it.			"

												PROS:Story - the writing and voice acting in this game were greatNovelty - introduction of an innovative game mechanic that lends itself well to creative and challenging puzzlesCONS:Controls - movement is awkward and occasionally a bit frustratingUnpredictable triggers - Use key on the wrong item and you will be taken to the next part of the story before you've had a chance to try and find everything in the current levelLength/Price ratio - This game is a bit expensive for being so short. Totally worth picking up on sale though.Many people complain about glitches but I didn't see anything too obvious. There are some kind of annoying places where you fall through decorative parts near the edge of the level that look like they should support you, but you'll only notice this if you are off exploring. It won't impede progression through the actual game content.Don't expect this to be game that's going to help hone your precision platformer skills. The controls, collisions, and physics are too wonky for that. The puzzles, story, music, art, writing, etc. however, are all very well done, and very cohesive. Nice little game.			"

												It's a story game with a mediocre storyIt's a clunky puzzle gameIt's an interesting mechanic/idea without overly meaningful explorationReally, each of these things counter each other to make a game that deserves 'mixed' reviews.See the criticism on Wikipedia - it's lukewarm stuff.			"

												This game is short but thank God it is. Don't get me wrong. The story is interesting and the soundtrack is amazing, but puzzles, oh my, the puzzles are SO boring... also, this is not a true platformer, it's more like a 3D adventure. Well, I bought it because I like puzzles and platformer games, and since puzzles are terrible and in my opinion it's not even a platformer, I certainly didn't like it and don't recommend it.			"

												Rather meh. The mechanics got stale quickly and the story wasn't enough to hold my interest.The problem wasn't with the 2D puzzles, it was going in and out of them from 3D with an extraordinarily wonky camera. Almost nauseating in parts.Some of the timed jumping bits were also cringe-worthy game design. It almost felt like a college project that somehow got produced into a full game.Still, it was a decent diversion...until the game didn't save my progress after I solved three puzzles. At that point, it was Uninstall Time.			"

												I was really excited to play this game, and the concept is pretty unique and interesting. I was excited when I started playing, and the first act does a pretty good job of leading you around so that you can figure out how to solve puzzles and things.After Act 1, though, is when I started to get disappointed. The tutorial-esque first level isn't the only tutorial-esque level. Every single act pretty much holds your hand through all of the puzzles, and it just wasn't interesting enough to actually keep my interest.I was very interested in the story, but it couldn't hold my attention long enough to actually keep me in the game. I uninstalled midway through act 3 and have never looked back.			"

												Not a bad game. The controls/shadow mechanic can be a little wonky at times. This can make for some pretty frustrating moments, but still playable.

												Contrast is a unique 3D platformer (2D when you're in the shadows). I played it some time back so I cannot write out an exhaustive review, but suffice to say the setting, story, soundtrack and voice-acting were all decent here. The artstyle especially was unique though. The game mechanics are interesting, but they were never fully fleshed out. The puzzles are mostly of moderate difficulty, but one or two of the later ones might frustrate you for a while.The game is a bit rough around the edges with texture pop-ins, some wonky animations and some other minor control bugs. The ending felt a bit rushed for the story. Length wise, it is pretty short at 3 hours or so, and you should be able to 100% the game in around 4 hours. If you go in with your expectations in check and manage to get this game on a discount, I'd be pretty certain you'll come away liking it. At least that's how I saw it in the end - a unique game that did not overstay its welcome.			"

												Contrast is an enjoyable puzzle platformer that has some unique mechanics, a great storyline but suffers from a few small gameplay issues.The shadow / light mechanics are unique and they work (most of the time) very well, making for some intriguing puzzles. The storyline is ambiguous but definitely interesting.The music and graphics are also fantastic, and better than I thought there'd be. I'd also recommend the soundtrack if you enjoy soundtracks.The game does have a minor annoyances when it comes to gameplay. Occassionally I found the controls a little clunky which made some more technical puzzle jumps hard. There were also a couple of glitches when trying to jump and shift into a wall.Overall those were only minor grievances and I easily lived with them. For its price, it's still great value for money.I recommend it if you want a nice but relatively quick puzzle platformer with some unique mechanics, a great storyline and fantastic music; just don't expect a 100% perfect gameplay experience.

												Quite a short game, but really enjoyable and well worth the price. The concept and esthetique are great, the film noir atmosphere works well with the story and mechanics. The puzzles are more about figuring out the routes and how to put spotlights just right, rather than split-second grab-that-pixel-wide-ledge reflexes, which I appreciated.			"

												Contrast is a game that grows on you and leaves you wanting more. The play style (Shadow shifting) for solving puzzles and progressing forward makes this game really fun. Although alot of elements were done before in various other titles, they were never done this good.The puzzles aren't too hard either so even the most novice players will get through them when stretching some brain muscles.The story slowly sucks you in from start to finish giving you just enough clues to keep you hanging on a threat but never enough to give it's story fully away.There were some clipping and frame rate issues here and there but was minor enough not to take up arms over it.I'd recommend this game to the young and old, hard-core puzzle fanatics or novices.Go on... give it a try... and enjoy.  :3			"

												When I saw Contrast at Steam Greenlight I knew that was a title I was going to play.Those who know me will easily understand why: Contrast has female protagonists, something I'm always looking forward to,  beautiful character and environment design, with an aesthetic close to my heart, an interesting mechanic and was non-violent, which is something I'm beginning to appreciate, even though I love to hack and slash things. So, as soon as it was available for pre-order, I decided to buy it, even if I was not at my best financially. It was worth it. First, the whole game was translated to brazilian portuguese, with the exception of the audio (which would've been really costly). Although I have no problem understanding english, this was a nice touch, specially when most people at my country don't have easy access to english lessons. Second, the game is beautiful, entertaining and interesting. I almost gasped at the final revelation: something I thought to be just an aesthetic choice, in the end, had much more meaning within the story. The puzzles were difficult enough to keep me interested, not hard to the point of making me want to give up nor easy to the point of leaving me bored. I once or twice thought of looking through a walkthrough, 'cause I'm lazy and always craving for more pieces of information surrounding a game's story, but I'd always close the window and decide to solve the puzzle myself. I loved when you activated some sort of ""memory"" and interacted with the shadows. There were glitches and bugs, like getting stuck between shadow-world and ""real-world"", but nothing really troubling. The controls were a bit weird at the beginning, I felt like Dawn walked too fast or something, but I got used to it quickly.  I could complain that the game is short. It is, really, but I honestly think it's worth it. It's an engaging experience and I think it lasts enough.  My only true complaint is that sometimes the cut-scenes would break the pace of the game. You'd walk a bit or solve one short puzzle and have a cut-scene right after it in a way that felt a tiny bit out of place. In the beginning of the game I felt there were too many short cut-scenes happening all the time. Still, it's not something that takes anything out of this wonderful game. This is a game you can show your non-gamer friends and family members too and I think would grab their attention. If you are open to it, you could ask them to help solving some puzzles, to make them engage more with the game.Visuals are lovely, gameplay is nice and the story is interesting.I'd recommend it for sure.

												I was drawn in to this game by the unique game mechanics and the amazing jazz music. I stayed for the decent gameplay and good story. It is a platformer, which naturally sets out its automatic good and bad points. My only sadness with the title was that it was over a bit earlier than I would have liked. This game is seriously a diamond in the rough. The music and art is combined and woven into a good story. There aren't too many games out there like this.			"

												This game was quite odd. As a game its nothing special; it would even be fair to say its gameplay is just bad. I often felt as though I tricked trough some levels by takng advantage of the hit-and-miss gameplay like making jumps that would avoid the puzzles. The stories execution is equally questionable, with a protagonist who serves to guide you through the game without any real finesse. And by that I don't mean your character; you seem to serve more as a tool for her tasks but that is the point.TO THE GOOD!This game had a very specific feel about it which I felt made it worth playing. The art style and music marry so well together that I forgave the shaky gameplay (at least for the most part). Depite its dodgy execution, I got what it was trying to show and it made for an enjoyable experience. The story wasn't as linear as what I've come to expect; whether thats a good or bad thing, im not entirely sure. Its fair to say Didi (the young girl) was a bit 'pushy' in trying to force you into the story, but I didnt really mind as my character is there to help her and the interactions of the character felt right for the situation.Theres plenty to find out beyond the game through exploration. I actually think these bits were what made the game as it added another level of story beyond Didi's life to something more personal for the character Dawn (who never speaks IIRC), also - great name without being something cheesy. I would throughly recommend you endevour to find the 20(I think?) hidden media snippets! It reminded me of Bioshock in that the information you find explains the situation youre in; but in a modest way.This game however is by no means difficult! I did the entire story in a single 2 hour sitting and found everything in that time. This wasn't even deliberately to finish it, I just felt like the game never lost traction and felt so, almost, calm to play that I kept casually playing. This isnt to say the story was good; it was weak with the hidden snippets making it interesting but it was solid enough in terms of character and situation.Overall, as someone who does try to game as much as possible, I can't honestly say its a great game. But for me, it was incredibly playable and I will revisit it again gladly. It was like listening to music, I did indeed just easily loose track of time and do it. I found it quite charming if I'm being honest.I played it with a controller if that means anything? You wont need the precision or focus of a kb+m but thats just my preference for this game. I would also say if youre on the fence about it, its probably best you wait till a sale comes around. I don't think I paid full price and despite enjoying it, don't know if its worth it. Definately feels like it should be £6.99 or similarly priced. Wouldn't be upset if I did pay retail though.			"

												Contrast is a unique little game. While the storyline is considerably brief, the puzzles can be intriguing, especially when the mechanic of switching in/out of the shadows becomes a touch glitchy. I will admit, it's not a jawdropping experience. There are technical aspects that need tweaking, such as a puzzle I was basically able to skip without noticing on the first try, but the effort is heartfelt and a bizarrely cute experience.That being said, I would not pay the list price for this game. I bought it when it was 40% off (around $8), and that was good enough for me. I would be onboard, however, if the studio were ever to invest in a larger scale version of the game, with some of the mechanics polished up.			"

												I have just finished playing this game; I completed it within about just over 4 hours. I will admit that they game is extremally short for the cost of the game (Although I did buy my copy on sale - I recomend that you wait till the sales come on) I was left feeling like the game wasnt really finished and that a lot of things where unexplained. But!!! I did really enjoy this game, I wont lie, its a good game and maybe the ending is suppose to be a mystery? its a very mysterious game. You play as Dawn a very interesting looking lady, that you really feel cool to play as, with her cool concept design and awesome abilities like turning into a shadow. Dawn follows Didi - a little girl who wants to sneak out to go see her mother singing and suddenly you discover the story behind Didi and her family and what is going on with them. The game is set in the 1920's and has wonderful music and a lovely Jazz theme to the story. The animations are amazing and some of the little pick up items you find along the way give you more detail as to whats go on and can be really interesting! You will find yourself becoming attatched to some of the characters and not wanting to pause the game :)Overall I would recommend the game as its interesting and unique in the story and game play and I would play this game just to listen to the music and feel the atmosphere:Pros-------- Great music and atmosphere all the way through- Great characters and concept art for items and puzzles and different areas- Good voice acting and dialogue is interesting and sometimes funny / sweet- Unique and fun ideas like turning into a shadow - Very interesting game - will make you hooked!!Cons-------- Minor glitches in gameplay and once in dialogue- Extremally short game....- Game ending will leave you wondering mosre about the story and will feel slighty unfinished...- Puzzles are very easy "

												The main mechanic of the game is very unique and quite fun to wrap your head around. Music is both haunting and enchanting all at once and the visual style is beautiful in an artistic- rather than purely technical, polygonal county way.Controls are responsive though edge detection could use a little polish. There were times when a jump looks like it should've landed but the character 'bumps' the edge and falls. Luckily, the checkpoint system is very forgiving and no more than 5 minutes of progress was ever lost through multitudes of jumping off edges.Level design Is a little inconsistent with a lot of levels containing linear solutions while others allow solutions that skip the entirety of the puzzles via jumping on objects in the 'real world' and dashing into the 'shadow world'. However, this is hard to fault as the shadow mechanics are very complex melding 2D and 3D puzzles across the levels.The way the story is told is very unique as well. Since pretty much all the story is told in the 'shadow world', each scene feels like a snapshot of what's happening with a slight time leap in between each one. The pacing of the story is well enough that it never feels like a drag. There is a drive to see what's next. This is all backed up by some pretty fantastic voice acting with moments of melancholy, angst, and anger delivered with emotion. The developers have left the ending a bit open for interpretation so those who are looking for a clear cut finish where everything is answered will be a bit irked. However, those who enjoy discussing interpretations with others will find a nice conversation with others in the same boat.Though it might be a bit short time-wise, it doesn't artificially inflate the time to beat. So it's enjoyable from start to end.			"

												I loved the art style and unique shadow puzzles. It was a very enjoyable game, just wish it was longer. Thanks for making it! On a sidenote: There was a saving issue with the game. Not sure if it was a steam compatibility issue or what, but I lost all my inital saves. So I restarted and just played right through. Short enough game that I was able to deal with the bug.			"

												Well where to start ? Okay I have been waiting for two years to play this game. It finally came out and so I did. It is simply like a critic once said ''It is like Limbo and Bioshock had a child together and Contrast is that child''. So rightous but also very indipendent from those games. Contrast has some references from both Bioshock and Limbo which I love them both and after I saw them I felt very touched. It's gameplay is very very unique and it has some science in it too like quantum physics and parallel universes as A.Einstein stated. My only complain was about the puzzles. Yes I know this is a puzzle platformer but it gives you so much puzzle and a little story on the sides that you would like to have some more because I think it was awesomely fair. Soundtrack is amazing if you are into Jazz/Blues. Modelling and artwork is also dashing. Ofcourse game has its problems when it comes to performance but then again this game never got a big budget so I can not blame the producers. Story is depressive and gloomy but with that being said, I like that kind of stories because life is like that too. To sum it all up, I am perfectly OK with the money I spent on this game (which I preordered it) and easily can recommend this to people around me.			"

												Contrast is a very well-done and innovative Indie game. It falls into the puzzle genre, but utilizes first-person character control and does require a bit of speed.Like all games, Contrast has its merits and pitfalls. Some things I really liked about the game are:- A very well-thought-out and touching story- Beautiful soundtrack (especially ""Kat's Song"". Youtube it!)- A unique gameplay mechanic- Some decently challenging puzzles- Beautifully done art. Many noir games and movies nowadays are just creepy and Sin City-like. This is a much more refreshing take on the noir theme.And some things that weren't so great:- I don't know anyone who has clocked more than 10 hours to beat this- Some minor bugs- a reference to Albert Einstein in an earlier time period (learn your history, people!)Simply put, Contrast is very well-done and a must-buy for any Indie fan. People who liked story-intensive games such as Bastion will definitely enjoy Contrast more than most. Of course $15 for a game this short may pinch wallets, so do wait for a sale. And of course, we hope to hear of a second game from Compulsion Studios soon. =D			"

												A very good game with a really good story and two loveable protaganists. The story is really fun and interesting with a cool twist at the end.My only complaint about this game is the platforming, as it's really ahrd to shift between 2D/3D etc. However it's an interesting concept, one that I have never seen before.

												My only complaint about contrast is that its short and the replay value isnt good. HOWEVER the game as a whole is very pretty, i loved the world and the mood. My original thoughts of the storyline was turned way upside-down. The story isnt not what you expect if you're the type to analize storylines. All and all, its worth playing, but expect to spend no more then perhaps 3 hours to get through it all unless you're a complitionist and have to get EVERYTHING....then 4 hours. try it!			"

												This game has a very good puzzle solving mechanic, using shadows as a way of over coming obstacles is imaginative. The lack of game play is a down side as it only took me 3 hours to complete the story and the achievements. A few collision glitches here and there but otherwise a decent game.

												Contrast, to put into a single word, is marvelous. Its graphics are well detailed, and the way that light is used in this game is borderline genius. The voicework is well done for all characters. The music is excellent, being very rythmic and jazzy. And the story is quite interesting. The collection of collectable that you can obtain is both expansive and impactful for the length of the game. The Bioshock-esque way of using collectables to explain plot points was well done. It was always interesting to read an article about a missing person, or seeing a picture of the ""scientific"" explainations of the shadow world. The light puzzles that are used are especially interesting because the game mechanic of switching between two worlds is wonderfully unique and fun. All of these factors really combine to create an incredible atmosphere.However no game is without its imperfections. Though I do, in fact, recommend this game to anyone who wants a interesting experience, I must also explain the game's faults. Contrast has 2 major flaws which both fall into the gameplay category. The main problem is that Dawn, the main character, is incredibly floaty. She's a tad hard to control because her jump arc seems a tad unnatural. The second would probably be the camera. See the having the camera be controlled by the mouse is fine in third person, but when you enter the shadow world the camera tends to be kinda random, causing you to have to adjust your mouse in odd ways. The small gameplay flaws that Contrast has pales in comparison to the experience of playing it though. Playing through the game is honestly just a marvelous experience, because of it's brilliant atmosphere, as well as its unique concept.			"

												This is probably one of the best puzzle games I've played. If you have any liking for French jazz culture, this is the game for you. It is all about using light in creative ways to solve puzzles, most of which are platforming. My favorite pieces are the music which was put together with care. The vocalist they hired to sing a couple songs has the perfect voice for this type of jazz. All of the voice acting is quite solid. The other piece that drew me in was the use of shadows to represent characters rather than physical beings. I think that is explained through collectibles, but I haven't spent much time with it. Contrast also manages to portray a sense of innocence surrounding Didi while giving some very adult conflicts when she's not around. The only real issue I had was with either the controls or the design, I'm not sure. Sometimes when something seemed easy to accomplish, like a jump, you'd be force off the wall for some reason and have to start over. Basically I think some of the shadows in the environment were unintentional and created surprise blocks for you to avoid. It could also just be I'm not very practiced at platformers. The puzzles seem well designed and not too challenging to figure out. After figuring out what needs to be done, you may still need to take a few tries at it before succeeding, but it isn't usually too frustrating.It is quite a short game if you figure out the puzzles quickly, it took me maybe 6 hours. So I probably wouldn't buy it for full price just because of the length, but I would definitely buy it on sale. Also, the soundtrack is a great jazz compilation.One last note: at I believe the end of the first act, there are two endings depending on if you just stand and watch, or actively do something (I don't want to give spoilers) If you don't do anything, you'll fail the level and be put back to the beginning of the dialogue, so I recommend just listening first, then actually doing what you're supposed to.

												A clever but underachieving adventure / puzzle game elevated at times by an interesting setting and story.For those of you that don't know, your character can blend between 3d person and 2d projected platforming by stepping into the light projected onto walls. Shadows become walls, floors and even lifts to new areas. At its best it feels like a mix of fez and portal, but at its worst the shadow stepping can be awkward and unreliable.The pacing is acceptable and there seem to be multiple ways to approach some puzzles, but there's no serious challenge here.The setting falls somewhere between Bugsy Malone and Alice in Wonderland, but doesn't fully deliver on either. The noir story is a nice touch, but not gritty enough for my tastes, and whilst the worlds warp and float like a fever dream this fact is entirely ignored by the characters. I would not have been shocked to see: ""But it was all a dream. The End""There were some beautiful moments towards the end of the game where a deeper meaning is hinted, but it arrived a little late.If you're curious, pick it up on a good sale day, but you're looking for puzzle, platforming or story, this game hits under average on all accounts.

												All in all, the game was a very fun, unique experience. I bought the game when it was 40% off and at the price I paid ($8.99), it was worth the money. That being said, I do worry about if I believe $15 is a fair price for Contrast. It just went a little bit too quick for a price like that. The controls are not as bad as you'd expect either, as some say that the controls are a little weird. In game, the puzzles are simple, yet enjoyable. How simple a story may appear to be could really turn into something remarkable and kind of mind-boggling. To conclude, great game, worth the money I paid, and I plan to play it again to collect all of the collectibles, so replay value is moderate. 8.5/10			"

												I'm really enjoying the atmosphere, and the story is both intriguing and mysterious to a degree. The puzzles have been challenging, varied, and entertaining. My one complaint is the platforming bits. Many of them are timed based on a spot of dialogue that is playing, which means that everytime you make a mistake, you basically have to listen to a whole cutscene over again. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that the shadow puppets you are walking on sometimes move in ways that ""throw"" you off of them, which is very difficult to predict. So part of these challenges becomes memorization, and trial and error. Which coupled with the replaying dialogue, makes a really interesting, innovative, and gorgeous blend of story and gameplay somewhat tiresome to replay until you get it right.I'd definitely recommend it, since it is otherwise very, very good so far.

												Extremely short, but very good game.  Unless you are a collector and want to find everthing in this game you can beat it in about 2 hours.  If you like collecting and learning a bit more about this lore of the game it take about 3.5 hours depending how good you are at solving these puzzles.Over all  The controlls where excellent, a little sticky here and there in certain spot probably from my own doing.There are a few spots in the game though if you lose a critical piece to the puzzle you must killl yourself to restart that part to get that critical piece back.  It was kind of annoying to have to jump off a ledge to respawn a box that I needed to have for a very small part of a leve.Overall the visuall are fantastic, the use of light and shadows are amazing and it takes into effect 2D planes.Over all if you want to kill a few hours with a very good puzzle game I would download this, But due to the shortness of the game I would suggest to buy it on a sale or give it to a friend when it goes on sale.

												Just finished the game and now here is my review.This game has a LOT of positive aspects and two negative aspects.Let's start with the cons: it's really short. Dramatically short. And the price isn't too high.Besides that the atmosphere is really magical, the idea of switching between the 3d world to the 2d world of shadows is really great and offers you some enjoyable moments and some locations are... dunno... special? I passed 10 minutes just staring the carousel.The main story is simple but a lot of other parallel stories are just outlined. So the game lets you dream about them. Who is Dawn? Why you can see Didi but the other people are just shadows for you? And how can Didi see you? Is she somehow special? The people see you as a shadow too? Is there a special relationship between Dawn and Vincenzo?...and above all... there will be a Contrast2? :D "

												Contrast was really well done, and I thoughly enjoyed it.Gameplay: 7.5/10Pros: Makes me think of Super Paper Mario, because in this game you switch back in forth between 3D and 2D platformming.Cons: Few qinks here and there nothing to bad. Example being some switchs you have to be facing just the right way for them to work. For every cutscene in the game the screen would fade to black before which can get annoying after awhileGraphics: 9.5/10Pros: Beautiful. Just Beautiful. The 1920's noir feel with the cartoony flair was well done 10/10 here.Cons. Some draw distance issues like pop ins, and flashes. Nothing to bothersome.Story: 9/10Pros: Very well written in my opinion. A lot darker then I expected, but given how the games looks it fits perfectly.Cons: ShortOverall: 9/10Well done game with only a few minor issues. Only major complaint is its short.			"

												Beautiful piece of bliss to play. Charming story, characters and atmosphere, and astoundingly good music. The game in itself is rather short, but personally I find that that's part of the whole ""magic"" of it. It's sweet, and touching, but it doesn't get boring with needless hours of repetitive gameplay. Speaking of which, the whole jumping in and out of the ""shadow dimension"" is amazing. Awesome idea, really difficult to implement. The quality of this game in general is dazzling. Contrast had me with a dumb smile on my face whenever I wasn't frowning over a particularly challenging shadow puzzle (yes, Vincenzo, I'm looking at you and your lab). I sincerely loved this game and would recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't really a puzzle fan. The music alone makes it worth it. And if jazz ain't your cup of tea, the story and the atmosphere ought to do the rest. Truly, truly a jewel. I am forever in debt with my past self for spending the twenty bucks it cost me then (I got myself the collector's edition, with the soundtrack and stuff).			"

												I really enjoy this game. The art style is nice and pleasing, but not over the top. There are nice things about the game, and I recommend it, but there are somethings that should be said. First, its very short. I didn't expect it to be that short to where I could be it in 4 hours after ♥♥♥♥ing up on puzzles and not being actually active in-game for a part of it. Second, there are some small ""bugs"" that are annoying. You'll find them. Next the story could be a bit more indepth. I feel it takes on the Bioshock type of feel of mystery is a plot itself but in reality a bit more of exploration and discovery would be nice. There are very little if a handful of ""extra"" things you can do in this game. Being gathering collectibles or luminaries which dont have any impact on the game or seem to give you extra completion or unlock more content, which would be interesting if it was that way. Overall it was a good game but it definitely could be better. The puzzles were a bit of a challenge and interesting but nothing to say ""this is a good puzzle game""If you like Noir type games like myself you can look past all of that and appreciate the style of this game.

												A great sense of style, setting and a lovely storyline. Puzzle-platformer centred on one game mechanic.You use lights to create shadows on walls which you can then blend into and become a 2D shadow yourself and use the shadows you made as platforms to get from one area to the next. My only real critique is that it's far too short. Even I managed to complete it after 3hrs, according to Steam, and I'm about as competent as a fish on a bicycle.			"

												This game was innovative and fun.  Has a very dark dreamlike aspect that reminds me of American McGee's Alice.  The story and the atmosphere also work very well together.  The only issues I have with the game are the mismatch between the visuals and the actual collision points (there was even a light beam that was not properly aligned with its source).  This definitely decreased the immersiveness of the game.  The other issue is that the game has absolutely no replay value AND it's very short.  One or the other is fine, but both is not good.Well worth playing but get it on deep discount because it will take only a little more time than a long movie to complete. "

												Wow! This is a wonderful little game. The music, the visuals, the story... they're absolutely fantastic. Dawn, your character, is an acrobat with this awesome ability to 'shift' into the shadows, helping you and your little friend, Didi, to traverse the world and help out Didi's pretty complicated family. When you're in the shadows, it's very Limbo-esque, though not quite as rage-inducing. When in the normal world, it's got a great♥♥♥♥♥♥Tracy feel to it, with sleazy gangsters and classy dames everywhere.My only issue with it is the length. 3.8 hours later and I'd completed the story, collected everything, and 100%ed the achievements. However, I can forgive it for this, as the story was great, and the puzzles were fun to solve, particularly as you have to think in both normal and shadow terms.			"

The main mechanic of the game - switching between physical 3D space and shadows 2D space is well done and an interesting mechanic to spend the game time fully wrapping your head around. Controller support is well mapped, if you prefer it. Save for a single annoying puzzle, I definitely recommend this for any platformer or story-based game fan.			"

												Contrast is one of those games that has a good premise - the idea of use light and shadows to create a separate bit of 2D puzzle gameplay from the normal 3D world, but the implementation from a story and setting as well as design is a bit disconnected.  The technical approach is good in how you can shift in an our of shadows, but the problem is that the areas you can do this in are very limited and separated from each other, making each puzzle its own microcosm.   The puzzles that use this aren't that difficult as well, with the most difficult ones being where you can either move objects to change shadows or the location of the light source. Again, with the puzzles being separate entities, these are one-stop problems as opposed to part of a larger difficult mechanism to figure out.The story is interesting but it's hard to get into and leaves some questions on getting into the characters. Whether this is a fantasy, a dream, or something else isn't clear, and whether it is a flashback or the like.  As such, the game quickly devolves into just moving from puzzle to puzzle with story getting in the way.It is still a decent game, but it's one I'd wait for a sale for, getting about 3 hrs of playtime from it.

												The trailer does not do this game justice. My initial reason for purchasing this game was mostly for the jazz album I would get as part of the collectors edition ;) But as soon as I started playing it, I was hooked. I really like what they did with the game; the graphics are amazing (for anyone who appreciates abstract, almost creepy, beauty); the characters were very well created, the puzzles are challenging, and overall a good game. However, I feel like the story line lacks a little bit. Gameplay is roughly 5.5 hours (even going through slowly and doing all the ""extra"" stuff), and consists of a girl basically reuniting her parents. There is so much potential the producers could have done with this game, and that's my only complaint. I really wish they would have done more with it because this game was so great! Even though the size of the map doesn't compare to that of Rust (for those of you who are familiar with that), it was so beautifully and artistically created. Very glad I invested in this game and I would definitely play it again to get the collectables I didn't find ;) Plus, if you purchase the collectors edition, you will get a bunch of artwork including details of the making of the characters and other such things, as well as 15 jazz songs that you can save right to your iTunes library :)			"

												Contrast, to put into a single word, is marvelous. Its graphics are well detailed, and the way that light is used in this game is borderline genius. The voicework is well done for all characters. The music is excellent, being very rythmic and jazzy. And the story is quite interesting. The collection of collectable that you can obtain is both expansive and impactful for the length of the game. The Bioshock-esque way of using collectables to explain plot points was well done. It was always interesting to read an article about a missing person, or seeing a picture of the ""scientific"" explainations of the shadow world. The light puzzles that are used are especially interesting because the game mechanic of switching between two worlds is wonderfully unique and fun. All of these factors really combine to create an incredible atmosphere.However no game is without its imperfections. Though I do, in fact, recommend this game to anyone who wants a interesting experience, I must also explain the game's faults. Contrast has 2 major flaws which both fall into the gameplay category. The main problem is that Dawn, the main character, is incredibly floaty. She's a tad hard to control because her jump arc seems a tad unnatural. The second would probably be the camera. See the having the camera be controlled by the mouse is fine in third person, but when you enter the shadow world the camera tends to be kinda random, causing you to have to adjust your mouse in odd ways. The small gameplay flaws that Contrast has pales in comparison to the experience of playing it though. Playing through the game is honestly just a marvelous experience, because of it's brilliant atmosphere, as well as its unique concept.			"

												Contrast is a unique little game. While the storyline is considerably brief, the puzzles can be intriguing, especially when the mechanic of switching in/out of the shadows becomes a touch glitchy. I will admit, it's not a jawdropping experience. There are technical aspects that need tweaking, such as a puzzle I was basically able to skip without noticing on the first try, but the effort is heartfelt and a bizarrely cute experience.That being said, I would not pay the list price for this game. I bought it when it was 40% off (around $8), and that was good enough for me. I would be onboard, however, if the studio were ever to invest in a larger scale version of the game, with some of the mechanics polished up.			"

ConceptA 2D/3D platformer where you can merge with walls to become a shadow. Utilize this to explore new possibilities in platforming.StoryThe game is divided up into chapters and acts, which you can select from the main screen if you wish. However, the game is really short. I clocked in with about 4 hours on my first playthrough, an hour of which I don't think I was playing. In addition, some mechanic frustrations also prolonged my playthrough.You play as a character named Dawn, whom only Didi can see. Didi is a child of a broken family who is trying to get back together leading to the different levels you encounter. Sometimes this leads to some interesting levels.The game also tries to induce a little mystery of if Dawn is real or not and what exactly is she. However, the game doesn't go too far along that route that it doesn't really matter, especially at the end.GraphicsThe graphics are okay. I had to run this on low settings so I cannot testify how great it can be besides online videos and pictures. I also wonder if the lack of some environment is a result of my computer or design. It does lead to some cool views. The shadow style is a pretty nifty idea that helps distract the player. As I was watching the cutscenes, I was wondering if people can be charmed by simply a shadow on the wall and a voice.SoundThe game has a Jazz music style. It fits with the setting, and the vocals aren't bad in that respect.

The vocals are actually fairly good too. Didi can get annoying sometimes, but sometimes her actions actually brought a smile. It's interesting that Dawn is voiceless but I guess that's to keep the player guessing what she is exactly and if she's real.GameplayThis game had a lot of promise. The idea of manipulating shadows to create solid platforming makes it a small thinking game as well. When I was little, I used to contemplate how interesting it would be if you can become a shadow. This game allows me to play with that idea a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked.You are given 5 basic controls for most of the game. Movement, Interaction, Shifting, Jump, and Dash. You also have control of the camera, which leads me to controller preferences. You do not want to play this game with a mouse and keyboard if you can avoid it. The camera is controlled with the mouse, which you also use for Dash and Shifting. This becomes a problem when you accidently move the camera while meaning to shift or dash. It has led me to many frustrations. The camera setting with the mouse is also too sensitive even after I adjusted it to get it right. When I switched to a 360 controller, the experience improved greatly. The camera was fine and my hands were less confused with which button was shift and which was dash.This game has no action in it, which is good for this style. Since there are no enemies to fight, you can focus on the platforming and puzzles you are given. The promise of the game expands with the different mechanics you find in the different chapters. There is some room for exploration, but not too much freedom. ONe time when I wanted to wander, Didi would interfere and force me to continue.Speaking of Didi, this game started to make me think about useless companions in video games; Didi is one of them. While you need to follow her to know what you next mission is, she never really helps you out. There is one occasion where she helps you out in the story and that is it. It's a shame because the image I posted near the top seemed to promise that you can use Didi to create an environment for you. There is one particular scene where I wish I could have controlled Didi to use something she was right next to instead of me doing something more complex than it needed.One of the things that could use some fine tuning is the mechanics. I resorted to Gamefaqs for one thing only to find that I was doing it right all along, but the game mechanics would screw it up.  The glitch I'm referring to is the game forcing you or an object to shift out where it shouldn't. Eventually I got it to work, but I was still upset over the whole thing. Unfortunately, the mechanics would still be glitchy every now and then, forcing me to restart multiple times when I should have easily progressed. It's a shame too, because if it wasn't for the occasional glitchy mechanics, it would have been a solid platformer. The game does have some redemption on the matter by giving you multiple checkpoints to restart from when you die and it doesn't take too long to reload.ReplayabilityAs mentioned before, the game is short and you can select specific chapters to play again. However, with the frustrations I encountered with the mechanics, and the story not being so grand, I probably would stay away from it for a while before trying to play again.OverallThis is one of those little disappointments for me. The game has promise and it shows it in sparks throughout the game. Unfortunately, it never completely capitalizes on it's potential. It can give you an interesting experience, but I think I would have more faith if they did a sequel with solid mechanics. This is a game where you might want to wait for a good sale before you buy it (maybe $5-7).My recommendation is for platforming fans who want to try something a little different. If you play with a controller and on a computer that can run it smoothly, then it is less frustrating and possible to enjoy.Taken from my blog at http://www.ign.com/blogs/falconrise/2014/02/16/game-review-contrast-for-pc "

												Contrast is a very stylish fantasy-noir. For some reason it has drawn some unfair and rather harsh criticism for one reason or another, presumably by a few gamers expecting a lot more.For me, Contrast's platforming gameplay relies on some exceptional lighting physics: the phasing in and out of shadow showcases some astounding programming by the developers.The period-noir setting is a nice touch - whilst there are references to Einstein, the turn-of-the-century-science and experiments with quantum physics and the 4th dimension could have gone a lot deeper.But as it is, Contrast is a satisfying and very enjoyable game. Of course it has a few glitches and quirks, but in the case of Contrast, the developers came up with an ambitious proposal, and pulled it off with aplomb.			"

												Contrast is a Puzzle/Adventure game developed and created by Compulsion Games. In this game, you play as Dawn, a young woman who has the supernatural ability to morph into her own shadow and interact with other shadows. You get to play in two dimensional worlds: 2D and 3D worlds, as you help a little girl, to whom you are friends with, fix her parents' problems and renunite them under a more peaceful bond once more.This game is a Puzzle game, meaning that as you continue along your adventure, you will be faced with puzzles that you must solve in both 2D and 3D worlds. What do I have to say about this game?Perhaps a marvel of creativity with non-stop interest as to what will happen next. Truly, this game is its own genius in Optics.			"

												The wasted potential in this game physically pains me. It has so much to offer and right when you think that you'll get more it's over. Considering its price i wouldn't normally recommend it. ConsThe controls are brokenThe graphics are mediocre Glitches everywhere The transition from 3d to 2d is a nightmareThe story is flatPros (and why i recommend it)The idea is lovely and if it was 4euros or even free  i would say 10/10. The mechanics are simple and there's only a main story to follow. No confusion as to where to go, no useless sidequests. I really liked moving though the shadows and some quests nailed it. Also the shadow cinematics on which you have to walk, in order to get some items where very aesthetically pleasing, a really nice touch to be honest.  I want to see more of this and i also have great hopes for We Happy Few so i want to support the team.  Since my main problem with this game is that it needs more of everything, i guess that also means more money, therefore, more support. I recommend this because i think this team can do better and i want to see a sequel.  The story could definitely still go on and i think it should. tl;dr: It's worth playing but don't get your hopes up			"

												A great little game. And the little part only comes because it's pretty short. That shouldn't make you look away though. The idea behind it is pretty original and refreshing. Going in and out of shadows definately sounds cool! The story is interesting yet a bit rushed. It felt like the creators ran out of ideas or twists to make it a bit more lengthy and try to flesh more out of the characters' pasts and personalities. And boy did they neglect Dawn's part concerning that! The collectibles offer a bit of information on some stuff but still it felt lacking. Apart from that (and a bit clunky camera) the game is beautiful. The 1920s atmosphere is given pretty nicely and the visuals seem like taken out of a painting. Plus it also gives off a feeling that you are actually in a dreamworld. The music draws you in before you even press start with that song in the title screen and it continues to accompany you pretty well throughout most of the game. The controls were ok. The puzzles were simple and fun, except a couple of times where you might not do it the correct way thus leading you in a dead end (hint: pirate ship) and you are forced to reload the last save. Thankfully the game autosaves frequently so you won't have to go back a lot, usually just before you start the puzzle event.Although i doubt it, i hope we get to see a sequel sometime in the future, but that's just me. The ending could be seen as both conclusive and open at the same time. Depends on each person and how they interpret it. All in all a great experience. If it's on sale grab it asap. 7.5/10			"

												This is a platform adventure game with a twist.  The 3-D setting is nice to look at, but the scope of it is limited.  Most of your focus will be on how to properly manipulate light and shadows to get around obstacles and reach ""hidden"" items that are actually quite visible but hard to reach.  In most cases, the solution is obvious.  There are no enemies to defeat.  You are an acrobat, not a fighter!  As for the setting and plot:  it is the 1920's (think film noire but in color) and you are the imaginary friend of a little girl with a broken family.  The girl is trying to find a way to keep her family from splitting up, and you are trying to help.  Most of the hidden items you find are clues to what is happening in the real world while the poor girl slowly goes ""crazy"" because she sees the world differently from the grown-ups.  Her madness is evident in the twisted and broken state of the world in which you travel, which is a reflection of the girl's mental state and memories.The game is VERY short, you can finish it in just a few hours.  The path is always obvious and you have strict limits about where you can go; you can never stray much outside of the world known to the little girl because you will find great chasms at the edges of her memories.  The way you can become a shadow when you stand against any well-lit surface is pretty cool though.  In many instances you will need to move objects in the 3-D world in order to open a new path in the shadows in order to progress in the game.  It really is a unique and fun game mechanic.So, the bottom line...yeah this game is fun, but very short and straightforward.  There are no enemies, no boss fights, no NPCs to talk to or get side quests from, no level-up system... just platforming with travel through shadows.  The story is a nice mix of sweet and sad but really nothing to write home about.  The setting and graphics are stylized and cute, but not exactly beautiful.  So, I'd say go ahead and grab this game if it's available for a really cheap price.  If you pay more than $5 for it, you're paying too much.			"

												+++ Unique and compelling gameplay concept.+++ Tight storytelling.+++ Trippy art direction.--- Late stages marred by glitchy platforming.--- Very short!Contrast excels by keeping things simple and tight: a story with few characters, a small world that's packed with everything it needs, and well thought-out gameplay mechanics - although some of the puzzles will have a tendency to glitch out against the player, requiring several adjustments and restarts.17 CDN is quite steep for a game that can be blown through in less than three hours, but it's definitely worth a shot while on sale.  It's a proof of concept that has potential to live as a full-fledged, longer sequel.			"

												This game had potential, espicailly with the ideas presented in the items you find in the lighthouse, but it didn't take that chance to be better. It was a nice game but all too short for my taste. I could have seen something greater come of the idea of being able to switch back and forth from the shadow realm to ""reality"" I guess, but the game didn't take that chance, so the story was very very shallow when it could have become something deeper and better. Switching between 2D and 3D gameplay was very cool, I liked that concept of it, but overall the game could have been better with a better story potential and longer gameplay.So if you want to play it, I would get it onsale; otherwise it's not worth the money.

The plot is rich too, main story about how an unsuccessful father trying his best to regain his family, while Didi and her shadow friend trying everything to support him- with more small stores coming including the puppet show, which tells a story about princess saves a prince lol.Very interesting, renowned design and intriguing storyline. The finale is quite fast through but I like it. Hope there would be a sequel of this game and if so I'll absolutely try.10/10. Great job!!!			"

												Short puzzle platformer with a fine ambiance and interesting mechanics.You need to use elements of your surroundings in 3D and in shadow form to progress through the game, set in an older looking French city, and help little girl Didi to get her family back together.It is a bit clunky at times. The camera isn't very smart and while using a controller it can be bothersome. I also managed to take an unexpected shortcut and solved a puzzle in an unintended way. Plus, you tend to jump out of the shadow world for seemingly no reason but it isn't too bad of a problem since the game saves your progession pretty often. In short it feels like the developpers lacked funds to make it flawless.As I said it is a short game. Steam hasn't taken into account my first play session which was about 2 hours long so add it to the amount displayed on my review. I recommend the game to anyone feeling interested but would advise to wait for a discount as there is not enough to make it worth the initial price of 15€.			"

												Contrast is an expressive puzzle-narrative in film noir style. The game is about four hours long and employs some innovative mechanics (such as stretching, narrowing, etc the same shadows to reach multiple places. The programming isn't polished, but it's definitely playable. I only glitched out twice. My biggest critique is the general lack of ambient noise/music. A bit more jazz here or there, or some overheard side conversations would have added a bit to the lonely world.The closing words of bioshock infinite go along well with this game. I would recommend buying it solely for the artistic feel and the decent story progression.			"

												This game has promise to it but for me the voice actor for the child is grating along with the lack luster story due to it this game has a very neat mechanic but it falls abit flat that it restricts the ways to solve said puzzle. only thing saving this was the music and the art style but the music loses it's charm quickly and the art style last when you can of course see it. 3/10 for the price leave it alone			"

												I saw a preview of this game and thought that the gameplay mechanics of it were creative and interesting, so I bought it and I wasn't disappointed. This game has some of the most unique machanics among games I've played and many of the puzzles are well designed and challenging. The music is nice, there's good humor here and there, the graphics are decent, and the story is straightforward. However, the game does have its drawbacks which are mainly the lousy controls, funky physics, and unstable environments all of which often interfere with gameplay.Overall, I'd recommend this game as something quick, fun, and different.

												To give it a typical score, I'd say 8/10, but a strong 8/10.It's not a very long game, I have to say, which only hurts more because the gameplay is so fun. Jumping in and out of shadows and moving sources of light to solve puzzles reminiscent of Portal, but more of a platformer and with more actiony gameplay. The controls and level design are pretty solid too.As far as aesthetics go, the music suits the story and overall design really well. The story doesn't say too much outright, but it has a few nice little twists.Really, what would put this game over the top, is more content. Either more official levels via DLC or just random updates, or a level creator feature for players to make and share their own levels. After finishing the game in one sitting, I'm really just left wanting more.			"

												In this game you play as an imaginary friend of a little girl and you can switch between moving in 3D and in 2D running on the shadows. You spend the game being ordered round by the little girl to help sort out the failures of her screw up step father but he is not a likeable bumbling failure like Inspector Gadget he just seems like a walking disaster where the family would just be better off without him. The story is short (less then 4 hours to complete the game with all achievements)  but it does have its moments. The environment is excellent with its slightly subverted cityscape, striking lighting, 1920s atmosphere and good music. The platforming mechanic is the weak point of the game, the trailers show really fast paced smooth gameplay but in actual fact it is rather awkward there is a lot of slightly moving objects round and repeatedly jumping at things until you get it just right. Overall I am still going to recommend this game it is a very nice unique platforming mechanic it is just not quite as good as I expected.			"

												This is a very charming story-driven platformer with a wonderful little mechanic. It runs very smoothly even on the highest settings and while it's a fairly short game, a lot of work went into it. The voice acting is great, the story is very cute, and the concept is just brilliant. I'd definitely suggest giving the game a try. It's graphically stunning and the art style is so clever.That being said... I do warn against a few frustrating puzzles. Not because the puzzles are particularly challenging, but because sometimes the mechanic can be frustrating. There are times that the controls aren't sensitive enough, or are too sensitive, and there are a few minor glitches that can be annoying. Sometimes the slightly wonky controls can break your enjoyment. But all in all, the game is charming.			"

												I used a controller for this and at the beginning the controls were a bit finicky but Im not sure if it was because of the controller... I also got this on sale.I liked this games design and atmosphere it gave off, aesthetically wise it looked good with a real nice feel. I'd recommend this for the design, but not the gameplay. Although the idea of the game was good the presentation of the game via the story wasn't.The story was meh, and the puzzles were ok, and if you combine all of this together I don't think the game is worth its full price (in my opinion).When I was playing it, I really got into the idea of the story... and then the credits roled in and I was just sitting there confused and a little disappointed that there wasn't more, it's only about 2 hours of gameplay.

												Contrast is a puzzle based platform game, developed by Compulsion Games.In this game you follow the story of a small girl Didi Malenkaya who has an imaginary friend called Dawn.No one else can see Dawn, but that does not mean she does not exsist.Didi found herself in a world where she only sees people as shadows.Her parents are having relationship problems and many debts to pay off. They both are too busy to take care of Didi, her mother Kat Malenkaya works as a singer at the Ghost Note cabaret while her father Johnny Fenris has been kicked out of the house because of doing business with gangsters in order to make some money.Child services have threatened to take Didi away from her mother.Didi can't stand this situation anymore and together with Dawn she sneaks out of the house to save the situation between her parents.Contrast is set in a 1920 Nior atmosphere.In this game you play as Dawn who has the ability to shift into the 2D shadow world and back into the 3D world. Throughout the game you have to help Didi solve puzzles that vary from moving objects between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world. Manipulating light sources in the 3D world such as spotlights, film projectors etc. will create shadow paths. These paths will lead Dawn to new areas containing collectibles like Luminaries (light sources) and Documents that reveal more about the story.Contrast felt like a very unique game because the ability of shifting between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world was something I have never seen before in games.Everything I already knew about puzzles games couldn't always match up to the puzzles in Contrast.This will make you think more out of the box, requires a little more creative thinking and raise the bar of puzzles.I must admit that Contrast has a short length of gameplay and the story itself does not have that much depth than I expected it to be.I really recommend Contrast for its unique experience but I don't think it's worth the full price, purchase the game when it's on sale.

												The soundtrack and art are beautiful. The whole shadow-light theme and puzzles are pretty good too. However, this game is too short. The story begins well but the ending is so rushed that I almost wish I didn't play it through the end. Overall completion time is barely 4 hours with all achievements.If you're going to buy it, do it while it's on sale (preferably more than 50% off). The main reason I don't regret buying it is because I spent only like 4 dollars.			"

												The game is VERY SHORT, taking about 3 hours to finish, so make sure you get it on sale. The game itself is rather enjoyable. There's a decent story but it feels like the designer's scope for it was much bigger. I liked that the puzzles felt kind of different with the use of shadows and lighting but in the end they weren't too challenging which I guess fits with how short the game is. It really felt like the game was intended to be more than it was. It really had a lot of potential with the characters, story, puzzles, and feel but was just too short of an experience. I don't know who the developer is so I can only assume this is their first title and they might not have had the capital to really see their entire project through.I still think the game is worth playing but that the price tag isn't justified considering the amount of play time you can actually get. There is no replay value either. You complete the game and get all the achievements basically in one evening. I do feel, however, that not recommending the game because of the price tag would be wrong because it is a pretty decent game. Did I mention it was short and to get it on sale? "

												I recommend the game with this caveat: it's about the experience of an art piece that has a few fun puzzles rather than the game as a whole.Pros:Beautiful art from top to bottom, with music to match.Story is just interesting enough to keep your attention between the likable protagonist and metaphysical plot points.Some genuinely clever puzzles to solve using the unique game mechanics.Cons:Controls/camera are not 100% solid. Some environment interactivity is awkward.The constant cut scenes and dialogue slow the pace more than they should.It's a shame they didn't go deeper into the supernatural mysteries they created.Overall I think this game really wanted to be a higher-priced title with a more fleshed-out story and extra polish on the mechanical aspects. But, if you are intrigued by the trailer and the screenshots, you'll probably enjoy it. "

However, if you want the 2D mechanic, get the Zelda game for the 3DS.  It's done with much more polish.  I'd say this game is about a 5/10--slightly below average.			"

It's a fresh indie title like non other I've played before. Try it!			"

												Contrast is a unique little game. While the storyline is considerably brief, the puzzles can be intriguing, especially when the mechanic of switching in/out of the shadows becomes a touch glitchy. I will admit, it's not a jawdropping experience. There are technical aspects that need tweaking, such as a puzzle I was basically able to skip without noticing on the first try, but the effort is heartfelt and a bizarrely cute experience.That being said, I would not pay the list price for this game. I bought it when it was 40% off (around $8), and that was good enough for me. I would be onboard, however, if the studio were ever to invest in a larger scale version of the game, with some of the mechanics polished up.			"

												BLURS THE LINES BETWEEN DARKNESS AND LIGHT In this game, you fight for no side as you need both darkness and light to get from Point A to Point B. I have never been this frustrated and fascinated with a game before. The controls take some time to get used to, so some necessary actions may take a while to do. I absolutely hated the moving shadow parts that you had to climb in order to get somewhere or in order to obtain an object. That, and the parts where you have to jump or speed past a shadowless area while in shadow form. It took me forever to get past them, but I pushed through anyway because I wanted to know how the story would end. Didi is a little girl with the misfortune of belonging to a broken family. Her father is nowhere to be found and her mother is a singer at a nightclub. Dawn is her imaginary friend-slash-babysitter who literally has the ability to walk in the shadows. Together, they try to solve the puzzle that is Didi's true identity and save the day. Speaking of puzzles, those are exactly what this game consists of. You'll have to think your way in, out, and around everything. It pays to be curious as there are collectibles to gather as well. These play a big part in explaining what the story is about. You also need to collect luminaries to power up certain objects. A good tip would be to think out of the box. Some solutions may surprise you and make you go, ""Why didn't I think of that before?"". I loved the graphics of this game. It's a bit dark, but charming in its own quirky way. It would have been better if they used more musical pieces though. This game is pretty quiet and, therefore, anti-climatic, but you'll be too busy listening to the gears in your head moving anyway, so it's a passable requirement. All in all, the game is a good mix between challenging, fun, and eye-opening. 7/10			"

 Save the circus, or jump to your death multiple times trying...  ...But it's not just Kat and Johnny's relationship that needs saving, you also get to repair a funfair ! 	Contrast is a fairly short game, which has its charming moments. It's atmospheric and witty but also has a very significant rage potential.	Biggest problems I've had : lack of checkpoints, and the controls are wonky. No, I mean really wonky. If Didi has to rely on an imaginary friend who can't jump onto a box right in front of her, or keeps dashing off the edge of the world and plummeting to her death, that kid had probably better join the circus... but we all know where that got her father...	The plot starts out fine, but the end feels rushed. Was personally expecting a bit more Didi, since she's meant to be the main character. However, I felt like the kid gets left out, both by her family and the game, replaced with quite a bit of fragile masculinity (see Johnny or Fred the Knight), and marriage issues (also Johnny).        On the whole, would recommend Contrast as it's very atmospheric and I loved the concept, but if you're unsure, I suggest waiting until it's on sale. ( + ) Positives  :+ visually pleasing+ great soundtrack+ amazing concept, mixing 2D and 3D+ fun puzzles (others not so much... trial and (t)error) ( - ) Negatives  :- A carousel of broken controls- Tragic lack of checkpoints making the game very much like Kat and Johnny's relationship : very difficult to save.- Game involves explicit language... on my part (mostly because of the previously mentioned points).- Broken fingers (see previous points)- … gurshdarn Fred the Knight			"

												It's far from a flawless game. It's about 3 hours long. There's not much replayability. The collectibles aren't very hidden and the achievements are easy. The controls are a bit clunky and the level design isn't great. Really, though, this game is more about the experience than the gameplay, and on that level, it's certainly good. It's not a grand, epic tale, it's a personal one for the characters, with a bit of backstory for the characters and a few twists hidden in the collectibles. There's a lot of neat touches in the game world, too, that I found really enjoyable and interesting. There's not a lot to be said about this game without spoiling it, honestly. I had one big issue with it though, a puzzle at the start of the third act that's... kinda terrible. But ehh. I liked this game! Would've liked to have a bit more of it than we got. I don't think it's a game worth its asking price, honestly, but I'm not the best judge of that.			"

												This is a fun game. Think Portal, if Portal were also Psychonauts.You play as Dawn, an acrobat with the ability to merge into her own shadow - and a curious inability to directly see or be seen by anyone other than Didi. This at first seems like simply an odd quirk, until the ending draws attention to it and refuses to actually offer explanation.The controls are good, if a little more responsive on the camera than I expected. The shadow-merging mechanic could use a little more polish - I often found myself popping out of the wall without being able to figure out why, and occasionally ended up across the room from where I had been a moment prior.The story is simple, which simply leaves more room to showcase the central mechanic and the world. Most characters (seen via projected shadows) talk with their hands a lot, presumably so you can tell who's talking as lips' shadows are very small.			"

												Contrast is like Bioshock Infinite, but a lot shorter.It revolves around that you as a player can fuse into shadows and move around in it, and by doing so clearing obstacles. You can mess around with objects and light sources to help you with the puzzles, and its a very interesting concept. But in some parts I feel the platforming in the shadows are a little bit clunky, and I have no idea why I would just jump out of the shadows sometimes without hitting any obstacles (well I assume i didnt hit anything).Music is great, voice acting is great, story can be better, controls are a bit awkward at times for both keyboard and controller,Good game overall, short but worth it. No brainer if its on discount.			"

												The pros:- The story is fantastic, and the voice acting is well done. The main character, Didi, is particularly good considering her age- The music creates a wonderful atmosphere, and the world is creatively put together. There are fascinating details throughout, that make you want to explore every nook and cranny- The platforming is clever, and for the most part the mechanics work. A few hiccups here and there, but usually there are work-arounds if you're patient enoughThe cons:- It doesn't say a controller is mandatory, but it should. You should be able to get through the first Act with just a mouse and keyboard, but after that it becomes more challenging. A controller will give you the freedom to maneuver that you're looking for.- Exploration is all but banned. Step too far to get a good look at something and a solid road may actually cause you to fall through the world. There's a lot of hand-holding, particularly in the quest objective that you can never remove from the screen. This is a pity, because it's tempting to take a lot of beautiful screenshots, but you can't without ""Follow Didi"" and ""Go back and meet Didi"" being scrawled on the upper right-hand side almost constantly.- There are few save points, no checkpoints, and no manual saves. This means that if you break a puzzle (it's possible) then resetting from the last save may put you behind a couple hours' worth of work, forcing you to do conquered puzzles over again.Overall, though, this very a very good game and very imaginative. Since the developers plan to make another game (though not a sequel) it will be interesting to see what they have in store.			"

												A unique concept that has been well executed. While it was difficult getting used to the controls at first, I soon found myself sucked into the game world. It is an eerie puzzle platformer that switches between 2d and 3d, sucking you in with the mystery of the girl and her story. Who is she? Who are you?

												Here are the cliffnotes of a review I wrote for this game elswhere:I’ve had this game on my Steam wishlist for a few months now and decided to grab it during the Winter Sale last week. I’m glad I did because, in retrospect, I wouldn’t have wanted to waste more money than I already did on it.  This is not something that I would call a puzzle game. A puzzle implies that there is an intricate mental test to perform that has a rewarding outcome if you can find and place all the pieces. To solve the puzzles in this game you just have to perform trial and error because there really is no intuitive puzzle to be had. You platform around as a shadow on the wall to perform an arbitrary task and that’s about it. The “puzzle” aspect comes in, I GUESS, when you turn a wheel or press a button and the shadows move and you continue platforming. Maybe it’s that some of the buttons are on timers? I suppose some people would consider that a puzzle……But if you find those people, please, remind them to take the plastic bag off of their head once in awhile. Bottom line: I wouldn’t recommend this game unless you have a big hard-on for platformers….But there ARE better platformers…..Much better. I’ve played about an hour and a half of the game and I’m over half done. I just simply don’t see any point in prolonging the review. I’m probably not even going to get around to finishing this game.			"

												The atmosphere, soundtrack and story are all good. It impressed me because I usually dislike jazz music and 1920's era settings.The viewpoint of the little girl being the only person who can see the player together with her backstory story of a broken family had me hooked.The shadow shifting concept is in my opinion very clever and the puzzles satisfying to complete. There were a few occasionaly problems with jumping where the controller buttons do not always make your character interact with platforms as you would expect. However I managed to overlook these as I was enchanted by the overall experience. Contrast is definitely worth playing. "

												In Contrast you play as Dawn, who may, or may not, be the imaginary friend of a young girl called Didi. The game is set in a surreal fantasy city with strong tones of 1920’s Paris. Your role in the game is to accompany and guide Didi on her adventures around the city. The story takes place during a single night when Didi has snuck out, to try and reunite her mother and her estranged father.Contrast is a platform game with environment traversal puzzles. The game is fully 3D, but its unique feature is the ability to shift into the 2D world of shadows cast upon walls. Dawn uses the shadows to reach areas inaccessible in the 3D ‘real’ world.Contrast is a short game, I finished it in two sittings over the course of a weekend. Far from a criticism, the longevity was one of the aspects I appreciated most. It never outstayed its welcome or outlived its enjoyment. Unlike most games I finished it because I enjoyed it and wanted to see how it ended, rather than feeling obliged to grind on to the finish line hours after it ceased being fun.Contrast is also a fairly easy game. No 3D platform game is without a few tricky jumping sections and Contrast is no exception. But I never encountered anything that caused me to quit in frustration and I never felt lost in the game world or became stuck overlong on any particular puzzle. I never encountered any bugs, crashes, glitches or clipping errors during my play through.I enjoyed Contrast, particularly the art style and character design. I have a feeling that I would have enjoyed it less if it had been longer. But as it stands it was the perfect length for me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and beautiful platform-game experience that doesn’t require a substantial investment of time.			"

The setting is top grade. The city is so well done and so much attention is paid to details that even after you finish the game you wish you can go back and explore it. (you can, but without missions it's eh)Only bad part is ~7 hours of gameplay :(   (and that's including being stuck on levels)Finally,  just simply the final level is a reason to buy the game, not to mention all the other levels. ♥♥♥♥in AThey ought to make a sequel in the same city and with more hours.

												Reminded me a lot of Portal. Lots of puzzles, cute story, loved running around in the city and I liked the atmosphere. It was a short game, but worth it. Some parts were challenging if you didn't get the shadows in just the right position, which is also very frustrating but I was able to work through it. There is one move where you 'rush' and are able to burst through a gate, and that wasn't utilized often which, me being a fan of breaking things, was a little disappointing.I didn't quite understand why the girl wasn't in the shadows like everyone else seemed to be, and the story never fully explained it, so the main plot didn't quite make sense. Otherwise it kept a mystical tone that was consistent throughout. Eager to play their next game!			"

												A nice little game with a nice little story, but don't expect much, it's average. I've certainly enjoyed the story and its unusual presentation.I hope other game developers explore the idea of shadows further, this game didn't seem to use all the possibilities, almost all puzzles were simple and the game was short.My primary complaint is that the controls are clunky. I often failed just because some tiny obstacle in a wall pushed me from the shadow mode or dashing caused me to move a bit too far into a shadow. It's frustrating when you know how to solve a puzzle, but fail because of jumping one pixel too far. Moving boxes using spotlights didn't look stable too.Overall, could have beed done much better and could have been much larger. What is left is worth getting with 75% discount though. Especially if you like nice stories and not too complex logic puzzles.			"

												Overall, this game is recommended if you get a kick out of platformers. The shadow character art and especially the voice acting are pretty top-notch. A chunk of the puzzles are inventive too. Now the bad; the game is a little buggy as your character moves, jumping is fairly crap, and the environments are otherwise bland and lifeless. The overall best reason to play Contrast is for the story, which is told in a film noir-style and tosses you the occasional feel. The Mum is friggin' annoying, making every worst decision.

Although the idea of the game was good the presentation of the game via the story wasn't.The story was meh, and the puzzles were ok, and if you combine all of this together I don't think the game is worth its full price (in my opinion).When I was playing it, I really got into the idea of the story... and then the credits roled in and I was just sitting there confused and a little disappointed that there wasn't more, it's only about 2 hours of gameplay.

												I really want to love this game.  It has a great soundtrack, I love the 3d 2d game mechanic, and the story started nice and dark.  I found a few of the puzzles challenging and it felt very rewarding to finish them. What I love more is that when they introduce a new game mechanic there isn't a lot of hand holding that walks you through the puzzle, its mostly trial and error. Unfortunately the controls are very bad and were almost a deal breaker.  I died so many times due to broken controls I rage quit a few times which says a lot; I am not sure how one rage quits multiple times on a 4 hour game.  The story was beautifully dark at first but became whimsical and rather unfulfilling.  The protagonist felt wooden and like she had no purpose except to pull levers.  Of all of the reasons as to why she has this 2d ability and why the world looks so disjointed the actual reason feels lazy, tacked on and overdone.  My last gripe, which feels very nit-picky, is that someone on the team needs to do fact checking.  I don’t know a lot about the 1920’s or quantum physics which made a few of the blunders I did catch that much more jarring.  Grumble grumble.I recommend it if it’s on sale for a couple of bucks.  I couldn't recommend paying full price for it. "

												Allow me to shed some light on this for you.Pros:-Accessible and creative art style-Great music-Charming personalities and characterization from start to finish (even if a little thin at times)-Charming atmosphere, overall-Excellent pace; definitely held my attention w/o letting it drag on forever-Spoiler: Oh my goodness the puppet show was so adorable.Cons:-Not very long (~4 hours to near-full completion (100% in-game collectibles, 19/22 achievements))-Engine/mechanics feel a little clunky and never really feel 100% intuitive (but they get the job done, they're responsive, and you can adapt to the flow, even if it feels a little off)-The voice acting and writing can be a little incredulous at times, but not immersion-breaking.Neutral, but notable:-No difficulty settings (not really appropriate for this kind of game type, so, no biggy)-No save function, but automatically saves at chapters-Not incredibly challenging, but has its moments.  Definitely not a hardcore puzzle experience, but not tremendously casual, either-Passable plot--keeps the theme consistent, ties things together, but isn't complicated.Overall, I definitely recommend this.  This would make a great game for someone who wants an atmospheric game with a great pace to story, without too much head-knocking challenge.8/10.			"

												I'm only making this negative, because I have to give it a recommendation.If my play time doesn't say it all, I don't know what does, I'm already done and only a few achievements short of completion, and I beat this in two days.The game is far too short and is more of a short movie than a video game. The mechanics are not used to their full potential, it's mostly just a 2d platformer with a 3d overworld in between each section. The puzzles are way too easy they never get too complicated. Where this game really shines is in its story and atmosphere, but both of them feel underdeveloped in the short time you're given. I don't want to spoil anything, but a lot of the explanation for what is going on in this game makes no sense, when you really think about it, and after act one the story starts to go downhill. The game really shines in act 2, by far the best part of the game, but it's still way too short, and the puzzles aren't too amazing. I really did enjoy this, but I could never recommend this, I paid three dollars for this, and I don't feel I got my money's worth for it. If you ever do buy this, get it on sale otherwise you're waisting a huge sum of money on a game that will last you 3 hours tops, because the replayability is almost nonexistent.Overall opinion is it's a clever story and mechanic that doesn't live up to it's full potential and is too lacking to be considered much of a game 5/10 won't say you shouldn't buy it, because I did enjoy it, but I could never recommend this to anyone, especially at full price.

												Contrast is very good game and most importantly, it is fun to play. It has several logic puzzles and generally combines adventure with action arcade. You can switch between two worlds - real one and shadow one. That concept is really good, shadow play is fun and innovative.I really liked the voice cast (English), music and  whole atmosphere. It has to be said that the game is quite short, it takes some 4 hours to complete. I used Xbox 360 controller and it worked great.Result: 8/10 "

												(Note: I completed the game in about four hours while offline, which is why I have no play time.)An enjoyable puzzle/platformer that hinges on the idea of snapping between 3D and a 2D realm in which you can platform areas using the shadows of a surface. Even if the overall level design and physics engine don't always fully utilize this super-cool concept, discovering ways to explore each area between both dimensions is rewarding nonetheless. Surprisingly, I think I enjoyed the game's narrative a bit more: It's a simple yet mature and heartwarming tale of a little girl fighting to keep her estranged family together that's presented in a way that pays homage to 1920s film noir. There are some obvious flaws to Contrast though, most notably the all-too-common ability to get stuck between objects (you can usually free yourself without a lot of hassle, though) and the moments where creativty is marred by archaic box-and-switch puzzles. Still, I think it's a game with a lot of style and a lot of heart.			"

												This is a good game based on a great concept. The music is lovely, the atmosphere is rich, and the platformer puzzles are lively. Except... the game is too short. I feel like I just started to enjoy the music and story and setting and puzzle concepts, just got into savouring all those tasty bites, and then my plate was empty.Additionally, I'm not a fan of the silent protaganist approach that this game took. With every other character having lively voice acting, the one sided banter between Didi and Dawn falls flat. Finally, while I was okay with the ending, it's not for everyone and further adds to the feeling of our protagonist being an incomplete and two dimensional (heh) character.Do I reccomend this game? Absolutely.  The developers here have executed something new here and that creativity is it's own reward even if you wish there was more depth to the game. If you're unsure about the $17.00 price point, put this game on your wishlist and grab it when it goes on sale.			"

												Contrast is the arty game that gives arty games a bad name.It's got a really good idea, and squanders it with horrible, unresponsive controls, endless cliche and the kind of poorly envisioned puzzles that make me want to scream at the screen.Bouncing around on umbrellas and canopies may be a fine game element in a goofy 16 bit platformer, but in a game that dresses, speaks and walks as though it wants you to take it seriously, it doesn't fit, and becomes completely unforgivable when the bad controls and the gimmicky linear level design combine to make the trick virtually impossible.There is an achievement for failing a wallrun jump near the beginning of the game, and if you play that section, there is no risk whatsoever of missing the achievement, because the controls for initiating the wallrun are so terrible that even if you do hit the right keys, your character will probably tumble off the world before she realizes you want her to actually do something.Yes, the shadow people are neat, the circus aesthetic is pretty, and running on shadows is a gimmick with a lot of promise; but Contrast is the perfect living proof that a good idea isn't enough to make a good game. I wish it had not been made, so that another developer could have taken on the project, and done it better.I might return to the game just to enjoy screaming at it. This game might manage to be ""so bad it's good"", depending on your taste. But it's definitely bad.			"

												This is a very tentative recommendation with some BIG caveats – if you are looking to buy this game, I would recommend getting it on sale, as I did, or borrowing off a friend. The reason for this is that the game feels very half-baked. Contrast is only a couple of hours long, ending before the game’s mechanics have really had a chance to flex their muscles. The story also seems to be truncated and cut down from what was originally intended. Further evidence of the game’s apparent rushed development is its controls and mechanics; the third-person camera controls feel very loose and wobbly, which is, to put it lightly, less than ideal for a game that features platforming as a central mechanic. Combine this with some inconsistent “shifting” controls and some poorly-designed puzzles and you are left with a game that often causes frustration where it should instead inspire satisfaction.So why am I still recommending Contrast in spite of these issues? In short, its central puzzle-platforming system is fascinating, one of the more creative mechanics I have seen in recent memory. As Dawn, the game’s silent protagonist, you have the ability to “shift” yourself and certain objects from the real, 3D world into the 2D world of shadows. This ability is the central focus of the game’s platforming puzzles, which may involve manipulating light sources and shadows to create platforming surfaces in more strategic puzzles, or using the shadows of moving objects to reach an objective in more fast-paced platforming action sequences. This interplay between the worlds of darkness and light forces you, the player, to see the world in a new way by placing shadows (things we often don’t even notice in games or otherwise) at the forefront of a scene. For this reason alone I would recommend this game, if only to game designers looking for interesting ideas.However, their is a second redeeming quality of Contrast and that is the game’s style. The game’s charming aesthetic and focus on playing as a young girl’s imaginary(?) friend can’t help but make you smile. Additionally, its 1920’s setting, a refreshing change to a period not often depicted in video games, provides us with a nice jazzy, big-band soundtrack. What little story there is features some quality voice acting and an intriguing sub-plot - it’s just a shame Compulsion didn’t have the time or resources to flesh the story out further.In summary, Contrast is a game that is full of potential but needed a few more months in the oven to be worth the $15-$20 asking price. However, if you’re looking for something that is short, charming, and original, Contrast may very well be right up your alley.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing the game, it was fun, but only for 3 hours. It's just too short! The story starts out all right, then ends too quickly. The gameplay and puzzles are nice, if not a bit easy. Find a wall, become a shadow. You always know what objects to interact with, so you will eventually figure out what to do if you can't see it at once. Shadow world platforming is glitchy at times, the cutscenes could be smoother, but I'd say you need some patience to play puzzle games in general.I wouldn't buy it at the full price, because it's much shorter than expected, but if you are interested in trying something new, get it when it's on sale.Also the brightness/contrast hurts my eyes *hisses and slips into the shadows*			"

												I recommend the game with this caveat: it's about the experience of an art piece that has a few fun puzzles rather than the game as a whole.Pros:Beautiful art from top to bottom, with music to match.Story is just interesting enough to keep your attention between the likable protagonist and metaphysical plot points.Some genuinely clever puzzles to solve using the unique game mechanics.Cons:Controls/camera are not 100% solid. Some environment interactivity is awkward.The constant cut scenes and dialogue slow the pace more than they should.It's a shame they didn't go deeper into the supernatural mysteries they created.Overall I think this game really wanted to be a higher-priced title with a more fleshed-out story and extra polish on the mechanical aspects. But, if you are intrigued by the trailer and the screenshots, you'll probably enjoy it. "

												I think this game deserves more attention, the first time I saw the trailer for this was two years ago on my Xbox 360 and I thought the main game mechanic looked awesome, the atmosphere and level design was very moulin rouge esk which isn't done often in games. Ithought the story was nice for what it was an it did envoke an emotional response. I'd give this a solid 6.5/10.For what you pay, I think you get your moneys worth, I've spent 3 hours in total playing and I even went back playing through again to find more of the hidden collectables which I enjoyed. One downside to this game is that you're thrown out of the shadows way too often when trying to complete a puzzle. I was stuck playing through the Vincenzo's hideout, I had to repeat the same jump a good 30 times before I hoped on Youtube for a walkthrough only to find I was doing everything right and the game was just being a♥♥♥♥♥♥..

												This game is a great play.I don't call it ""excellent"" due to a lot of bugs in the game. The physics are a bit off in some parts, however, you'll only have these in about 18% of the game. The game will be easy for many 2D and 3D platformer gamers. It gets a bit challenging as you get closer to the end (but for some of you, it may still be easy). When I type ""a bit"", I mean you'll have between one to three rage moments.The story and setting is superb. And the ending is not at all what I expected it would be.If I were a ""professional"" reviewer, I would give it a 7 or a 7.5. If the bugs were fixed I'd give it an 8.But I do recommend this game. Even though it has it's moments that make you wonder just HOW... or... if this game even had beta testing, the story, artwork, and character devlopment keep most of it hidden in the shadows, meaning the bad is very easy to ignore due to its other qualities overshadowing it.Play Contrast and delve into its awesome story. Take on this adventure and learn more about the protagonists as you jump between dementions and try to figure out which is reality.You will start this game with many questions:Who am I playing as? Am I an imaginary friend? Is this reality or a world created by this young girl?Only one way for them to be answered... play the game.Your choice. "

												This game features some very clever mechanics, a rather touching story, if a bit 'trope-y', and some great ideas. Basically, it's beautiful to look at, and fun to play... And it lasts about three hours max. The biggest frustration is that sometimes you can see the puzzle solution right away, but because of some of the slightly wonky controls it can take upwards of twenty minutes to get through the answer you saw immediately, to the point where you doubt yourself again about whether you might be wrong. That said, I still recommend it, though not at the full price, it's simply too short for $15. But overall, while it won't blow your mind, it is very cute, endearing, and has some great ideas, and most importantly, it's fun.			"

But for someone who really hasn't played a Jump game since Mario brothers in the late 80's I just suck at um. I have tried games like tomb raider, and Alice, and i really love the style game, but i can't make the blasted jumps, so it ends with just frustration. Wish there was an easy button for people that suck at these types of games. I play strategy, RPG's and puzzle games, but jump puzzles and quick times just ruin a game for me. To bad because i was really enjoying it too, But to get stuck, and repeatedly do the same 5 things to try to complete the jump puzzles and miss for 15+ mins is just no fun for me.  I often put games on the easy settings these days, just to play for fun and see where the story takes me. wish this game had an easy button, cause i was really getting into it.			"

Definitely not a hardcore puzzle experience, but not tremendously casual, either-Passable plot--keeps the theme consistent, ties things together, but isn't complicated.Overall, I definitely recommend this.  This would make a great game for someone who wants an atmospheric game with a great pace to story, without too much head-knocking challenge.8/10.			"

												I'm only making this negative, because I have to give it a recommendation.If my play time doesn't say it all, I don't know what does, I'm already done and only a few achievements short of completion, and I beat this in two days.The game is far too short and is more of a short movie than a video game. The mechanics are not used to their full potential, it's mostly just a 2d platformer with a 3d overworld in between each section. The puzzles are way too easy they never get too complicated. Where this game really shines is in its story and atmosphere, but both of them feel underdeveloped in the short time you're given. I don't want to spoil anything, but a lot of the explanation for what is going on in this game makes no sense, when you really think about it, and after act one the story starts to go downhill. The game really shines in act 2, by far the best part of the game, but it's still way too short, and the puzzles aren't too amazing. I really did enjoy this, but I could never recommend this, I paid three dollars for this, and I don't feel I got my money's worth for it. If you ever do buy this, get it on sale otherwise you're waisting a huge sum of money on a game that will last you 3 hours tops, because the replayability is almost nonexistent.Overall opinion is it's a clever story and mechanic that doesn't live up to it's full potential and is too lacking to be considered much of a game 5/10 won't say you shouldn't buy it, because I did enjoy it, but I could never recommend this to anyone, especially at full price. Plus any game you can completely and still be eligible to return on Steam is far too short to be considered a game in my mind.			"

												The tone, the puzzles, and the voice acting are spot on. I enjoyed the game, however thought it was to short for a very nice game. what i would of loved to see is more of the multiverse thoery the game was trying to base itself off of. (not a spoiler) in retro spec, there was a large lack of multiverse. if the viewer knew it was a form of multiverse the story would complent every action that was taking in the game. Now im not harping on the game for its lack. But with this added facts I think the game could have been longer then 3 hours of gameplay, implementing more gameplay mechanics that complement puzzles saying ""hey, this is multiverse"" even for the ending I still thought there could of been more. there should of been more. tell me who dawn is... tell me about the shadows. the main story was perfect, but these side tid bits would make the game longer lasting. either way the game was very good, except for the controls. but even overlooking those i still would recommend the game. 8.9/10			"

												An amazing game! Fun, great story, great aesthetics, and a great central game mechanic. It does of course have some problems, but only a couple.The controls can be difficult at times, which can lead to a lot of early deaths. Chances are you'll get used to them fairly quickly, however.I'd recommend turning the mouse sensitivity down, to about 30-40. By default it's way too high, at least for me.The biggest problem, however, is it's too short. I beat it in one evening, and I want MOAR.This is my first review, I hope it's helpful.			"

												The game is pretty good. The puzzles at times are a tad hard thinking, but it's actually very interesting. What I don't like are the saves on the game. It saves on one part and I can't seem to make it save on my own time. Example, I can finish a puzzle and if I decided to leave the game to finish the rest later on, it resets the whole process. The graphics are very well put. The controls are very simple. The puzzles are amazing... objectives are at times hard to find (no maps) but it's very entertaining.

This game while linear is a very fun. There are a few puzzles that you are bound to get stuck on and make you really think. The story is also quite interesting and could easily gain a sequel in the future.I would highly recommend this game, however you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												In a world seperate from ours, but connected through shadows; you play as Dawn. A mysterious companion to a little girl. With your special shadow shifiting powers; you will help her reunite her family. Looking for a short puzzle adventure as a break from your usual gaming? Look no farther than Contrast! With a brilliant/beautiful graphical art style, intriguing gameplay mechanics, and a beautiful soundtrack; you will not be disappointed. The only downside is the puzzles are very simple and easy to solve, so there is no difficulty anywhere in the game.I bought this game on the Steam Summer sale for only $10, but it is definitely worth the full asking price. So go ahead, buy it already!			"

												While ""Contrast"" is certainly not a ""AAA"" game - the gameplay is a little rough around the edges in ways that can put a hitch in some of the platforming puzzles, and the graphics look like they belong a generation earlier - it's filled with style and atmosphere that invokes Tim Burton, focused gameplay, and a feel that throws back to the earlier days of 3D platformers that kicked up a nice nostalgia trip.And it has some strong thematic similarities to Bioshock Infinite.Having clocked about 3 hours in it from start to finish, for what it is, the length feels just about right. This is a game you play for the overall experience, so it does what it wants to do without overstaying its welcome.Cool game.			"

												This game is a great play.I don't call it ""excellent"" due to a lot of bugs in the game. The physics are a bit off in some parts, however, you'll only have these in about 18% of the game. The game will be easy for many 2D and 3D platformer gamers. It gets a bit challenging as you get closer to the end (but for some of you, it may still be easy). When I type ""a bit"", I mean you'll have between one to three rage moments.The story and setting is superb. And the ending is not at all what I expected it would be.If I were a ""professional"" reviewer, I would give it a 7 or a 7.5. If the bugs were fixed I'd give it an 8.But I do recommend this game. Even though it has it's moments that make you wonder just HOW... or... if this game even had beta testing, the story, artwork, and character devlopment keep most of it hidden in the shadows, meaning the bad is very easy to ignore due to its other qualities overshadowing it.Play Contrast and delve into its awesome story. Take on this adventure and learn more about the protagonists as you jump between dementions and try to figure out which is reality.You will start this game with many questions:Who am I playing as? Am I an imaginary friend? Is this reality or a world created by this young girl?Only one way for them to be answered... play the game.Your choice. "

Gameplay is fun, but the puzzles come in varying difficulties. But otherwise a great game to pass the time, Have fun.			"

It's good enough game if you want to clear yourself of all the mainstream stuff. I love the 20s film noir and caberet style and I also love the shadow-shifting concept. Though the puzzles are a bit too easy to solve, and it more of a rinse and repeat. The story can suck you in but the disappointing aspect are the collectibles that serves to fill in the gaps of the story. I could have been a lot more.			"

												Yes, i recommend it, but just not at full price. In a 50% off sale, you can consider.Contrast is a game that has catched my attention because of its innovative game mechanics, those mechanics are really cool and area a good refreshment. You can classify its gameplay as a platformermer/puzzle game, thoug its puzzle are not hard (unless it bugs). The game charachters are really nice, especially Dawn, but they could be a bit deeper. I think the innovative mechanics could be more explored, and the charachters could gain more depht. The game is really short (it took me 6 hours to beat it and i'm usually slow) and buggy. There are bugs everywhere, some parts of the game are not hard, but you can't complete them because something bugs and makes it more difficult than it should be (stuck on a wall, gone through it, etc). Other complaint is the camera wich could be better placed, because sometimes it makes difficult for you to jump. Though I said a lot of negative points, i recommend Contrast for its inovative mechanics and its nice story.6.8/10			"

												Contrast is an expressive puzzle-narrative in film noir style. The game is about four hours long and employs some innovative mechanics (such as stretching, narrowing, etc the same shadows to reach multiple places. The programming isn't polished, but it's definitely playable. I only glitched out twice. My biggest critique is the general lack of ambient noise/music. A bit more jazz here or there, or some overheard side conversations would have added a bit to the lonely world.The closing words of bioshock infinite go along well with this game. I would recommend buying it solely for the artistic feel and the decent story progression.			"

												I have just finished playing this game; I completed it within about just over 4 hours. I will admit that they game is extremally short for the cost of the game (Although I did buy my copy on sale - I recomend that you wait till the sales come on) I was left feeling like the game wasnt really finished and that a lot of things where unexplained. But!!! I did really enjoy this game, I wont lie, its a good game and maybe the ending is suppose to be a mystery? its a very mysterious game. You play as Dawn a very interesting looking lady, that you really feel cool to play as, with her cool concept design and awesome abilities like turning into a shadow. Dawn follows Didi - a little girl who wants to sneak out to go see her mother singing and suddenly you discover the story behind Didi and her family and what is going on with them. The game is set in the 1920's and has wonderful music and a lovely Jazz theme to the story. The animations are amazing and some of the little pick up items you find along the way give you more detail as to whats go on and can be really interesting! You will find yourself becoming attatched to some of the characters and not wanting to pause the game :)Overall I would recommend the game as its interesting and unique in the story and game play and I would play this game just to listen to the music and feel the atmosphere:Pros-------- Great music and atmosphere all the way through- Great characters and concept art for items and puzzles and different areas- Good voice acting and dialogue is interesting and sometimes funny / sweet- Unique and fun ideas like turning into a shadow - Very interesting game - will make you hooked!!Cons-------- Minor glitches in gameplay and once in dialogue- Extremally short game....- Game ending will leave you wondering mosre about the story and will feel slighty unfinished...- Puzzles are very easy "

												The main mechanic of the game is very unique and quite fun to wrap your head around. Music is both haunting and enchanting all at once and the visual style is beautiful in an artistic- rather than purely technical, polygonal county way.Controls are responsive though edge detection could use a little polish. There were times when a jump looks like it should've landed but the character 'bumps' the edge and falls. Luckily, the checkpoint system is very forgiving and no more than 5 minutes of progress was ever lost through multitudes of jumping off edges.Level design Is a little inconsistent with a lot of levels containing linear solutions while others allow solutions that skip the entirety of the puzzles via jumping on objects in the 'real world' and dashing into the 'shadow world'. However, this is hard to fault as the shadow mechanics are very complex melding 2D and 3D puzzles across the levels.The way the story is told is very unique as well. Since pretty much all the story is told in the 'shadow world', each scene feels like a snapshot of what's happening with a slight time leap in between each one. The pacing of the story is well enough that it never feels like a drag. There is a drive to see what's next. This is all backed up by some pretty fantastic voice acting with moments of melancholy, angst, and anger delivered with emotion. The developers have left the ending a bit open for interpretation so those who are looking for a clear cut finish where everything is answered will be a bit irked. However, those who enjoy discussing interpretations with others will find a nice conversation with others in the same boat.Though it might be a bit short time-wise, it doesn't artificially inflate the time to beat. So it's enjoyable from start to end.			"

												A three hour game or so about puzzles dealing with shadows. Think Zelda: A Link Between Worlds except fleshed out to have dynamic shadows which are how you mainly interact in the game. Some of the puzzles later on are tough, but managable. Platforming skills are needed.The story is about a little girl, Didi, who wants her dad to reunite with her family. However, her dad has a few reasons why he is not with his family. The story follows a typical film noir story, but is so good in the end. It will make you speculate a little.The music is enjoyable and very immersive for the feel of the setting within the game. Well worth playing.			"

												This game was innovative and fun.  Has a very dark dreamlike aspect that reminds me of American McGee's Alice.  The story and the atmosphere also work very well together.  The only issues I have with the game are the mismatch between the visuals and the actual collision points (there was even a light beam that was not properly aligned with its source).  This definitely decreased the immersiveness of the game.  The other issue is that the game has absolutely no replay value AND it's very short.  One or the other is fine, but both is not good.Well worth playing but get it on deep discount because it will take only a little more time than a long movie to complete. "

												Contrast is a unique little game. While the storyline is considerably brief, the puzzles can be intriguing, especially when the mechanic of switching in/out of the shadows becomes a touch glitchy. I will admit, it's not a jawdropping experience. There are technical aspects that need tweaking, such as a puzzle I was basically able to skip without noticing on the first try, but the effort is heartfelt and a bizarrely cute experience.That being said, I would not pay the list price for this game. I bought it when it was 40% off (around $8), and that was good enough for me. I would be onboard, however, if the studio were ever to invest in a larger scale version of the game, with some of the mechanics polished up.			"

There's a moment I'm so much in love with everything (especially the begining) and there's yet also a lot I do really hate in this game. These are the Com/Nega thought of mind.+ Beauty concept and art design.+ A very good or even great soundtrack I've found so far+ - The story might need a bit of ""chronological"" moment and rely heavily on collectible, which mean if you missed most of them, You missed the story as well.-  The platform mechanic was sooooooooooooooooo irritating. Especially in shadow form, I'm sure they meant for good but quite a bit bad excuse. Enough to made you plucking your hair and crunch your teeth at same time.- A very obsure direct story line. Really need a full attention and thought to sort it all out- Toooooooooo Short.  But still I wish to see a next game from them. so if you wish to support a good artist (but not a good game designer?) and love a good beautiful game in both visual and audio. this is the game for you.

												The game was short in my opinion, but the gameplay was fun and challenging: shifting in and out of shadows to solve puzzles -- cool! I found it difficult to control Dawn with the keyboard; xbox controller was much more responsive especially when timing jumps etc. For the bad: I don't know if I missed it or what, but you just launched right into the game without any introduction as to what the deal is with Dawn :shrug:. I mean you get an idea later throughout the story, but I would have liked to know who my character was beforehand -- SOMETHING. I also felt like the luminaries (clueless as to what they were supposed to be) were an after-thought and served no real purpose. i.e. Why do I suddenly need these to put into this device? But near the end of the game, you didn't need them at all. The game could use some polish, but I still think it was worth the purchase.			"

It only takes between 2-3 hours to complete (includes finding all collectibles and luminaries) so it's great for just a quick evening sitdown. The controls are simple and while the puzzles do progress in difficultly they do so at a steady intuitive rate while telling an interesting story about a little girl and her troubled family.This is not a game for everyone, but is a great choice for anyone who loves a good story, pretty art, interesting concepts, and incredible music.

												If I were to give this game a rating, it would be 5 out of 10. The genre is very intrguing and does very well for being a game where the player does not commit violence. The shadowplay is incredible, the voice acting great, and overall, this game deserves more than 5 our of 10 if it weren't for...The controls and movement. Buggy at best, infuriating at its worst. The player character lurches when changing directions which sends you sailing into the abyss more often than not. Switching from a 3D control style to a 2D control style lends a natural use of the W key for jump but this is not the default mapping. It is a complete world unto itself but does not lend itself to immersion. It is clear that Didi (""diddy"", if you prefer, since she's always looking for her real ""diddy) is going through her memories either with the help of a friend, an imaginary friend, or as an adult hoping to fix her issues and this surreal landscape lends itself well to that. However, beyond that it is clear that it is a ""bubble"" world that doesn't really hold you. There's enough missing from the environment and gameplay and world that you constantly realize that this is a game with a story of a dysfunctional set of actors. The puzzles start off very easy and tend to stay that way until the end of the game when an entirely new mechanic with jumps and shadow-merges at a difficulty level previously unencountered is introduced. When going into the lighthouse, you are expected to understand this mechanic and how to use it with no instruction or hints. For a hardcore gamer, this will likely be fine but the gameplay lends itself more to a casual style so this sudden leap in difficulty is jarring and frustrating in and of itself. Once you figure out the difficulty of the new mechanics, however, it becomes little easier to understand. It is not reasonable to use hints that previously indicated an object to interact with as hints for some other part of the mechanic of the puzzle. Changing the rules like that makes the hint system unaffective and almost useless.That said, the storytelling is indeed superb.And finally, this game is far too short and the idea of shadowplay is not explored as well as it should have been. If you want a casual game that requires no real commitment and one or maybe two days play, this game is for you. As a matter of comparison, I played casually and only logged 4 hours on it. I think, however, that gamers of today will be disappointed with the lack of content and linear gameplay. This game feels more like a proof of concept than a finished idea however polished the end product is. This game is worth purchasing but if you pay full price, you're paying too much unless you just want a short distraction and aren't paying attention to cost.			"

 The Good This game is full of good ideas, and is short enough that you never get bored of the mechanics. The visuals are pretty good, if only a bit washed out, but that's intentional I guess. I actually think the game looks a bit better on ""low"" because the colour filter is removed, but with it so are the pretty lighting effects. The story is quite compelling, and it has a unique take on interactive story-telling. The music and sounds are nice, fitting and well-implemented, the game-feel is pretty good and for the most part I can recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games or platformers... The Bad But I do have one enormous gripe with it. It has an obnoxious tendency to constantly take control away from the player. This is very common with games nowadays but it is so bad here that I got annoyed and stopped playing at one point, just because of it. I don't think there is a single 5 minute stretch of gameplay without a cutscene, or extremely slow camera-pan across a level to point something out. Even standing on buttons triggers a bloody cutscene, and not just the first time; every time. I get that you need to show the player what each button triggers, but it's better to naturally design the level so that the player can notice it in-game. Or at least only have the cutscene play the first time. Most of the triggered cutscenes are there for seemingly no reason, and the game would have looked almost identical if it just played out in-game. Sometimes the game simply freezes you in place while a character speaks with absolutely no camera angle changes.If it wasn't for this one annoying tendency, I would have absolutely adored this game. TLDR Great puzzle-platformer with a unique mechanic. Looks and sounds good, controls well. Unfortunate amount of pointless cutscenes.			"

												Contrast is a great, non-violent 3D and 2D platformer.Much of the gameplay involves navigating the protaganist Dawn around a 3D 1920s city.  The boundaries of the city are warped in a twisted MC Escher way which is a far more stylish way of focusing the player in the playable space than invisible walls would be.  Dawn is led around this space by another character Didi to various areas where the player is to overcome various platforming puzzles to advance the story.The platforming is very clever.  Against most walls on which shadows are cast, Dawn can phase into the wall becoming a silhouette that can jump on the shadows cast by objects in 3D.  Prior to phasing in, Dawn can interact with objects to move the shadows into more traversable platforms.  She can also phase some 3D objects into the shadows with her to help solve puzzles and reach collectible items.  The 3D navigation is occasionally interrupted with a jittery camera and the player will occasionally pop out of shadows while phased without notice.  It seems the idea is to keep the camera perpendicluar to the wall while phased, but at bends or corners in the wall, this can get tricky.  Other than that, the controls are decent.The story is touching with a focus on family and the characters are unique, except for Dawn who is essentially a mute avatar.  Didi, the child who accompanies and directs Dawn, is adorable and determined to help her father Johnny.  Johnny is the reformed tramp that to whom the player immediately yields his sympathy.  Kat is at her wit's end with the unreliable Johnny as she raises Didi on her own.  Didi's--more so than Dawn's--resourcefulness and her comments--especially during the puppet show--highlight a theme of female empowerment without being heavy-handed in its delivery.I completed this game in four hours and would recommend it, especially at the going rate of a movie ticket.  The energetic Didi helps move the heartwarming story along in a stylish world with many ledges and crannies to explore.  Phasing from 3D into a 2D environment is a treat and the creatvity with which the 2D shadow puzzles were designed is impressive.  Despite camera and control issues in the 2D space, it would have been nice to explore this mechanic with more puzzles, but even so Contrast is a standout title.			"

												   If you like small but good games this a really good purchase, otherwise if you prefer bigger fully developed games i wouldn't really recommend it. The game itself is awesome, the ideas are amazing and the soundtrack and environment can really blow your mind. But theres a problem in the middle of all the amazing stuff. The game itself is underdeveloped. That makes some really nice characteristics seem bad a lousy and end up ruining your experience.    Overall you can pass the game 100% in less than 4 hours. There are some colectiables but most of the time you dont even need to search for them because they are right in front of you. The devs probably wanted the general environmetn to be bigger but something went wrong and they ended up giving a huge amount of content in a place where it shouldn't exist and only made the entire plot more confusing than it already is. The story is amazing but a lot of details where left untold just because the game lenght wasnt big enough to carry all of them. There are some bugs that shouldve been fixed and sometimes the entire shadow-person mechanic feels a bit cluncky. it would be awesome if you could change not only into a shadow but also to a difrent shadow size. overall the shadow you trnasform into is you in 2D instead of your other stange amazing reallity. Overall its a preatty decent game but that could be improved in various aspects.I would compare my gameplay Story experience of this game with my gameplay experience i had with bioshock infinite. There is however a huge difrence amoung them. Bioshock is fully developed and is almost bug free. It has an awesome replayability, an awesome story, awesome mechanics and the colectiables are hard to find and pretty damn awesome to get entirely. Contrats on the other hand is poorly developed, has a lot of bugs, almost no replayability since you cant change the way you play to make the story a difrent experience, super shor game length, the story is awesome and really good but lacks detail in many ways, the mechanics are awesome but you end up barely having to use them and the colectiables end up giving you a worse experience overall.I really realy want to tell the world about this game because its really awesome. I would pay 50 bucks for it if i needed to. But this game is not finished. I would say thats in its current state the game is 70% away from behing the best game ever made. And im talking about 70% off wich 10%would be bug fixes, 20% increasing the scenario availible to explore, 10% actually making the colectiables hard to find and woth finding, 10%making more puzzles and 20% increasing the story told to the player soo it can actually mean something more. TLDR. This game has the capability to have a 90+ rating however lacks some development that reallly ruins some important gameplay details. I consider it a must play tho just for the overall experience.			"

												Some people play Portal (and its sequel) only for its quirky, witty humor, but Portal is one of my favorite games of all time for another reason: its puzzles. Why do I mention Portal? Because if you enjoy the puzzles in Portal and Portal 2, I think you'll enjoy the puzzles in Contrast.Like Portal, Contrast is a puzzle platformer. The challenge isn't just in getting from Point A to Point B - it's also about HOW. And, like Portal, Contrast adds an exciting twist. The shadow-shifting element is perfectly designed: it's very simple to understand how it works, but figuring out how to use it is challenging and fun. The puzzles aren't tear-your-hair-out difficult, and neither is the platforming skill required, but it's still hard enough to be rewarding when you finally get it right. The game's later puzzles have you manipulating the position of light sources and even shifting objects - like boxes - into the shadow world with you, so the puzzles never get stale.The story is short, but interesting. The voice acting is absolutely superb, especially in scenes where tensions are running high. The world is beautifully crafted, and it really does have a fun 1920s vaudevilleIn summary: I desperately wish there were more of this game. In fact, I think the brevity is my only complaint about Contrast. I hope there's a sequel, or at least another puzzle-platformer from this developer. If you like puzzles, and especially if you liked Portal, you should play this game.			"

												Short puzzle platformer with a fine ambiance and interesting mechanics.You need to use elements of your surroundings in 3D and in shadow form to progress through the game, set in an older looking French city, and help little girl Didi to get her family back together.It is a bit clunky at times. The camera isn't very smart and while using a controller it can be bothersome. I also managed to take an unexpected shortcut and solved a puzzle in an unintended way. Plus, you tend to jump out of the shadow world for seemingly no reason but it isn't too bad of a problem since the game saves your progession pretty often. In short it feels like the developpers lacked funds to make it flawless.As I said it is a short game. Steam hasn't taken into account my first play session which was about 2 hours long so add it to the amount displayed on my review. I recommend the game to anyone feeling interested but would advise to wait for a discount as there is not enough to make it worth the initial price of 15€.			"

												Allow me to shed some light on this for you.Pros:-Accessible and creative art style-Great music-Charming personalities and characterization from start to finish (even if a little thin at times)-Charming atmosphere, overall-Excellent pace; definitely held my attention w/o letting it drag on forever-Spoiler: Oh my goodness the puppet show was so adorable.Cons:-Not very long (~4 hours to near-full completion (100% in-game collectibles, 19/22 achievements))-Engine/mechanics feel a little clunky and never really feel 100% intuitive (but they get the job done, they're responsive, and you can adapt to the flow, even if it feels a little off)-The voice acting and writing can be a little incredulous at times, but not immersion-breaking.Neutral, but notable:-No difficulty settings (not really appropriate for this kind of game type, so, no biggy)-No save function, but automatically saves at chapters-Not incredibly challenging, but has its moments.  Definitely not a hardcore puzzle experience, but not tremendously casual, either-Passable plot--keeps the theme consistent, ties things together, but isn't complicated.Overall, I definitely recommend this.  This would make a great game for someone who wants an atmospheric game with a great pace to story, without too much head-knocking challenge.8/10.			"

												Few games marry platforing and puzzle elements as well as Contrast. Its shadow mechanic allows for a lot of unique solutions to puzzles, usually requiring the manipulation of the play field to set up platforms or move an object from one area to another. The solutions are fairly intuitive once you get the hang of it, and this keeps the pace of the game brisk. While the game is short (3 hours on my playthrough, with time included for exploration), it's exactly as long as it needs to be for the narrative it's telling. And oh boy, what a narrative. I admire the decision to tell a story of a troubled couple from their daughter's point of view, and to tell it in a highly Expressionist way. The noirish setting, the importance of casting light onto darkness and viewing events through projection and found documents leaves the player (and Didi) questioning the amount of agency they have in shaping the events occuring around them, but as the game progresses the player's actions do push the narrative forward, leaving one wondering if there's some reality-bending at play or if we're just in a land of childish wish fulfillment. The question is left to the player, as the narrative focuses less on making sense of the universe and more on the emotions of its central characters.But the experience isn't without a few drawbacks. While I personally found Didi to be a very compelling character, her constant direction can get tiring, as well as break the difficulty of some puzzles. Her guidance may be helpful for younger players or those inexperienced with 3D platformers, but a seasoned player may find themselves wishing for an option to forgo such a built-in hint system. Whether or not you identify with Didi can make or break the game because of this.The platforming is overall very tight and responsive, and the game grants abilities which ease progression later on. However, it has its moments of challenge which require timing so precise that getting it right may feel more like luck than skill. There is an excellent organic checkpoint system integrated into the mix, so failure is rarely punished and trial-and-error solutions are encouraged, so long as frustration doesn't set in too quickly.On a rare occasion, my character glitched into a wall or other fixture, but jumping/dashing out of them seems to fix the problem. Pros:Interesting, varied platforming and puzzle solving for a unique experience.Tight controls made for a gamepad.Beautiful and thought-provoking visual style.Largely well-acted characters with cheesy, but engaging dialogue.Positive portrayal of a female lead.Cons:Little replay value: collectables are included, but a completionist could grab them all in one playthrough.Difficulty is at parts too easy due to too much direction.Game length may affect one's opinion of its asking price.Overall, I found Contrast a fantastic experience, and certainly one that feels artistically-driven. The story and characters are compelling enough to push you forward without bogging the experience down with overlong cutscenes. Collecting all of the found documents in the game reveals an added light to the game's ending, encouraging exploration and abstract thinking, though the core of the game will be Didi's concerns for her father. If you're willing to forgive a young girl asking a lot of favors of you, the unique style and solid gameplay will make the experience worthwhile.			"

												First game i wouldn't recommend on steam,.  I actually love the game, story was nice, interesting game play. But for someone who really hasn't played a Jump game since Mario brothers in the late 80's I just suck at um. I have tried games like tomb raider, and Alice, and i really love the style game, but i can't make the blasted jumps, so it ends with just frustration. Wish there was an easy button for people that suck at these types of games. I play strategy, RPG's and puzzle games, but jump puzzles and quick times just ruin a game for me. To bad because i was really enjoying it too, But to get stuck, and repeatedly do the same 5 things to try to complete the jump puzzles and miss for 15+ mins is just no fun for me.  I often put games on the easy settings these days, just to play for fun and see where the story takes me. wish this game had an easy button, cause i was really getting into it.			"

												I'm only making this negative, because I have to give it a recommendation.If my play time doesn't say it all, I don't know what does, I'm already done and only a few achievements short of completion, and I beat this in two days.The game is far too short and is more of a short movie than a video game. The mechanics are not used to their full potential, it's mostly just a 2d platformer with a 3d overworld in between each section. The puzzles are way too easy they never get too complicated. Where this game really shines is in its story and atmosphere, but both of them feel underdeveloped in the short time you're given. I don't want to spoil anything, but a lot of the explanation for what is going on in this game makes no sense, when you really think about it, and after act one the story starts to go downhill. The game really shines in act 2, by far the best part of the game, but it's still way too short, and the puzzles aren't too amazing. I really did enjoy this, but I could never recommend this, I paid three dollars for this, and I don't feel I got my money's worth for it. If you ever do buy this, get it on sale otherwise you're waisting a huge sum of money on a game that will last you 3 hours tops, because the replayability is almost nonexistent.Overall opinion is it's a clever story and mechanic that doesn't live up to it's full potential and is too lacking to be considered much of a game 5/10 won't say you shouldn't buy it, because I did enjoy it, but I could never recommend this to anyone, especially at full price. Plus any game you can completely and still be eligible to return on Steam is far too short to be considered a game in my mind.			"

												Contrast is one of those games that has a good premise - the idea of use light and shadows to create a separate bit of 2D puzzle gameplay from the normal 3D world, but the implementation from a story and setting as well as design is a bit disconnected.  The technical approach is good in how you can shift in an our of shadows, but the problem is that the areas you can do this in are very limited and separated from each other, making each puzzle its own microcosm.   The puzzles that use this aren't that difficult as well, with the most difficult ones being where you can either move objects to change shadows or the location of the light source. Again, with the puzzles being separate entities, these are one-stop problems as opposed to part of a larger difficult mechanism to figure out.The story is interesting but it's hard to get into and leaves some questions on getting into the characters. Whether this is a fantasy, a dream, or something else isn't clear, and whether it is a flashback or the like.  As such, the game quickly devolves into just moving from puzzle to puzzle with story getting in the way.It is still a decent game, but it's one I'd wait for a sale for, getting about 3 hrs of playtime from it.

												Contrast is a unique concept, filled with brilliant ideas that are unfortunately hindered by a less than ideal execution. The story, music and scenery are all above average, crafting a whimsical art deco world that’s incredibly delightful. However the core game mechanics suffer from inconsistent behaviour and glitchy collision detection turning the otherwise novel idea of moving through shadows into a laborious experience.

												I really like indie games, so when I saw this I thought that the concept was amazing, and it really is, but the fact that it is an indie game is the reason it could do with some work, the soundtrack and style of the game are mesmerizing and the character design has been done well, that's all good. Then there are the aspects that need tweaking, the shadow jumping, platforming and the AI aren't all that good. When attempting to scale or run a wall, the game is too unforgiving, basiclly you get caught on all the little details of a shadow, which may make it seem realistic but no. it gets frustrating. The platforming is also, of course, based around the shadow dimension so you can already guess what I would of said there, another big annoyance is that even though solid objects wouldn't hypothetically affect the dimension of a shadow, in the game, for example, if you try to walk past a pillar on the wall you will generally get thrown out of the shadow world. The last complaint is about the lack of AI for Didi, your young, female companion, whenever travelling from one mission area to another, she will walk exactly where she is programmed to and then stand there for as long as it takes you to get there, making no comments or attempt to follow you around while you search for collectibles (a main feature in the game) or admire the scenery. All together this game is a little expensive for $15, it was a great puzzle experience with an excellent soundtrack and an amazing ending, but for $15 it seems a little expensive. I would give this game an 8/10 and send a request to rename it ""Contrast: Prepare to Die Edition""			"

												Absolutely loved this game. The system of going back and forth from real to shadow, was done really well. Puzzles were enjoyable, without being tedious. Storyline was really enjoyable, with nice period piece settings and music to go along with it. My only complaint would be the length of the game, but any time a game is so good you can't put it down, it ends up seeming too short once you're done.10/10. Would be an awesome shadow shifter again.			"

												A very solid platformer, its mechanic of shifting between the real world and shadows makes for some interesting levels. The story is a little cliche and leaves you hanging a confused at the end if you don't grab any of the collectables but the art style and overall ambience of the game is worth it.  It is pretty short though, you'll be lucky to stretch it out to 3 hours.			"

												Game was really short, not too difficult, and maybe a bit glitchy.  It had an interesting concept but the puzzles aren't that difficult to figure out once you figure out all the items at your disposal.  You could do alot with the game but it didn't really last long enough to really amaze me with a whole lot.  Phasing into the shadows is fun but its annoying getting kicked out of the shadows when it seems like you should be fine.  At one point during the Merry-go-round, there was clearly open space that kept kicking me out of the shadows for no reason, and after going around and taking another route, it stopped doing it.  There's far more that could be done than simply putting boxes into the shadows, then moving the spotlight around.  Outside of getting kicked out of the shadows at random sometimes, the puzzles aren't overall too difficult to figure out once you pick out every option at your disposal.  The last stage introduces the idea to focus the spotlight but you cant keep it focused and is only used to raise a box higher and its only used once.  Its fairly useless to introduce something out of nowhere just to solve one puzzle, especially since you need to tell the player the controls so you're basically telling them what to doOn top of getting forced out of the shadows at odd times, the models for the shadows are clearly screwed up.  Johnny's hat is often floating half off of his head, the character's limbs seem to disconnect, and you can see glitches like this even with Dawn in the shadows.  It was most noticable when you had to float down on an umbrella and it disappeared whenever I faced a specific direction.The game overall seemed a bit like Vincenzo's act in the end.  His act seemed cool but I could only see the shadows of it, and it was also over very quickly.  In fact, he seems to hint that there may be monsters in the Shadows that could prove to be an obstacle for Dawn but its never followed up on cause all thats left to do in the game is follow Didi then its over.  The game was very interesting, especially for the concept, but again, it only took 2 hours to complete.  Judging from the other reviews, it seems I may have gotten it down quickly, but in order to get 10 hours of gameplay, you would have to be looking for every luminary and every collectable, or have played through the game multiple times.  The game does have some good music and a good story, but its far too short and gameplay wise, not interesting enough to be worth the $17 (canadian) it costs normally.  I got it during a sale but even then, there's other games you could spend your money on instead			"

												Its a unique game, the shifting into the shadows gameplay is it's major selling point but it also has quite nice art, music and storyline.  As some of the other reviews hinted - everything in this game is really good but it's lacking some tiny bit of extra wowfactor which would really make it amazing.  I didn't find any terrible bugs.  But it does have issues, sort of like you would expect an infinite possibility sandbox environment to have issues.  It uses the dynamic shadows cast by the graphics engine as part of the gameplay, and sometimes that isn't going to work out right as there's just too many possible shadows that can be created.  I imagine it's damn near impossible to test properly as shadows can be different in a thousand ways.  The shadow play can be a bit annoying as you fall out of the shadows and back into the 3D world a little too easily.  And once (spoiler!) I shifted an item with me into the shadows and managed to lose it completely somewhere.. take care of your precious metal balls! :)But anyway, the game is short and sweet, play it if you like unusual games.

												Here are the cliffnotes of a review I wrote for this game elswhere:I’ve had this game on my Steam wishlist for a few months now and decided to grab it during the Winter Sale last week. I’m glad I did because, in retrospect, I wouldn’t have wanted to waste more money than I already did on it.  This is not something that I would call a puzzle game. A puzzle implies that there is an intricate mental test to perform that has a rewarding outcome if you can find and place all the pieces. To solve the puzzles in this game you just have to perform trial and error because there really is no intuitive puzzle to be had. You platform around as a shadow on the wall to perform an arbitrary task and that’s about it. The “puzzle” aspect comes in, I GUESS, when you turn a wheel or press a button and the shadows move and you continue platforming. Maybe it’s that some of the buttons are on timers? I suppose some people would consider that a puzzle……But if you find those people, please, remind them to take the plastic bag off of their head once in awhile. Bottom line: I wouldn’t recommend this game unless you have a big hard-on for platformers….But there ARE better platformers…..Much better. I’ve played about an hour and a half of the game and I’m over half done. I just simply don’t see any point in prolonging the review. I’m probably not even going to get around to finishing this game.			"

												I really liked Contrasts style, and the puzzles weren't too hard (though the carousel I messed up on a tonnnnn of times). The shadow animations weren't always that great, the controls were a bit wonky at times, and the story wasn't that unique. But, the level design I liked--the pirate ship and the entrance to the puppet stage the most, though there wasn't really anywhere in the world that didn't look nice. Dawn is a really pretty character, and that aspect was well-displayed in her model, but Didi was kind of...gross-looking? Her textures were messed, her overall model looked wonky, and it didn't seem as much care was put into making her as there was for Dawn. Being that Didi is the only other character you see in the game that isn't a shadow, and being that she's a much more essential piece to the story of Contrast than Dawn, she should look much better all-around. I get that it might be tougher as she's playing out a string of specific animations, but there could have at least been an 'inside' to her mouth, instead of a weird, shallow, flesh-colored concave that you have to look at each time she speaks.I almost 100%'d Contrast on the first try, and it only took a couple hours to play, so I can definitely say that as the game stands I'd play it again.

												Bought this game for under 4 bucks thanks to the Halloween sales and honestly, I don't regret it.The artistic direction of Contrast is beautiful, the characters are well developped and the story is pretty catchy. The only downside is the abrupt ending and the lack of explaination of the story, especially if you haven't managed to find all the collectibles.The gameplay is groundbreaking and well designed, as well as really intuitive, even though it can prove to lack precision at some points.Finally, I would definitely recommend this game if you want to be immersed in the cabaret universe for a little while. (expect about 4 hours of gameplay if you want to find everything, more like 2 hours if you just follow the story).			"

												Contrast is a very well-done and innovative Indie game. It falls into the puzzle genre, but utilizes first-person character control and does require a bit of speed.Like all games, Contrast has its merits and pitfalls. Some things I really liked about the game are:- A very well-thought-out and touching story- Beautiful soundtrack (especially ""Kat's Song"". Youtube it!)- A unique gameplay mechanic- Some decently challenging puzzles- Beautifully done art. Many noir games and movies nowadays are just creepy and Sin City-like. This is a much more refreshing take on the noir theme.And some things that weren't so great:- I don't know anyone who has clocked more than 10 hours to beat this- Some minor bugs- a reference to Albert Einstein in an earlier time period (learn your history, people!)Simply put, Contrast is very well-done and a must-buy for any Indie fan. People who liked story-intensive games such as Bastion will definitely enjoy Contrast more than most. Of course $15 for a game this short may pinch wallets, so do wait for a sale. And of course, we hope to hear of a second game from Compulsion Studios soon. =D			"

Overall Appeal - 5/5The premise of the game is fantastic. Being a character that only a child can see but still being able to change the real world is quite fun and amusing. The puzzles are not always straight forward... it's not always as easy as 2D vs 3D... sometimes you have to dig deep.Fun Factor -  4/5Can't really say much without giving it away. It was, at times, incredibly annoying. But no matter how much I hated it at the time I turned it off, I always came back.Replay Value - 1/5Unfortunatly, I believe this is one of the few areas where this game fails. Though the game is awesome, the only replay would be collectables missed in your previous playthrough.Presentation/Graphics - 4/5The game didn't make use of all the mechanics available to it... but that's okay... It wasn't meant to. It's done in a depression era art kind of way and is part of it's appeal. Fluidity of the transition between 2D and 3D was nice. The only complaints I had were that, at one point, an object I needed started floating above me where I couldn't reach it and had to reload and near the end, as I started to fall (to my death, I missed a ledge).... just stopped... couldn't jump, couldn't fall, couldn't move. Other than those two things, marvolous.Storyline - 4/5Don't get me wrong, the story in, and of, itself was absolutly flawless. I loved the backgroud (loved the ending even more). My only complaint is that it was too short. The game could have been a little longer (maybe 5-10 more hours of gameplay).Summary/Overall Score - 3.6 of 5Overall, a solid game. If I am to read the game correctly, I expect another. I do hope that, if true, the sequal will be a little more developed and incoorporate a longer storeyline, more gameplay, and an answer to the question thrown in our faces at the end. I would reccomend this, if only to help the developer to make a new one and continue this intriguing story.			"

												Don't think of this as a game per-se. Think of it more like an interactive film and you probably won't be disappointed. Also - get it on sale. It takes 4-5 hours to complete, getting all achievements, and it's a pleaesant ride.The noir tone of the game is fun without getting really dark. It stays squarely within the child's perspective. Visually, this game is fantastic. The plot keeps you engaged, but isn't anything special.The mechanics are pretty solid and controls work well (assuming you're using a controller and not keyboard / mouse - haven't tried those). It can occasionally be tricky to figure out what you need to do, but it's nothing anyone should have that much trouble with.As long as you go into this from the perspective of a brief sojourn into a gorgeous fantasy world, you won't be disappointed. The closest game I'd compare this to is Papo & Yo. They both sort of feel like a day in the life of a child, although that one's a touch more fleshed out. Both are good.			"

												Good Game, good history, nice atmosphere! But it has drawbacks. The game has some interesting mechanics. You can basically change between your ""3D form"" and the ""shadow form"". The main aspect of the game is to figure out your way through the puzzles with this shadow form to proceed through the history. The gameplay is not the best and I found some ""bugs"" (some ways to complete the puzzle that the developer did not intend, like climbing a vertical wall by getting stuck into it). But the main problem (in my opinion) was the fact that the puzzles aren't difficult (there isn't really any challenge on the puzzles for myself at least). I would like to see what they can do with this interesting mechanic in a bigger game.Is it worth the money they ask for? Well it is a really short game (near 4 hrs for me) but for the atmosphere that this game submerged me, it was worth.			"

												Contrast is a beautiful and entertaining game. I found the environment, story and gameplay very intriguing from the get-go. As the game progresses the puzzles get more difficult and challenging, in mind as well as execution, just the way I like it. One could argue it was borderline too short, but fit me and my current schedule well enough. As for something negative I believe they could have elaborated the ending. If finding the all collectables, finds throughout the game giving hints and details to the story, you are able to realise the big mystery and thus get the ending. But I feel like the developers relied to heavily on finding the collectables being the ""big giveaway"" and surprise factor that the ending just felt a bit anticlimactic. It was a shame as the game had been bold and exciting up until that point. Either way it's a game I truly recommend. If you have a thing for puzzles, are fascinated by the 20's and/or like good soundtracks I believe you should give it a go.			"

												While the game has a charming style and an interesting mechanic, it falls flat on using its potential.You can only use your ability exactly where the programmers want you to. No creative exploration of the city is possible. Places where you should be able to use your ability, you can't because there are no puzzles to solve there.Also for a game which has such focus on shadows, outside of puzzle areas you are stuck with the bland, sun-is-exactly-above you shadow, even if within a light source.They should have focused on the story or the puzzles. As it is, both are not really that great.I often found myself skipping the cut scenes because I was bored and just wanted to finish the game as fast as possible.On the other hand the puzzles seemed awefully contrived in their environment. And I found none of them particularly challenging.With a bit more love this could have been a really great game. As it is, it's still interesting but not worth the full price. Wait for a steam sale.			"

												8/10Cool game with pretty graphics, great and atmospheric music, a unique gameplay mechanic making for fun puzzles, and a neat little story. Only rating it an 8/10 however because of bugs and other issues (note: my computer exceeds the recommended requirements and played the game fine on high settings). At times, Dawn will slide around at high speeds or suddenly stop moving due to some invisible obstruction. That's annoying while walking down the middle of the road, but downright frustrating when trying to solve puzzles, especially while in shadowland. These movements sometimes cause Dawn to shift out of shadows at inopportune times as well, requiring restarting entire puzzles. The worst issue, however, are the occasional times when something that is supposed to sparkle (such as an item that can be used or a collectible) does NOT sparkle, and thus can't be used. Collectibles don't stop you from completing the game, but the usable items not sparkling certainly will. I was able to solve this issue by restarting the game, but it's still annoying and meant lost progress. All in all though, I would still recommend Contrast.			"

												Though visually stunning and in employ of a very interesting game mechanic I'd never seen before-- the manipulation of lights in order to traverse through a shadow-world to allow the player access to areas that are otherwise unreachable,-- I felt that these two points were not enough to make up for the amount of glitches and the weak plot that I found in an otherwise palatable game. For the amount I bought it for, I felt this game was not polished very well, and it certainly doesn't help that the secondary character you follow was written in a very annoying manner. Noir games are often hit-or-miss because of the amount of stereotypes the genre builds upon, and Contrast followed the routine noir atmosphere and plotline.In short, this was a very imaginative game, but I don't see myself going back to it for another playthrough. I would recommend it for the shadow/light manipulation, however.			"

I got a little bore with the gameplay near the end, because of the simplicity of the puzzles, but the rest kept me going.The animation of the models feels a little like a 1990's game but get pass that and you have a (short) good experience.

												Contrast is a puzzle platformer that combines 3D and 2D gameplay to its problems, while telling a story of a family going through a crisis in a 1920's dreamlike bohemian Paris. Mixed with the story are some fantasy mysteries of other realities and a tiny bit of film noir gangsters. To top it all the game has pretty nice, if fairly short, soundtrack with some sultry jazz.The game lacks some depth, hardly any of the mysteries introduced are explained, and game mechanics could have used some tweaking. Despite that, Contrast is a nice short little game with a unique setting and interesting ideas that could carry on for some deeper exploration. For its regular price the game is short, but it is something to consider if one is after a light puzzle platformer.			"

												Interesting, unique gameplay with a fantastic art style.  Music fits the tone perfectly.   Surprisingly good story as well, with well done voice acting.  I beat it in just under 3 hours, and that includes finding all collectibles and achievements, so it's a bit short.  Like the original Portal, though, being short isn't bad, as it doesn't overstay it's welcome at all.  It's not especially challenging, so I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a relaxing and pleasant way to spend an afternoon (Especially if it's on sale).			"

I'm not a fan of side-scrolling games but I would buy this particular game again for the concept alone.			"

												+ I fell in love in Dawn's face every time i see her in closeup and in fact she was the first spark of interest to the game.+ Nice atmosphere and music. All about plays of lights and shadows. Literally. + Story is simple and mature. It is like a nice evening (french) movie watching it on comfy couch with your lover.- Story is also as long as evening movie.- Animation in cut-scenes seems stiff like wooden puppets.- Control is sometimes clumsy. Sometimes it looks ridiculous jumping several times into walls.- Pillars will kick you out of shadow realm which is annoying.Although the technical side of the game is not perfect, the artistic side is deep and good looking and the main character's charm is so glaring it outshines bust of Lara Croft's.

												Contrast is an incredibly well written and well implemented platform/puzzler.  All accented by an incredible sound track.  While it certainly has some control issues from time to time, none I encountered were game breaking.  It is also incredibly short, finished in only a few hours.  But, the unique mechanics never over-stay their welcome.  Each chapter builds upon previous chapters' lessons, allowing the player to experience something new while not feeling like their previous lessons were wasted.  The story is surprisingly deep, even if it feels a little rushed from the player's perspective.  Overall, even at full price, it’s a great buy if you like platform/puzzlers.  On sale, it’s a definite buy for anyone wanting something different and new, that won't eat too much time.			"

I think the puzzles were a bit hit or miss but overall good.If you like things by Double Fine you'll understand this game well. Lots of raw potential that just lacks a bit of polish and length.

												If you are a fan of puzzle games and you've always liked the Parisian 1920's atmosphere, then this game is made for you. I really enjoyed the old-fashioned platformer feel turned 3D and some puzzles were really mind-bogling, but I also have to admit that to my personal opinion the game has a flaw and that is the automatic checkpoint saves. If I was given the option to save and load when I choose, then I would have LOVED every second of it! What balances the game are the amazing atmosphere, the so well picked jazz music for soundtrack and the wonderful story of Didi, Johnny, Kat, Vincenzo and Dawn. I would have preferred it if it was a bit more detailed or even longer, but that doesn't diminish the total quality of the game at all. And if you find it a bit linear or a bit cliche, then the ending may surprise you! :)			"

The visuals are beautiful, the music beautiful, and the ending was wonderful. While you can compare the 2D/3D puzzle to something similar to Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds, I'd easily argue that this is far more innovative. Even more interesting are the little surprises for the obsessive compulsive AND for the lazy. Defintely, defintely worth the money. I can only hope for a sequel.			"

												It's an alright platformer where you can merge with shadows to solve puzzles (e.g. placing a box in front of a light source to cast a huge shadow, then jumping on the box's shadow to reach a platform). The puzzles aren't too hard, but some are made taxing just from the occasional glitchy shadow mechanic. Sometimes the slightest bump in the wall will kick you out of shadow-mode. Considering the game is built around this mechanic, it's pretty annoying it isn't 100% smooth all the time.The story is minimal, but you can go in to character backstories through collectibles.Clever idea, sometimes interesting to actually use, falls a bit short of it's potential. For the right price, considering I 100%'d it in 4 hours, it's worth a playthrough I think.			"

There are some bugs, some tricky jumps / platforms, less checkpoints than desired.Music is most of the time minimalistic but it has 2 or 3 fantastic tracks that provides enjoyable moments like carrousel.I'd say that this game should last more for the release price... keep in mind that you will not replay it...Sum up:Graphics: 7.5Sound: 10Gameplay: 6.5Should you play this game?

												Coming away from Contrast after some thought – it’s come to me that this is a game that I enjoyed more for its theme. I stuck with the game for its amazing setting, lovely soundtrack and to see the end of the story, rather than staying for its 3D-to-2D shifting gameplay. The shortness of the game means that the puzzle mechanics are never given the time to fully grow. Mix this up with some questionable glitches and you’re left with a game that isn’t as well constructed as one would like.Contrast is a curious, fair attempt at a puzzle platformer with some neat ideas that make it somewhat enjoyable, but is a slightly frustrating experience that in the end won’t be remembered for its gameplay, but more for its world, visuals and sound.

												Beautiful piece of bliss to play. Charming story, characters and atmosphere, and astoundingly good music. The game in itself is rather short, but personally I find that that's part of the whole ""magic"" of it. It's sweet, and touching, but it doesn't get boring with needless hours of repetitive gameplay. Speaking of which, the whole jumping in and out of the ""shadow dimension"" is amazing. Awesome idea, really difficult to implement. The quality of this game in general is dazzling. Contrast had me with a dumb smile on my face whenever I wasn't frowning over a particularly challenging shadow puzzle (yes, Vincenzo, I'm looking at you and your lab). I sincerely loved this game and would recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't really a puzzle fan. The music alone makes it worth it. And if jazz ain't your cup of tea, the story and the atmosphere ought to do the rest. Truly, truly a jewel. I am forever in debt with my past self for spending the twenty bucks it cost me then (I got myself the collector's edition, with the soundtrack and stuff).			"

												This game was quite odd. As a game its nothing special; it would even be fair to say its gameplay is just bad. I often felt as though I tricked trough some levels by takng advantage of the hit-and-miss gameplay like making jumps that would avoid the puzzles. The stories execution is equally questionable, with a protagonist who serves to guide you through the game without any real finesse. And by that I don't mean your character; you seem to serve more as a tool for her tasks but that is the point.TO THE GOOD!This game had a very specific feel about it which I felt made it worth playing. The art style and music marry so well together that I forgave the shaky gameplay (at least for the most part). Depite its dodgy execution, I got what it was trying to show and it made for an enjoyable experience. The story wasn't as linear as what I've come to expect; whether thats a good or bad thing, im not entirely sure. Its fair to say Didi (the young girl) was a bit 'pushy' in trying to force you into the story, but I didnt really mind as my character is there to help her and the interactions of the character felt right for the situation.Theres plenty to find out beyond the game through exploration. I actually think these bits were what made the game as it added another level of story beyond Didi's life to something more personal for the character Dawn (who never speaks IIRC), also - great name without being something cheesy. I would throughly recommend you endevour to find the 20(I think?) hidden media snippets! It reminded me of Bioshock in that the information you find explains the situation youre in; but in a modest way.This game however is by no means difficult! I did the entire story in a single 2 hour sitting and found everything in that time. This wasn't even deliberately to finish it, I just felt like the game never lost traction and felt so, almost, calm to play that I kept casually playing. This isnt to say the story was good; it was weak with the hidden snippets making it interesting but it was solid enough in terms of character and situation.Overall, as someone who does try to game as much as possible, I can't honestly say its a great game. But for me, it was incredibly playable and I will revisit it again gladly. It was like listening to music, I did indeed just easily loose track of time and do it. I found it quite charming if I'm being honest.I played it with a controller if that means anything? You wont need the precision or focus of a kb+m but thats just my preference for this game. I would also say if youre on the fence about it, its probably best you wait till a sale comes around. I don't think I paid full price and despite enjoying it, don't know if its worth it. Definately feels like it should be £6.99 or similarly priced. Wouldn't be upset if I did pay retail though.			"

 The Good This game is full of good ideas, and is short enough that you never get bored of the mechanics. The visuals are pretty good, if only a bit washed out, but that's intentional I guess. I actually think the game looks a bit better on ""low"" because the colour filter is removed, but with it so are the pretty lighting effects. The story is quite compelling, and it has a unique take on interactive story-telling. The music and sounds are nice, fitting and well-implemented, the game-feel is pretty good and for the most part I can recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games or platformers... The Bad But I do have one enormous gripe with it. It has an obnoxious tendency to constantly take control away from the player. This is very common with games nowadays but it is so bad here that I got annoyed and stopped playing at one point, just because of it. I don't think there is a single 5 minute stretch of gameplay without a cutscene, or extremely slow camera-pan across a level to point something out. Even standing on buttons triggers a bloody cutscene, and not just the first time; every time. I get that you need to show the player what each button triggers, but it's better to naturally design the level so that the player can notice it in-game. Or at least only have the cutscene play the first time. Most of the triggered cutscenes are there for seemingly no reason, and the game would have looked almost identical if it just played out in-game. Sometimes the game simply freezes you in place while a character speaks with absolutely no camera angle changes.If it wasn't for this one annoying tendency, I would have absolutely adored this game. TLDR Great puzzle-platformer with a unique mechanic. Looks and sounds good, controls well. Unfortunate amount of pointless cutscenes.			"

												the game is beautiful. the artwork was great, and the music was pretty good. the atmoshere of the game though is intriguing which was one if it's best characteristics. you always have questions on your mind about the world you are in. not many games are like that. you just accept where you are and play the game. not this one though. i was always wondering where i was and trying to guess why things were the way they were. the only problem i could find with the game was that the ending was rushed and things left unanswered:the story was pretty short, which wasn't a bad thing, but the details on what happened and were you were wasn't ""concretely"" explained. you you have to figure it out yourself with collectables, which you find throughout the game which did pretty much tell you, but it wasn't enough for me. i guess i wanted more back story for your character and the world you are in. there are a lot of questions on my mind about everything. maybe i'm just over thinking it, but i really liked the setting of the game, it's characters, and what was going on so i want to know everything haha.the ending also left on one of those ""cliffhangers"" where you know there isn't going to be a next time, but something happened that you want to see more, and it pisses you off because it kind of makes it seem like there is going to be a sequel which will go into more detail about what just happened, but you know there won't be one.[POTENTIAL SPOILER] as for being rushed, i guess i just don't like how fast and easily everything wrapped up with the family due to the circumstances and their past......its hard to describe with out any spoilers.over all, it was a very enjoyable game and i'm glad i bought it. i would like a sequel with more detail about the characters and setting.

												Contrast is a game I can't help but really enjoy. A new mechanic done in an interesting way couched in gorgeous art direction can really make up for rather stilted... everything else. The concepts are there. The skill level is there. What's lacking is the actual execution.It comes across the worst is the dialogue - decent lines read by good voice actors come across with too little impact simply because the delivery wasn't quite right, the pacing not quite right. The music is spare and doesn't serve much to hype whatever's going on, and many scenes feel bare without it. This is all a shame, because clearly there's something going on here - the dreamlike world, the shadow-people, the family drama. All of this is sorely under-embellished. There's no weight or time given for these scenes, no gravity - except for when you're jumping through them (which I actually found really neat!)But what IS there is largely delightful. Didi has pep and zing, even if her voice actress is a little bit unpleasant to listen to. I was more than happy to help Didi make a change in her family's life and make their business her business with an aplomb and positively not often seen in games. The environment is fun to explore in and has a wonderful feel.Oh and the gameplay is fun and okay.There's a solid 3-4 hours of gameplay here - you decide what that's worth. I enjoyed this different kind of tale told in a different kind of way, and I'm very eager to see how this developer will grow in future games.			"

												Very worth it. There are a few jumping puzzles that get frustrating due to the... imprecise collision, but it's not a game breaker.The world-building, story-telling, and sound are what really made this stand out for me.It's short, sweet, and exactly as much game as it needed to be.			"

												A puzzle game with no combat.You play the friend of this little girl. Only she can see you and she needs her help to visit and help her father out.The main feature of this game is that you can walk on shadows. As you find your way blocked, switch to the shadow realm and walk on shadows. Go back to the real 3D world and push objects so the light creates shadow paths you can use. Turn on the ferris wheel and have multiple horses moving up and down on the wall behind it so you can reach the shadow of a billboard all so that you can climb over a wall that was blocking your path.The game is very different and good. The music is Jazz. The only downside to this game is that it is rather short.Highly recommend this game!			"

												Contrast is one of those games that can easily be beat within a few hours ( I took roughly 3.5 hours to play through and get the few achievements I missed). This game while linear is a very fun. There are a few puzzles that you are bound to get stuck on and make you really think. The story is also quite interesting and could easily gain a sequel in the future.I would highly recommend this game, however you may want to wait for a sale.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing Contrast. Great atmosphere, a story line with real heart and most of all a truly original game mechanic: Switching from the 'real' world to the shadows in order to manipulate the environment and solve the puzzles.Cons: Controls can be hit and miss at times, it was rather short: I finished it under 5 hours and it wasn't as if I was rushing.

												How and where to begin this review? Like most story driven games, I shall begin with the plot and the setting. Both of these strive very well indeed; however, due to the game's short length (roughly four hours for me), the story unravels greatly towards the end. You can see where Compulsion Games were wanting to go with it, but unforunately the developers were told to wrap it up, and it shows in Act III.It was disappointing because the noir setting was surperb, and the story soars in Acts I and II. The music and voice acting are top notch. I also loved the idea of Dawn being an imaginary friend and the concept of traveling from the real world to the shadow world.However, the controls in this game is what did it for me. The game is a platformer, which I admit that I am okay at them. Dawn would not stop getting stuck on little things or would pop out the shadow world even when there weren't any conflicting shadows nearby. There were also numerous times in which you should be able to jump onto a simple ledge in the 3D world that was only waist high; however, Dawn would refuse to jump onto it. And due to the game's short length the puzzles weren't that hard to solve. The mouse is what controls your camera angle, and it felt like you had to barely move it or else everything goes haywire.All in all, Contrast is a game that had so much potential and soars through the air in the first two Acts. Then, it faceplants in the third act. I did buy this during the Steam Summer, so for just $7.99 (got the soundtrack as well) I did get my money's worth....just wished that there were tighter controls and a longer game length.			"

												While ""Contrast"" is certainly not a ""AAA"" game - the gameplay is a little rough around the edges in ways that can put a hitch in some of the platforming puzzles, and the graphics look like they belong a generation earlier - it's filled with style and atmosphere that invokes Tim Burton, focused gameplay, and a feel that throws back to the earlier days of 3D platformers that kicked up a nice nostalgia trip.And it has some strong thematic similarities to Bioshock Infinite.Having clocked about 3 hours in it from start to finish, for what it is, the length feels just about right. This is a game you play for the overall experience, so it does what it wants to do without overstaying its welcome.Cool game.			"

												A very satisfying experience. I absolutely LOVE the art!! The scenery by itself is fantastic and the music really made the play through enjoyable. The storyline drew me in and the characters were quirky in their own ways. There are so many great things about this game I don't want to give anything away!It's a very casual play through, not too long but not to short either. Honestly I wouldn't mind playing more. If you enjoy puzzles and platformers, I'd check it out. The puzzles were very fresh with a range of difficulty. The concept of stepping into the shadows gives each puzzle a new look. Very imaginative creations. On the other hand, a few puzzles were a bit frustrating because of the picky mechanics and I found myself forgetting simple things like how to climb because I was busy with shadow walking. Overall it was worth the buy.			"

												I'm a sucker for engrossing environments, and poking around through Contrast's surroundings feels like perusing a Dali exhibit at times. While you're enjoying the ambience, there's a story about a little girl with family troubles that likes to sneak around at night. You play as her mute shadow-friend, swapping between 3Dspace and the 2D shadows cast upon the world.The puzzles are fairly straightforward, although some will take a bit of experimentation. Solving them is less about flipping switches and more comparable to turning the hands on a clock to the correct time: it's difficult to get them in the precise orientation for success, but more often than not you'll get ""close enough."" As a result of this, a good number of the puzzles left me feeling like I'd somehow found an alternate, unintended solution from point A to B. This was actually the case once or twice, as I had found a way to sneak past a goal and into the next room with no way to continue since I didn't take the expected route. Reloading a previous save and checking online for the actual solution was my workaround that one time. I've uploaded a screenshot of this area so you don't get stuck like I did.The shadow-swappy controls are fun, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome, being relatively short to complete (give or take if you go find the hidden locations of stuff). There aren't any badguys to shoot here, and it's a fairly comfy game despite its flaws.			"

												Contrast is a very short game, even without much hurry it can be finished within 4-6 hours. Might be worth waiting for the next Steam Sale. Nevertheless, Contrast is what I call ""art"". The game is sparkling with creativity. The initial idea of switching from 3D ""surreal reality"" to 2D where you become a shadow and walk on shadows is clever and fun. This is what the game is mostly about: solving riddles and tasks by making use of light and shadow, mixed with a lovely story. The world of Contrast is beautiful and very atmospheric and a bit bizarre at the same time. It's pretty much like a dream. The art design, both graphics and sound, is just wonderful, and I very much enjoyed my trip through this game. A short adventure, but clearly one to remember.			"

												Contrast: Endgame Review(TL:DR Quick 'n' Dirty Version: Love it despite its faults. Worth supporting the developers even if just on sale) I'll be honest - I went in prepared to love the sshit out of this game. The artwork was sublime, the music was orjazzmic and the concept was brilliant. Venturebeat had me at ""It's as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan's Labyrinth"" - given that I'd just finished Limbo, and, well, I'm sure my avatar tells you all you need to know about Infinite. Unfortunately, however, Contrast is not without its flaws, like the characters the game adeptly depicts. The story was well paced and engaging and there were some genuinely clever puzzles in the piece, but an overuse of cut-scenes and needlessly fiddly gameplay detracted from the overall satisfactory experience.You play as Dawn, nine-year-old Didi's imaginary friend. Dawn helps Didi solve puzzles and navigate a troubled maze of family relationships by manipulating light and shadow in a sometimes third-person 3D puzzly, sometimes 2D-ish platformy, surreal depiction of the interwar era. The game marries the music of the Jazz Age with high-contrast film noir aesthetics and archetypes, and largely makes this work. It just looks and sounds beautiful, and the voice acting is realistic and moving, especially Didi. There were lots of things the designers managed to get right - little things I really appreciated, like colour-coding the on-screen button prompts (Call me crap, but I'm still SO confused with the XBox buttons because they're the wrong way around from Super Nintendo!) or making it optional to collect everything, but easy to go back; this goes for Luminaries and collectibles. The final puzzles were immensely satisfying; I successfully put to use everything the game had taught me, which meant the learning curve was well thought out. Another thing was the inclusion of the soundtrack and a PDF of the collector's booklet. And now for the whinge. The plot was engrossing, but I got sick to death of being interrupted by cut-scenes every few nanoseconds. The developers, again, got things right by making these skippable, but I felt I couldn't skip them anyway because I didn't want to miss the story. This and the way the camera kept getting yanked out of my control while trying to solve puzzles were some of the irritating aspects of the game: these interruptions kept breaking the flow so that things never really settled into a decent rhythm. The consequence was that, when it came time to jump around, some of the puzzle-solving was quite hard to execute. I opted for a controller over keyboard and mouse, but wasn't entirely satisfied with either option. Shadow-world play is really fiddly; the camera doesn't neatly snap to a 2D view for this mode and I was forever accidentally leaping off into space and having to try again because of this. A lack of micro-save exacerbated the problem. When not in shadow mode, the camera was at times so far up Dawn's bum it was nigh-on impossible to have a good look round for problem-solving, and at other times I'd solved the puzzle mentally but found the solution needlessly difficult to perform... Why have little bumps on the wall just to break you out of shadow mode and make it more difficult? For other puzzles, there was no intermediate feedback to show when the player was on the right track; the light had to be in exactly the right spot or things didn't work, and I had no idea whether I was right in theory or just all wrong. The game's physics also seemed inconsistent; there were loads of times when it looked like Dawn could easily make a certain jump, but wouldn't. I found all this incredibly frustrating to the point of controller-biting and rage-quitting, actually... But Contrast wasn't all bad. As infuriating as the negatives were, the narrative was sustaining with its emphasis on family and dysfunctional relationships. I enjoyed the fact that the characters, though archetypal, were flawed individuals making the best of their respective situations -  a contemporary theme that will resonate with any mature, thinking player. Add it to your wishlist and grab it next time it pops up on sale; you'll enjoy the cheap quickie.			"

												Contrast is game that I liked, but I can easily see why some people might dislike it, and why it got so low score on Metacritic. 1) GameplayContrast comes up with a great concept, but it's been poorly made. The idea of changing from 2D to 3D really inovates (even though there was already a game that came with a concept a lot like that called Perspective, it's a f2p game, go and check it yourself), and brings lots of great moments, but also buggy ones. There were moments where the puzzle wasn't the challenge it self, but the glitches.There were also mechanics that could have been more exploited.2) Art/ Soundtrack/ VoiceactingThe atmosphere of the game is well built by the scenario and the sound track, art desgin really fit's in, but there are problems. The animations weren't much organic (and seem really half baked), there were buggy shadows and some halfbaked props, missing collison on places where it clearly should have something. The voice acting actually impressed me. It's not exceptional, but it fits in to the characters really nicely.3) StoryThe story of Contrast may be for some one of the strogesnt points, but I have to disagree a little bit on that one.The story really intrigued me, and it really got me thinking, but there were some really strange moments. Sometimes it's to obvious that the developers didn't have in mind much about the story, only about the gamplay. But it's a nice story, and the gap for theories are wide open for interpretetions. There are some people making some deep theories, but to  be honest, I don't think they really thought about all that. 4)Conclusion:It's a nice expirience, but it seems like the game was rushed, it's short and there are lots of things that could have been more polished. It's worth a try			"

												Now here's a unusual game.  I'm all about the story. For me a game can get away with average gameplay and a great story, but this game does well in both aspects, great story and great gameplay. Add to that the great artwork, a noir atmosphere, some sad jazz tunes, and you have a game worth keeping.I'm still about halfway through (I suppose). But I've been hooked onto this game. You get to play a silent protagonist who can shift from the real world and into shadows. Shifting into a shadow makes you able to use shadows as a 2D platforms to traverse otherwise impossible to cross areas. You can use shadows as bridges or a sort of transportation device. In the real world (or should I say 3D), you get around just like any 3D platforming game. While in 3D mode you can move objects or light sources to arrange shadows in a way that could help you through some obstacles. The combination of 3D and 2D platforming make for interesting puzzles and a unique gameplay. Definitely, a game worth buying, sale or no sale.  "

												A stunning game. Brilliant concept backed up by some really nice graphics. The storyline is so engaging that I found it hard to put down. The puzzles were often a touch of genius. Not that they were difficult, only one or two stumped me and even then only for a short while. The genius is in the way they suck you into the story a little more each time. Especially the 'flashback' puzzles which can be tricky but never frustrating because the scene you are replaying is always a poignant moment in the story.The soundtrack sets the tone just right and the voice acting is spot on. In particular Teale Bishopric was amazingly good as Didi.Yes I have a few gripes. Jumping could be frustrating at times because it's a little to sensitive to collisions and it would have been nice to be able to customize the key mapping but that's about it.It's a short game but one I will remember for a long time. I think it's almost the perfect length for the story. Yes I would have liked more but that's because I enjoyed it so much.			"

As a stand alone game it shows heart in design and creativity. It is not without its faults it that collision could be a little finicky and the story is not tremendously detailed but i guess you can say that is the charm of the game. Its a simple game with plenty of heart and a small price tag so that anyone can afford it. If your looking for a long game with alot of story look else where but if your looking for a simple game with a creative way of looking at things then pick it up. its worth it.			"

The animations weren't much organic (and seem really half baked), there were buggy shadows and some halfbaked props, missing collison on places where it clearly should have something. The voice acting actually impressed me. It's not exceptional, but it fits in to the characters really nicely.3) StoryThe story of Contrast may be for some one of the strogesnt points, but I have to disagree a little bit on that one.The story really intrigued me, and it really got me thinking, but there were some really strange moments. Sometimes it's to obvious that the developers didn't have in mind much about the story, only about the gamplay. But it's a nice story, and the gap for theories are wide open for interpretetions. There are some people making some deep theories, but to  be honest, I don't think they really thought about all that. 4)Conclusion:It's a nice expirience, but it seems like the game was rushed, it's short and there are lots of things that could have been more polished. It's worth a try			"

												In short: this is a little gem. It is clearly a work of love from some caring people.That said it is also 'little' as in very short.Contrast has innovative gameplay and a good 'girl and family story' set in a very well presented 20's environment. (though kind of missed out on the meaning of the ending ). One of the main characters has an eery resemblance to Tesla by the way.I picked this up in last weeks sale for just under 4,-. I guess it is worth a bit more, but in hind-sight happy that's what it cost me.Basically once finished there is no real replay value. The collectibles are supporting the story, but not really amazing.So it's all about enjoying the experience and perhaps returning after a year or so (just like a good book)This game shares itself among my cherished gaming experiences next to 'Brothers: a tale of two sons' and 'Remember Me'. All not very good in the gaming genre they represent, but they somehow catch you and keep you playing on. That's what a good story can do............So get it in a sale or at full price if you like to support the creators			"

The puzzles are easy, given that I beat the game in around 2-3 hours.  They can be hard if you don't know what you're doing, tho.  Supported by an amazing story and a likable child character (a rarity), Contrast is high on my list.			"

												Contrast has you swapping between 2d and 3d platforming on the fly as your character has the ability to meld into walls with high ""contrast"" lighting. Shadows become navigable platforms that allow you to reach places other wise inaccesible. As you can imagine this creates some interesting puzzles involving moving objects around in 3d space to create your own path way from shadows. The puzzles throw a few monkey wrenches in to try to keep the mechanic from getting stale, but cant maintain the same sense of accomplishment in discovering new way of thinking for the entire 4-5 hour experience.The story does a good job at keeping you interested in the game. You follow a girl and her ""imaginary"" friend as they try to piece together her parents failing relationship. It takes a bit of a weird turn towards the end but it doesn't ruin the rest of the game.It's worth a look if your into platformers at all. Even with the market seemingly flooded with them this one has enough original ideas to float above the rest.			"

												A very charming puzzle-platformer with a very impressive motif and soundtrack. The story of the game largely revolves around a broken family trying to piece itself together and is at its best when it focuses on their trials and tribulations. (It takes a weird turn near the end trying to answer questions I never asked about the broken shadow dimension that protagonist Dawn inhabits that just end up raising even more questions, but that treads into spoiler territory.) Manipulating shadows so that Dawn can become a shadow and platform across them proved to be an interesting challenge that had me scratching my head more than a few times, and they were never afraid of introducing new elements (even if some of those elements involved box-switch puzzles seen in many games before). The game is definitely a bit on the short side, however, and the only thing that kept me from clearing it 100% on my first run was a few collectibles and one item that was only available for a short time frame and ended up being lost forever. It's also very story-focused, and relies heavily on cutscenes to tell its tale. Overall, it's definitely flawed (probably rushed a bit to be a PS4 launch title), but it's an enjoyable game that should be tried.			"

												A good experience from beginning to end. The music and art style of the game is probably what sold it to a lot of people and it is endearing as is the voice actor for the young girl.There are some frustrating moments with the gameplay where it does seem a bit janky and encountered a couple of glitches which required a reload of a chapter but overall still very enjoyable and nice to see some experimentation with new platform mechanics.Story was good and leaves you wondering about certain points during the game even if some small parts come across as cliche the fresher parts more than make up for it. Overall I'd say it's worth the time and money for it, it's fairly short running at 4 hours for full completion but I don't feel short changed and hopefully there'll be a further game following the possible success of this one.

												Rating 8/10Contrast is an interesting little platformer. Taking place in a 1920's setting it uses the setting to make for some great songs and soundtrack. The singer they picked for this was definitely the right choice. The gaming mechanic for this game is that the main character, Dawn, can turn into a shadow person along a wall. They use this very well and it never feels like mechanics are taking a backseat to the progression of the story or that the mechanics are being shoe-horned in.If I had any complains it would be that the game is too short. It didn't take me very long to finish the game with most of the collectibles. That was the only thing that disappointed me. There could of been build up to conclusion to the game's story at the ver least. I would definitely say it's worth the price for anyone who doesn't mind a short, but enjoyable game.			"

												Coming away from Contrast after some thought – it’s come to me that this is a game that I enjoyed more for its theme. I stuck with the game for its amazing setting, lovely soundtrack and to see the end of the story, rather than staying for its 3D-to-2D shifting gameplay. The shortness of the game means that the puzzle mechanics are never given the time to fully grow. Mix this up with some questionable glitches and you’re left with a game that isn’t as well constructed as one would like.Contrast is a curious, fair attempt at a puzzle platformer with some neat ideas that make it somewhat enjoyable, but is a slightly frustrating experience that in the end won’t be remembered for its gameplay, but more for its world, visuals and sound.

												A dark noir atmospheric tale set in the 1920s that is reminiscent of the Dark Horse graphic novel ""Misty Circus"" or many other tales of this genre inspired by Neil Gaiman or the ""Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children"" series. Every aspect about the game is wonderfully enchanting, from the sad storyline of a broken family and child neglect, the beautifully rendered graphics, to the melodic soundtrack. This game successfully transports you to and immerses you in a world of wonder.The mechanics are simple, crossing between a 3d world to a 2d platformer by using light and shadows. The puzzles aren't overly challenging, and neither is the platforming, nor is it necessarily a walk in the park. It's challenging enough to make you feel proud of yourself when you quicly come up with a solution, but not so challenging that you ever get frustrated.Many complaints about this game stem from there not being a tutorial, which IMHO would have ruined the allure of exploring a unqiue world. The only other complaints others have voiced is about bugs which must have been fixed because my playthrough was flawless and entirely bug-free. Pesonally, the only complaint I had about the game is that it is too short and left me wanting more! A word of warning: It can get a little dusty if you take the time to examine the collectibles in the game which may threaten your FPS machismo. You may want to keep your handkerchief nearby if you do.			"

												A three hour game or so about puzzles dealing with shadows. Think Zelda: A Link Between Worlds except fleshed out to have dynamic shadows which are how you mainly interact in the game. Some of the puzzles later on are tough, but managable. Platforming skills are needed.The story is about a little girl, Didi, who wants her dad to reunite with her family. However, her dad has a few reasons why he is not with his family. The story follows a typical film noir story, but is so good in the end. It will make you speculate a little.The music is enjoyable and very immersive for the feel of the setting within the game. Well worth playing.			"

												Although a bit over-priced considering it being so short (I didn't stress through the game what-so-ever and still beat it in three hours) I recommend this game, but I would advice picking it up when it's on sale, since three hours for 14 euro is a bit on the expensive side. A beutifully designed game, with an engaging and sad little story about a young girl. Filled with economical issues, romantic affairs, mafia-involvement and drama.  With heavy elements of film noir, and with a graphic style that in many ways resembles a german expressionist silent film, with a touch of Tim Burton-esque quirkiness as the beutiful cherry on top. The humoristic elements such as hidden mature jokes really made me happy and sometimes I even laughed out loud. The puzzles are interesting, all though not that hard if you're used to puzzle-solving in games. But I still feel this game brought something new to the puzzle-genre. The gameplay mechanics are very well scripted and you quickly forget what buttons you have to click and just do it on impulse, immersed in the quirky little world that the game takes place in. Overall I really enjoyed this game, but it's far too short.			"

												A living embodiment of 3d puzzle combined with the 2D style platformer such that of Limbo. The atmosphere of the game set around the 1920's with its Jazzy influences and the developments of magic shows really opened up a spectacular mystery genre to the art of the game. For a few moments, the game looked easy and only required persistence to get through levels, but eventually requiring more brainwork than eye hand coordination as the levels progressed in acts II and III. What seemed like a memory of the protagonist, Didi, becomes a reality in this magical game of shadows and their players.Overall, one of those masterpieces of 2013 if only the game wasn't so heavy on a simple graphics card!9/10			"

												The trailer does not do this game justice. My initial reason for purchasing this game was mostly for the jazz album I would get as part of the collectors edition ;) But as soon as I started playing it, I was hooked. I really like what they did with the game; the graphics are amazing (for anyone who appreciates abstract, almost creepy, beauty); the characters were very well created, the puzzles are challenging, and overall a good game. However, I feel like the story line lacks a little bit. Gameplay is roughly 5.5 hours (even going through slowly and doing all the ""extra"" stuff), and consists of a girl basically reuniting her parents. There is so much potential the producers could have done with this game, and that's my only complaint. I really wish they would have done more with it because this game was so great! Even though the size of the map doesn't compare to that of Rust (for those of you who are familiar with that), it was so beautifully and artistically created. Very glad I invested in this game and I would definitely play it again to get the collectables I didn't find ;) Plus, if you purchase the collectors edition, you will get a bunch of artwork including details of the making of the characters and other such things, as well as 15 jazz songs that you can save right to your iTunes library :)			"

												Excellent game, although very short, especially if you aren't going to take the effort to collect all the items.  The mechanic is great and has a portal type feel but the mechanics are introduced poorly at times and caused some confusion around the puzzles.  I pulled a walkthrough twice to save me some frustration.  The real downside is that by the time you feel adjusted to how the mechanics work the game's already over.  Still the character and style are fantastic but it suffers from a pretty weak plot, being short and a poor learning curve.Would recommend more highly if the plot was more about the main character and her relationship with the girl and if the game was just longer.

												Contrast, to put into a single word, is marvelous. Its graphics are well detailed, and the way that light is used in this game is borderline genius. The voicework is well done for all characters. The music is excellent, being very rythmic and jazzy. And the story is quite interesting. The collection of collectable that you can obtain is both expansive and impactful for the length of the game. The Bioshock-esque way of using collectables to explain plot points was well done. It was always interesting to read an article about a missing person, or seeing a picture of the ""scientific"" explainations of the shadow world. The light puzzles that are used are especially interesting because the game mechanic of switching between two worlds is wonderfully unique and fun. All of these factors really combine to create an incredible atmosphere.However no game is without its imperfections. Though I do, in fact, recommend this game to anyone who wants a interesting experience, I must also explain the game's faults. Contrast has 2 major flaws which both fall into the gameplay category. The main problem is that Dawn, the main character, is incredibly floaty. She's a tad hard to control because her jump arc seems a tad unnatural. The second would probably be the camera. See the having the camera be controlled by the mouse is fine in third person, but when you enter the shadow world the camera tends to be kinda random, causing you to have to adjust your mouse in odd ways. The small gameplay flaws that Contrast has pales in comparison to the experience of playing it though. Playing through the game is honestly just a marvelous experience, because of it's brilliant atmosphere, as well as its unique concept.			"

It is a game full of character and atmosphere with plenty of fun and extremely creative puzzle-solving missions. The ending is somewhat abrupt at 2 or 3 hours in, and leaves some questions unanswered and open to interpretation, but it is still satisfying while leaving room open for future instalments.In short, it could have been polished a bit better, but there's a great gem here full of life and color (despite presenting a world of colorless shadows), and at $15 it's worth every penny.

												Yes, i recommend it, but just not at full price. In a 50% off sale, you can consider.Contrast is a game that has catched my attention because of its innovative game mechanics, those mechanics are really cool and area a good refreshment. You can classify its gameplay as a platformermer/puzzle game, thoug its puzzle are not hard (unless it bugs). The game charachters are really nice, especially Dawn, but they could be a bit deeper. I think the innovative mechanics could be more explored, and the charachters could gain more depht. The game is really short (it took me 6 hours to beat it and i'm usually slow) and buggy. There are bugs everywhere, some parts of the game are not hard, but you can't complete them because something bugs and makes it more difficult than it should be (stuck on a wall, gone through it, etc). Other complaint is the camera wich could be better placed, because sometimes it makes difficult for you to jump. Though I said a lot of negative points, i recommend Contrast for its inovative mechanics and its nice story.6.8/10			"

												Contrast is an expressive puzzle-narrative in film noir style. The game is about four hours long and employs some innovative mechanics (such as stretching, narrowing, etc the same shadows to reach multiple places. The programming isn't polished, but it's definitely playable. I only glitched out twice. My biggest critique is the general lack of ambient noise/music. A bit more jazz here or there, or some overheard side conversations would have added a bit to the lonely world.The closing words of bioshock infinite go along well with this game. I would recommend buying it solely for the artistic feel and the decent story progression.			"

												This game has a very good puzzle solving mechanic, using shadows as a way of over coming obstacles is imaginative. The lack of game play is a down side as it only took me 3 hours to complete the story and the achievements. A few collision glitches here and there but otherwise a decent game. If you are looking to buy it I would wait till it goes on sale. Almost forgot about the references, good job on those!			"

												Contrast is one of those games that has a good premise - the idea of use light and shadows to create a separate bit of 2D puzzle gameplay from the normal 3D world, but the implementation from a story and setting as well as design is a bit disconnected.  The technical approach is good in how you can shift in an our of shadows, but the problem is that the areas you can do this in are very limited and separated from each other, making each puzzle its own microcosm.   The puzzles that use this aren't that difficult as well, with the most difficult ones being where you can either move objects to change shadows or the location of the light source. Again, with the puzzles being separate entities, these are one-stop problems as opposed to part of a larger difficult mechanism to figure out.The story is interesting but it's hard to get into and leaves some questions on getting into the characters. Whether this is a fantasy, a dream, or something else isn't clear, and whether it is a flashback or the like.  As such, the game quickly devolves into just moving from puzzle to puzzle with story getting in the way.It is still a decent game, but it's one I'd wait for a sale for, getting about 3 hrs of playtime from it.

												(Only half way through) The unique puzzel mechanic and story will keep you playing this indy darling. The setting, theme and style also make this an enjoyable experience. BUT. I have a feeling the publishers are still honing their craft. This game very much holds your hand throughout and the play is very linear. Peppered collectable items are easy to identify and collect though do help develop the story if you care to inspect them. Animations/models are also a bit stiff and the shadow world can be a bit rough around the edges. I feel this game was carefully planned and at a sale price it's worth your time. A great buy @ $10 and (so far) appears kid friendly.			"

ConceptA 2D/3D platformer where you can merge with walls to become a shadow. Utilize this to explore new possibilities in platforming.StoryThe game is divided up into chapters and acts, which you can select from the main screen if you wish. However, the game is really short. I clocked in with about 4 hours on my first playthrough, an hour of which I don't think I was playing. In addition, some mechanic frustrations also prolonged my playthrough.You play as a character named Dawn, whom only Didi can see. Didi is a child of a broken family who is trying to get back together leading to the different levels you encounter. Sometimes this leads to some interesting levels.The game also tries to induce a little mystery of if Dawn is real or not and what exactly is she. However, the game doesn't go too far along that route that it doesn't really matter, especially at the end.GraphicsThe graphics are okay. I had to run this on low settings so I cannot testify how great it can be besides online videos and pictures. I also wonder if the lack of some environment is a result of my computer or design. It does lead to some cool views. The shadow style is a pretty nifty idea that helps distract the player. As I was watching the cutscenes, I was wondering if people can be charmed by simply a shadow on the wall and a voice.SoundThe game has a Jazz music style. It fits with the setting, and the vocals aren't bad in that respect.

The vocals are actually fairly good too. Didi can get annoying sometimes, but sometimes her actions actually brought a smile. It's interesting that Dawn is voiceless but I guess that's to keep the player guessing what she is exactly and if she's real.GameplayThis game had a lot of promise. The idea of manipulating shadows to create solid platforming makes it a small thinking game as well. When I was little, I used to contemplate how interesting it would be if you can become a shadow. This game allows me to play with that idea a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked.You are given 5 basic controls for most of the game. Movement, Interaction, Shifting, Jump, and Dash. You also have control of the camera, which leads me to controller preferences. You do not want to play this game with a mouse and keyboard if you can avoid it. The camera is controlled with the mouse, which you also use for Dash and Shifting. This becomes a problem when you accidently move the camera while meaning to shift or dash. It has led me to many frustrations. The camera setting with the mouse is also too sensitive even after I adjusted it to get it right. When I switched to a 360 controller, the experience improved greatly. The camera was fine and my hands were less confused with which button was shift and which was dash.This game has no action in it, which is good for this style. Since there are no enemies to fight, you can focus on the platforming and puzzles you are given. The promise of the game expands with the different mechanics you find in the different chapters. There is some room for exploration, but not too much freedom. ONe time when I wanted to wander, Didi would interfere and force me to continue.Speaking of Didi, this game started to make me think about useless companions in video games; Didi is one of them. While you need to follow her to know what you next mission is, she never really helps you out. There is one occasion where she helps you out in the story and that is it. It's a shame because the image I posted near the top seemed to promise that you can use Didi to create an environment for you. There is one particular scene where I wish I could have controlled Didi to use something she was right next to instead of me doing something more complex than it needed.One of the things that could use some fine tuning is the mechanics. I resorted to Gamefaqs for one thing only to find that I was doing it right all along, but the game mechanics would screw it up.  The glitch I'm referring to is the game forcing you or an object to shift out where it shouldn't. Eventually I got it to work, but I was still upset over the whole thing. Unfortunately, the mechanics would still be glitchy every now and then, forcing me to restart multiple times when I should have easily progressed. It's a shame too, because if it wasn't for the occasional glitchy mechanics, it would have been a solid platformer. The game does have some redemption on the matter by giving you multiple checkpoints to restart from when you die and it doesn't take too long to reload.ReplayabilityAs mentioned before, the game is short and you can select specific chapters to play again. However, with the frustrations I encountered with the mechanics, and the story not being so grand, I probably would stay away from it for a while before trying to play again.OverallThis is one of those little disappointments for me. The game has promise and it shows it in sparks throughout the game. Unfortunately, it never completely capitalizes on it's potential. It can give you an interesting experience, but I think I would have more faith if they did a sequel with solid mechanics. This is a game where you might want to wait for a good sale before you buy it (maybe $5-7).My recommendation is for platforming fans who want to try something a little different. If you play with a controller and on a computer that can run it smoothly, then it is less frustrating and possible to enjoy.Taken from my blog at http://www.ign.com/blogs/falconrise/2014/02/16/game-review-contrast-for-pc "

												A neat little indie with a cool gameplay hook, but Contrast falls short of its potential.  Contrast has a patchwerk story, which is incredibly unfortunate given the potential of the lore (it's visibly rushed despite a very interesting world).  I love the art style, and particularly love the 2D/3D platforming crossovers.  Contrast cleverly utilises intricate 3D world objects to affect the 2D world (to use a basic example that doesn't spoil the puzzles, dragging an item closer to the light to make the shadow on the wall bigger).  It has a 'cute' companion character and touches on some of the deeper issues surrounding families, but it only lasts about 2-3 hours on a slow playthrough.  I would say about 20-30 minutes of that focuses on the story, and the majority is spent trying to figure out the tricks for the puzzles.  Once you work them out, you could probably play from start to finish in less than an hour, without skipping.There are two types of collectibles.  One type of collectible comes from exploring and overcoming optional puzzles, and is essentially useless outside of the few occasions you need them to progress (When you need them to progress, they're very easy to find).  The other works to build up the lore, and it's quite expansive.  These collectibles flesh out the story in much greater detail than the main storyline, but mostly they serve to highlight just how unfortunate it is that Contrast was cut short.The pros:An old-fashioned setting with a great accompanying visual styleCool dynamics between 2D and 3D elementsSome deep themes around familyClever use of mechanics in puzzlesInteresting loreThe cons:Shallow and disjointed story, with a very rushed ending.The majority of playtime and difficulty comes from initially working out puzzle stylesAn irrelevant collection system (not referring to the lore collectibles)The verdict:Pick it up if you enjoy games with a sense of uniqueness, or the potential for depth (rather than depth itself).  Contrast will test your lateral thinking (though only on a few occasions), and it touches on some pretty cool concepts.			"

												In short: this is a little gem. It is clearly a work of love from some caring people.That said it is also 'little' as in very short.Contrast has innovative gameplay and a good 'girl and family story' set in a very well presented 20's environment. (though kind of missed out on the meaning of the ending ). One of the main characters has an eery resemblance to Tesla by the way.I picked this up in last weeks sale for just under 4,-. I guess it is worth a bit more, but in hind-sight happy that's what it cost me.Basically once finished there is no real replay value. The collectibles are supporting the story, but not really amazing.So it's all about enjoying the experience and perhaps returning after a year or so (just like a good book)This game shares itself among my cherished gaming experiences next to 'Brothers: a tale of two sons' and 'Remember Me'. All not very good in the gaming genre they represent, but they somehow catch you and keep you playing on. That's what a good story can do............So get it in a sale or at full price if you like to support the creators			"

												This game is really charming. You won't find a deep, or intricate story here nor does it present itself that way. There is a lot of love, and care in the art diection, music, character designs and voice acting. The platforming is unique, and an interesting concept. My only problems with the game is that the mechanics of shifting are explained pretty vaguely. The game doesn't really tell you what you can, or can't do when shifting. So puzzles take a bit to solve because of that, and it could frustrate some people myself included. Jumping and movement is pretty sensative which is a big no-no for platformers, but they make up for it with a great jump. Finally the length. If it wasn't for me getting confused with some of the puzzles, and collecting I could've finished this game in 3 hours, or less. But once, again, this isn't a narrative like Bioshock or something, so I'm afraid that if it went on too long it would have lost its luster.All in all I enjoyed my experience, albeit with some frustration. Its a decent game, that's pretty fun, and a cute, charming story. I recommend it if its on Sale.			"

												Beautiful, fun little game. Unfortunately it's only about three hours long.Perhaps a little longer if you really try to get all the collectables.The 2D shadow mechanic is done really well. It's not a difficult game and you can mess up as often as you like. Ideal for people that are actually quite bad at platforming, such as myself.Personally, I wanted more from this game. It's short and so it doesn't drag on, but on the other hand it feels like only the surface of both the story and the mechanics is seen. Only at the very end of the game does it feel comfortable making you take leaps of faith and fulling combining the 2D and 3D puzzles.I really hope there will be a sequel. I just didn't get enough from this.TL;DR:Great game, fun puzzles and easy platforming. Good for a casual 3 hours of gameplay.Beautiful enviroment and good story.			"

												Contrast is an incredible game. The design and the art is lovely, I'm especially impressed with how the borders of the world you can interact with are handled. The shadow mechanic is fun to play with, and leaving out the people and only show the player their shadows is an absolutely brilliant idea. While the glitches aren't in any way game breaking, they may bother some, and the transition between shadow-world and in-game real-world controls can be a bit jarring.			"

Not one of the characters is annoying whilst the collectables are pointless but very cute.It's almost an Art Game but lacks the self-congratulatory ♥♥♥♥♥♥isms of something like Limbo, or the sixth-form angst of Dear Ester. It is, in short, a precious shining gem of a game: a small story (in a good way) with no shooting, no hitting, and no rock music. It's also short, easy and glitchy, but worth every forced restart.Most importantly unlike every other game released in the last ten years, no zombies. Hooray!			"

But I bought it mainly for my 10 year old son, so the difficulty is adequate, and I admire the very idea of the game, the dense atmosphere and the affectionately drawn environment of it.If you like not to difficult puzzling games with a inventive game mechanics, this should be in your collection.

Everything was made with passion in Contrast. The 1900 setting is amazing too.The only complain I have to make is that the control could be a bit more fine tuned, and the length could be a little longer (well, a movie ticket is more expensive), but that is only minor flaws in the amusement of this game/art.

												I thought about writing up a big review, but the more I thought about it the more I think a simple review will do best, because really this game is simply beautiful and fun.The story is cute and well thought out. The visual aspect of the game is phenomenal. The game play is engaging and fun as it integrates with the visual aspects. Buy it, play it, and get all the achievements in under 5 hours. The game is now a happy memory and I am glad I experienced it. I honestly believe everyone should play it.			"

												While this game is lovingly crafted, there are a lot of problems with it. I really do enjoy the gameplay and the stylisation of it all but I have to say the glitches are beyond infuriating. I cannot count how many times I have been pushed out of shadow in to the real world at just the wrong moment. After a while, some of the puzzles get repetitive and boring. Which is a shame because the ones that are not are really engaging and fun.			"

												Contrast is a 3rd person platforming puzzle game that uses the shadows cast on walls as its primary medium. The artwork is reminiscent of the 1920's and the rest of the game follows suit. There are some incredibly good songs in this one but the overall music is just decent.The controls and actual implementation of game mechanics can feel awkward and unpolished at times. The game makes up for this though...by limiting when you actually get to use any that. Level design feels incredibly linear at points, and some of the dialog and writing could have been done better.It's a very short game and the difficulty isn't really there to prolong the length. There are some very obvious and often angering bugs that appear in game, mostly when using your shadows, which happens to be the primary game mechanic..The culmination of all these factors led me to believe that the game was not ready for release. It had a very rushed and unpolished feel to it.It was still an enjoyable play and I would recommend it for most people. When its on sale again. "

I just expected a little more story, a little more secrets, a little more wandering, but less cutscenes. you take 7 steps and you get a cutscene, you jump over something, cutscene, Not enough interaction. I felt very limited. It just feels like it was rushed. Most beautiful idea.			"

												This was an entertaining four hour game. The puzzles were not frustrating. Just a matter of tweaking the shadows or timing jumps. Didn't notice any glithing as some said, at least not in shadow mode, unles they are talking about the pilaster kicking you out of shadow mode, but that seemed intentional. The only glitches I came across were at the beginning where Didi was acting weird. She was sliding across the alley outside her bedroom. I have only played through it once, but I have not seen that in the Let's Plays I have seen. This game is set in one of my favourite time periods. I just want to go take a walk in an urban setting at night after some rain in the 1920s. It's just my thing. The music is wonderful. If that doesn't set the tone, the surreal outer limits of void and exploded elements set another tone, the more sci-fi part of the game.Through the collectables, Dawn's character is explained as to where she came from and why she is hanging around Didi. Overall, I enjoyed the storey around Didi and the members of here family, and the voice acting suited each member really well.			"

												Contrast is a very fun and beautiful game. The story is great but the world isn't as good. The world only consists of shadows and you and Didi so there's not much to see. It is fun finishing puzzels and the game first try took me about 6 hours to finish. This is an ok amount of gameplay but for speed runners you could easily finish the game in an hour, Although you could go back and collect achievements, luminaries, and collectible images. Overall this game is very good and I would recommend this game. I rate this game a 9/10.			"

												a nice little game with a nice mix of 2D platforming and 3rd person perspective. the story is touching and mature how a little girl tries to get her family back together by solving shadow puzzles. there are some frustrating moments that switching back to a shadow does not always work but it dint ruin the experience. not really worth full price since it is a short game but a game that should be played if you like a little mix of 2D and 3D or a break from shooting stuff down.

												Contrast is a pretty short game and it could benefit from a lower price point or some more content.Yet the small bit you do get is puzzle platforming wonder. The shifting from 2D to 3D perspective is a concept I really need to see more of, some of the puzzles can be actually confusing, and it's all crafted very nicely.I'm more of a gameplay person, but here the gameplay was completely overshadowed by everything else. The environments are visually stunning, the art style is superb, and the story has some pretty good character development.It's not perfect, but it's unique. There was a certain charm in Contrast that I haven't seen anywhere else. A truly marvelous world, where you don't have enemies or shooting to ruin the beauty of it all.There's not much replayability, so give yourself 4-5 hours to just sit down and play this in one sitting. It's best to give yourself the glory of Contrast all at once, because there's not much of it.			"

												I do recommend Contrast, but just barely.  It's yet another puzzle platformer. The hook in this one is the main character can turn into a 2D shadow on the wall to overcome environmental puzzles. It's not that original of a mechanic, but it goes well with the noir look of the game. Objects and light sources get moved around to create the perfect shadow that the player can use to proceed. Unfortunately, this game is pretty easy and the 2D shadow puzzles aren't nearly as creative as they could have been. There's also a melodramatic story about bad things happening to poor people in 1920's France. Another thing too, is the world is all but empty. The game looks fantastic, but it is devoid of any life as only the main character and little girl are depicted as more than shadows on the wall. There's a kind of weird motif in the game where the player is jumping across the bodies of shadow characters acting out scenes on the sides of buildings. The game took around five hours to finish. The voice acting was good. Almost good enough to make me care about the corn ball story that throws every cliché in the book at you to manipulate your emotions. Some of the puzzles were fun and generally exploring the world of Contrast was enjoyable. The best way to summarize this game is that it had a lot of potential that was never fully realized. The actual game is just the 2D shadow projection on the wall from the game that could have been. The people that made this game are obviously talented. I'm looking forward to the next thing they do and hope they learn from their mistakes.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Contrast is a game developed by Compulsion Games, the same people behind We Happy Few. Contrast was Compulsion Games' first game before the development of We Happy Few and the game was published by Focus Home Interactive. Contrast takes place in a Caberat setting where a young girl Didi and her friend Dawn (who you play) set out on an adventure to save Didi's father from losing out more debt on a circus he wants to buildIt seems as if Dawn is an imaginary character and only Didi can see her, Dawn also has the ability to blend in with the shadows, this is the main gameplay concept. You, as the player, have the ability to blend in with the shadows and interact with objects and go up to higher levelsThrough this you solve puzzles and progress through the story. Although this game is in 3D, a heavy amount of the game is puzzle platforming. The platforming in Contrast is the weakest bit, some of the platforming bits in the game were frustrating and outright annoyingAnother issues with Contrast is Dawn's jumping ability, its too weak and so feeble that you have to place Dawn in the exact point that the game wants you to do it, if not, you will die countless timesThe story is good although the game is extremely short (finished the main story in two hours and in one whole sitting) and I was expecting the game to be longer, however, with the annoying puzzle platforming bits and the horendous jumping ability, I was happy that the game ended quicklyThe voice acting is really good. The game camera and animation is the poorest aspect of the game (including the puzzle platforming segments and Dawn's jumping ability) and you could tell that this was Compulsion Games' first game as the animations and camera work greatly improved in their second game, We Happy FewHowever, Contrast is a nice little short puzzle platformer game which although it has a few annoying segments here and there, it is a nice game to play in one whole sitting RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Who doesn’t appreciate some nice cabaret every now and then?I know I do.There’s something otherworldly about those noirish personas, drawing you into their game of lust and intrigue with dance and performance. Often with dark and gloomy attire, but of such a vibrant and exuberant character. Such melancholy, yet so much joie de vivre. A world of contrasts. Compulsion Games’ first game shares this same vibe, but not always in a good way…http://www.mush-room.be/startgame/the-show-must-go-on-2/ "

												Just finished the game and now here is my review.This game has a LOT of positive aspects and two negative aspects.Let's start with the cons: it's really short. Dramatically short. And the price isn't too high.Besides that the atmosphere is really magical, the idea of switching between the 3d world to the 2d world of shadows is really great and offers you some enjoyable moments and some locations are... dunno... special? I passed 10 minutes just staring the carousel.The main story is simple but a lot of other parallel stories are just outlined. So the game lets you dream about them. Who is Dawn? Why you can see Didi but the other people are just shadows for you? And how can Didi see you? Is she somehow special? The people see you as a shadow too? Is there a special relationship between Dawn and Vincenzo?...and above all... there will be a Contrast2? :D "

												Contrast was really well done, and I thoughly enjoyed it.Gameplay: 7.5/10Pros: Makes me think of Super Paper Mario, because in this game you switch back in forth between 3D and 2D platformming.Cons: Few qinks here and there nothing to bad. Example being some switchs you have to be facing just the right way for them to work. For every cutscene in the game the screen would fade to black before which can get annoying after awhileGraphics: 9.5/10Pros: Beautiful. Just Beautiful. The 1920's noir feel with the cartoony flair was well done 10/10 here.Cons. Some draw distance issues like pop ins, and flashes. Nothing to bothersome.Story: 9/10Pros: Very well written in my opinion. A lot darker then I expected, but given how the games looks it fits perfectly.Cons: ShortOverall: 9/10Well done game with only a few minor issues. Only major complaint is its short.			"

Beside that fantastic artwork there is a game that is not flawless, handling is not the best and it lasts about 3-5h hours. There are some bugs, some tricky jumps / platforms, less checkpoints than desired.Music is most of the time minimalistic but it has 2 or 3 fantastic tracks that provides enjoyable moments like carrousel.I'd say that this game should last more for the release price... keep in mind that you will not replay it...Sum up:Graphics: 7.5Sound: 10Gameplay: 6.5Should you play this game?

I did put some 15$ on it and I'm not feeling that my money was stolen in any way, since the soundtrack was beautiful, the backgrounds were impressive, the story was compelling (even if quite simple) and the gameplay was really good.

												It's okay I guess.. I wish the story was longer than this. Puzzle is not so bad. Graphic is good. What I hate was there was no sound when the character was walking. No background music at all or really tiny bit of music. The background music occurred only when the big events happened. I really hate that. They already have wonderful background music and why they didn't use it for during entire playing game? :( Or is it error?			"

												Absolutely beautiful game - fantastic soundtrack, innovative game mechanics and a lovely feel to the environments, very dream like. Speaking of environments, to me they're most reminiscent of Bioshock Infinite (of all things!) which in my view is high praise indeed!The game is quite short at ~4 hours and this works in the sense that, like Portal, it doesn't faff around too much and reuse environments or waste your time with busy work. In short, it doesn't outstay its welcome... Having said that, in my view it could do with being about 2 hours longer ideally - I'd love to see perhaps one more big environment like the circus and a bit more puzzles really making use out of all the various mechanics.But I'm nit-picking - this is a fantastic game and well worth playing!

												Well where to start ? Okay I have been waiting for two years to play this game. It finally came out and so I did. It is simply like a critic once said ''It is like Limbo and Bioshock had a child together and Contrast is that child''. So rightous but also very indipendent from those games. Contrast has some references from both Bioshock and Limbo which I love them both and after I saw them I felt very touched. It's gameplay is very very unique and it has some science in it too like quantum physics and parallel universes as A.Einstein stated. My only complain was about the puzzles. Yes I know this is a puzzle platformer but it gives you so much puzzle and a little story on the sides that you would like to have some more because I think it was awesomely fair. Soundtrack is amazing if you are into Jazz/Blues. Modelling and artwork is also dashing. Ofcourse game has its problems when it comes to performance but then again this game never got a big budget so I can not blame the producers. Story is depressive and gloomy but with that being said, I like that kind of stories because life is like that too. To sum it all up, I am perfectly OK with the money I spent on this game (which I preordered it) and easily can recommend this to people around me.			"

												A very charming puzzle-platformer with a very impressive motif and soundtrack. The story of the game largely revolves around a broken family trying to piece itself together and is at its best when it focuses on their trials and tribulations. (It takes a weird turn near the end trying to answer questions I never asked about the broken shadow dimension that protagonist Dawn inhabits that just end up raising even more questions, but that treads into spoiler territory.) Manipulating shadows so that Dawn can become a shadow and platform across them proved to be an interesting challenge that had me scratching my head more than a few times, and they were never afraid of introducing new elements (even if some of those elements involved box-switch puzzles seen in many games before). The game is definitely a bit on the short side, however, and the only thing that kept me from clearing it 100% on my first run was a few collectibles and one item that was only available for a short time frame and ended up being lost forever. It's also very story-focused, and relies heavily on cutscenes to tell its tale. Overall, it's definitely flawed (probably rushed a bit to be a PS4 launch title), but it's an enjoyable game that should be tried.			"

The story begins well but the ending is so rushed that I almost wish I didn't play it through the end. Overall completion time is barely 4 hours with all achievements.If you're going to buy it, do it while it's on sale (preferably more than 50% off).

												Contrast has fantastic art, atmosphere, story, and puzzles. The story is on the shorter side; most players will beat it in less than 5 hours. The main drawback of this game is the lackluster camera controls, which combined with some of the puzzles is really frustrating. The game designers did a great job with smartly placed checkpoints that threw you back into action almost immediately. It's almost like they knew where most players will wipe. Prepare to die ALOT in this game. I would only recommend buying this on sale. 75/100.			"

												Although very short, it's fairly well done.  The movement is a bit awkward at times but you get use to it pretty quickly and isn't annoying.  the transistions from shadows to 3D is done very well and the puzzles are neat and not tedious unless you've played it through a couple times (to get achievements or whatnot).  Really cool atmosphere and pretty good little story and too.  The voice acting has some immersion breaking moments, but overall good enough to be ignored.Recommended if you're looking for a side-scroller semi casual game to play as a break from other games (this wasn't intended to be a negative statement).

												Coming away from Contrast after some thought – it’s come to me that this is a game that I enjoyed more for its theme. I stuck with the game for its amazing setting, lovely soundtrack and to see the end of the story, rather than staying for its 3D-to-2D shifting gameplay. The shortness of the game means that the puzzle mechanics are never given the time to fully grow. Mix this up with some questionable glitches and you’re left with a game that isn’t as well constructed as one would like.Contrast is a curious, fair attempt at a puzzle platformer with some neat ideas that make it somewhat enjoyable, but is a slightly frustrating experience that in the end won’t be remembered for its gameplay, but more for its world, visuals and sound.

												Main reason I bought this game was because the gameplay looks similar to Lost in Shadow for Wii. Playing in shadows is so mysterious and entertaining. As I played the game I was amazed by its concept and art(Dawn is so trendy). I'd always ask 'why everyone are shadows? why the city is like that?' and getting to the end all these answers start to show up and there comes the plot twist, what made Contrast one of my favorite games. I'm really impressed with the story. The gameplay is okay, jumping around and solving puzzles has its fun and boring parts but still enjoyable. However, the game looks a bit unfinished. I got stuck 4 times and I lost the box I was using but it wouldn't respawn more so I had to reset the whole chapter. Can't wait to play it again!			"

												I'm going to recommend this game, but I will give a caveat - I bought it on a good sale, when it was under 4 bucks.  At that price, it's well worth it.  At full price... probably not.This is a nice little game, with a really fantastic concept - the idea of shifting in and out of a 2D shadow world, and solving puzzles by moving objects and lights in 3D in order to properly align their shadows in 2D is very clever.  The music and atmosphere is quite nice as well, and the voice acting is well-done.  The story is a little thin, but I can't complain too much about that.Now, the down sides.  First off, the game is quite short.  I completed it in just a few hours, and I'm sure many players could do it in even less time.  Also, the controls are a little... I don't know how to describe it, exactly.  Often, when working in the 3D world, the camera will drift a little oddly, and you end up running into a wall unintentionally.  In the 2D world, you find yourself occasionally falling out of the shadows for small things - bumping into the wrong shadow, jumping across a wall of a darker color.  Not consistently, and not enough to ruin the game, but enough to make it a little frustrating occasionally.  Control just doesn't always feel right.While there are some good puzzles, and the atmosphere is quite interesting, often it feels like the designers weren't quite sure what to do with the concept.  Finally, gameplay is interrupted far too often by cutscenes.  I understand the desire to tell the story, and to set the stage for each new area, but it is annoying when control is taken from you every 5 minutes or so.This review ended up seeming a lot more negative than I actually feel about the game.  As I said at the start, if you get it on sale for less that 5 dollars or so, I think it's worth it, if you enjoy casual puzzle games with a unique atmosphere.  Ultimately, though, I would love to see this concept fleshed out more in another game.  It's a great idea that this game just couldn't quite do justice to.			"

												I read many of the negative reviews here and agree that the controls could be more precise, but I never found it frustrating. Compared with the greates action puzzles games of all times (IMHO Portal/Portal 2), it is not very difficult and relativly short. But I bought it mainly for my 10 year old son, so the difficulty is adequate, and I admire the very idea of the game, the dense atmosphere and the affectionately drawn environment of it.If you like not to difficult puzzling games with a inventive game mechanics, this should be in your collection.

												Gorgeous game! I loved the soundtrack, the aesthetics, and the whole concept! Each puzzle is very unique and some are pretty difficult, so the game never got repretitive and stayed interesting. Admittedly, the controls are a little clunky during some puzzles, but it isn't so bad that any puzzle is impossible to complete. You may just have to die or fall a few times before you can get it just right. The game only runs about 4 or 5 hours from start to finish, plus a little more if you have to replay a few chapters to complete all of the achievements. For the relatively short game length, the story is actually very well developed; however, the focus is obviously the puzzles and not story-rich content, so don't expect anything too in-depth.All in all, I was very impressed!

												In short: this is a little gem. It is clearly a work of love from some caring people.That said it is also 'little' as in very short.Contrast has innovative gameplay and a good 'girl and family story' set in a very well presented 20's environment. (though kind of missed out on the meaning of the ending ). One of the main characters has an eery resemblance to Tesla by the way.I picked this up in last weeks sale for just under 4,-. I guess it is worth a bit more, but in hind-sight happy that's what it cost me.Basically once finished there is no real replay value. The collectibles are supporting the story, but not really amazing.So it's all about enjoying the experience and perhaps returning after a year or so (just like a good book)This game shares itself among my cherished gaming experiences next to 'Brothers: a tale of two sons' and 'Remember Me'. All not very good in the gaming genre they represent, but they somehow catch you and keep you playing on. That's what a good story can do............So get it in a sale or at full price if you like to support the creators			"

(I hope theres some dlc plans)- The story can be lackluster overall, though it has it's moments.- Ran into a glitch at the carousel where I already activated the controls then left the area, and when I came back, it prompted me to put the luminaries into the controls, while it was already full. I couldn't turn back on the carousel, and was forced to restart the level. Overall, a really good game!

												Beautiful, fun little game. Unfortunately it's only about three hours long.Perhaps a little longer if you really try to get all the collectables.The 2D shadow mechanic is done really well. It's not a difficult game and you can mess up as often as you like. Ideal for people that are actually quite bad at platforming, such as myself.Personally, I wanted more from this game. It's short and so it doesn't drag on, but on the other hand it feels like only the surface of both the story and the mechanics is seen. Only at the very end of the game does it feel comfortable making you take leaps of faith and fulling combining the 2D and 3D puzzles.I really hope there will be a sequel. I just didn't get enough from this.TL;DR:Great game, fun puzzles and easy platforming. Good for a casual 3 hours of gameplay.Beautiful enviroment and good story.			"

												A neat little indie with a cool gameplay hook, but Contrast falls short of its potential.  Contrast has a patchwerk story, which is incredibly unfortunate given the potential of the lore (it's visibly rushed despite a very interesting world).  I love the art style, and particularly love the 2D/3D platforming crossovers.  Contrast cleverly utilises intricate 3D world objects to affect the 2D world (to use a basic example that doesn't spoil the puzzles, dragging an item closer to the light to make the shadow on the wall bigger).  It has a 'cute' companion character and touches on some of the deeper issues surrounding families, but it only lasts about 2-3 hours on a slow playthrough.  I would say about 20-30 minutes of that focuses on the story, and the majority is spent trying to figure out the tricks for the puzzles.  Once you work them out, you could probably play from start to finish in less than an hour, without skipping.There are two types of collectibles.  One type of collectible comes from exploring and overcoming optional puzzles, and is essentially useless outside of the few occasions you need them to progress (When you need them to progress, they're very easy to find).  The other works to build up the lore, and it's quite expansive.  These collectibles flesh out the story in much greater detail than the main storyline, but mostly they serve to highlight just how unfortunate it is that Contrast was cut short.The pros:An old-fashioned setting with a great accompanying visual styleCool dynamics between 2D and 3D elementsSome deep themes around familyClever use of mechanics in puzzlesInteresting loreThe cons:Shallow and disjointed story, with a very rushed ending.The majority of playtime and difficulty comes from initially working out puzzle stylesAn irrelevant collection system (not referring to the lore collectibles)The verdict:Pick it up if you enjoy games with a sense of uniqueness, or the potential for depth (rather than depth itself).  Contrast will test your lateral thinking (though only on a few occasions), and it touches on some pretty cool concepts.			"

												Contrast is an incredible game. The design and the art is lovely, I'm especially impressed with how the borders of the world you can interact with are handled. The shadow mechanic is fun to play with, and leaving out the people and only show the player their shadows is an absolutely brilliant idea. While the glitches aren't in any way game breaking, they may bother some, and the transition between shadow-world and in-game real-world controls can be a bit jarring.			"

												I loved this game.  Combo of Portal, Bioshock Infinite and Limbo.  Loved the music and story which I wish was stretched out a lot more, but there is no point on making a more complex story if you don't have the money to make it longer, so what can you do. The only minuses are the short length (~4 hours including finding all the collectables and achievements) and it is overpriced (get it on sale).An indie gem.			"

The puzzle part of this game is very fun, it challenges how you think and interact with the game world and the environment.

When it is on sale, you should definitly grab it instantly. I got some magical hours out of it that simply made me feel happier. 9/10			"

												Took me 9 hours to finish and find all collectibles and all Steam achievements. If you're used to this kind of game it might take even less, so maybe some people will probably think the game is too short.  Except for collectibles and achievements you probably won't play it more than once... However I see it as reading a short novel in a very interactive way. So if I'd pay for a book that would maybe take me 8 or 9 hours to read (and that I wouldn't read again too soon), why not pay for a game as fun as this one? I loved the story and how it unfolded.The puzzles in the beginning are very easy, but later start getting harder. Since it's a short game I definitely don't recommend reading/watching walkthroughs. The feeling of accomplishment in a game like this one is important and puzzles ARE reasonable.The only time I watched a walkthrough was in a part when I was sure there had to be a way to move a light beam and that that would help me find the solution, but I wasn't able to move it. I confirmed that that was the case and figured out by myself that I had to use the mouse (as when moving the camera) because of some probable incompatibility with the controller. So, two hints (no spoilers) you might need that for me were not that obvious and got me stuck for a long while:- Sometimes you have to get very near something to interact with it.- If you use a controller, you might still need to use the mouse every now and then to move the camera and light beams.Other than that, I got no issues with the game. The atmosphere reminds me of Grim Fandango, one of my favorite games of all times!I strongly recommend this game.			"

												Now here's a unusual game.  I'm all about the story. For me a game can get away with average gameplay and a great story, but this game does well in both aspects, great story and great gameplay. Add to that the great artwork, a noir atmosphere, some sad jazz tunes, and you have a game worth keeping.I'm still about halfway through (I suppose). But I've been hooked onto this game. You get to play a silent protagonist who can shift from the real world and into shadows. Shifting into a shadow makes you able to use shadows as a 2D platforms to traverse otherwise impossible to cross areas. You can use shadows as bridges or a sort of transportation device. In the real world (or should I say 3D), you get around just like any 3D platforming game. While in 3D mode you can move objects or light sources to arrange shadows in a way that could help you through some obstacles. The combination of 3D and 2D platforming make for interesting puzzles and a unique gameplay. Definitely, a game worth buying, sale or no sale.  "

												A stunning game. Brilliant concept backed up by some really nice graphics. The storyline is so engaging that I found it hard to put down. The puzzles were often a touch of genius. Not that they were difficult, only one or two stumped me and even then only for a short while. The genius is in the way they suck you into the story a little more each time. Especially the 'flashback' puzzles which can be tricky but never frustrating because the scene you are replaying is always a poignant moment in the story.The soundtrack sets the tone just right and the voice acting is spot on. In particular Teale Bishopric was amazingly good as Didi.Yes I have a few gripes. Jumping could be frustrating at times because it's a little to sensitive to collisions and it would have been nice to be able to customize the key mapping but that's about it.It's a short game but one I will remember for a long time. I think it's almost the perfect length for the story. Yes I would have liked more but that's because I enjoyed it so much.			"

												Contrast is a platformer/puzzle game with good graphics and a fair story. I can honestly say if it is patched and expanded on it could lead to something really great. As a stand alone game it shows heart in design and creativity. It is not without its faults it that collision could be a little finicky and the story is not tremendously detailed but i guess you can say that is the charm of the game. Its a simple game with plenty of heart and a small price tag so that anyone can afford it. If your looking for a long game with alot of story look else where but if your looking for a simple game with a creative way of looking at things then pick it up. its worth it.			"

												Contrast is nothing short of a work of art. The atmosphere immerces you right away as the art style, astounding music and the overall world feeling come together in fleshing out the film noir setting. The game mechanic is also very interesting, sure to satisfy both those who look for a puzzle and those who enjoy platforming, and if you like exploring and collectables you're gonna find plenty of that as well. Special mention to the sound track that might be worth the game price by itself if you're into that kind of music.			"

I also ran into a puzzle that I had to restart manually because I had bugged it by accident. One time I ascended a tower by walking upwards on air... these are the bugs/collisions I'm talking about.That being said if the art style captivates you I would suggest playing the game. The games puzzles aren't to complicated, but the unique shadow mechanic is a nice deviation from other titles. The story and music perfectly match the art. So this game won't be a thumbs up by everybody, but I enjoyed myself.			"

												Contrast is a nice little puzzler/platformer with some really pleasant touches. The basic concept of using shadows is just really inventive, and being able to manipulate them meant that the level design became even more impressive. I loved the concept. I thought the world imagery was great with soemwhere between a 1930's dreamscape, and the music were wonderfully sultry and bluesy. The visuals are of a good standard too with a clear style. Overall its a very clever game, with some really well thought through touches and a great feel to it On the bad side, the puzzles are a little easy to complete and the game is just too short. I don't consider myself to be a particularly good platform player, so with only 5 hours to complete the whole thing, it felt a bit lacking in depth. The plot was good enough, though I felt there was more of a story to tell, so it could've done with more development. The controls are a little glitchy at times too and you'll miss jumps. Overally not a bad game at all but needed more to it. Will give it a comfortable 8 / 10 "

												Exactly what it says on the tin:  a puzzle platformer requiring you to shift between the 3D ""real world"" and the 2D ""shadow world."" Even the real world has its own strange characteristics however, such as bottomless pits, which makes you wonder just how ""real"" it is.  I recommend this game for those of you who like platformers or atmostpheric stories.My one complaint about the game is that the collision boxes are sometimes unpredictable, such that you may occasionally misjudge your jumps or object interactions.  However, this doesn't really affect your ability to complete the game, so you may consider this a minor nitpick.The story is of the ""small and personal"" kind.  You're not saving the galaxy; you're just taking care of a little girl.  Depending on your attitude towards precocious children, this girl may or may not be annoying to you.

I like how it doesn't even tell you who you are or why you exist when you first start.I would recomend this to someone who enjoys puzzles, mysteries and to-the-point games. It's pretty much open map, you can go anywhere at any time, you can be in the middle of a challange and just walk back out the front door (if you can make it back there) and go somewhere else, though unless you're searchig for more luminaries, there's not much point. There are a couple of things you can collect on the side: luminares and collectables. The collectables are like a little side story/mission, but like I said, the game is pretty much to the point and doesn't waste much time.I feel like I just read a really interesting novela.			"

												Amazing game! Not only do you get to explore a nice French 1932 environment with some interesting achievements, you get to run along walls and use the light and shadows to your advantage. Can't reach that high up balcony? Shift the light around until shadows form for you to walk on. Simple, short, but so much fun!Does this game have downsides? Yes, it does, but nothing much to make you stop playing. For one, this game is fairly short, only three acts. I played 8 hours and got all the collectibles and achievements. And I'm not even too great at platformers. Also, as demonstrated in the trailer, the little girl you with helps you along the shadows by holding up a stick. Sadly (SPOILER), that is the only time that happens. I think they could've used that mechanic better.Still, I'd say this game is a definate must-buy, if you can get it on a discount. 8/10, mostly because of flawless gameplay, beautiful art-design and great jazzy music.

												In the end everybody should stand up and give a round of applause, so impressive and nicely done.The mechanics through entering the shadows and having to exit creates such awesome puzzles.Gameplay and graphics are well done, actually much more than that.However the masterpiece in this game is the soundtrack, FABULOUS. When I first opened the game while hearing the song over the menu, really, that was an awesome sensation. It was literally music to my ears and this high level of soundtrack keeps going during all the game.I don't know if it is kind of a spoiler but at first I was like in doubt in the first scene where Didi is in her room and her mom appears through the shadows, but that makes sense over the ending.Only a few issues with my controller that would not jump in certain occasions that would soon enough become normal.(I think the problem really is in my controller not really how the game adapted it, but...)Only a few bugs with the character and the scenario, nothing like would destroy the game, because it doesn't even affect the gameplay (like the carousel would spin and the character stands still).The studio created their own style, of course people will compare it limbo (black and white through the shadows) and I still don't know why but gave me a déjà vu of bioshock infinite like the theory from multiverse and portals used between shadows, people will say that somehow the appearance of Dawn remembers Elizabeth and the city is in the sky?(That's what it looks like to me). Congratulations for the studio and keep the hard work to develop others great pieces of art like these. (And let me know about it, I would love to play again any other creation).			"

												Contrast left me wanting more. I loved the shadow world you get to explore with Dawn and Didi. Its style and story is the kind of thing you best see in foreign films and the magic realism of Neil Gaiman (Mirrormask in particular kept cropping up as I played).Didi has a friend no one else can see named Dawn, who looks like she's an acrobat of some kind. What is her story? How did she gain her powers? Is she real or a figment of Didi's imagination? None of this is ever truly explained over the game's short running time (I finished it with all the achievements in a little over 3 hours), but what does happen is Dawn getting involved in the story of Didi and her parents. Her mom is a lounge singer and her father is a shiftless dreamer in debt to the mob. Jonny has one more scheme up his sleeve to get back in Didi's mom's good graces, and Didi will do everything in her power to help make it happen (with Dawn's help, naturally).It's hard not to get excited as you run and jump through Contrast's levels. The music and art design sell the world well, and the voice acting draws you into the struggles of its inhabitants, told enough enough as shadow plays. These are just for story design either; oftentimes you'll have to make use of the shadows you see to reach a switch or a puzzle piece. Collectibles take the form of either documents that reveal the game's backstory or glowing globes also used to power some of the game's puzzles.A lot has been said about the game's controls. I found them as tight as could be expected with the mechanics, with a handheld controller the best way to go. A keyboard and mouse setup could work but the best experience I think would be found with a controller if able.Contrast decides not to overstay its welcome, but I hope that the game devs do come back for an encore performance.

												While I recommend this game for its tremendous style, awesome soundtrack and clever concept, I feel there are two warnings for prospective buyers. First, a skilled player can probably complete it, achievements and all, in about two hours. In this day and age of hundred hour rpgs and unlimited online play, some may feel this affects the value. Secondly, there were times when I really felt that the controls didn't work as they should and I found it very frustrating. I'm not the best at platformers by a long shot, but I feel like their were times I missed jumps and it really wasn't my fault. Overall, I would say this game is like a short art film. It oozes style and tells a sweet, albeit simple story. Wonderful to experience, I think anyone who made it so far as reading this review should pick it up, because the factors that likely drew them to this point are all there and in spades.			"

												It's kind of hard to give an all out recommendation for this game. I love the idea and when the gameplay works, its fantastic. The trouble is that the gameplay is a little buggy still, particularly the mouse controls (maybe it was designed to work better with a controller) and the whole thing feels a bit short with the world shifting and light mechanics a little under utilized for what they could have been. Seeing as the game is pretty cheap and even a bit longer than other clever puzzle games like Portal, if they patched it to run a little less buggy, I could whole heartedly recommend it. What I'd really like to see would be a better funded, or at least better polished sequel. That would be awesome!			"

												You know when you find a game that has fantastic setting and story, but the soundtrack is off? Or the voice actors don't sound like they mesh with the characters? The story is nice and the characters are believable but they just don't fit the setting? Well, this game is a finely crafted work of art. Everything about it just fits. the music, character design, everything aesthetic about this game was chosen by people who clearly not only care about how well the game fits together but independently enjoy every aspect of this game from the art direction to me imaging the game devs just sitting in a coffee shop listening to this style of music while reading a book. It is clear to me that the team responsible for this true gem of a game were not making this because someone higher in the company food chain told them to, the love wouldn't be there, they made this game because they loved and believed in it. Whatever issues I have with the controls are minuscule compared to how enjoyable the game is to experience. My only…I guess complaint is the best word for it, is that the music doesn’t play throughout the game play. I was stuck on a puzzle for about 10 mins before finding a simple answer and all I could think was how little I would care about being stuck if I could just hear some of the wonderful music.  I cannot wait to see what this crew of dreamers puts out next.			"

												One of the best ideas for a puzzle game i've ever seen. It's like portal but with shadows. Definitely an underrated game. If you are on the fence about buying this game, let me help you out. Do you like Portal? If yes, buy it.... Do you like mazes? If yes, buy it... Do you like when there are two worlds in one, where there is our normal 3D world as well as a shadow world at the same time? If yes, the ABSOLUTELY BUY THIS GAME!			"

												A dark noir atmospheric tale set in the 1920s that is reminiscent of the Dark Horse graphic novel ""Misty Circus"" or many other tales of this genre inspired by Neil Gaiman or the ""Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children"" series. Every aspect about the game is wonderfully enchanting, from the sad storyline of a broken family and child neglect, the beautifully rendered graphics, to the melodic soundtrack. This game successfully transports you to and immerses you in a world of wonder.The mechanics are simple, crossing between a 3d world to a 2d platformer by using light and shadows. The puzzles aren't overly challenging, and neither is the platforming, nor is it necessarily a walk in the park. It's challenging enough to make you feel proud of yourself when you quicly come up with a solution, but not so challenging that you ever get frustrated.Many complaints about this game stem from there not being a tutorial, which IMHO would have ruined the allure of exploring a unqiue world. The only other complaints others have voiced is about bugs which must have been fixed because my playthrough was flawless and entirely bug-free. Pesonally, the only complaint I had about the game is that it is too short and left me wanting more! A word of warning: It can get a little dusty if you take the time to examine the collectibles in the game which may threaten your FPS machismo. You may want to keep your handkerchief nearby if you do.			"

The biggest problem with this game is that it's too short!That being said, it is a tad glitchy, and sometimes it's unclear what to do and the jumping is not spot on (annoying when it's the same spot for a full minute.)8.5/10			"

												I must say that i've wanted to play Contrast really badly because of the fluent 3d-2d in game mechanics transitions, and I was not dissapointed. The game has great, quite nicely paced story. The voices and music is gold (altough i wouldn't mind if the jazz tunes played more than in a few places and weren't entirely chained to the story cutscenes) and characters are really nice written. If you want to get the full picture od it, it's good to find all the collectibles because they cast a lot more light on the plot, and actually gives Dawn - a playable character - (even if she's not the main character - that tilte goes to Didi and her family) it's backstory.The graphics aren't stunning but look nice, the other pair of shoes is design of the surrounding world and game shines on that field. Twisted streets going into nothingness allways appealed to me. :)Game, though short, is really enjoyable buuuut... the controls could have been better.If you have some cash to spare for a 4-5 hours of fun, go for it ;)			"

												I might not be able to explain why Contrast is so amazing, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try.Basiclly, the takes place in 1920's France and you take control of Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl named Didi. As of imaginary friends, only Didi can see you. You also find out her dad, Johnny, was kicked out because resulting in him trying ridiculous ideas to get back. Kat, Didi's mother, is a singer in The Ghost Note.Johnny tries go get famous illusionist Vincenzo to perform for him to get money for some gangters, ofcourse, thing's goes wrong, so ""Didi"" (Dawn) fixes everything.I'd rather not spoil anymore, as the story is quite amazing, and needs to experienced for yourself.Oh, did I mention you can shift between the real and shadow dimension?That allows great platforming due to shifting lights.However, I only have two problems with the game:1. The humanoid shadows sometimes have holes and are abit glitchy, but that can be forgiven!2. The platforming sometimes screw abit up, sometimes you fall out of the Shadow World randomly, and falling in 3D is very easy.Might be one of the best games I've ever played, with a great storyline, score and gameplay.10/10			"

												After playing this game - yes, I did enjoy it. Really was challenging getting my head around how to use the shadows some times to enable me to move forward. Which after you've played it a bit, you may come to understand as well! But once you've got your head around the play mechanisms a lot of the puzzles are solveable without transforming a nice sleek head of hair into a patchy bald mess! On top of that the French/Circus/ somewhat Gothic graphic style is very attractive and the music and storyline work very well together to create quite a good game!

												If you plan to buy this, get the collector's edition for the OST. The shadow 2D-3D mechanic is a fun gimmick, however, causes typical platforming rage since sometimes the 3D elements can block you while in shadow form, especially when puzzles get more difficult. Complicated stages = clipping textures = press ""B"" or ""O"" to sprint out if Dawn gets stuck.Overall, the game seems fairly underated. Contrast in summary: beautiful aesthetics, sensual music, and touching storyline.			"

The puzzles are not *too* hard, the gameplay is quite simple, like in Portal, so you can concentrate on how to solve the puzzles (and the plot) rather than which keys to press. And the story is easy to follow, even though it has...very special twists. The style and the set of the game is like nothing I've ever seen (personnally), and I absolutely loved it!

												I enjoyed this game a lot, but I really recommend getting when its on sale.  The story is very interesting and whimisical in its own way, but this is definitely one of those games that could have benefited from a bit more content.  I feel like a lot of content was cut or scrapped before it made it in which is unfortunate because there is a completely different story that it sounds like never made it in.  I beat the game in just over 3 hours, but I did that while still taking the time to poke around in the corners and retrying the more difficult puzzles multiple times (during the shadow puppet show I would intentionally die so the narrator would have to interupt himself and mention how I died, that was probably a good 20 plus minutes right there).  Someone good at platforming could probably clear it in less than 2.  Also, the shadow jumping is not as smooth as the trailers imply, just a heads up.  Several things they imply you can do in game aren't viable moves.  Aside from that?  I would definitely pick this game up for $5.  The story is fun, the game play is interesting, and while short I did enjoy the game.  Most of the other reviews touch on the things I liked and disliked so check them for more details.			"

												The game lives up to the other reviews on the novelty it introduces and it was a pleasure to play as Dawn and merge/transit between both worlds and is a magical beauty to see such world rendered.As a true puzzle game you will find both puzzles in 3D and 2D, and why not: both :)Soundtrack is something quite good out of an indie game, albeit repetitive and small in its reporteur.Story is linear and with not to handle much surprises, perhaps best enjoyed by gathering all collectibles.Only a couple downsides for me:- Game physics engine: it really is a nag sometimes.   Although the transition between 'universes' is crisp, elements in a scene can (and most likely will to you?) render the play frustrating at certain point.- Small game but from an indie production don't expect much. That said, the label price cam be quite hefty whilst I got my copy on Steam Sales and see the price adequate (instead of something nort of £8+).Overall: a good game. Play it if you can, a good experience and great concept.P.S. - Oh, I got the the soundtrack as well. This should really come standard with the game.			"

												short version: fun platformer, really neat concept that needed work, decent story with a little depthlong version: idk what i expected when i picked this up. it looked very different, and it honestly was. the trailers are very misleading in how fast paced the game is. you'll want to take things slow unless ur speedrunning it. i enjoyed myself though, it was sort of challenging but retained something that was just right to keep me going. the whole phasing in and out of the shadows was honestly something i havent seen before and i thought it was very original, but it needed work. it also only really worked when the game wanted it to work. being able to go in and out of the shadows told you there was something to do. normal lights wouldnt actually let you go into walls and such, i thought that would've been a nice extra addition, just being able to phase into walls and not always knowing if i need to get something from there. as for the story, it was nice, i cared about what happened to people, why ____ happened, how important is he, how does the person im playing have powers and stuff. the answers are there, but you just have to look.but yea, decent game, play at ur leisure			"

Not one of the characters is annoying whilst the collectables are pointless but very cute.It's almost an Art Game but lacks the self-congratulatory ♥♥♥♥♥♥isms of something like Limbo, or the sixth-form angst of Dear Ester. It is, in short, a precious shining gem of a game: a small story (in a good way) with no shooting, no hitting, and no rock music. It's also short, easy and glitchy, but worth every forced restart.Most importantly unlike every other game released in the last ten years, no zombies. Hooray!			"

The shadow mechanic that is the main aspect of this game is incredibly well done and the puzzles and platforming are challenging without feeling as though they are impossible.  The plot was thick and gripping enough to keep me interested in the characters I interacted with, but not so overwhelming that it felt like the puzzles were filling in the space between cut scenes.I would absolutely recommend playing this game if you're intersted in puzzle or platforming games.  I would also recommend it if you enjoy playing games that are plot-heavy.			"

												Although a bit over-priced considering it being so short (I didn't stress through the game what-so-ever and still beat it in three hours) I recommend this game, but I would advice picking it up when it's on sale, since three hours for 14 euro is a bit on the expensive side. A beutifully designed game, with an engaging and sad little story about a young girl. Filled with economical issues, romantic affairs, mafia-involvement and drama.  With heavy elements of film noir, and with a graphic style that in many ways resembles a german expressionist silent film, with a touch of Tim Burton-esque quirkiness as the beutiful cherry on top. The humoristic elements such as hidden mature jokes really made me happy and sometimes I even laughed out loud. The puzzles are interesting, all though not that hard if you're used to puzzle-solving in games. But I still feel this game brought something new to the puzzle-genre. The gameplay mechanics are very well scripted and you quickly forget what buttons you have to click and just do it on impulse, immersed in the quirky little world that the game takes place in. Overall I really enjoyed this game, but it's far too short.			"

Overall Appeal - 5/5The premise of the game is fantastic. Being a character that only a child can see but still being able to change the real world is quite fun and amusing. The puzzles are not always straight forward... it's not always as easy as 2D vs 3D... sometimes you have to dig deep.Fun Factor -  4/5Can't really say much without giving it away. It was, at times, incredibly annoying. But no matter how much I hated it at the time I turned it off, I always came back.Replay Value - 1/5Unfortunatly, I believe this is one of the few areas where this game fails. Though the game is awesome, the only replay would be collectables missed in your previous playthrough.Presentation/Graphics - 4/5The game didn't make use of all the mechanics available to it... but that's okay... It wasn't meant to. It's done in a depression era art kind of way and is part of it's appeal. Fluidity of the transition between 2D and 3D was nice. The only complaints I had were that, at one point, an object I needed started floating above me where I couldn't reach it and had to reload and near the end, as I started to fall (to my death, I missed a ledge).... just stopped... couldn't jump, couldn't fall, couldn't move. Other than those two things, marvolous.Storyline - 4/5Don't get me wrong, the story in, and of, itself was absolutly flawless. I loved the backgroud (loved the ending even more). My only complaint is that it was too short. The game could have been a little longer (maybe 5-10 more hours of gameplay).Summary/Overall Score - 3.6 of 5Overall, a solid game. If I am to read the game correctly, I expect another. I do hope that, if true, the sequal will be a little more developed and incoorporate a longer storeyline, more gameplay, and an answer to the question thrown in our faces at the end. I would reccomend this, if only to help the developer to make a new one and continue this intriguing story.			"

												A game that has an imaginary character that is way sexier than what a small child going through the trauma of a broken home should experience. Feel yourself getting the weirdest boner as you watch a sexy character platform and puzzle all through out the broken life of her child creators life.Watch your boner die as you pay attention to a very well told but bleek story. Then watch it rise again as you play as you take control of the sexy imaginary friend again while the story tunes out. Contrast INDEED.Embararassing boner rollercoaster/10			"

												Fun platformer puzzler with a good story and solid mechanics. Reminded me a lot of portal; it's only a few hours long, but it feels like the perfect length for what it is. Quite a few easter eggs for sci-fi fans throughout as well, including one from my favorite Sci-fi film, Dark City.			"

												A delightful short puzzel game with good graphics, great for anyone interested in just gaming. For those interested in playing this game for the story be warned, the game raises more questions than anwered. Nevertheless I recommend playing this game as I find the story of the game to be more interesting than the gameplay.			"

												This game is amazing.It had me from the moment I booted up and felt that sweet jazz tune playing during the loading screen, and kept me with the unique mechanics, engaging story, and incredible atmosphere and graphics. 9/10, would absolutely play the sequel, and I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for stuttery graphics at times. (And now I'm even more excited about 'We Happy Few'.)			"

												Contrast grabbed me right from the get-go with its cover art, and after I saw the trailer, I knew I had to play it.Contrast is not perfect, if I'm being totally honest.  It's kind of short, and sometimes a little rough around the edges when it comes to trying to finesse the tricker bits.  It's also mabye a bit too easy, and platforming pros will blow right through it.However, Contrast has an amazing atmosphere and aesthetic, and good music to boot.  There's a nice story that will keep you moving through the game.  Also, the whole concept, having a 3D character who can merge into shadows for some 2D platforming, is a stroke of genius.  Navigation using this mechanic just delights me every time I use it.  It's seriously that much fun.I played this one to a fairly easy 100% completion a while back, and I'm surprised by how often I get the urge to replay it.  Every time I scroll past it in my library, I think, ""Man, I should play Contrast again soon"".  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.  Even if you don't like it as much as I do, I think you'll agree that it was worth your time.			"

												Recommending this game was a hard decision, and in fact it is by no means worth its regular price. I got the collectors edition for 6€ in a sale, which is still on the upper end of what I think the game should actually cost. You can beat the game in under two hours. If you speedrun a second playthrough it's probably one hour flat. But there is no real replay value. I missed one collectable and I can't picture me hunting that last piece any time soon.I only have 15 hours on this title because I alt-tab'ed out of it and finished it the next day. But it's not a bad game. The story and dialoque are simple yet ok, the visual style is quite nice as is the 3D/2D shift mechanics.It's one of those short indie games you wish it would've had the development time and budget of a AAA title.So grab it the next time it's 75% off, solve a few puzzles with Didi and Dawn ... and dream of what could've been ...

												This is a very charming story-driven platformer with a wonderful little mechanic. It runs very smoothly even on the highest settings and while it's a fairly short game, a lot of work went into it. The voice acting is great, the story is very cute, and the concept is just brilliant. I'd definitely suggest giving the game a try. It's graphically stunning and the art style is so clever.That being said... I do warn against a few frustrating puzzles. Not because the puzzles are particularly challenging, but because sometimes the mechanic can be frustrating. There are times that the controls aren't sensitive enough, or are too sensitive, and there are a few minor glitches that can be annoying. Sometimes the slightly wonky controls can break your enjoyment. But all in all, the game is charming.			"

												Contrast is a puzzle based platform game, developed by Compulsion Games.In this game you follow the story of a small girl Didi Malenkaya who has an imaginary friend called Dawn.No one else can see Dawn, but that does not mean she does not exsist.Didi found herself in a world where she only sees people as shadows.Her parents are having relationship problems and many debts to pay off. They both are too busy to take care of Didi, her mother Kat Malenkaya works as a singer at the Ghost Note cabaret while her father Johnny Fenris has been kicked out of the house because of doing business with gangsters in order to make some money.Child services have threatened to take Didi away from her mother.Didi can't stand this situation anymore and together with Dawn she sneaks out of the house to save the situation between her parents.Contrast is set in a 1920 Nior atmosphere.In this game you play as Dawn who has the ability to shift into the 2D shadow world and back into the 3D world. Throughout the game you have to help Didi solve puzzles that vary from moving objects between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world. Manipulating light sources in the 3D world such as spotlights, film projectors etc. will create shadow paths. These paths will lead Dawn to new areas containing collectibles like Luminaries (light sources) and Documents that reveal more about the story.Contrast felt like a very unique game because the ability of shifting between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world was something I have never seen before in games.Everything I already knew about puzzles games couldn't always match up to the puzzles in Contrast.This will make you think more out of the box, requires a little more creative thinking and raise the bar of puzzles.I must admit that Contrast has a short length of gameplay and the story itself does not have that much depth than I expected it to be.I really recommend Contrast for its unique experience but I don't think it's worth the full price, purchase the game when it's on sale.

												A huge plus is the story isn't overfull with plot twists for rather short gameplay. This game creates its own atmosphere by amazing music and artwork (I'm in love with properly made backgrounds, I've got aesthetic pleasure from running every location, and made thousands of screenshots). But the sharp way models were animated spoils the impression of the process. I've kept noticing bugs during the game (Dawn's arms weren't connected with cubes she carried and I could see through wall textures in Vincenzo's workshop).Still, this game has impressed me. After thousands of boring hours in co-operative Steam games ""Contrast"" with its line plot and simple puzzles is like a breath of fresh air, I've been missing games like this.Thank you for your attention.

												The game maybe buggy and short, but is enjoyable game, especially the soundtracks. The collectable items are way too easy to get the achievements too, if it wasn't the bug.

This game took 3.6 hours to finish and that was only because I would just leave the game going rather than actually pausing or exiting. I wish there was more to the game and hope maybe eventually one day there will be some dlc for it because I would love to see more of the story.

												Good Game, good history, nice atmosphere! But it has drawbacks. The game has some interesting mechanics. You can basically change between your ""3D form"" and the ""shadow form"". The main aspect of the game is to figure out your way through the puzzles with this shadow form to proceed through the history. The gameplay is not the best and I found some ""bugs"" (some ways to complete the puzzle that the developer did not intend, like climbing a vertical wall by getting stuck into it). But the main problem (in my opinion) was the fact that the puzzles aren't difficult (there isn't really any challenge on the puzzles for myself at least). I would like to see what they can do with this interesting mechanic in a bigger game.Is it worth the money they ask for? Well it is a really short game (near 4 hrs for me) but for the atmosphere that this game submerged me, it was worth.			"

												   If you like small but good games this a really good purchase, otherwise if you prefer bigger fully developed games i wouldn't really recommend it. The game itself is awesome, the ideas are amazing and the soundtrack and environment can really blow your mind. But theres a problem in the middle of all the amazing stuff. The game itself is underdeveloped. That makes some really nice characteristics seem bad a lousy and end up ruining your experience.    Overall you can pass the game 100% in less than 4 hours. There are some colectiables but most of the time you dont even need to search for them because they are right in front of you. The devs probably wanted the general environmetn to be bigger but something went wrong and they ended up giving a huge amount of content in a place where it shouldn't exist and only made the entire plot more confusing than it already is. The story is amazing but a lot of details where left untold just because the game lenght wasnt big enough to carry all of them. There are some bugs that shouldve been fixed and sometimes the entire shadow-person mechanic feels a bit cluncky. it would be awesome if you could change not only into a shadow but also to a difrent shadow size. overall the shadow you trnasform into is you in 2D instead of your other stange amazing reallity. Overall its a preatty decent game but that could be improved in various aspects.I would compare my gameplay Story experience of this game with my gameplay experience i had with bioshock infinite. There is however a huge difrence amoung them. Bioshock is fully developed and is almost bug free. It has an awesome replayability, an awesome story, awesome mechanics and the colectiables are hard to find and pretty damn awesome to get entirely. Contrats on the other hand is poorly developed, has a lot of bugs, almost no replayability since you cant change the way you play to make the story a difrent experience, super shor game length, the story is awesome and really good but lacks detail in many ways, the mechanics are awesome but you end up barely having to use them and the colectiables end up giving you a worse experience overall.I really realy want to tell the world about this game because its really awesome. I would pay 50 bucks for it if i needed to. But this game is not finished. I would say thats in its current state the game is 70% away from behing the best game ever made. And im talking about 70% off wich 10%would be bug fixes, 20% increasing the scenario availible to explore, 10% actually making the colectiables hard to find and woth finding, 10%making more puzzles and 20% increasing the story told to the player soo it can actually mean something more. TLDR. This game has the capability to have a 90+ rating however lacks some development that reallly ruins some important gameplay details. I consider it a must play tho just for the overall experience.			"

												Excellent game! Gameplay mixes shadowrunning (though not Shadowrun-esque) with parkour of a sort, and in some puzzles, it turns positively Rube Goldberg in style.

												I was caught between upvoting and downvoting this game... The game, overall is great, the puzzles were so clever, the atmosphere and audio perfect... But the problem was in the technical side of the game. The platforming during puzzles were so annoying and the controls just don't feel right.. Doesn't matter if you're using a keyboard or a controller, the way your character controls in and out of shadows to solve puzzles is not smooth or how you would expect it to work. This issue alone made me hate the game at some parts, because it had a little too many annoying sequences. But once i completed the game with grinded teeth, I realized, it's worth it... Pick it up during sale... It's more of a game you'll remember for many years and admire it's brilliance, but just something that may temporarily annoy you while actually playing it.			"

Whilst the game is very short its a lot of fun and a real gem from an indie gaming studio, Compulsion Studios proves they are a company worth supporting. Contrast also offers a great soundtack that fits perfectly in the enchanted 20's france, I'd love to see more games in this world being a big Jazz fan this game gave me a musical pleasure that I havn't found in a game sense.Would reccoment to anyone who belives games don't need to sacragice gameplay in order to create a piece of great art, and I can't wait to delve into the world of We Happy Few.

												Got this on sale and finally play through it.Is this a good game?Well if I could, I would give it a netrualBut if you can get it on a sale, go for it. It will properly take you 2-4 hours to complete it.The Good: 1) The mix with shadows are a fun and enjoyable2) The artstyle is interesting and for me appealing3) The puzzles are aren't hard or to easy - most will see the solution without to much hassle.4) The english voice acting is pretty goodThe Neutral:1) The story is cute, but the ending is a bit disappointingThe Annoying: 1) Controls, controls and the bloody controls. This pulls the game down, for me. Almost to the point where I don't want to recommend it. The character seems floaty and often slide of things she should be able to stand on. Or falls through objects or out of shadows for no apparent reason. It makes the game more difficult than it has any right to. And interacting with objects, is camera based - oh the camera.2) The camera, isn't there to help you. It's doesn't follow your movement and often so close navigating is a pain. And best of all, when you want to interact with objects - the camera is the deciding factor which object is chosen. Example: Lets say there are 2 objects, the character is standing facing object A the camera is slitghly turned to object B - Object B is the object that will be used. I have spend just as much time playing camera man as controlling my character through the puzzles.But in the end, it was a neat 3 hours in the company of Contrast.Hope this helps you, in your quest for good games and sorry for any spelling mistakes :)			"

												Just finished Contrast and overall the game is really great, but there is always the 'but' word, but it has some bugs and that's really annoying, it's like Bioshock: Infinite and Limbo had a kid and his friend was Mr. Bug. I really enjoyed the puzzles and the gameplay but the atmosphere... it was kind of empty with all the shadow stuff. The game is really short that's a pitty. The idea of the game is awesome, mix the 3D and the 2D world+puzzles and that you can instantly go to the shadow world that was amazing, that's why I give this game 8/10 "

												This game is truly unique, and absolutely stunning, both visually and story-wise, but WAY too short for full price.  I wandered quite a lot, have an incredible knack for getting lost, suck at platformers*, and got most of the collectibles all in 5 hours.  I was completely thrown by the ending, not because of how it ended, but because it ended so abruptly.  I feel like it was only about half finished when they realized they had a deadline so instead of compromising on ANY aspect of gameplay, they decided to leave the ending as a Sopranos-esque sharp cutoff.  I can respect that a hell of a lot more than rushing through and releasing a clunky mess of a game full of bugs. *During the play, a shameful number of times - "".... unfortunately, she impaled herself on the bamboo.  Wait, no, that's not what happened!""8/10 ADORED the game, but wish there was more of it. Immediate purchase when on sale, though!			"

												This game is terrific, the only bad thing i can say about it, is that its too short. The entire game will take you maybe 3-4 hours to complete.... and thats if your taking your time. Its honstly really unfortunate, with a longer campaign this game would get an easy 5 out of 5 stars. Beautiful graphics and art style, tight controls, smooth transitions, a gripping story, and best of all, puzzles that arnt so simple that you can figure them out super easily, some actually require a fair bit of thinking. I have found that some puzzles can be solved in different ways, so im not sure if that was intentional, but i hope it was. It shows that the creators want you to be open minded and think outside the box. I absolutely love this game but the best i can give it (due to such a short play time, and not much replay value) i give it a 4.5 out 5.			"

I found the story to be rather compelling and yet simple with a somewhat unexpected ending. The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it is a ""tad"" glitchey and the environment is rather empty.

												Short, simple, and charming little story with a neat noir setting. Ultimately plagued by a few bugs and a mechanic that could've been expanded upon A LOT more. It had much more potential.  The soundtrack is good, albeit it's only one or two songs, but those songs are really cool with a Parisian songbook era type of vibe.

Great concept, great visuals... but is it worth its price?Contrast is a fun single player Platformer with the great concept of switching between 3D and 2D. At one moment you wander around in the colourful yet desaturated noir style world, when you have to plunge into the nearest wall to let your shadow finish a certain puzzle. For me, the visuals, and the way certain parts of the game are changing throughout the level was pretty cool.While providing 2-3 hours of gameplay (depending on how skilled you are as well as how much time you spend exploring), Contrast tells the story of the girl Didi Malenkaya. In the 3 acts provided, the player gets to play as Dawn - Didis imaginary friend - and learns a bit about their past as well as discovers new details about Didi and her family's past. While not being the most complex of stories ever told, it's still an interesting tale that gets completed by gethering collectibles throughout the levels.The puzzle and platforming elements themself are pretty well executed but sometimes lack of difficulty. I do know, that Contrast was not intended to be an overly difficult game, yet some parts seemed just too easy, while some had the perfect mixture of difficulty in figuring out what to do and actually doing so. Sadly, like in many other games, there were one or two plain frustrating parts in the game, when the objective was figured out quickly, but the execution took a lot of time because of ""bad"" level design or more often bugs.As just mentioned, bugs were one of the only negative aspects of the game. While (most of them) most of them were not game breaking, they were pretty constitant throughout the game. By that I mean, wierd clipping through walls (that can be performed on purpose to get some stuff earlier), gettig shot out of the wall when being in 2D or getting stuck in places you shouldnot reach. For me, especially the Pirate Cove part was a bit of an issue as I got stuck in some of the ships placed throughout the level several time withozut being able to get out again. Because of this I had to repeat the level three times, as Checkpoints are sometimes set a bit weirdly.While being a bit short and having some minor flaws that could be fixed ""easily"", 10$ might seem a bit pricy, but in my opinion, when bought on sale, Contrast is a great gaming experience, if not for just it's Shadow Puppet part and general visuals alone.  7/10 "

												Contrast is a very nice little platformer with a really interesting game mechanic; in well lit areas you can turn yourself into a 2d shadow and platform with the shadows on the walls to solve puzzles. This mechanic allows Contrast to give players both a 3d and 2d world to solve puzzles. Great voice acting and good, period appropriate music draw you into a well written story about a little girl and her (imaginary?) friend, as they navigate through the lives of her and her parents. And wonderful animations and artwork help craft this world into a very interesting environment for the player to solve the puzzles that are put into the characters paths.That's not to say the game is perfect. It isn't. There are some camera issues here and there, not enough to ruin the game but it can pull you out of the story every now and then. Also, if you only play on a keyboard then you may well hate the control scheme. The controls were picture perfect on my Steam Controller but oddly delayed on my keyboard and sometimes locking out certain commands until I reloaded. Stick with a controller. And once it was all complete I really found no reason to go back.Anyway, for a 3-4 hour game experience Contrast is well worth checking out, but you might want to wait for a sale. Pros:Beautifully animatedWell WrittenGreat controller supportinnovative level design and game mechanicsNice soundtrack and localesExcellent voice actingCons:Very shortBad keyboard supportNot much replay value "

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Contrast is a game developed by Compulsion Games, the same people behind We Happy Few. Contrast was Compulsion Games' first game before the development of We Happy Few and the game was published by Focus Home Interactive. Contrast takes place in a Caberat setting where a young girl Didi and her friend Dawn (who you play) set out on an adventure to save Didi's father from losing out more debt on a circus he wants to buildIt seems as if Dawn is an imaginary character and only Didi can see her, Dawn also has the ability to blend in with the shadows, this is the main gameplay concept. You, as the player, have the ability to blend in with the shadows and interact with objects and go up to higher levelsThrough this you solve puzzles and progress through the story. Although this game is in 3D, a heavy amount of the game is puzzle platforming. The platforming in Contrast is the weakest bit, some of the platforming bits in the game were frustrating and outright annoyingAnother issues with Contrast is Dawn's jumping ability, its too weak and so feeble that you have to place Dawn in the exact point that the game wants you to do it, if not, you will die countless timesThe story is good although the game is extremely short (finished the main story in two hours and in one whole sitting) and I was expecting the game to be longer, however, with the annoying puzzle platforming bits and the horendous jumping ability, I was happy that the game ended quicklyThe voice acting is really good. The game camera and animation is the poorest aspect of the game (including the puzzle platforming segments and Dawn's jumping ability) and you could tell that this was Compulsion Games' first game as the animations and camera work greatly improved in their second game, We Happy FewHowever, Contrast is a nice little short puzzle platformer game which although it has a few annoying segments here and there, it is a nice game to play in one whole sitting RECOMMENDED :)  "

By the end, I found myself thinking it was such an odd place to leave off at and I would have loved to have more gameplay.Still, though, I truly enjoyed the game. It's attractive and interesting.

												I don't like it. The art is very good, but the mechanics are frustraing and make no sense half the time. The soundtrack has 2-3 songs and tons of simple, repetitive music that really doesn't help. You can also get stuck and when you get back to the last point you lose all the progress, and not just go back to the beginninng of the puzzle you got stuck in.PS:The physics annoied me a lot - one moment you can walk on thin air, the next you can go though object, somtimes you get knocked down after encountering something, sometimes you don't'. I caused the carousel on the second act to consistedly get stuck just by standing there. I really tried playing it, but I just get frustrated over it.			"

I like the concept although I found the gameplay to be frustrating at times. but perhaps that's just good for a puzzle solving game as this. Would love for the developers for the game to make a similar one, perhaps set in one of the other parallel universes with different rules and with a more in-depth gameplay since this game felt more like a walking simulator than anything.

												+++ Unique and compelling gameplay concept.+++ Tight storytelling.+++ Trippy art direction.--- Late stages marred by glitchy platforming.--- Very short!Contrast excels by keeping things simple and tight: a story with few characters, a small world that's packed with everything it needs, and well thought-out gameplay mechanics - although some of the puzzles will have a tendency to glitch out against the player, requiring several adjustments and restarts.17 CDN is quite steep for a game that can be blown through in less than three hours, but it's definitely worth a shot while on sale.  It's a proof of concept that has potential to live as a full-fledged, longer sequel.			"

												Great puzzle game that really gets you thinking on how to solve it. This game is a nice brain teaser tha will give you a few hours of fun and a a little extra if you collect everything. Not only is the gameplay fun, but it has a very nice story throughout and it is very psychological which is also a bonus. Pick this game up if you can, you won't regret it!			"

 Save the circus, or jump to your death multiple times trying...  ...But it's not just Kat and Johnny's relationship that needs saving, you also get to repair a funfair ! 	Contrast is a fairly short game, which has its charming moments. It's atmospheric and witty but also has a very significant rage potential.	Biggest problems I've had : lack of checkpoints, and the controls are wonky. No, I mean really wonky. If Didi has to rely on an imaginary friend who can't jump onto a box right in front of her, or keeps dashing off the edge of the world and plummeting to her death, that kid had probably better join the circus... but we all know where that got her father...	The plot starts out fine, but the end feels rushed. Was personally expecting a bit more Didi, since she's meant to be the main character. However, I felt like the kid gets left out, both by her family and the game, replaced with quite a bit of fragile masculinity (see Johnny or Fred the Knight), and marriage issues (also Johnny).        On the whole, would recommend Contrast as it's very atmospheric and I loved the concept, but if you're unsure, I suggest waiting until it's on sale. ( + ) Positives  :+ visually pleasing+ great soundtrack+ amazing concept, mixing 2D and 3D+ fun puzzles (others not so much... trial and (t)error) ( - ) Negatives  :- A carousel of broken controls- Tragic lack of checkpoints making the game very much like Kat and Johnny's relationship : very difficult to save.- Game involves explicit language... on my part (mostly because of the previously mentioned points).- Broken fingers (see previous points)- … gurshdarn Fred the Knight			"

												Contrast has a lovely soundtrack and great art. The mechanic of 2d to 3d is a lot of fun and the platforming is relatively challenging. The environments are interesting and fun to explore. The characters are... so so. The story and characters were pretty mediocre, for me. The game isn't very long, so it's not like it was painful to sit through. It's worth a play and it has a lot of potential, but I think it could have done with a better ending and less annoying characters.			"

												Contrast is a challenging puzzle game that has you leaping back and forth between corporeal and shadow form to help a little girl fix things for her father. The game has a film noir feel, set to a lovely jazz soundtrack. You have to play with light and shadows to solve a lot of the puzzles. Contrast provides a truly unique experience. I enjoyed it all; from the background story, to the music and ambience, to the challenge of figuring out the puzzles. I highly recommend it.			"

												Pros: the art, music, and story. I'm actually a little bummed at how short the game was. I felt like they really only scratched the surface with the puzzles that they could pull off with the 2D/3D mechanics.Cons: The mechanics of the 2D/3D transition was a little choppy and I found the controls to be a little non-intuitive (which is really only a problem because you can't customize them (i.e. inverting axis or turning down mouse sensitivity)). Overall, a short but definitely worthwhile ride (if on sale).			"

												Can't say I like it. It's got that typical, clunky Indie game un-refinedness to it (very simple animations, sketchy collision detection, ...). You can clearly tell it was built on an austerity budget. I kind of rage quitted when I fell down a somewhat tedious jumping puzzle that has multiple, button activated stages, which I'd have to do all over. Bleh...Running around the level is rather eerie and dull, with no environmental sound or music. Not how I imagined it to be. After all, it's a neat core idea (the 2D/3D mix), wrapped in an otherwise poorly executed game, unfortunately.			"

												+ Beautiful art design and soundtrack.+ Gameplay is unique+ Puzzles are challenging, but not unsolvable. No one should need a guide to finish this.+ Story is fascinating, occasionally suprisingly dark (Try taking a bit too long to solve some of the puzzles).- Game is too short. It took me only 3 hours to complete, getting all collectibles/achievements along the way.- Story is not substantial enough. A lot is hidden in the collectibles, but there still isn't enough to completely flesh out the universe. - Controls can be buggy. Occasionally you flicker in and out of the shadows while trying to manoeuver in the shadows.I'd recommend this game for the soundtrack alone. An entertaining game, though could have been a bit longer.			"

												A very satisfying experience. I absolutely LOVE the art!! The scenery by itself is fantastic and the music really made the play through enjoyable. The storyline drew me in and the characters were quirky in their own ways. There are so many great things about this game I don't want to give anything away!It's a very casual play through, not too long but not to short either. Honestly I wouldn't mind playing more. If you enjoy puzzles and platformers, I'd check it out. The puzzles were very fresh with a range of difficulty. The concept of stepping into the shadows gives each puzzle a new look. Very imaginative creations. On the other hand, a few puzzles were a bit frustrating because of the picky mechanics and I found myself forgetting simple things like how to climb because I was busy with shadow walking. Overall it was worth the buy.			"

Also it is short but this is not really a bad thing though I would have liked more puzzles and more story elements. Perfect game for a relaxing weekend.			"

The soundtrack has 2-3 songs and tons of simple, repetitive music that really doesn't help. You can also get stuck and when you get back to the last point you lose all the progress, and not just go back to the beginninng of the puzzle you got stuck in.PS:The physics annoied me a lot - one moment you can walk on thin air, the next you can go though object, somtimes you get knocked down after encountering something, sometimes you don't'. I caused the carousel on the second act to consistedly get stuck just by standing there. I really tried playing it, but I just get frustrated over it.			"

												A very nice, short puzzle-platformer. Graphics and animations, even when maxed, leave a little to be desired, the aesthetic of this game is great with an amazing soundtrack. Wish there had been more gameplay for the price, but it wasn't too bad considering I got this on sale, 100%ed the game in about an hour, but if you miss a few collection acheievements on your first playthrough it might take you considerably longer. The plot is fairly directed, but not so much as to feel as if you're stuck on rails, and both the characters and world are fairly interesting. Exploration of the world is rewarded with plenty of collectibles that give you a clearer picture of the story. Sounds corny, but it made me look at the shadows of the world more closely for a few days afterwards.			"

												This game has an interesting plot and game play which makes me want to recommend it. However I also found the game play a little frustrating because I felt it was more about right timing than actual puzzles, which sometimes made it frustrating because in the frantic attempt to get things right I would accidentally click the mouse (to be shadow or not) or hit the keyboard in the wrong direction. At one point I was screaming in rage because I just couldn't get the timing right, and scared my boyfriend who's never seen me angry before. I felt that the ending left more questions than answers, but it was a nice story on a topic rarely covered by games: parenthood and childhood.			"

												Contrast is a very nice little platformer with a really interesting game mechanic; in well lit areas you can turn yourself into a 2d shadow and platform with the shadows on the walls to solve puzzles. This mechanic allows Contrast to give players both a 3d and 2d world to solve puzzles. Great voice acting and good, period appropriate music draw you into a well written story about a little girl and her (imaginary?) friend, as they navigate through the lives of her and her parents. And wonderful animations and artwork help craft this world into a very interesting environment for the player to solve the puzzles that are put into the characters paths.That's not to say the game is perfect. It isn't. There are some camera issues here and there, not enough to ruin the game but it can pull you out of the story every now and then. Also, if you only play on a keyboard then you may well hate the control scheme. The controls were picture perfect on my Steam Controller but oddly delayed on my keyboard and sometimes locking out certain commands until I reloaded. Stick with a controller. And once it was all complete I really found no reason to go back.Anyway, for a 3-4 hour game experience Contrast is well worth checking out, but you might want to wait for a sale. Pros:Beautifully animatedWell WrittenGreat controller supportinnovative level design and game mechanicsNice soundtrack and localesExcellent voice actingCons:Very shortBad keyboard supportNot much replay value "

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Contrast is a game developed by Compulsion Games, the same people behind We Happy Few. Contrast was Compulsion Games' first game before the development of We Happy Few and the game was published by Focus Home Interactive. Contrast takes place in a Caberat setting where a young girl Didi and her friend Dawn (who you play) set out on an adventure to save Didi's father from losing out more debt on a circus he wants to buildIt seems as if Dawn is an imaginary character and only Didi can see her, Dawn also has the ability to blend in with the shadows, this is the main gameplay concept. You, as the player, have the ability to blend in with the shadows and interact with objects and go up to higher levelsThrough this you solve puzzles and progress through the story. Although this game is in 3D, a heavy amount of the game is puzzle platforming. The platforming in Contrast is the weakest bit, some of the platforming bits in the game were frustrating and outright annoyingAnother issues with Contrast is Dawn's jumping ability, its too weak and so feeble that you have to place Dawn in the exact point that the game wants you to do it, if not, you will die countless timesThe story is good although the game is extremely short (finished the main story in two hours and in one whole sitting) and I was expecting the game to be longer, however, with the annoying puzzle platforming bits and the horendous jumping ability, I was happy that the game ended quicklyThe voice acting is really good. The game camera and animation is the poorest aspect of the game (including the puzzle platforming segments and Dawn's jumping ability) and you could tell that this was Compulsion Games' first game as the animations and camera work greatly improved in their second game, We Happy FewHowever, Contrast is a nice little short puzzle platformer game which although it has a few annoying segments here and there, it is a nice game to play in one whole sitting RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I only got this game based off of a short trailer featuring the unique gameplay aspects of this game, and I must say everything else about it, to my delight, took me by surprise. The French 1920's noir setting with mystery and hints to the lasting effects of the World's Fair really make this a world of its own. Along with very unique story telling that show things as you might imagine through the eyes of a child, and how all of the other adults are shown only in shadow, you can easily begin to feel the world live on it's own. The game can be seen as short, but in my personal opinion the length is perfect. They tell the story they wanted to tell, it isn't drawn out, and it doesn't overly complicate things.While the gameplay itself feels a bit like the bracelt mechanic in LoZ: A Link Between Worlds, the platforming and world manipulation aspects really put this in its own category. It works off the Unreal engine, which is known for having issues with lower budget productions. Surprisingly Contrast doesn't show many signs of that. There are a few times where walls that aren't completely flat can throw you out of shadow, and if you get one interactable object too close to another you can't choose between which one you wish to interact with, but aside from that I didn't experience many other issues.All in all, if you are looking for something simple and sweet, I highly suggest you try this out. If you already have it, get on it.			"

												What can I say about this game, if you enjoy a Noir art style that looks stunning, and music that is unique compared to other games you may play. I can happily say this is the game for you. From the start I was impressed with this game, firstly not matter what graphic setting you choose the details remain the same, the only difference is the lighting (the higher the setting the more “noir” the game becomes. Even playing in the lowest settings this game becomes a joy to play with its amazing soundtrack that you should buy with the game and upload to your music device soon as you can. No joke I’ve been playing the soundtrack on my morning run for the last week or two.The voice acting is clear and easy to understand, nether unsure of where you need to go. If you do go the wrong way more often than not you will encounter a closed gate or Didi will force a cutscene asking where you are going. The only downside I would mention is that the game does take some learning when jumping between the 2D puzzles and 3d World, this may vary from person to person, those used to shooters and FPS games might experience more of a learning curve than those who prefer Indie and puzzle games. Not helped that you can jump into and shadow you find, this would be a major bonus if they added more secret areas or goals to complete, but for my playthroughs it caused me to stop and figure out if this was the right direction i needed to go.The world itself takes a 1920’s theme, then thrown together with a dreamworld to add a surrealist element to the environment, this catches you by surprise as you only begin to see this style more half way through the first section of the game. Unfortunately there are some flaws to the game, it is a basic platform and does come with some collision issues (tied in with the shadow 2d world you can avoid some segments all together) and it is relatively short, yet despite all the flaws of this game i would play and play again just for screenshot purposes and the music.If you wanted a different game to play for a evenings entertainment I would recommend this in a heartbeat.

												On the whole I really enjoyed Contrast, but the story, although interesting, gets in the way of the gameplay a little too much. Also, I only really started to feel like I was playing the 'proper' game about halfway through, as the first half felt like one very long tutorial. This left the game as a whole feeling too short, as I was only really getting into it shortly before it ended. I really hope they do a sequel and try and concentrate on the gameplay a bit more now that they've sorted the mechanics out.I'd definitely recommend it, but it requires quite a bit of patience!			"

												An amazingly beautiful and relaxing puzzlegame. The puzzles in this game are fairly simple to figure out, I only found myself being stuck once as I had missed a pretty important mechanic. However, the big drive of this game is the beautiful and weird shadow-world with a french twist. The music in the game is calming, and everything just feels right!This game is perfect for when you are tired, and just want to watch a movie, or listen to some relaxing music. This game has it all!It has a few collectable items and eastereggs, but it doesn't get overwhelming by having 1231512 different items for you to find in each stage. All of the collectibles provide you with different insights to the story, but at the same time, you don't need any of them to understand what's going on.Sadly I found the game to be a bit short, but it is a very good game difficultywise and imagewise for people of all ages.Highly recommended for a friday afternoon with the kids!

												Everything but the gameplay is great only problem is that the gameplay is terrible. The controlls are what kills it they just dont work the way they should and combine that with timed jumps and you get lots of annoying deaths.			"

												overall enjoyed it.  had some flaws but still gets a thumbs-up   + fun little game, nice atmosphere and music   + shadow puzzles were fun   + a little short, but for $8, about worth it   - save points are MUCH too far apart.  I would regularly lose lots of progress because of this.   - some jumping puzzles were horribly twitchy and frustrating "

												A unique game with stunning art concepts and imagery throughout. You learn two stories as they unravel and solve complex puzzles and are able to manipulate items in the world as well as the shadowy background pieces to create a unique platform-style view. It brings things - objects, people, and ideas - to the foreground and you interact in ways you hadn't considered. It definitely takes time to see the shadows as solid leges and tangible objects, but it was surprisingly easy to use the controls. I was enthralled! The shadows tell a story of their own!! I sped through this game and wish that there were more like it!!			"
