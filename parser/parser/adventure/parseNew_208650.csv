												*sigh* where to start. It's 2015, why is a game of this caliber is being locked at 30fps? While the frame rate cap is editable, you have to go into the config to do it instead of the main menu. But that doesn't matter, the game is terribly optimized. Whether it's capped at 30 or 60fps, you'll get major framerate drops. A single GTX 970 isn't even enough to keep it at a stable 30fps, which is completely ludicrous. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of releasing a game like this.What makes it worse is that, at the very last hour, they edited the Steam sub for the people that got the free Nvidia copy for buying a GTX 970 or 980 so that they wouldn't get the Harley Quinn pre-order bonus. Why do that? You already give away a free game, why take away a little pre-order bonus that everyone else who pre-ordered would get?It just ends up making a lot of people angry. For months now people have been asking whether or not the people who got the Nvidia free copy would be getting the Harley Quinn pack. They were completely unclear on it, just beating around the bush.This is no way to treat your fans.At this point, this game isn't worth buying because of technical issues and such a terrible practice by it's publisher. Even people who got this game for free must feel like they got betrayed right now.Save your money, wait for updates and play something else in the mean time. I recommend the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a game that is much more optimized for PC, developed by a group of people who actually care about their fans.Update 1: No patch yet, but after some tinkering in the config file. I've gotten the game to run at a somewhat more stable frame rate. If I stand still or move slowly I can maintain a stable 60fps, but as soon as I hop into the Batmobile or start gliding around, frame rate will start dropping anywhere from 50's down to the low 20's. The worst part is every now and then the frame rate would tank so hard it would go down to single digit, like several other people have noticed. So I guess for right now, maintaining a stable 60fps or even 30fps is impossible unless you want to play Batman: Walking Simulator.Update 2: I got a chance to play the game a little bit, so this post will be about the gameplay. The combat and control are great and responsive, You never felt quite more like Batman than you are in this game. You feel powerful. The entire Gotham City is your playground and it feels amazing to traverse it. The only problem I have with the gameplay is that driving the Batmobile in ""Pursuit Mode"" felt pretty bad. It was hard to turn around corners without smashing into something, combining with the terrible frame rate and let just say I rather just glide across Gotham City than drive the Batmobile. I really hope they tweak the control for the Batmobile, it's my least favorite thing about the game right now. ""Battle Mode"" however is great, only because it's alot easier to maneuver around with it on.			"

												Updated 10/29 for the PC re-release that happened on 10/28:Many of the worst issues in the original release of this game have been resolved, but if it came out as-is today I would still say the port is pretty disappointing. Many people who couldn't play the game at all before can get a playable framerate now, but even on a very high end system the frame pacing is very poor and results in a stuttery experience. The texture loading issues that plagued the game on release are gone, but you still see shockingly low resolution textures during almost any cut scene.Image quality is all over the board, but is improved quite a bit by turning off AA, CA, and film grain effects. Speaking of effects, there seems to be a bug that scales the intensity of post-processing effects with the screen resolution the game renders at. The most obviously visible occurance of this bug is when lens flares are rendered. In 1080p, lens flares look more or less as they should. At 1440p you'd think Batman just had LASIK surgery because looking at a street light produces a double or triple lens flare corona that makes it very difficult to see what is going on. Considering the whole game takes place at night and there are more lens flares than a JJ Abrams movie this bug can get pretty irritating.If you're a huge batman fan and you've been waiting to play this game, I'd say it is definitely playable now. If you're on the fence and were waiting to see whether they had turned a legendarily bad release into a good one for rerelease, I'd say wait until it is heavily discounted.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review of initial release version:One of the worst PC ports of all time.This game had some incredibly misleading advertising. In the Nvidia gamework promo reel, posted to youtube by Nvidia on June 6 (only a few weeks before the game was released), they show ambient occlusion and rain textures - both of which are present in the console versions, and entirely absent from the PC version. The same gameworks promo trailer is also a full 60fps, but the game ships with a 30fps cap. By editing an .ini file you can remove the 30fps cap, but many have reported that causes other graphical issues such as textures only loading the very lowest detail level (they look pretty similar to the textures from a Nintendo 64 game).Aside from the false advertising, this game can't even maintain a consistent framerate on hardware that FAR exceeds the recommended specifications. For example, despite having the game installed on an SSD, and running a 980ti with the latest drivers, I still get dips into single digit framerates in many situations. For example, any time I get in the batmobile, I am watching a slide show for a few seconds.Save your money and wait to buy this game until it is fixed (if it ever does get fixed).			"

												Edit 30/10/2015  People are still commenting on this review so I'm making this edit to let people know this wasn't updated to reflect current patches in the game.  I returned the product shortly after it was released.  There has since been two performance patches which reportedly improve things.  I decided not to purchase it again as it's so close to November when other games launch and my time is limited ATM.*** If your interested in purchasing the game look for more current reviews. ***---Played it for around an hour so far.The combat is fun and responsive, the gliding is great and the game looks okay (AF is set to 4 by default which makes some textures look awful).  That's the good parts.The bad parts are the framerate issues which are all over the place and the batmobile.  The game will frequently pause or dip to sub 10 fps on a gtx 970 when entering or approaching new areas.  Cutscenes have similar issues to witcher 3 in that while in engine they run at even less fps (by default the game itself is locked to 30, tweakable in the ini files) than the normal game making them stutter or appear stilted.Summoning the batmobile causes major frame rate drops.  At one point I summoned the car to try the batmobile takedown move.  By the time the frame rate recovered the batmobile had crushed the pack of guys I was fighting including the Riddler henchman I wanted to interrogate.The batmobile itself handles awfully.  There are forced batmobile sections which involve chasing targets such as tanks or vehicles.  The handling makes some turns difficult to pull off and the vehicle feels clunky.  Some have recommended turning into a tank for a small amount of time for more precise control but this kills all momentum.  Tank mode is really boring but necessary to take out armored vehicles.  If you eject while under attack from armored vehicles batman will get upset someone is wrecking his car.  There doesn't appear to be a way (yet) to deal with vehicles without the batmobile which ruins the feel of the prior batman games.  Hopefully the need for the batmobile is limited later in the game.Unless this is patched soon it's definitely a refund.  I bought the game based on the prior Rocksteady Batman titles which played well on launch but this is a terrible PC port.  Never really expected the game to turn out this way but I guess alarm bells should have triggered when there was no PC review prior to launch.Edit: For those commenting my PC is below min specs. It's notWin 7SP1i5 3570k8gigs ramSSD 970 GTXIf you want to see what the gameplay was like for me see this video by RPS.  It was less frequent than in the video but it's the exact same symtoms.

												POST PATCH UPDATEMy did this take a while, well the game has now had a major patch and things are...better. The game is still by default held at 30fps but now an option in the menu has been added that lets you choose between 30/60/90 fps although they do say if you put it above 60 you may experience some issues with the performance. In my experience the game runs much better than before I get a solid 60fps on maximum settings (not including NVIDIA crap) during fighting/walking/gliding/grappling with almost no hitching, however I must say while driving the batmobile you can get 60 around the outskirts of Gotham but in the center where its busy and there are more npc's and other cars it does drop to around 50fps quite frequently. While this is not great it is certainly better than the 20fps it used to be when driving the batmobile. The options menu has had loads of changes more suitable to PC with texture settings actually having an option for ""High"" this time rather than just medium which brings me to the games graphics. The game looks marginally better although not really in any significantly noticeable way. While batman games always had that shiny polished look to all its textures, I find that the moody lighting and glossy textures tend to hide the fact that some of the textures just aren't that great meaning walls, backgrounds and such; but they are good where it matters I suppose such as the batsuit, batmobile and generally all character models.So should you buy it? Sigh this is a rather hard question but let me try to expand. I feel like this game is in a playable state, not perfect...but playable. However, I urge everyone not to forget the disaster that was this games launch. In my opinion such a terrible launch and treatment of the PC community requires that we show WB and Rocksteady that this is not ok by voting with our wallets and not buying this game. By doing so, showing them that this is unacceptable and if this is the state in which you release your games and it takes you like what 3-4 months to fix this then you don't deserve our money and support. So if you don't have any strong reason to buy this game then please don't. There are better games out there that you can still buy, if however you are intent on buying this game then at least wait for a sale because working or no this game is not worth its standard price. Take note of this games launch and please don't preorder and keep an especially keen eye on WB games since its clear whatever they may be publish to PC will likely crash and burn since they don't give a damn about PC and PC should not give a damn about them.                                                           ORIGNAL REVIEW- Performance issues everywhere.- Had to use ini files to uncap the default 30fps lock.- I have drops to around 23fps on a rig that supersedes the recommended system requirements.- Do you have an AMD graphics card? lol good luck m8It's a shame because there is a good game somewhere in here but the performance issues make it unplayable, I strongly advise against buying this until it is patched and begins to work properly. As it stands right now DO NOT BUY IT			"

												""Gameplay"" video - real fun starts at min 6.

			►At 6min mark is where the fun begins :). Edit as of July 15th: ►A minimum of 25% of the ad revenue generated each month by my videos will be donated to a charity and to help those in need.		

Note: This review is a work in progress, as a PC gamer my first couple of  hours of any game is playtesting and seeing the performance on my rig.  I am using a 970 on stock settings and 3570k overclocked to 4.5ghz with 8 gigs of ram, just for a frame of reference. Game also uses Denuvo DRM which has been reported in previous games that used this such as Dragon Age or Lord of the Fallen to have performance problems associated because of the processes behind the DRM. It is my hope that this title doesn't see any performance impacts because of the DRM implementation, but sadly I think it is...once again. Seriously, do we need ANOTHER layer of DRM on top of the already existing DRM (Steam?) Ugh.PC PORT IS LOCKED TO 30 FPS BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THAT. ""TURTLEBOATS YOU DONT NEED TO SHOUT MAN, NOW YOU ARE MAKING ME SHOUT!""-To change the ini files go wherever your game is saved and go to: Knight\BmGame\ Config\BmSystemSettings.ini and change the parameter for ""MaxFPS=30"" to ""MaxFPS=60""-To delete the intro video files go to Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\BMGame\Movies and delete StartupMovie and StartupMovieNV.Graphics Impressions: The game is really hit or miss at times and while the game can look good, some textures arent as crisp and tight as you would hoped it would be.  At a distance the graphics  look servicable, but once you get close to even some of the thugs, they look like reused assets from the previous games.  The graphics settings in this port are honestly bare bones (you cant even tweak how high you want aliasing to be set at!) The game looks a bit outdated in areas but that should not come as a surprise since the game is using the same engines as the previous Arkham games, so while they have probably maxed out what that engine can do, it does not have all the bells and whistles you would like to hope for in a next gen title. It looks as though without the nvidia settings, the max settings on this pc port is on par with its console brother.  There are a limited number of specific Nvidia exclusive graphics tweaks that seperate it from the console version, so in that sense it is dissapointing.To me the best way I can describe how the game looks is: washed out. The textures aren't crisp, enemies float above the ground after you knock them out, pop in happens quite frequently.  The best parts to me graphically are the parts where you are soaring down around Gotham and seeing all the vibrant lush neon lights.Gameplay Impressions: Combat feels better than ever, it feels a bit more faster and fluid than the previous games (got through playing the series recently so its easy for me to compare.) To me I loved how the combat worked in previous games, but felt it was just a tad slow, nice that its sped up here. No more walking through tight corridors or seeing the same locales like in Asylum or even City to an extent, this games world is massive. Zipping from building to building with Batman's arsenal makes you wish a Spiderman game was only this good at its ""web slinging"" action. There is a great sense of speed while you coast from building to building and is quite fun. One moment you are on top of  building, next moment you are flashing toward some thugs and blistering their bones.  You can now also interrogate your victims and make them spit out some pertinent information to your mission.  Launching in and out of the batmobile in pursuit of some random street thug or being propelled in to the sky all work seemless and make me excited to play with my new toy any chance I can get.Its too bad the best moments and the highlight of the game - the gameplay - SUFFERS because of the shoddy port quality.  I have had my fps drop to as low as 20 in some cases. Something I have never seen happen on my 970 before running a game on its max settings (this is without the nvidia effects toggled on.)Performance Impressions: The games open world looks good, not great.  That said for a game that looks like this it should not have my framerate stuttering all over the place at times. Other open world games like the recent The Witcher 3 actually look more impressive in many aspects compared to Batman Arkham Knight, and perform way more stable. I think the stability and the game being locked to 30fps is a very telling sign that this port was - nay - IS rushed without all the bells and whistles you would hope for in a next gen PC title.  I will update this review later with a video with my gameplay performance using the 970. Thanks for reading and I am hoping to have more detailed impression as the night progresses. As of now I feel a bit bamboozled out of shelling out money for this, yea you can fly and punch baddies like before and its open world.... but it just doesn't look or perform like a next gen title should even with the Nvidia fluff on. The Witcher 3, really made my standards of PC gaming high, not only in a gameplay aspect but graphically speaking as well.Game feels really good when its WORKING and smooth. Heck I even had tons of fun just doing donuts and seeing the smoke effects in the batmobile at 20fps glory. For what its worth, I quite like the batmobile segments. You can cruise through walls, call it in to literally steam roll a group of bad guys, and it doubles as a freaking tank with eye popping particle effects.The combat is tight and responsive as ever, however the performance just bogs the game down way too much for me to say that this game is an instant buy right now.  Couple this with the widely known game hindering DRM Denuvo, it is just mind boggling, companies continue to support DRM practices that hinder their own game and risk the games integrity in order to make another buck or two. All signs point to Rocksteady rushing this port out.Update 1: Game port was outsourced to a company named Iron Galaxy.  Well, there it is.Update 2: Last update for the night its 4am! Uploaded a quick video of the gameplay, take care for now my fellow Dark Knights.Update 3: Supposedly new Nvidia drivers are out today - will try them out and let you guys know if anything changes.Update 4 June 24th: Thanks for everyone being informed gamers and doing their research. It is my hope as well not to only get a better product I paid for and was eagerly awaiting for just like you, but to help set a precedent for future PC titles from big pubs/devs. PC gamers should not be treated like second class citizens.  We pay for digital titles that we can't sell back unlike console players, and are often left mercy to the corporations (its what they are) to fix their games.  We aren't guaranteed anything, thankfully Valve is now accepting refunds and reports of customers from thid party vendors like GMG are now willing to process refunds. This is great news for us PC gamers. We have no excuses anymore but ourselves if we continue to support faulty products even if we are given the chance to get a refund. While I am dissapointed with this port, without problems like this, we as customers would continue to be treated in such a manner and there would be no progress. I am willing to give Rocksteady/ Iron Galaxy one chance, since they know and openly admitted to screwing up this port - thats a lot more than what Ubisoft ever did for their scam on Assasins Creed Unity for many of us.  I will continue to post my impressions of the game and keep you guys up to date, as well post a follow up to the performance after the next patch. Iron Galaxy/Rocksteady, take your time - please don't rush the patch just like you did with this port. For myself personally this is your last chance.Update 5: Rocksteady has issued a public statement saying they are pulling the game digitally.  In the meantime I plan on finishing the game for the review, and will post my impressions on the patch when it comes out.			"

												As much that i hate downvoting a great game, this titel deserve it.. I'm running a 970 with a i7 4790k and getting 30 FPS and alot of problems (stutter, soundbugs etc). I have waited and was really hyped to play this game and it saddest me too se the PC port be so bad this time around. (Please read the updates i do in this review if you have some questions or disagreed with me)Pros:Looks like a great history (only 3 hours in the game)Fun combat system with amazing cool combos Driving the BATMOBILE :oReally huge world to play in. Alot of things to do.Cons:Bad performance. 30fps LOCKStutter, soundbugs, etc.Bad looking textures.Really bad PC port.Buy this game? If you dont mind the problems atm, i would pick it up BUT not for full price.Thanks for reading the review. :)Update 23-06-2015: Okay, you can remove the 30FPS lock, by going to your go to this in your steam library:G:\Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\Engine\ConfigThen double click on ""BaseSystemSettings""Then press ctrl+f and type in ""fps"" and now you can change that to 60 but i dont recomend going over 60 as it will most likley crash.I still stand by the review even tho you can remove the 30FPS cap. This is 2015 and a game that release on PC should not have been capped at all. Update 23-06-2015: I know my english isnt good, but that should not stop me from doing this short review. :)Update 23-06-2015:I have now talked to a support @nvidia becaruse many have told me that the game have some problems with the GTX 9xx series. Nvidia says that they have a few problems with the cards and i should be fixed ASAP. Update 23-06-2015:After i removed the CAP and turn Blur off im getting a steady 60 fps while running around etc. Sadly the FPS drop quite alot when im driving the BATMOBILE or flyving around in Gotham. Textures are still looking bad & many soundbugs still is there.  :P			"

												1. Horrible stuttering where the framerate is anywhere between 60 and 3  FPS when I glide or drive on my Radeon 290x. 2. 30 FPS Lock on a PC release is unforgivable.3. NVIDIA Game Works things hammered in that makes the performance of AMD cards worse, Thanks for being a part of the team NVIDIA and Rocksteady.4. Price of the Season Pass is too high for the amount of content that has been revealed to be included.5. The native Anti-Aliasing in the game options still gives the game horrible jaggies. The option is either on or off for it.6. Not many graphical options, and those there are makes little to no differance to the performance.Cannot recommend at it's current state.

												Yet another AAA title that fails actual playtesting and is shipped out to unsuspecting consumers who hoped it might not actually run like balls. Given this game runs on Unreal Engine 3, an engine pushing over 11 years old at this point, it has performance that makes GTA IV run like any Source game in comparison.Rocksteady have in the past demonstrated great optimisation in previous titles. My old laptop, which ran a GT 555m graphics card could maintain 60 fps in Arkham Asylum on the highest settings. This game, on my GTX 970 (which is one of the top 10 best graphics cards currently on the market) can barely push 40 fps stationary, and between 5-30 whilst moving. Good thing we got that enhanced NVIDIA driver to improve our performance!I think the worst part is that graphics wise, its not really much of an improvement over its predecessors. The post processing effects look really nice, and the rain effects are pretty gorgeous, but the overall texture and model quality just barely look better than Arkham Asylum, and that game came out NEARLY SIX YEARS AGO.I cannot recommend this to anyone until they fix the performance issues. Also, you can tell its probably a shoddy console port because the left the 30 fps cap in the .ini file. Stay classy, Rocksteady.			"

												I got it for free, and I still want a refund.Seriously though, I've got sli 980 Ti's(I'm only using one with Arkham Knight because SLI is broken atm...) and the game installed on an SSD and the performance is woeful if you unlock the framerate. It's the year 2015 ffs a 30fps cap is not acceptable, especially for one of the biggest releases of the year on PC. SLI is broken, along with the low-res textures/assets, streaming issues and stuttering, there is NO Ambient Occlusion in the PC version at all, rain effects/shaders are also missing that are in the console versions, just check some comparisons that are starting to pop-up. The bloody game crashes after exiting, every time. The PC graphics options are woeful, not to mention all you get are ""Low"" and ""Normal"" textures, that's it...really? Even at 4k there is aliasing/shimmering, and it just emphasizes the other graphical anomalies. I've never had this many technical issues with a PC game. Also, for a game that was heavily plugged by Nvidia and makes use of Gameworks, why is there no Arkham Knight ""Graphics, Performance and Tweaking Guide"" that Nvidia routinely does for all the big game releases on their Geforce website? They did one for GTA V, Witcher 3 and Dying Light, so surely Arkham Knight warranted one? They obviously knew this PC port was a steaming pile of crap and they've tried to hide it as much as they could before release. There were no PC reviews before release either, all reviews were on the PS4 version apparently.Do not buy this game in it's current shape. Cheers.			"

												I can't recommend the game in its current condition. Who cares about the 30FPS cap because that's an easy fix in the .ini files. The stuttering and freezing, however, happens even on the lowest settings, and it is unfixable. I've never played a game with stuttering this bad before, and I've played games with a dying GPU.I'm giving this game the two weeks before I refund it, which I probably can't due to it being from a third-party. My review will change when the game is playable.EDIT 2: I recently had to upgrade my video card from an nVidia GTX 680 2gb to a GTX 970 4gb. Does the game run any better? Sort of.. The stutter issues don't happen so immediate, though they start appearing after extended play. Plus, with this video card, there should be no reason for these low framerates on ""normal"" settings in an Unreal Engine 3 game.EDIT 3: Thanks to the new video card, I've been able to play it a little more and I've discovered the Harley Quinn DLC can be completed in a mere 19 minutes. Unless she can be used as a challenge mode character (like Catwoman/Robin/Nightwing in Arkham City) this pre-order DLC is truly garbage.			"

												SAD to see our beloved hobby go down in flames like this.  Been gaming since Atari 2600 and this gen has just been full of lies, fake ""real-time"" in-game footage (sleazy marketing swines) by publishers and Nvidia, and blatant false advertising - this is all besides the nickel and diming of microtransactions and chopped games to sell DLC.Enough is enough.  This was it for me, especially after taking time off work for this launch, paying for what I expect to be a working product (as advertised and flaunted by puclishers/Nvidia as high performance graphical tech), and spending these AAA launch days extremely frustraed just trying to get them running at a barely decent playable level rather than enjoying playing the game.  Giving them our money for broken products is unacceptable and the FTC should step in at this point to assist with consumer rights.I NEVER preorder yet I allowed everyone's hype to convinced me to do so.  I will certainly not be preordering or purchasing any games on day one until I see the ACTUAL game running on either youtube or twitch.			"

DisclaimerThis ""review"" is meant to be a blemish of Warner Brothers publisher for what they've released on PC on June 23, 2015. Negative words about the game mean technical state of PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight at the moment of the launch. All the information I refer to can be easily checked on the internet, I give almost no references here.What Happened?I'm sure I can not write what happen at the launch of Batman AK on PC. In a nutshell: crashes, stuttering and terrible performance issues overall (even on the best systems, on both AMD and Nvidia setups), 30 FPS cap, texture and visual effects issues and so on. Of course, it was reflected in tons of negative feedback from community and press. Steam Store had superior percentage of negative reviews. The game was pulled from sale on Steam which never ever happened before as far as I know. Users were offered to refund the game and Green Man Gaming (games online store) even started refunds for BAK though they don't do it on regular basis as it's stated in their Terms and Conditions and Refund Policy.Who to Blame?Much sh*t was poured on Rocksteady (BAK developers) and on ""external PC development partner"" Iron Galaxy Studios (studio that ported the game to PC). It's clear that the first were responsible for the game in general and console versions of it in particular and Rocksteady did its job quite good as far as I'm concerned. IGS is made guilty more often (they were doing PC version of the game, at least), but I refuse to do so. They're experienced[en.wikipedia.org] enough in developing, porting and assisting in porting games for various platforms. They ported Bioshock: Infinite to PC and The Handsome Collection (Borderlands 2 and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel) to PS4 and XBox One after all. I wouldn't judge them unless I knew the conditions they were set and time they were given to do their job.But I know who to blame for sure - Batman Arkham Knight publisher Warner Bros.Quick FactsWB made decision to have console versions of the game as primary ones (which is, sadly, a common practice nowadays) and to outsource porting to PC. It didn't happen to previous Batman games made by Rocksteady. Quite likely this decision was made just to save money on PC version because sales on PC are lower comparing to consoles.WB didn't give much sh*t about testing the game on PC. Anonymous sources say PC version of BAK was tested by 10% of sources (while PC is more complex than consoles) and in 720p. Standard resolution for PC gamers, right?WB took decision to protect their crap that can't hold even 30 FPS with Denuvo[en.wikipedia.org] anti-tamper technology. No comments.WB as a publisher is responsible for what they ship to customers. They decide when it's ready for release. They can delay the release (like it happened to GTA V PC or Witcher 3). And they knew the crap they had been releasing on PC. Undoubtedly. But they still did it. Shameless ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.WB f*cked up MK X launch as well. And its PC Version was also outsourced. What a coincidence, right?Final WordsWarner Bros. made the ultimate slap to all PC gamers' faces and showed their attitude to us. I suggest you to pay them the same coin and blacklist them as a publisher. And you should definitely refund the game (if you haven't done it before). Have done it right after finished writing this.As P.S. I will leave this TotalBiscuit's video about why you should never pre-order games:

However, VRAM requirements are still too demanding on highest settings, causing unusual stutter during the gameplay. Normal to High settings require more than 2GB of VRAM. Not worth to get unless you've at least a 2GB card and up to play the game on low quality.			"

												Months ago this game was bashed by every PC user for the horrible launch. Since then I've watched and read dozens of reviews of both PC and PS versions and it was still getting mixed bad opinions. Therefore I had low expectations when I bought it a few days ago, only expecting the tech issues to be fixed.Now that I've finished the game I can safely say it was a great and very enjoyable experience. I won't spoil anything here, not a big fan of the ending but it was a great story. All the little touches and details you would expect from the previous games are here as well. Never had a stutter or crash and I'm on a slightly above average PC.Won't go in detail, just want to say this - if you were put off by the fail-launch and negative reviews since then, give this game a chance. I love the previous ones in the series, but this is the first one I almost completed at 100% (only riddler trophies remain and they are really a grind). And the top point of many reviewers that the CAR is shoved on you and takes away - I was afraid of that, but no, really no, it adds and takes sometimes but it's not in any way obtrusive.If in doubt - buy on sale!

Good luck with that. I think I'll just go wait for Fallout 4 and get a refund.Edit: 24GB, not 20.  For those commenting: Odd numbered ram does not a broken game make, try again.

SPOILER-FREE REVIEWMy specs:  Windows 10 with 8GB RAM and an AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card.There is a lot to be said about the final chapter of this trilogy, and while not all of it is good, I still definitely recommend the game.  Let's get the BAD out of the way so that we can focus on the GOOD.First, every time I entered the game I was warned that I only had 4GB of RAM, and that the game recommended six... *looks at my specs mentioned above, then back at warning* :\ Yep, I'm pretty sure that EIGHT gigs is not the same as FOUR, but I digress... This did not seem to affect my gameplay.GLITCHES:  I only saw two actual game glitches.  One was where a character mysteriously appeared OUTSIDE of the compound where I'd been fighting his crew, and the other was that the bat signal indicated a quest item being over the WRONG building.  Not bad, as far as glitches go!TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  They are many, and could be game-breaking if you are not comfortable with adjusting some files.  I had no troubles in the beginning, but then the problems started: Lagging, crashing, and even completely shutting down my computer with zero warning. *cries*  Lagging I can deal with.  Crashing I can deal with.  Shutting off my computer over and over again?  WHYYYYY???  It started happening so often that despite how much I was enjoying the game, I was beginning to think that I'd have to stop playing...... and then I found the Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT thread here at Steam, and my hope was rekindled.  It turns out a couple of files corrupt over time, and all I had to do was delete one file and one folder, then verify the integrity of the game cache (very easy on both points), and voilà -- WORKING GAME! *cue angels singing*GRAPHICS:  If you don't have a new enough graphics card, the game won't even start for you.  The plus side of the high-spec card is that the graphics are amazing.   From the smallest dust particle to the sweeping bridges and skyscrapers, Gotham City truly feels alive.  Every crack in the sidewalk, every fierce tattoo, each choppy wave, an craggy wrinkle tells a story that makes you want to know MORE.  The people may not be as attractive as in previous installments, but they are more realistic, and they truly have character.  The devs have introduced a photo mode, where you can pause the game and do a nearly 360-degree rotation to get just the perfect shot... Just use the Steam shortcut you set up (F12 default) to take screens, and it removes the ugly interface when you take the shot.THE GADGETS:  We do have a couple of new gadgets to play this time around:  A voice synthesizer which allows us an extra layer of tactics by giving orders to assailants, plus the Batmobile, which I'll come back to in a bit.  The gadgets are by and large underutilized and not really explained, bringing back my recommendation to play the games in the order in which they were released: Asylum, City, Origin, Knight.  Not only will these previous installments give you a feel for the story, combat, gameplay, and general useful knowledge, but you'll get to play some GREAT games!THE INTERFACE:  Most of the controls are the same as what we're accustomed to, though they had to do some tweaking in order to include...THE BATMOBILE!  What a great addition to the series!  Not only can you zoom around Gotham City like a boss, you can destroy half the city as you go~! I had great fun running down criminals (literally... Muwahaha), blowing up cars, knocking down trees, fences, support pillars... you get the idea.  *evil grin*  In addition to a new form of transportation, we have a great many quests, riddles, and fights to win using the Batmobile, which is not only a car, but a BATTLEmoblie!  At the touch of a button we can transform it to a highly-maneuverable tank in order to kick all♥♥♥♥♥.. We can even do Batmobile-assisted takedowns with Wayne's patented non-lethal rounds. ""It's like being punched in the chest by an angry gorilla!""Many of the Batmobile quests are optional, but you will need to develop some proficiency in driving it, as eventually you'll have to use it to progress in the story.COMBAT:  As usual for the series, combat starts off deceptively easy, then amps up in difficulty as you progress.  We have the new Fear Multi-takedown ability, which enables you to take out up to six enemies within seconds... provided that you can come upon the group by surprise.  There are also points in the story where you can play two characters at once, and during this time you can do multi-character takedowns.  Those are great fun, let me tell you! ;DWe have some new attacks that we can do whilst gliding, plus the items mentioned above, but nothing really game-changing about the combat.  We've got our guys with riot shields, cattle prods, brutes, guns... and a few little extra things that I'll let you discover for yourselves.THE STORY:  When the game started, I felt that the side missions were much more engrossing than the main storyline.  I went through the game knowing not only exactly who our mystery assailant was, but why we were being attacked... Absolutely positive right up to the moment of the unmasking, and then... Everything changed.  That which had been mildly interesting was suddenly fascinating.  My mental shift was profound, as far as such things go, and it pulled me into the story in ways I had never considered.  Although one aspect of the story I had totally nailed, there were several real surprises throughout, something which I really cherish.  A good story is something that I truly appreciate, but you have a good story with great gameplay, and I'm in heaven!THE ENDING/THE RIDDLES (Still no spoilers!):  You must secure a certain number of criminals in order to view the final sequence of the game.  You do not have to 100% the game to see the ending, BUT, to get the FULL ending, you have to defeat The Riddler, and THAT means solving, saving, maneuvering, finding, and destroying a total of 243 riddles, people, courses, trophies, and destructible items.The riddles are the one thing I won't be doing 100% on this time around, though I did get 100% on the rest of the content.If, like me, you don't plan to solve every single riddle in order to secure the post-Riddler portion of the ending, then NEVER FEAR, YOUTUBE IS HERE!  Although some may feel that it's not really important to see that extra tidbit of story, one little sentence during this scene completely changed how I felt about the ending of the game. I'm not gonna add a link, since that's just too tempting to click, and I want this to be spoiler-free.THE BOTTOM LINE:  Batman: Arkham Knight is flawed.  The devs have no plans to fix that which is broken, but you CAN fix the problems yourself!  If you're a fan of the series and can problem-solve enough to follow the instructions in the Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT thread, then it is ABSOLUTELY worth your trouble.  I enjoyed this title immensely, despite the frustrations with the technical difficulties.  I would even start the game over again right this minute if it weren't for the fact that I have so many other games that I want to play.IN CLOSING:  I loved this game, and if it weren't for the technical problems that I encountered, it would be my favorite of the series. As it stands, I rank them as follows: Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum, and then Arkham Origins.  Definitely a MUST-play!I am Batman... I am the Night! "

												This is one of the worst PC  ports i have ever seen. It's basically the ps4 version shoveled onto pc like the massive pile of crap it is.  It's locked to 30 fps and still runs like crap. It has constant stuttering and the most bare bones options menu i have ever seen in a modern title. Gameworks destroys my framerate on a 970 and it's even worse for amd users. The game looks awful and the mothionblur effect, which can't be turned off, is nauseating.Stay away from this game. If you pre-purchased it, take advantage of the new return policy.			"

												At this moment in time, the game is broken, and not just a normal broken, but broken in a way that some people will find it very unenjoyable. You can fix the 30 fps problem by editing the ini files (Lord knows why they locked it in the first place, but that's not the point.)I have a 2gig GTX 960, it's obviously the biggest regret of my rig so far but I'm waiting for the next line of GPU's to come out before I waste my money on a 980ti. I have stuttering when turning the camera, when driving, etc. It's crazy bad even on the lowest settings. I do get 60 fps in a majority of areas, but as soon as I turn the camera or drive it dips in the 40s. It's sad because the game stutters even worse when I lock it back at 30 fps.It's just flat out broken concerning performance, and I really wish to enjoy the game. The arkham games are some of my favorite games of all time, and I will give a positive review once these performance problems are fixed. Until then, save your money.			"

												Warner Bros. is official a worse than Ubisoft. Let me explain why: when AC: Unity came out broken the company stopped the development of DLCs, rolled out patches weekly and the game was (mostly) fixed within 2 months, Ubisoft even gave the players a complimentary DLC. But what does WB do? Nothing. The game's been out for almost 2 months now, not a single patch came out since, instead they keep making DLC for the consoles. You think that after such terrible launches as Battlefield 4 or the previously mentioned AC: Unity, companies would learn to ship their games finished, but obviously that isn't the case.			"

												I'v finished the game at 100%, but making it took me more hours than really needed, and all because of the bad performance of the title. I recommend it now that the realease patch has been released, but only if you buy it out of steam, because is not worth the 45,99 euros they want you to pay. In some pages it costs less than 10 euros. And the season pass 12. I will regret for the rest of my life the prepurchase of this game. First and last game I prepurchase ever. Oh, and one last thing: Where is the season pass they promised for the people that supported them since the release more than 3 months ago? I dont find it fair that you sell a game in these conditions and give nothing to the people that (literally) wasted their money on it.			"

												*Edit*  2015/09/04 My game actually runs worse post-patch...First off, this is an inexcusably terrible port, especially from a developer whose budget vastly exceeds the million dollar mark, I find it ironic that they delayed the Limited Edition due to quality issues yet were perfectly content with releasing this broken, incomplete mess as it is on PC. The FPS is locked to 30 by default and suffers dips to the single digits when moving fast due to what I suspect to be a texture streaming issue, while there is an option to unlock it, it's best left on as it creates instabilities and the constant drops from 60 FPS to 10 - 20 FPS make for an annoying experience. I hope the Steam refund is used in wide effect, this trend of games launching in such state is getting rather tiresome. The game itself is mediocre - featuring the same overly simple, monotonous combat from the previous installments and most of the same gadgets only this time you get access to the Bat Mobile, which does create a few cool moments but soon becomes extremely repetitive when you're forced to use it on nearly every mission in the game. The voice acting is horrible, beyond the 'so bad it's good' mark, it comes across as tired and uninspired where the characters in-game sound like they care little for the current situation with a stiff, almost sarcastic tone and hardly ever fits the mood of the moment at hand.  The world features some nice design choices and looks pretty good in my opinion, the aesthetics of the game are not too shabby either. The plot is laughably bad, this is lower grade writing defined - not that I care much for it in most games, but in a game like this that's heavily narrative driven it's... bad. The characters are pretty dull and generic too, along with their cringe worthy dialogue that makes for plenty of moments where you're likely to let out a sigh, it's as if they read a few comic books, watched some of the movies & cartoons and took the cheesiest, most generic lines they could find and threw them in there.While this is essentially the same Batman game as before and you're likely to find some enjoyment out of it if you don't mind the monotony of being forced to use the Batmobile for a good portion of the game and if you really liked the other ones and are a fan of Batman in general, I'd recommend waiting atleast a year for them to iron this mess out and get a version inclusive with the swamp of DLCs planned - I,myself, will never buy anything from this studio again, their attitude is awful and they clearly shafted PC gamers to the bottom of the pedestal, like most AAA devs of this era do.

												I preordered Batman: Arkham Knight because I was super hyped for this game.  Turns out I then got it free with the purchase of a GTX 980, so I gave my preorder to a friend.  Then I spend $60 on Season Passes for both of us.  Now, Im sitting here with a game that won't run on a nVidia GTX 980 and an i7-4790k...oh, and my free copy from nVidia got downgraded to a regular purchase and not a preorder, so I don't get the Harley Quinn missions...NOT LIKE I COULD FREAKING PLAY THEM ANYWAY.  What a piece of garbage...FPS locked at 30, downgraded textures, preorder bonuses stripped away, failure to write to disk, frequent framerate drops.  I thought I could trust you, Rocksteady...I don't preorder anything...but just this one time and you screwed me hard.  You'll never get my money again.  I hope you burn for this.Edit: I originally tried to post this after it absolutely wouldn't run on my machine...turns out you have to play it for at least five minutes to review it...that's hilarious...WHEN IT WON'T EVEN FREAKING START!!!!  I had to launch the game like thirty times to get that five minutes...but somebody is going to read this review!			"

												Playing on a 970 at 1080p: Game has a 30 fps lock that can be turned off in the ""BmSystemSettings.ini"" in the .../BMGame/Config folder. Change ""MaxFPS=30.000000"" to whatever you want. But, the framerate is so inconsistent, its probably best to keep it locked to 30. I can get it to 60 fps when nothing is happening. Flying around or driving plumets the framerate to sub 30 at times, and this is with all the Gameworks stuff off. Game lacks many, many graphical options (they might be in the .ini files but not in the game). After playing it more: There is a lot of really bad textures all throughout the game. This is an Unreal Engine 3 game, so I'm guessing it's having pop in issues. The limited graphics options is a huge negative, especially since the previous games have had a decent amount of options.Not a good PC Port. Wait for it to get better. Good thing we can get refunds now, I guess?			"

												It's been over a year now...I finally bought the game on a steam sale only to discover it is absolute garbage.  My system excceds the recommended specs...all drivers are current and it still crashes 9/10 times it tries to move from a cinematic into game play.  Rocksteady's response to my inquires was ""We regret to inform you that at this time we are no longer supporting or adding material to the PC release.""  So Rocksteady can kiss my business good bye.  They have had a year to fix this...they put it back up for sale and the game is still broken.  Don't buy it.  Give your money to someone that makes games that are working on release and offers support to their customers.Update:  Finally got this game working on 9-25-16.  Took a lot of efforts going through forums on steam and on other 3rd party sites.  I appreciate the input of so many commentators below.  That said I stand buy the review and the recommendation.  A player should not have to resort to the player forums, mods and the fan community to get a product to work.  It is poor customer support, planning and product management.  Rocksteady provided no help in their communications.  Steam support actually refered me to more resources and they followed up.  Rocksteady dropped the ball on this product.  I called them on it.  I stand by it.Update 2:  10-18-16 After months of trying to log on to WBPlay Forums to get the Zur En Arrh skin I brought up the problem in the WB Forums.  Was their reaction to provide support?  Was it to unlock the skin for me?  Was it to apologize for their poopr infrastructure and almost 60 day delay in being able to access content I was promised?  None of the above.  Instead they banned my account and access the the WBPlay site for life.  Not just Arkham Knight but ALL WBPlay forums, community access and other information.  This game and everyone involved in it are a sick joke.  To hell with Rocksteady, to hell with WB and to hell with Arkham Knight.  Don't buy it.  You can't get any support unless its from the players.  They are the one redeeming quality of this crap pile of a game.			"

												I had the graphics on full settings until around halfway through the game when it lagged out so much that I thought I had suddenly returned to the game E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.However, I will try to focus on the actual game instead of the graphics.Good:- Interesting story- Good number of returning villains- Interesting villains, not just boring ones (with the exception of the Riddler)- Funny thug dialogue- Good, new fighting mechanics (not including the Batmobile)- Allows you to use the Batmobile- Introduces new classic characters (Lucius Fox, Red Hood, Man-Bat)- Gives returning characters more development along with their own missions (Azrael, Firefly, Deathstroke)- DLC isn't just rehashed ideas- Good references and easter eggsBad:- Story gets repetitive in some places- Some returning villains have extremely boring side missions (Riddler, Deathstroke, Hush)- New villains also have extremely boring side missions (Pyg, Deacon Blackfire)- Riddler riddles are getting REALLY BORING- You have to solve all 243 riddles to complete the game 100%, which is complete bullsh*t- Deathstroke, the only villain who can match Batman's skill, is reduced to a tank battle boss fight- Fan-favourite villains aren't in the game (Deadshot, Bane, Mr Freeze)- The Batmobile is overused, and it is used in almost all side missions at least 3 times- The Batmobile removes the need for avoiding sentry guns, allowing you ro just run them overAnd an honourable mention:- Rocksteady completely ignored PC gamers and focused on Xbox and PS			"

												This is another example of a AAA title ported to PC and getting ruined to a state of complete disarray because the developers have the ""bright"" idea to focus on crap consoles and outsource over a third of their market to some shady, virtually unknown, 3rd party dev team to do the PC porting.I actually had high hopes for this game after Asylum and City (never played Origins), but I feel now the same way I have when Darksiders 2 came out...I guess the only thing that sort of saves me is the hardware I have, but what the hell is this crap about capping the frame rate?I thought only Ubisoft is into the FPS capping♥♥♥♥♥♥..I'm sitting on a G1 GTX980, 16GB DDR4 and an Intel i7 5960X - and I get dips under 50 at minimum in certain places during the benchmark test the game offers in the main menu with a res of 1920x1080 (24"" screen) and everything else enabled and maxed out...if that's the case for me, I dread to think of what people with more mainstream setups experience.

												It's a sad day... not for a Batman fan, but for a PC gamer, who waited, who anticipated and who paid for the game. In this state, it's total garbage, and absolute disdain for PC gamers all around the world. So what we have: blur, ""normal"" for highest texture setting, Blur, 30 fps lock, more BLUR God dammit! And of course the most grandeur thing is: TA-DA NVIDIA no Ambient Occlusion and rain effects!!!http://i.imgur.com/Md7V0YZ.png Yeah guys, you shouldn't have killed the Joker, 'cos now you yourselves are no more than a sad sad joke...P.S. I've played only 40 minutes, 'cos game crashed and I've checked cache... Stuped me, now I'm downloading this for the third time)))I can really smell the Joker around)))			"

												Just one more preorder, the publisher said Then we will unlock a cool hat for your head You'll save 10 percent if you order today The game is not out yet but we ask you to pay The previews are glowing, so make no mistake this game is amazing though the screenshots are fake But check out this gameplay it's a vertical slice so before you have played it, please put down full price We love all the fanboys so we ask you to pay, for our unfinished product that we'll patch the 1st day It's still bloody broken 6 months down the line But you got a free skinpack so it all turned out fine. I trusted the trailer, oh why would they lie? They gave an xp boost so I just had to buy This game is atrocious, it should have been free But I just cannot wait to buy the dlc.EDIT: I've been getting too much positive reviews for this, but this is NOT my creation.

												*This review will be addressing the actual in gameplay and story aspects, NOT the technical issues. There's plenty of reviews covering those*I got Arkham Asylum when it came out. One of my favorite games, ever. Same with Arkham City. I beat both of those games on PS3, and beat AA again on PC and will do City on PC shortly, and I rarely re-beat games.I don't know what happened to Arkham Knight. There are no boss battles in this game. None. There are a few souped up tanks/helicopters you fight with the Batmobile that could qualify as a boss battle, but there are not any actual hand to hand combat boss battles. You have no boss battle with Arkham Knight. You have no boss battle with Scarecrow. You have no boss battle with Harley Quinn, or Penguin, or Deathstroke. Why? Back in City/Asylum, Mr. Freeze is considered one of the best boss battles of all time. Ra Al Guul, Poision Ivy, EXCELLENT battles. You have almost a century's worth of material from films, games, comics, and tv shows to look for inspiration to how a 1v1 boss battle could be played out. Why are these not there? Like what a stupid design decision. I guess that's the most jarring part is just that there's just no good reason to not put them in. it's not like there were time/money constraints. As I said you have Batmobile boss battles where you fight unique tanks and what not. Why not allocate some of those sources to a real battle? I mean really, there was no Arkham Knight boss battle? None? And with the backstory they gave the guy, there is no reason he wouldn't have been able to have a huge epic fight with Batman. It's just so stupid.  Also, the story. The story is really good at some points. But I kinda wonder if there isn't some DC Executive ♥♥♥♥in with the stories cause he thinks he knows what he's doing better than Rocksteady. because Joker steals the show. again. Yes I know he died at the end of City. I know Rocksteady confirmed that absolutely Joker would not be in the game. Well, they lied. Joker's in the game, and he has more recorded dialogue than Scarecrow and Arkham Knight combined. The Batmobile segments weren't bad in theory. I don't know why people say the Batmobile is tough to control, I think it's very smooth. The combat of it, in theory, is complex, strategic, and fun. It has a variety of fun weapons to play with.Except all the actual fights with the Batmobile were just incredibly uninspired. Like with the exception of two fights, the dozens of tank fights in the game is just you in an empty area with a bunch of takes. Hit 'Fire' and strafe until everything stops moving. There's no 'tactical' way to assert the situations. You just strafe and♥♥♥♥♥♥ the AI is also incredibly unfair at somepoints. basically, the way enemy tanks attack is that shoot in a straight line, and it's telegraphed for ~1 sec by an indicator line from the tank that traces the hits area of effect. Sometimes, when you're fighting 50+ tanks simultaneously (which btw sounds epic but is really just tedious) you see the lines pop up and there is LITERALLY (i used that in the traditional, non hyperbolic meaning) no way you could possibly dodge. Not that you can't react fast enough. I mean there is literally no possible button input in which you could possibly dodge some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥thrown at you. None nada. It doesn't happen often, it's the result of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deal of the RNG, since attacks are more aimed at the Batmobile's general area rather than right at you. but still just stupid. Part of the problem also is it's almost like Rocksteady thinks that every time you fight a big crowd as Batman, there has to be some complimentary batmobile fight/segment. No, there doesn't. When you show some intimidating crowd attacking Batman, you don't need to do a tank squadron right after. Geez, why does this have to be explained? Why would you think this? That's like fanfiction logic.Now the actual hand to hand combat was really done well. It was very refined, and it's not just Arkham City with new attacks/enemies. The core gameplay is the same, but it's done in a way where you handle situations a lot differently than you would in AC. It feels inspired, like they had ideas about the combat that they were excited about implementing. For example, you get a voice sysnthesizer that can be used to direct an enemy to a certain location by a false voice of their commander. It makes you rethink the way Predator encounters are done. There's a LOT of nice touches like that. Overall, get this game if you liked the other Arkham games, but do not expect the holy pinnacle of the Batman series. Just expect some more Arkham style mayhem that can be frustrating but usually fun. If you haven't played any other Arkham games, go get Arkham City or Asylum. This and Origins are the ones who to save for those who really liked the previous 2 and want more.			"

												When I played Arkham Origins, I thought it was a fine game with some notable flaws that made it inferior to Arkham City, but all would be made right with the release of Arkham Knight. But that's not exactly what happened -- instead, I think Arkham Knight is a fine game with some notable flaws that make it inferior to Arkham City.Let's tackle the first elephant in the room: the botched port and initial release. It stank up Steam so bad that it single-handedly kickstarted popularized the refund policy (thanks to Link XL1 for pointing out refunds actually started a bit earlier than AK), and it was the reason I held off on actually buying it until a good long while had passed, despite being a massive fan of the series. I can be brief about this: my brand new rig has 16 GB of memory and a GTX 1070, and the game runs at a near-constant 70 FPS at 1440p maxed settings while looking absolutely gorgeous. Now, I get that not everyone has had that experience, or will have that experience, but I can only judge the game on how it plays for me at this point in time, and I have no reason to complain. That's not to say I tihnk that putting out a release as broken as this one is in any way acceptable or excusable -- it's not -- but I'm not going to count it against the game in its current state.The same can't be said for elephant number two, which is the Batmobile. The Dynamic Duo in this game isn't Batman and Robin, but Batman and his amazing rooftop-hopping car. It quickly veers from cool into silly and contrived, and about the only thing missing is the Batmobile doing inverted takedowns (it does hang upside down a few times, so that's not as implausible as it sounds...). They made sure you can't miss out on the experience by putting in vehicular combat and puzzles that require the Batmobile, but I found myself more frustrated than entertained by these sections. Despite what the game designers thought, it would have been completely fine if the Batmobile had just been there as a cooler way of getting you from A to B. Throw in the optional racetracks for the people who like that sort of thing, I'm fine with that. Have maybe one sequence where the Batmobile gets to slug it out with a tank or helicopter, sure. But repeated vehicular combat sequences and painfully forced puzzle sequences just detract from the experience. While you can avoid almost all racing and puzzles if you just don't go after the Riddler (as if!) the tank battles are there to stay. It's as if someone baked you a delicious, velvety smooth chocolate cake, except that they mixed in crunchy peanuts to chip your teeth on, because they read somewhere that chocolate and peanuts go well together.There are a lot of things Arkham Knight gets right, too. The meat and potatoes of the game, combat and predator encounters, work as smooth as ever, and there are the requisite tweaks and new moves to keep things interesting without completely unbalancing things like the shock gloves in Origins did. There's a smorgasbord of villains on the loose in Gotham waiting for you to arrest them, and they all involve different gameplay, so you can easily mix things up without getting bored. The voice acting is top notch, both from the regulars and the guest villains (special tip of the hat to Dwight Schultz, who plays a terrifying Professor Pyg -- I was surprised to find out it was him when I looked it up). The story is engaging, and I'm happy to say that's still the case even if you had the identity of the Arkham Knight spoiled before you picked up the game, like I did. I especially like the way the writers justified the issue of Batman suddenly deciding to stick massive guns on his Batmobile (even if they do conveniently fire ""non-lethal rounds"" when targeting humans). If this sounds a bit out of character for Batman, it's because it is... and you'll find out why as you play the game. Having said that, I'm definitely not a fan of the ending (the true ending you get with 100% completion), which is deliberately ambiguous on the ultimate fate of Batman and Gotham. It's not terrible, I can live with it, but it still feels like a cop-out and something the writers could absolutely have avoided in favor of a stronger statement. As a cap to the whole series, it's a bit underwhelming.Arkham Knight gets an easy ""recommended"" from me, but it's not as great as the final installment could have been.			"

												I have Quad Titan X cards. I get 70% utilization on the 1st card and 1% on the other 3. I spent 10K on my rig and I get 30 to 40 FPS on average with dips into 10 FPS. The game crashes every 30 min. The first time I booted it it failed to load at all and it hard locked my PC. I tried to verify the local game cache and it deleted every file I had and caused me to redownload it. The 2nd download didn't solve any issues. This game doesn't even have ""high"" textures let alone HD textures. This is the worst AAA relase in the history of the platform. Publishers need to stop treating PC gamers as also rans. We are the true gamers. I spend an average of 5K a year on this hobby. Just once I would like to see a major publisher treat me with respect.			"

												This game's PC port is not good, even according to my benchmarks. I have had several issues with this game so far and here is the list:Graphics are lacking; it could have been much better for PC. However, the console versions look great.Performance tends to drop when moving through one city to another.Sometimes turning off VSync and AA improves performance, but not by much. When racing through tracks, using the Riddler Blocker tends to pause the game every half second that it's activated. Unsure if that is input lag according to the controller.Stuttering occurs frequently in the game when moving throughout for some, even that it becomes unplayable for some who first drive the batmobile.Vsync locks it to 30 frames which signifies poor performance and/or implementation.My advice: Wait for a patch and more reviews to release, but skip for now if you have a minimum-requirement computer. A future review may be in the works later down the line. I'll update the review as I go along with further updates and announcements.6/27/15 UPDATE #1: An announcement has been posted stating that Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy Studios are now focusing on the performance and graphical fidelity for the PC version. A user named   Batsassin has posted an improvement of graphical fidelity here (the left image is the improvement) http://i.imgur.com/hV7ZNH0.jpg "

Fast-forward to a year and ahalf later and the game is amazing. Only about two times did my framerate ever stutter during the entire game (note im playing on my laptop), even on some of the lowest settings the game looked and sounded beautiful, definitely my favorite depiction of Gotham in any Batman game I have ever playedAnd thats just the technical sideTHE STORYoh my godTHE STORYIts predictable, its slightly cheesy, but it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feels like a living comic book and if it doesnt make you feel like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman than my name isnt Marco Crump.

												Runs horrendously bad even on medium settings on a GTX970.Frame drops in the range of below 3fps, 30fps at best. Simply unplayable due to the frame drops.Edit: The game uses Denuvo DRM without the store site mentioning it. Also, don't try to verify the integrity of the game cache, it will delete your WHOLE installation and download the whole game new.Edit: Changing the maximal fps in the .ini and reinstalling the game improves the performance by a lot. But it is still a bad port and the DRM issue remains.Edit (29.10.15): Key issues like no SLI/Crossfire and paging issues (FPS drop the longer you play) are still untouched, so don't get deceived by the relaunch!

												I'm pretty sure this game is a big part of why Steam updated the review system to show ""overall"" and ""recent"" reviews.  Upon launch this game was apparently unplayable due to how poorly it was ported to PC, and hopefully the flack WB Games got for it will teach developers in the future to show more care for their PC releases...however, the game itself (once the bulk of the bugs were worked out) is actually pretty fun.As usual, the storyline is solid.  The Arkham games in general have been some of the best adaptations of Batman from the comics ever.  And Batman rarely translates well from the comics.After Scarecrow got his face chewed off by Killer Croc in Arkham City, he's come back for revenge on Batman, and this time he's brought along a new player, the Arkham Knight.  The Arkham Knight is someone we haven't seen in the Arkham series before, but if you're familiar with the comics, you'll have fun trying to figure out who it is behind the mask, and why they're hell bent on destroying Batman.As with every other game, Riddler's been leaving trophies and graffiti around town, but this time he's got a hostage, you have to complete various challenge levels with Catwoman to help her defuse an explosive collar, and you're able to switch between the two in real-time to help them work together more efficiently.  This feature is also present whenever you're fighting alongside Robin.There are more toys, this time around.  The Batarangs, Batclaw, Line Launcher and Explosive Gel are still there, but this time you also get a voice synthesizer to command henchmen around for Predator challenges (until they inevitably catch on to the deception), a disruptor (which I think may have also been in Arkham City, I'm not sure), the Remote Hacking Device has more utility this time around and you can even call in the Batmobile to whereever you are in the city, even if you left it way on the other end of the map, it seems to always conveniently be just around the corner.  But I won't complain.There are street battles against the Arkham Knight's tanks, there's environment takedowns during fight sequences, there are car chases, there's an even wider variety of takedown methods...there's just so much more to the (presumably) final installation of the Arkham series...so if you liked the previous games but are worried it's just more of the same, worry not.  It's totally worth it.  And if you're apprehensive because of how buggy everyone said it was at launch, don't worry, it's fine now.  I only had one issue my entire time playing it, and I'd practically beaten the game by the time it happened, I started clipping through buildings.  Just reloading from a previous save fixed it, I only lost a couple minutes of gliding through the city, no big deal.I give it an 8.5/10, I really liked this damn game.			"

												I can't believe this is still happening in 2015. I got this game for free with my GTX 970 and I still feel ripped off. Forget the fact that they swerved all of us Nvidia key owners and removed the Harley DLC at the last minute, that it has a 30-FPS cap and 3rd-party DRM not listed on the Steam page, or that it was apparently ported over by some 12-man rinky dink developer 8 weeks before launch. I could maybe be convinced to forgive those obscene facts if the game didn't turn into a slideshow on any graphical setting while attempting to do much of anything beyond standing still. Feeling ashamed would not even begin to make up for what Warner Bros. has done here. People need to be fired over this.			"

												Reviews posted today are being marked as ""pre-release reviews."" I've seen plenty of incompetent indie publishers try to pull stuff like this on Steam before, but this is the first time I've seen a major publisher engage in such scummy behaviour on Valve's service. Arkham Knight itself is a decent game, and it ran more or less fine for me, but I'm giving this game a thumbs-down simply because I'm disgusted with Warner Bros.' business practices. Do not reward WB with your money; they haven't earned it, and they're trying to trick you into parting with it.How much do you want to bet that this review will be marked as ""pre-release"" tomorrow?

												It makes me feel so sad when something as technical as a PC port can dull a game, something that it's much more that just that. IntroductionBatman Arkham Knight is the conclusion of the epic Arkham series developed by Rockstedy. Sincerely, when you play the Arkham Knight, you don't feel you are playing just a superhero game which is usually some kind of marketing for a movie, you feel you are playing a brand new video game saga, and this game takes that to a whole new level in every wayGameplayThere is no need to say that apart from the Batmobile (whose use is forced sometimes) there are almost no new gameplay features that were not introduced in previous instances, something that I think is missing are new animations, because Rocksteady has been using the same ones since Asylum, that would make it feel even more fresh Apart from that I honestly think that the control is perfect, there are lot of gameplay opportunities, and and the best part of the game is it's rhythm, it's INSANE you are always moving, there is always something happening all the time, that's why the game doesn't feel static at any timeStoryI will make no Spoilers about this, I will just say that the story is totally gripping, it's unpredictable and full of twistes, it made me stay stuck to the screen all the timeBut, I think that the games biggest fault is the following: The campaign is a bit too long. By any means Im saying that I don't like long game storys, they are my favorites, but there are some parts of the campaign that could be omitted, some parts that you feel that are there just to fill spaces, unnecessarily oneGraphics Honestly, I can't believe this game runs on Unreal Engine 3 (well it's some kind of Unreal Engine 3.5 in fact) it looks so breathtaking in the most pure meaning of the wordI would like to remark this fieldsRain: The best I've seen in any video game Character models: Truly at another level, just take a look at Batman, Catwoman, Scarecrow or the Arkham Knight and you will see what I'm taking about Particle Effects: Seeing the sparks after an explosion leaves you like ._.Depth of Field: The best dynamic DoF I've seen, it's smart, effective, beautiful, perfectly used and its not distracting at any point OptimizationAs it is right now, I would say it's an OK port, because it runs well and it's not so demanding, but there could be more graphics options ConclusionBatman Arkham Knight is, in my own opinion, the best Batman and superhero game ever made, a must have if you like action-adventure games.9.7/10 "

												I'll add my two cents to the flame. I'm a batman fan. I've read pretty much all the modern comics with his appearances, watched films, played the games, watched tv shows.So imagine my excitement with the announcement of this game. I have an AMD FX-8370 with a GTX 970. 8GB RAM. I run games like The Witcher 3 at max, save for hairworks and a notch lower on shadows and foilage. I've never seen a framedrop, even in Novigrad. That should demonstrate that there isn't anything wrong with my system. I've run taxing tests to be sure using different benchmark utilities, and I get within the same ballpark as other recorded scores of this video card. I don't think PC games can be expected to run 100% amazing right out of the box. It's a difficult thing to accomplish. With the numerous different PC configurations that everybody around the world has, it's an undertaking that few games have managed to accomplish. Of course, it's absolutely fantastic if they do, but I don't hate it when a couple of ini tweaks are necessary for smooth gameplay. It's the nature of the beast. That being said, the lack of a bloody slider for mouse sensitivity is pretty stupid. The previous games in the series didn't even have that, if I'm remembering correctly. Even with my tolerance for doing fixes on my own, this is one of the worst that I've seen.I've tried everything. I've even given up the dream of a full 60 frames per second, and used that terrible recommendation that they posted on their forums: Telling users that don't have a 980 to run all the settings at normal. I couldn't even maintain a stable 30 framerate with those settings. I've tried numerous ini tweaks outlined in the steam forums, none of which, unfortunately, seem to make a difference. I jacked the ini file that the tweak guide author posted on pastebin and tried that (even though I essentially copied his guide to begin with). Didn't work.The bottom-line is that this game doesn't work properly for the vast majority of players. Of course, there are outliers out there, who claim to be able to run the game great. Do I think they're lying? No. Maybe their configuration just works better than the rest of us for whatever reason. But there's no denying that the vast majority of players, even with good builds, are unable to run this game at a stable framerate.I bought the game on GMG, so a steam refund isn't applicable to me. Luckily, GMG, bless their souls, has stated that if the issues aren't fixed by the next patch, they'll issue refunds to everybody who bought from them.All I wanted to do was play as the ♥♥♥♥ing batman.Edit: With the new patch, 30 fps lock is now playable. There are minor drops few and far between, but it doesn't drop to 18 fps for me anymore.			"

												I have two GTX 970s and an i5 4690k processor. The year is 2015. I disabled the 30fps cap and the game bounces between 30fps and 60fps to the point at which it's unplaybable, and don't tell me the game is playable at 30fps, I KNOW it is, but guess what, my rig cost me $1600, it can run Far Cry 4 in 4k on ultra settings at a stable 60fps, I should be able to run Arkham Knight just as well. I didn't spend that money to get a copy of a game that runs worse then it does on a glorified shoebox that's only good for casual gamers and people who like exclusives (I am the latter). Just because it would run better on my PS4 doesn't mean I should just fork up $60 for the title just to see it run at 30fps at 1080p with low to medium textures, which by the way are all that you can basically use in the game, because not enough time was put into the PC port. Luckily I merely got this game for free for buying my GTX 970s, but even then this feels like a ripoff. I'll repeat that. This game is so poorly optimized for PC that I got it for FREE, and I still feel like it was a bad deal. I'm waiting for a patch to decide whether or not to uninstall this game from my 2 terabyte hard drive which, shocker, there's still plenty of space on. It's not that this is a bad game as far as gameplay goes, which speaking honestly is the most important aspect of a game, so is it fair for me to give this title a fully negative review? No. But at this point I cannot suggest to anybody to buy this game on any platform if you care about the PC community, because people that want to pay top dollar for the best product should GET the best product. That's how capitalism has always worked, and another pillar of it is that we all vote with our wallets. So please PC community, for the love of all that is holy, do not buy this title on PC. If you want to stop production companies like WB and Ubisoft from putting out games that don't have good PC ports, then don't buy them. I don't care how much you want to be batman, go back and play Arkham City if you care that much. This game is not worth $60, I honestly feel like I should be compensated for even spending any time trying to get this game to run as it should on my PC. I understand some people will see my viewpoint as unreasonable, and I completely understand, but I entirely refuse to accept that this is the best that a large scale video game production company can do. I'm aware that they outsourced this to the same people that screwed up Arkham Origins, I don't blame the company that did the port I blame Warner Bros. for choosing them and pushing them to meet a deadline that they clearly couldn't. This entire situation infuriates me, and I have no doubt that another such game will come along in a few months and do the same. But for now Warner Bros. has my full attention and hatred. Please heed my words, and consider what is best for the PC community. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. Pretty please. With sprinkles on top. Screw Warner Bros. With love, cleanshot.			"

I've got 149 hours and while I can definetly say I've got my money's worth, I can't say this is a good game.As a huge DC and Batman fan, I've religiously 100%ed the previous Arkham games with the exception of Batman: Arkham Origins (I gave up on the Predator Paragon achievement). It seems Batman: Arkham Knight will be another exception but for different reasons. I actually loved Origins despite its flaws but the more I think about this title... the more I realize it was a chore to play. Keep in mind that I got the premium edition (base game + all DLC) for ~$24 USD off of Bundlestars when they were having a sale too. Before I cover the issues that annoyed me though, I'd like to go over the positives first.For starters, this game looks amazing -- there's no doubt about it. I've never seen an Unreal Engine 3 game that looks like this and I'm not just talking about the facial animations and expressions, I'm talking about everything. Another area the game excelled in was voice acting. Most characters were well cast and Kevin Conroy as Batman and a certain someone definitely were at the top of their game here. Also worth mentioning is the good twists and ""gotcha!"" moments that totally caught me off guard. The soundtrack was similarly great and hit most of the right notes, making me almost cry in one scene. Building off what Arkham City gave us, we get even more combat moves and ways to initiate a silent takedown. Not only that, we finally get to drive around in the batmobile and tear down the streets in it. I can't downplay how exciting it is to hop into this awesome vehicle the first time and then find out it's a tank! Yes, the batmobile can transform in a matter of seconds into a tank which the game calls ""Battle mode"". There's tons of stuff you can do while in this mode and it's all really exciting stuff.Batmobile aside, there's no shortage of side missions and other little diversions happening while you fly around the map such as: thugs driving around in cars like hooligans or riots happening on the streets. If you've got the season pass there's also a ton of different batmobiles that you can test drive with authentic sounds and multiple characters you can play as in the AR challenges. My fondest memories are of playing the Adam West race tracks while hearing the TV show's theme song and playing as characters like Harley Quinn and Red Hood because of how unique they are. The best part of this game would have to be Photo Mode though. This wasn't even part of the base game upon launch but it was later added as a free update. A good 1/4 of my screenshots for this game were done in photo mode and what makes it great to use is that you can pause the game at any time, choose ""Photo Mode"" from the pause menu, manipulate the camera angles, slap on a filter, zoom in or zoom out, choose a border, and do it all in a way that's really easy to use. You end up getting some great looking screenshots like the one below. But unfortunately... all of this isn’t enough.


Batman™: Arkham Knight

Even though I’d say this is the best Arkham game for role-playing as Batman... there's such a thing as less is more. The batmobile's undoubtedly great but because the story mode over relies on it, the fun factor disappears. Tank battle after tank battle and the game doesn't give up. Maybe I'm exaggerating but I reckon a good half of this game is spent in the batmobile. Winch this, dodge these tanks and blow them up (it feels like an arcade game at times honestly), drive around and use this feature from the batmobile… and repeat. I really think the batmobile should've been optional and not forced in the way that it is. The batmobile just feels a bit too destructive at times as well. I laughed as I mowed over people and slammed into buildings leaving nothing but debris. In addition to all of what I've said, the batmobile reduces the rather cool boss fights that we had in previous games to... yep, you guessed it... tank battles.Want to battle Deathstroke? Tank battle. Want to battle the Arkham Knight? Tank battle. Want to battle Firefly? Batmobile pursuit (okay it's a bit different but still not much fun). It just shows a lack of creativity. Other side missions? Disabling bombs safely and destroying APC military vehicles. How? I won't even go there. Even some of The Riddler missions - one of my favourite Batman villains - are almost crippled because of this. I won't spoil anything but The Riddler has basically set up race tracks for your batmobile and you have to get to the finish line in time. Yay? Writing this just makes me upset at all the lost potential here (even a lot of the non-batmobile missions and sidemissions lack fun for some reason). I get Rocksteady wanted to spoil us with the batmobile as well as a large cast of villains but it came at the cost of quality and most of the game just feels extremely repetitive.Next is the story. The writing here is noticeably weaker than any of the other Arkham games (might be because Paul Dini left) and the story has too many plot holes for my liking. Not to mention the identity of one of the villains in this game is incredibly easy to guess. There's a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing and what could've been a powerful reveal is mostly uneventful. Besides that, to get the “True Ending” players are forced to beat every side mission and get 243/243 riddles. The true ending doesn’t even answer a lot of questions or provide much closure but locking something like this behind riddles is a very silly move. Thankfully there’s a 242/243 savegame on PCGamingWiki if you don’t feel up to the task. On the port side of things, the game runs mostly decent but I had some issues that need to be addressed. The first: unlocking certain Steam achievements will actually make the game freeze for a second or two every time you satisfy the criteria once more for that achievement. I’m not joking. It’s all to do with the PCEngine.ini file. The second: I had around 13 crashes total across my playtime but 8 of those were in the same part of the story (analysing the crash site of a vehicle for someone that was kidnapped). You might not experience it, but it too has been another reported issue that remains unfixed.Other negatives include the ""Arkham episodes"". 6 characters have a DLC mission made for them but 5 of them can be finished in less than 10 minutes. I could probably forgive this but these missions are divided into 3 sections with 3 short cutscenes usually. Combat room, predator room, combat room or the other way around, but I don't think that's worth applauding. Batgirl's DLC is fortunately 1 hour and man is it a good piece of DLC in the way that Cold, Cold Heart was for Batman: Arkham Origins. Season of Infamy is also good but not worth the $10. Moving onto AR challenges… most of them aren't tailored for every character. You'll notice this with someone like Harley Quinn where there's a lack of things for her to climb or jump up to. When it comes to combat, a lot of characters share a ridiculous amount of moves. Lastly, thug voiceovers are reused for most of the characters and maybe one line for some is changed. A good example would be ""Batman's not going to save you now Robin!"". For Nightwing? ""Batman's not going to save you now Nightwing!"". It's especially bad when these lines repeat over and over more than they ever did in Arkham City. Certain AR challenges have bugs where thugs stand still and do nothing. Other maps are just unfair and weren't made in mind with the current combat system (Iceberg Lounge and Catwoman's Revenge). I’ll stop here….I've written an essay but all I’ll say is this: the PC port's better now but this game is easily the weakest in this series. If I wasn't a person with a lot of patience and/or a hardcore achievement collector, I don't think I would've made it far into this game. 4.5/10.			"

												First off lets talk about optimisation. The game had a terrible release 2 years ago, which has been widely documented.If  thats all that is keeping you from picking this title up then have no fear! , it took them long enough but its fixed. I hold a solid 60fps with a 970 asus strix, all settings maxed except the extra nivida fluff. If you have a monster rig go ahead and turn those on but I don't see much difference between on/off and it hogs VRAM. That being said..Almost immediately ingame you are introduced to the batmobile, get used to it apparently the dev team fell in love with their creation as it is USED ALOT. I really liked it myself but near the end it really is a bit much, I would have preferred some more hand to hand fights with the super villains of Gotham.The combat is pretty much unchanged from City which is no surprise as they have influenced other games with this system. Some new gadgets are introduced though which is neat when it comes to puzzle solving or taking down groups of henchmen.The storyline is fantastic and shouldn't be spoiled, you need to go in unaware and get ready to be shocked! Strong voice acting supports this especially a stand out performance by John Noble as Scarecrow.One big thing that everyone should know is the whole mess with the ending(s).If you are not going for 100% completion then do NOT and I repeat do NOT finish the main storyline with all side quests complete.Doing so leaves you only the riddler trophies  and the game locks you into the 100% game completion to see the ending/credits. Which means you need to hunt down 243 riddles across all maps/buildings....Solution - Leave 1 side quest incomplete while you finish the main storyline and then you can avoid the riddler and his riddles. If you do go for it then don't worry, some of the puzzles are fun, it took me 20 hours extra but it wasn't really that boring at all.So in summary - + Great Graphics+ Marvelous soundtrack and voice acting+ Arkham combat system- Riddler trophies for complete ending "

Do not buy!Batman Arkham Knight, where underneath the capped 30fps framerate, frame drops, stutters, muddy and terrible textures, missing visual effects compared to the console twins, and just all around bad optomization; is a game, with mechanics and characters I love. The gameplay itself is solid Batman offering here. If you love previous Batman games this game is for you, just not the pc version. As much as I like the franchise I didn't drop a substantial sum of money on my gaming rig to play games that have better image quality on a Playstation 4. One of my video cards cost as much as the whole machine. Luckily for me I did't buy this game but it was free with my GPU. Hope they fix it soon otherwise stay away.			"

												Fantastic game and all, combat, story and visual. It has almost everything from the previous games which makes the Arkham series great. Imo the game lacks a bit 1on1 boss fights, for example (MINOR SPOILER) the fight with Deathstroke, i mean come on, 1 punch and Deathstroke is KO'd? lol.Only thing it lacks from my view is the 1on1 fights which all the previous games did a great job with.Despite all that Batman Arkham Knight is a great game.BUT, it still doesn't justify the games current state. It is filled with bugs, bugs that should not even be in a game when it is released.It breaks my heart as a big Batman fan to give my favourite comic book hero a downvote, i hope to change this to upvote in the near future.TLDR;GREAT BATMAN GAME PROBABLY THE BEST IMO, BUT HOLD ONTO YOUR MONEY TILL ALL THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN FIXED.

												This game was terrible when it came out, and after spending four months working on improving performance for PC, it is still a failure. They recommend 12 gigabytes of ram for windows 10 users, which would be hilarious if it weren't so sad. The game runs TERRIBLY for the quality of the graphics involved. Still no SLI support after four months of ""fixing"" the game. As an apology for the games release being so bad it was removed from the steam store for four months, they're going to give Arkham Asylum, City, and Origins to users. Those games have been on sale countless times for under $4, and the majority of people who have Arkham Knight already have them, because it is their sequel. An absolutely worthless gesture for the majority of gamers. Seriously, ""People who purchased the fourth game in the series, get the first three games for free!"" in what world does that make sense? Oh, and the copy of Origins they give you doesn't even have the season pass, so they're still trying to nickel and dime you, even with their ""apology"" games. This game is completely unoptimized.

												I don't know what Rocksteady was doing for the past 3.5 years but they should have focused more on making a Batman game. When they first showed off the Batmobile I thought it would just be a neat way to travel the big open world, but sadly that is not the case. You will spend probably half your time playing this game in the Batmobile which doesn't control all that great. This ends up feeling more like Twisted Metal: Arkham than a Batman finale.Pros- No constant backtracking that has been so prevalent in Arkham games. - Batman + ally sections. Can also be a con because it's used so scarcely and is a missed opportunity.Cons- Worst PC port of all time. - Too much time spent in the Batmobile- No boss fights- Arkham Knight is a disappointmentThis has 70% negative reviews and most of them are because of the performance, but honestly it is just that bad. On top of the game no working, there's just so little it does right and a whole lot it gets wrong. Scarecrow and Arkham Knight are supposed to be the antagonists but they feel secondar and even though it has been in development for ~3 years it feels rushed. 4/10			"

I am choosing to keep this review negative because of how badly Rocksteady and WB messed up the PC port in the first place with little word and no compensation for everyone's trouble. Great game though.			"

												I have never written a review on Steam but feel i have to with this game. Im not going to write a full review about the game, its mechanics etc as that would be impossible. Every game I have to date has auto settings of at least high, most of the time, ultra. I boot up this game to find myself stuttering around at what would appear to be no more then 10-15 FPS. Impossible to play, highly disappointing.			"

												STATUS: Broken/Patching?To release such an broken game with bad performance in 2015 is not acceptable, People must refound, it feels like an early access , there is not way you have to pay 55euro/60$ for this broken game, they try to milk money from PC gamers with Season pass which is: 40euro/40$, this is not acceptable.I finish the Main story missions in about 20 hours, with 98% completion in 58 hours.I like the story, Puzzles and some of Side missions. I don't enjoy how the Batmobile feels.Creating Hype on an IP like Batman is not good, Warner Brothers should not release game like this in future on PC, like they did with Mortal Kombat X another broken game on PC, this is second big mistake.As an early adopter beacause I preordered this game I want something in exchange.

												TL;DR: Remember those ads telling you to ""Be The Batman""? Well you get to ""Be The Stutterman"" instead in the PC port.The review:For my birthday, I got the Batman and Harley Quinn action figures as well as the game.I like them a lot better, mainly because their frame rate is solid and they don't crash all the time.Anyways, this port is truly god awful, I've spent nearly two hours playing and while the game ran decently at first, it slowly descended into a port that ran so poorly that even Saints Row 2 and Assassins Creed Unity could be considered better ports.I mean the constant stuttering and freezing got so bad I put the game at 640x480 resolution, lowered all settings to minimum and turned off all Nvidia effects.BUT GUESS WHATIT STILL RUNS LIKE UTTER S***ENANANANANANANANANA STUTTERMANSo yeah,This IS how the Batman died.I can't recommend this to anyone, not in it's current state. Wait for a patch, there's a reason it's not on the store.(That said why are WB still selling the season pass? I mean, there is literally no reason it should be sold when the game is this unplayable...)			"

												Let me preface this by saying I only recommend this game if you are invested in the trilogy's story, because it does end the trilogy and the story did have it's moments.  But as an overall game, it gets a C+ in comparison to Arkham City's A+ in my books.This review is not about the ineptitude and failure to deliver a good port, or how the game runs.  Because for me the game ran perfectly fine.  I have a system that could run it at 60fps just fine.  I was one of the lucky ones.Therefore I waited until I completed the game, and this will be a review of the actual game itself, and will contain spoilers.  For Knight and for Arkham City, maybe a little for Asylum, because I have to make this comparison.If you were to ask me which of the Arkham games was the best.  Far and away it would be City.  Knight in comparison feels, lazy, and the Batmobile segments feel forced, far too often do you use the Batmobile for miniscule things, like Riddler tasks.  Why would the Riddler design a underground racetrack for the Batmobile?  His entire premise is about Riddles.So why you ask is City a better game.  Well.  The Boss Battles.  Not only did City make you ""Feel"" like the Batman, it made some of it's most distinguished villains feel memorable.  Bane in Asylum was a good, classic, Nintendo era style boss fight.  Dodge him a few times, nail him in the back with Batarangs, take him on and rip his hoses out.  Freeze in City is by far one of the better boss fights I've ever played in a game.  I've never fought a boss that would actually block off a method of taking him on after you used it before.  Solomon Grundy in City, much like Bane from Asylum, was a big brute you had to dodge a lot and actually fight.  Even Ra's Al Ghul himself in City, or Clayface in City.  Were far and away, better than any boss you will fight in Arkham Knight.This is why City is the better game.  Compare those fights in City to what you get in Knight.  Your first fight with the Arkham Knight is in a bloody tank.  He doesn't even fight you himself, he sits in a tank.  Yes, this is the first use of the Batmobile gimmick.  You continue to play along, man, doesn't seem to be many bosses in this game... oh wait heres the Second Encounter with the Arkham Knight.  Guess what?  He's in a bigger ♥♥♥♥ing bloody tank that can drill underground, which you run from in the Batmobile gimmick 3 more times.  Awesome, done with that.  Time to rescue Gordon.  Heres out first encounter with the Red Hood, unmasked lazily Jason Todd is the Arkham Knight, woo way to throw a twist in there Rocksteady.  Red Hood isn't even a boss, he's 4 glorified Predator rooms linked together to defeat him... thats it.  Thats the last you'll see of the Red Hood till the end of the game.  What a boss fight.  So The Arkham Knight/Red Hood is gone, so who takes over for him? Good old Deathstroke, but don't worry, you won't get to actually fight Deathstroke. They recycle the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tank encounter you had with the Knight the first time for this lazily thought out ""Boss Battle"".  And I'm not even going to spoiler tag this, I'm going to spell it out for you clearly, THERE IS NO FINAL BOSS BATTLE IN THIS GAME.  You never fight Crane.  You go to him for the final moment of the game,  You do actually fight the ""Fear Toxin"" and Lock away Joker in your head but there is literally no satisfying boss fight in this game.  At all.I wanted to like Knight, and I enjoyed my time in Gotham City doing all of the various tasks.  But even those Tasks.  Where you capture the other big name villains in the game like Two-Face, Penguin, Firefly, Pyg, Riddler, Deathstroke.  Not a single one of them, in any shape or form, has a memorable boss fight.  They are bullet points at the end of a task list.  You finish 100% of the tasks in their chain and you capture them pretty much effortlessly.  This is absolutely disappointing and lazy.  They are Supervillains.  They are Batman's most lethal and ruthless adversaries.  And they turned them into fetch tasks.There where other things missing from this game.  These 2 bothered me the most.  The Duel Stealth Takedown option is gone.  Replaced with the Fear Takedown.  Thats great, I can Chain Takedown 5 guys (At max'd skill)... but I have to do it loud.  So if I sneak up on two guys who don't notice me, can I stealth takedown them?  Nope, I can Fear takedown them, loudly.... Why did Batman forget how to stealth takedown two guys?  Why was it necessary for him to forget how to do one essential Batman thing to learn how to do another?  That is ridiculous.  The other major thing missing from the game is the ability to freeroam as the other characters like you could in City after completeing the story.  Or any Predator/Wave room challenges with the other characters in the game.  Nightwing, Robin, Red Hood, Harley, Azrael, Catwoman... all Playable during the game at some point, or in the case of Harley and Red Hood DLC, but I can't take them for a spin anywhere else?  Come on Rocksteady.My advice to you is, if you want to play a Batman game, go back and play Arkham City.  Play a Batman game done right.  I love Rocksteady and I respect the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of what they did for Batman in the video game universe and the fact they tried to up the scale each and every game.  But the lack of anything memorable in Knight will forever be a stain on this series.			"

												This is a disastrous launch, stay the hell away from this game until they patch it properly, even though i wouldn't bet on it.I'm running this on a oc'd 2600k@4.5Ghz and oc'd 970 @1080p with the latest drivers from nvidia. First of all, the framerate is capped at 30(!) fps. Great job devs, especially for a 2015 game. You can unlock it via the .ini file though, so let's ingnore this for now.I am launching the game again ready to enjoy glorious 60 fps gameplay...NOT! Even with all the gameworks crap turned off, i am getting dips to sub 30's while driving, gliding and various other situations making it pretty much unplayable at times. The graphics quality doesn't justify such terrible performance, i can't even imagine how the game runs on lower spec systems. Trying to tune the settings does little to no difference at all. Gpu usage in afterburner is unstable during gameplay from 40% to 80% which indicates the game is poorly coded and cant ulitilize gpus properly. Before you say my cpu is bottleneching my gpu, there are guys in the forums with latest oc'd intel cpus and TitanX facing the same issues.Rocksteady already admitted here http://community.wbgames.com/t5/Support-for-PC/PC-Performance-issues-we-hear-you/m-p/571341#U571341 that they tossed the pc version of the game to an ""external PC development partner"" so you can understand how much they appreciate us.Update 25/6: Well, apparently WarnerBros halted sales of the game until it is fixed. You can thank steam's new refund policy for that because i highly doubt they would do such a move with the old, no-refund system. I want to be positive that we will get the pc version that we deserve but I still advice everyone who is eligible to get a refund and wait until the game's new release. If it works properly, you can just buy it again. If it's not, you can tell them to f*ck off and move on. Don't forget, WB is in full damage control mode right now so we don't really know what to expect from them. Or when.			"

												Bias: I am a dinosaur. But I wish to be as great as BatmanDespite the initial issues with the PC release, I decided to wait until the improvements were made.This installation of the Batman series was a great ending to the story.I really  enjoyed the new editions to the game : BatMobile and Combo Fighting. Both additions were enjoyable. I will say, if the combo fighting was integrated into other games by the developer (like in LOTR: Shadow of Mordor) it would be a great addition in future games.I enjoyed the story. Combined some different aspects I have read in the comics without spoiling the villain and who the Arkham Knight, I thought it was an interesting addition the the Batman Video Game Universe. The game dark and gritty environment made me feel I was in Gotham. It was also enjoyable to see Gotham city itself. From lower parts of the city to from the height from Wayne Tower to LexCorp.I will also add, I enjoyed this game to the point that I even completed all the riddler\'s riddles (I did not do this in AA, AC, or AO)One complaint, I will say is the repetitive nature of some missions (but that was the same in the other members of the series). Another was how much focus on Bat Mobile Missions. I initially enjoyed these, but further into the game, I found them to be quite annoying and bother some.I would give this game a 9/10. I would also rank it in the series second. Arkham Asylum > Arkham Knight > Arkham City > Arkham Origins. Those people would disagree with me. I did enjoy this story more then Arkham City.			"

												The game runs ok for the most part on my MSI GTX 970 and i7-4790k. The Nvidia smoke settings screw you and there are frequent frame rate drops while doing specific things. Alot of weird bugs and sound glitches also. On top of running poorly, I don't think the graphics are even impressive.  The story is strange and comes out of nowhere. There are alot of awkward little scenes with maybe one strange line of dialogue, and it just feels out of place. After some patches come out and fix the framerate problems I feel like this will be a pretty great game that will give you hours of fun. At the moment I wouldn't recommend it, but make sure to pick it up when these things are fixed.			"

												30 fps cap, horrible glitches, bad performance on enthusiast builds, don't waste your money on this piece of crapEdited 7/29.I have finished playing the game, and, technical issues aside, I still don't recommend it.The story is good, although I'm not a huge fan of the ending, but the whole gameplay is really bad. This port was poorly done. Controls are weird (Press 1 ten times to use a batmobile weapon, press alt+1 for a takedown, press Unasigned for combo batarang), they didn't even bother. I have a mouse with programable keys, so I could use those, but it should come to that. The batmobile is pretty cool at first, but it becomes a burden as you need it for almost everything you do. Drones was their response to the whole ""Batman doens't kill"" discussion, but you now have to battle wave after wave of drones, even in some boss battles that should have been the highlights of the game.Arkham City took Arkham Assylum and made it better, but Arkham Knight just couldn't do the same. Let's hope there's some cool DLC coming when they re-launch it in September...			"

												Heard about the horrible PC launch and skipped it. My system couldn't handle it anyway.But my Radeon 7870 2GB died. Bought GTX 1070 8GB. Then summer sale came up. Read the ""recent reviews"" that the game was already in a much better condition, so I bought it. After all my graphic card can now handle it.I'm still playing it, but so far only 8 hours now,  I didn't find any technical issues at all. All graphic settings max in 1080p, including all those nVidia specific settings (but use FXAA only), the game runs smoothly. The lowest fps I got was 56fps and it was very very very rarely. Read that 970 could handle it very well, too.So far I like the gameplay, the story (darkest in the series) and really enjoyed it. If you're a Batman fan, or just a action-adventure third person gamer fan, you should get this.Basically it's Arkham City plus Batmobile and with lots and lots of new features and improvements here and there. I understand that Batmobile is a little bit overused. Some even mock ""Be the Batmobile"" should be used instead of ""Be the Batman"". But overall, it's still a great game. One that shouldn't be missed if you have the system to handle it.Plus :Good story (so far)Great gameplayAmazing graphicsHell..it's Batman from RockSteadyMinus:A somewhat too much batmobile gameplay (but still okay for me)Inefficent use of VRAM PS. I read that it still doesn't play well with a few AMD cards, so do some research first if you own AMD cards. Or you can just buy it, try it in your AMD cards, and refund it if it doesn't work well.

I didn't encounter any issues aside from the occasional lag spike, but as far as I can tell many people still have problems running the game.

												The last time I wrote a review was when I started my Steam profile to get a community achievement but THIS game right here, and the publisher behind it, I just can't even..So where to start? The game came out on 23rd June (my birthday as it so happens) and I had preordered my FIRST game EVER, after salivating and getting majorly hyped for well over a year (since the E3 gameplay reveal). I essentially did all the marketing WB would have wanted asking any friends of mine with a new PS4 or XB1 to watch out for this game, and when I finally got it? Surprise WB has cooked up a nice birthday surprise. It's a steaming turd! 4 months on not much has changed, game is back on sale with all DLC at FULL PRICE, no discount whatsoever, they barely bothered communicating in the time in between, game is still not fully fixed (relaunch game to fix issues? 12GB on Windows 10? Are you serious?)Can't comprehend what's been going on for 4 whole months that the game is still in such a messed up state. This doesn't deserve your money, worse, WB seems like they're gonna get away with this completely. They duped their customers they deserve a bloody lawsuit.Also Arkham library for ""FREE""?? Are you... Do you even... I can't.. I'm so lost for words at the stupidity of this decision. HEY WARNER BROTHERS! WHAT SORT OF RETARD ARE YOU, GIFTING THE PREVIOUS GAMES TO THE OWNER OF THE LAST INSTALMENT OF A TRILOGY? The amount of abuse that WB put the PC portion of their customers through, 99% of the people who have been patient enough to wait for the rerelease are fans who already own all the previous games, what a pointless gesture. Whole thing stinks of corporate whose priority is money first, profit 2nd, customer? What the ♥♥♥♥ is a customer? Has it given us money? NO?! GIVE MONEY!! Ahhh goood there's money you'll never see again now F*KK OFF LIL CUSTOMER GO F*CK YOURSELF. Sincerely WB "

												I honestly don’t know if I should recommend this. Was it entertaining? Yes, but mostly because it felt like playing Arkham City again. It’s another Batman game: better than the average action title, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors. Arkham Knight gets so much wrong. Firstly, the story is really two stories that have no business intersecting one another. The game kicks off with Scarecrow threatening to release a cloud of fear toxin over Gotham. Scarecrow could have been an amazing antagonist. Imagine the entire city transformed into a gallery of Batman’s worst nightmares: a surreal hell-scape that would have fit perfectly with the game’s Halloween setting. But all Scarecrow does is say, “You’ll lose, Batman” on TV screens. The fear gas does less than it did in Arkham Asylum. 80% of the story focuses on the new Arkham Knight villain. (If you can’t figure out who the Knight is in the first hour, you should probably question your knowledge of Batman. Yet, somehow Batman himself is perplexed the entire game.) The Arkham Knight leads the story in a terrible direction that feels more like exploring a dystopian cyberpunk world than playing as Batman. He fills Gotham with tanks, drones, and soldiers – far removed from supervillains and detective work. Batman spends most of his time in the Batmobile (also a tank). It’s overused to the point of nauseam. I hate the Batmobile. I hate its slippery controls, how slowly it moves, and how long and tedious its combat feels. Not to mention it kills people. The game tries to gloss over it by giving the tank “dummy” rounds and creating a ridiculous shock field that only zaps enemies when you run them over. But they are absolutely dying, especially when you ram into cars until they’re mangled soup cans. The first game in the series offered Batman a handful of gadgets, but designed the world around using them. Arkham Knight gives him dozens of gadgets and doesn’t have any level design at all. Every patch of Gotham looks like every other patch. It’s ugly, monotone, and lacks any recognizable landmarks. Even the combat feels bloated. Enemies are specialized to such an extent that beating them becomes a chore. Big enemies, electric enemies, ninja enemies, electric ninja enemies, enemies with shields, enemies with electric shields, enemies who heal other enemies and make them electric, enemies with guns, enemies with bigger guns, enemies that require beat-downs, enemies that require shocks, enemies that require the Batarang, enemies with quick-time events. It becomes so ridiculous, the game provides tutorials until the last hour of play. Everything is supersized until you’re gliding from one waypoint to another in a gigantic, empty world. When the story does get some room to breathe, it’s amazing. Some of the villains are even creepy. But they’re treated as afterthoughts. And don’t get me started on the DLC. I really wanted to play as Harley Quinn. In fact, for three games, all I’ve wanted to do is play as Harley Quinn. Know how long her missions are? 20 minutes. I’m betting some players will rush through them in ten. I paid real money for 20 minutes of gameplay? She has THREE fights in her entire story! The other DLC missions are just as bad. Batgirl’s is glitchy and short; no one cares about Red Hood, and all the characters are just dumbed-down versions of Batman. Do not waste your money on the DLC. Oh, and as a final note, yes, the game is finally playable. Barely. My GTX 900 series card runs it at about 40 frames-per-second. It eats up a staggering amount of processing power – so much that my computer will lag for five minutes after closing the program. It’s the worst-optimized game I’ve ever played. Nothing about Arkham Knight compares to its predecessors. Only buy it if you’re really desperate for some Batman action.			"

												This is a somewhat good game,not 60$ good.I'd say buy this only after it's fixed and on sale.Pros:-Gotham city is really fun to explore-The police hub is nice-The suit is pretty much as rad as batman gets-Great Riddler missions-Batmobile exploringCons:-HORRIBLE performance-Reused,rehased storyline from the comics-Boss fights are not really creative are numberd-Have I mentioned the horrible performance?-FPS lock(wtf Rocksteady?)-Overuse of the batmobile to the point where most boss fights are tank fights-combat is the same(maybe that's a plus for some?,idk,nothing's changed from previous Arkham games)			"

												Update: Sales have been temporarily suspended while Warner Brothers works to address performance issues. Clearly a result of Steam's new refund policy. The consumer has spoken.Currently unplayable for many, including me. I have never seen such a bad port. The game is not even functional! At least Mortal Kombat X was playable despite crashes and low framerate. But in this game, I can not even move without it becoming a slide-show!That is a shame because there is an amazing game somewhere under this mess. I hope they can patch this game soon. Let's remember that Arkham City had its issues at launch as well. But this is another level.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I will update this review once the game is patched and I am hopeful it will be a glowing review...when all of this is fixed. I am a huge fan of the series and the return of Rocksteady had me hyped with giddy excitement. But once again, WB seems to have given the PC port to an incompetent studio, just like they did with MKX.			"

												It's impossible to recommend this game in its current state.- Horrible optimization- 30fps cap (that even when removed is extremely difficult to exceed due to the performance issues)- Audio problems- Stuttering and huge lag spikesDefinitely wait to see if these problems get patched before even considering buying this game.

												I am not in the habit of overreacting or exaggerating, so try to take what I write as literally:- Settings are VERY limited. As in some of the worst I have seen in a while.- I have to run with ""low"" textures, because I only have 2GB RAM on my GPU. Textures still often pop and take a couple of seconds to load, which is distracting to say the least and still they look terrible. A chimney I looked at reminded me of Battlefield 2, which is now 10 years old.- The framerate is horrible. With settings all the way down, and the game looking worse than Arkham City, which is 4 years old, I still only get a framerate of around 40 in the benchmark. of course that is locked to 30 FPS in game so that doesn't matter, am I right?- 30 FPS does not look good when you are gliding across the low textured rooftops with depth of field and motion blur forced on, because you can't disable them in the settings. I took to the .INI and configured a couple of things: I disabled motion blur, ambient occlusion, bloom and capped the framerate at 60. I then started the game for real:- FPS 45-80 which is playable for me, I am not a demanding man. Unfortunately some things just didn't load properly:- When in detective mode, no enemies, or people generally, were rendered. So I could see the analysis of people I couldn't see. And upon deactivation of detective mode for a second, they were still invisible, and then they popped in, rendering through 3 sets of textures in half a second.- When in combat, there were no markers above the enemies when they were about to strike, no indicators of when to block. I was playing on 'normal' difficulty, and I am pretty sure they are supposed to be there, altough not entirely certain.- I changed the keyboard controls to fit my usual Arkham setup, but the notices ingame did not really update. It kept telling me to press 'R' to eject from the Batmobile, but all it did was look behind the car. Through pressing random buttons I found that I needed to press 'E'. So that's kind of useless.At this point I have nothing more to add. I have been waiting for this title since the release of Arkham CIty, and I think I deserve a properly working title for all this waiting, and for paying that amount of money. I will just have to wait a month or six and hope they are able to fix this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Posted: October 28, 2015
												Let me start by saying this review has nothing to do with the actual technical issues faced by somany PC players. Enough has been said about that. With that said:So I buy Arkham Knight - I must admit fantastic game and i can run it ok by reducing the settings. I have a season pass too. Yay! Oh but theres issues with the PC version? So they pull it from the store. Fair enough. Months go by. I wait patiently for them to get going again so i can get some DLC and continue to enjoy the game. That time has come, except apparently my season pass only unlocks about 3 pieces of DLC, non of the new mini campaigns no new batmobiles, and not most of the skins. So can i get this straight WB, i assume my season pass covered the 'season' where you stopped releasing DLC and i am now expected to pay for it ON TOP of my season pass? I am furious! I will never buy a WB game again (and to be fair, I've really enjoyed their recent ones, Arkham Knight included) due to these shoddy business practices, and cannot reccomend that anyone else does. Please people, dont encourage them.edit - Thought I'd throw an edit to be fair to WB; They have fixed the season pass issue. Yay!! However I can't help but notice that although WB have now stated that for Windows 10 machines they recommend a minimum of 12GB RAM, they have not updated the min/recommended sys requirements on the store page. Despite the fact that, with Microsoft ramming Win10 down everyones throats, more and more people will be finding this issue out the hard way. I can only assume it's because if they were honest it would almost certainly stop a large percentage of steam users buying the game and if we know one thing, it's that WB loves that money.  So, unfortunately, one issue is fixed but many more remain. And shoddy business practice is still rampant. I still cannot reccomend this game and my views on future WB games remain unchanged.edit 2: More shoddy business practices, just when i thought it couldnt get worse. The 'offer' they have made as COMPENSATION (although i imagine most affected already own most if not all of the Arkham games) is being used as a marketing technique to get more people to buy this broken game. They're advertising it on the store page as a Special Offer. Why not label it what it is. Poor compensation to the schmucks who bought the game. I must admit though, i was pleased to see that they are offering refunds. So one step forward, two steps back i guess.			"

												This review is for the initial release date. This pre-release review crap is so bs. The game was horribly broken, and half of the game is a repetitive mess. A complete downgrade in gameplay to arkham city. No amount of patching will fix the boring repetitive bat-tank. It is a complete waste of time.			"

												Arkham Knight is the final game in the Arkham trilogy that started with Arkham Asylum. There's a lot to love about Arkham Knight and a lot to dislike. The devs polished a lot of the minute to minute gameplay really well. Batman's animations are much smoother, running and zipping from rooftops feels better than ever, the graphics are really pretty and so on. The things I'd expect from a sequel. The parts I really dislike though are the things Rocksteady tried to innovate with.For the first time they included the Batmobile as part of gameplay. However this to me feels like the biggest misstep Rocksteady made. The batmobile is equipped with guns and controls like a tank. And you routinely jump into it to shoot at other tanks. It feels like a window into a different game Rocksteady was more interested in developing. You go from a relatively down to Earth experience where you use your fists to dispatch criminals in alleyways, to jumping into a sci-fi tank and destroying hundreds of other tanks with automatic missle launchers. I keep expecting a boss fight with Metal Gear REX whenever I enter it. I wish they didn't include the Batmobile and I especially wish it wasn't in the game so often.They also added multiple elements to the combat and stealth mechanics I dislike. For instance, you can now take out multiple enemies in succession with ""fear takedowns"". This feels gimmicky and unnecessary. They also included new enemy types. The worst one by far are medics who can revive enemies. This ruins how you would normally play the predator segments. Instead of encouraging you to watch a room carefully, waiting for enemies to become separated and avoiding being seen. You're now encouraged to take out enemies really quickly. I always felt much more anxious during these segments which used to be my favorite part of the series.It's really a shame that this game went one step forward two steps back. Since there was clearly a huge amount of work that went into making it. But as it stands, and ignoring the infrequent framedrops Arkham Knight feels unpolished. I think Rocksteady was too focused on making the game much larger than the previous entries in the series. When they should've focused on making a tighter and memorable experience. As it stands, the parts of the game I remember are the parts I wanted to avoid.			"

												Wait for more patches and optimization. At this state, the game is unplayable, especially for AMD users. Would not recommned to buy now.Update: Just completed the game, managed to run most of it on 30FPS on batmobile and the rest on 40-50. The game is great, really good story and the secondary tasks are pretty good, STILL the optimization is horrible, so the review will stay negative until they patch it and make the game playable for most people (Considering I had problems aswell in some parts, with frames dropping to 20 or less randomly).

												I must say that this game has really taken me by surprise. I understand that it had a rough launch, but they have really done a great job gettin' the game back on its feet. I have had no issues of any technical degree what so ever, since I launched it the first time. It runs smoothly with everything on max graphic settings with a steady 60 fps. So far, the story is good. I would say that the other stories in the previous games had more to offer. The big difference is that some of the first games, like Arkham asylum, had a very linear story, which resulted in them spending more time on main story. I am not saying that it's a bad thing, but it shows that they have focused on a lot more different elements. Arkham knight is a big open world, with a lot of challenges and side missions to complete. The key element to this game, is of course the batmobile that you can use as much as you wish, to drive around the beautiful city. The combat has evolved nicely through the series, with a lot more environment integration. Batman is as awesome as ever, with all his gadgets and suits, that becomes bigger and better as you would expect of the bat!All around the game is really nice, and has a lot to offer. If you are big fan of batman you will of course love all the little easter eggs and references to the universe, with some of the dlc's addin' even more to it. Price is not too bad, for what you are gettin' but i'm sure that it will go on sale soon, with the summer sale coming. Now get out there! A long night awaits!			"

NOTE: This review is based on my dissatisfaction with WB Games and WB support, it is not indicative of the game quality itselfThe game is STILL unavailable for gamers who purchased the game in Japan or Korea.  I purchased the game and preloaded it on June 22nd.  The game is STILL locked in ""preload"" for anyone who is unfortunate enough to be in Japan or Korea - WB support have been USELESS and they do not seem to know why it has not unlocked yet.The game was released in JP/Korea on July 16th for consoles, steam had that same release date* before the game was removed from sale.I am currently in England on vacation and that allowed me to unlock the game on my laptop - I idled for the trading cards which is why I have no achievements.  I am hoping the game remains unlocked when I return to Japan at the end of the month and have access to my gaming PC.*In Japan, the original release date said June 23rd.  Steam changed that to July 16th with around 5 hours remaining on the launch countdown...EDIT Still in preload... game also locked back up as soon as I returned to Japan :-(			"

												*Note: This relates to Batman: Arkham Knight as it stands on the day of it's release for PC.*After editing .ini files to get this shoddy PC port to even function, I've managed to sink a couple of hours into the storyline of Arkham Knight. But I'm not going to talk about the story, the mechanics or even the gameplay. As I said, I had to edit .ini files to get the game to *function.* As it stands, upon release, this game suffers from a locked framerate of 30, memory leaks, crashes, dropping frames, severe stuttering, *THE GAME DELETING ITSELF* and quite a few other severe problems. These issues are effecting the majority of people who purchased the PC version of this game to some degree or another, even on computers that are more than powerful enough to handle the Arkham Knight system requirements. It's effecting Nvidia and AMD users.The port of this game is atrocious. It's barely playable at best and unplayable at worst. People shouldn't be unknowingly paying for unfinished, broken products. Hopefully a patch will be released soon to deal with these issues. In the mean time, we are out of luck.

Posted: June 24, 2015
												With great anticipation I unpacked my PC copy for Batman: Arkham Knight, however, the reign of my excitement was cut short by the quality of this product. To describe this product as substandard and bad would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe the PC portation as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. In short: It is one gigantic clusterf**k. There may be people among you that ask me to give WB Games the benefit of a doubt and that they might not have known the state their game was in but that would suggest a complete loss of oversight and control which is just not realistic. I wish WB Games would have taken the same approach as with the Special Edition that was ultimately delayed because of quality issues. The fact that they haven’t leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of the PC community – appearance, apparently, is more important than a working software. The more we’re faced with such subpar programming the more I warm up to the idea that there should be a governing body; an equivalent to the NHTSA, NTSB or FDA.I bet the executives over at Rocksteady, the name behind Batman: Arkham Knight, are fuming. See, Rocksteady wasn’t responsible for the PC port of this game but another third party was put in charge (various sources speak of Iron Galaxy) – yet, Rocksteady has all the bad press and is busy doing damage control; I feel for you guys! Maybe you should send some flowers to whoever signed off on this travesty. I wonder how you can sign off on a 5-disc physical copy of a videogame that installs exactly 7.7 GB and makes you download the remaining 26.1 GB from the internet – WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! Whoever waved this through should have his decision power relegated to answer questions like whether you’d like fries with that burger.How can you ship a game that has a framerate lock at 30?! Sadly, the problems won’t stop there – besides being slow and prone to stutter and locking up which topples the game over the brink of unplay-ability, you’re likely to suffer from audio glitches and then there is the god-awful Denuvo DRM, it’s as if there has been no lessons learned from Lords of the Fallen. Legitimate players are stifled and get hurt the most with those laughable protection attempts to fend off Pirates sailing the seven ISPs. I get that you want the community to purchase your games and you want to be compensated for your work – every gamer that actually cares for videogames understands that. The problem is that by treating everyone like a potential criminal and pumping out defective software you’ll lose your customer base, you’ll lose them by not taking them seriously and frankly you deserve it. Arkham Knight is the absolute worst PC port I’ve ever seen. The only way to fix this is to have a fresh go at it, preferably not by the same company that is responsible for the initial portation but someone capable and competent. Instead I’m afraid we’ll just see a myriad of patches and nobody owning the mistakes that were made.UPDATE: WB has pulled the game and suspended sales and already the masses are singing praise - the poor delusional souls. Commending WB to ‘a brave step’ or ‘the right thing’ is silly and wrong and is a perfect reflection of what’s wrong with gaming nowadays. You mustn’t sell defective goods, pulling it from sales is the normal thing to do and should therefore be acknowledged and met a with a slight nod but certainly not with exultation and cheer.Many of us seem to have become so used to shoddy programming that we expect problems when we purchase a game, some even go as far as trying to gloss over game-breaking bugs. This will never bring about a change in behavior from the publisher, they’ll just expect us to bend over and ‘get on with it’ and worse, many are buying in to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the broken promises and cheap tricks – it’s like they have the attention span of a gnat. The fact is: This game should have NEVER been greenlit for PC release.			"

												I was one of the lucky, hated few for whom, on release, the game worked well for. It had a few bugs but nothing terrible for me. At that time I would have given it an average to low review as it lacked polish and whilst playable it clearly had some major issues. Since purchase -as I was fool enough to pick up the season pass with it- I  have been forced by the publisher to sit on my thumbs for months as they forcibly stopped me from accessing the DLC I paid for while they pulled the game which as a one off was a bitter pill but I suppose I could look forwards to them bringing it all out with a shiny. polished, ""as it should have been"" version of the game.Finally yesterday they re-released the game.....Now the game crashes every 120 seconds in the batmobile, and around every 8 minutes on foot. The same graphical bugs, low post processing quality and missing features (I'm looking at you fancy rain effects) are still there/missing after 4 months of ""fixing"". I am still effectively barred from accessing the dlc content I paid for months ago because now in essence the game for me is non-functional.I am Extremely disappointed and feel let down by the whole debacle as such despite my best intentions I can personally only rate this game based on my experiences with it's playability which for me has lessened to the point that it is now unplayable.I won't give it a straight 0/10 because some people might be able to get it to run, like I was when it first was released months ago.3/10 seems only fair to me. Franchise's legacy has been utterly ruined - for me at least.			"

												After 5 months and 3 patches the game still runs BARELY better than it did on release, and if you're SLI/Crossfire user it actually runs worse now since they disabled SLI/Crossfire support (earlier it had a pretty awful support for it but it still gave you good 20 FPS more).The game got re-released at FULL price with no recompensation whatsoever for people who waited this long.No free DLCs or anything.We were also promised that the console and retailer exclusive DLCs would be given for free to all Season Pass holders, but that was a lie too since some of them are still GameStop exclusive and PS4 exclusive.Instead people who owned the game before re-release will be RANDOMLY given Arkham library games (Asylum, City, Origins and Blackgate, with no DLCs) and only directly into their library, so if someone already has them and hoped to gift the extras to friends, nope you don't get to do that.You literally get jack s.h.i.t.That's how Warner Jews decided to reward loyal fans of the franchise who bought every game in the series including Knight when it released.By ramming a giant corporate c.o.c.k. up your a.r.s.e.

												Even after the update, I'm afraid I can't recommend this game. It's saddening to think that despite the 5 month wait for the promised patch, I still can't play the game flawlessly as was promised. Ironically enough, I'm having a crashing issue that I didn't have when the game was originally released. I can't play for more than 20 minutes without the game just abruptly crashing on me. I've tried everything from clearing registry files, rechecking file integrity of the game, to even deleting and re-downloading the game, but the issue still exists. Warner Brothers, I'm done with you. Not only do you have the audacity to release a broken game, and fix it 5 months later, but you have the nerve to still charge the original price of the game and just add Batman games that are usually sold for a little less than $5 on sale as compensation, which I'm sure that most people that bought BAK already have. To top it all off, THE GAME IS STILL BROKEN....AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.			"

												Great game; story and gameplay wise so far but the lack of AMD optimisation cripples performance, I'm using an R9 285 2GB on low textures and the game's fps lie between 21 and 30 and on average 27, note that there is a 30 fps cap in the actual game but not the game benchmark. Why is the game so Nvidia biased?I also pre-purchased the game (not from steam) before the game's minimum requirements were increased shortly before release date. I am using the updated graphics driver as well.The game is quite fun though when its running smoothly, albeit uncommon, the batmobile is bloody awesome and it looks like there is so much to do.Edit 1: There is a workaround for the 30 fps cap now. The game also runs terribly on Nvidea cards too.Edit 2: I've set the max fps to 60 with the workaround and the game feels and runs better than before, the framerate no longer dips below 25 (except from extreme stuttering), I run the game mostly at 58-61 fps (keep in mind that my card is below the NEW altered minimum requirements that was posted shortly before the game's release and it runs at this framerate) however there are still many cases of stuttering and tearing occurs quite a lot.Something I mentioned in the comments:I said Nvidia biased because 2GB is the min for an Nvidea card whereas its is 3GB for an AMD card, also the HD 7950 3GB is a better performing card in most instances than the GTX 660 2GB.Sidenote: I'm pretty sure the 7950 outperforms the 660 on Arkham City.

												UPDATE TO THE ORIGINALWB Have gone and removed the game from steam to fix the issues so hopefully I can have a good experiance playing this... BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED! If you valued your port so much then why the F*** send it out to another company outside of your offices who clearly don't give a s*** as much as you do????? AAA games like this should be worked on internally anyway especially a franchise this popular! even tho we know for certain that the game will be how it should have been in the first place I am sooooo dissapointed that I had to experiance the bugs, glitches and graphical errors.

												Almost one month since its launch and no patch. Because releasing paid DLCs is more important than fixing your game, WB! Great job. Amazing combat and really good, but a bit predictable story. The Batmobile, though, was the downfall of this game (apart from the hideous port). It was cool in the beginning, but then it became a burden due to the fact that they push it down your throat on every segment that would be way better without it. ''Destroy some tanks. Destroy more drones...'' That's what you'll do for most of the game. They're not even hard; just plain boring. Boss battles are close to non-existent since most of them rely on the Batmobile...Conclusion:Game gets a 7/10 for its story and great combat, but tedious and burdening Batmobile sections. WB gets 0/10 for customer reliability.			"

												This game is really mediocre . I'll try to be as synthetic as i can.Positive aspects :- The main story and  PERFECT ending were properly designed- The Batmobile addition and the improved combat system- The melee combat system is even more fluid and challenging- No loadings when entering/leaving buildings - Flying and diving were polished to the extreme perfection- Gotham City is awesomeNEGATIVE ones ( spoilers included ) :1 - pointless upgrade system  :You'll have to spend several points in order to be able to unlock abilities,forcing you to wait a ♥♥♥♥♥ON of time before getting some of those 8-points abilities that are quite often meaningless, like the super-hyper batmobile's ejection system.2 - some upgrades ARE STUPIDLY OVERPOWERED :Clear example : you'll meet 2 new enemy types : medics and camouflaged soldiers. Don't worry,your jammer rifle will thwart their abilities,neutralizing them immediately.NIO,JUST NO. A NEW ENEMY SHOULD RESULT IN AN IMPROVED THREAT / AND INCREASED GAME DIFFICULTY AND VARIETY. This is not the case at all,especially in New Game +.3 - Lack of boss fights and overall boss stupidity :You won't have boss fights. Forget about Bane,Coppehead,Deathstroke,Deadshot,Mr FREEZE.They're FFF GONE FOREVER. This is...stupid. Now. The Joker is dead,right? THEN ♥♥♥♥ING REPLACE HIS DEATH PROPERLY! New epic boss fights are totally absent,except for the Riddler's wresting match. ( ""--__-- ).Wanna have a laugh? Riddler vs Batmam is like ""Loki vs Hulk in Avegers 1"". 'Nuff said. SPOILER : Loki gets brutalized.4 - Bosses Stupidity :HOLY CUPCAKES. The Arkham Knight should be the ultimate enemy but instead...he's a clueless moron running with his drilling♥♥♥♥♥♥♥machine into underground explosives?!. He should also have been a melee combat expert...BUT NO! A FIRST CLASS CAMPING WUSS,like Mr.Mundy from Team Fortress 2 ! - Deathstroke : he'll replace the Arkam Knight right after you'll defeat him. The worst thing about it is that....you'll have to defeat Deathstroke in the same way that you've defeated the KNIGHT! HOLY MACKERELS! Deathstroke's fight was epic in Batman Origins...but here you'll just have to play hide-and-seek-and-rocket-him as well with 100+ tanks. ROCKSTEADY...you could have shown some creativity! Lazyness at the 100th power.5 - The Batmobile :The Batmobile addon could have been useful...the problem is that...IT'S NOT.Compared to the grappling hook flying...this car is as fast and handy as a shopping cart driven by a drunken sailor in the morning. ( Yes,obvious reference to the Irish Lovers' song here )Also,in order to solve many Riddler's challenges you'll need this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle. Good luck.6 - SIDE QUESTS :This is where the game fails the most . They're utterly repetitive and BADLY designed,clearly showing how lazy they were building them .Just to show :1) Man-Bat case : i thought ""wow a cool new enemy to fight;super senses,super agility,the ability to fly,to produce supersonic echoes.."" THE HARSH REALITY : DO A PIGGYBACK RIDE TO SUCK HIS DAMN BLOOD. Please. What a wasted opportunity.2) Firefly's case : forget the epic fight scenes in Origins,say welcome to a batmobile pursuit. ""--__--3) Dr.Pyg Case : all those ♥♥♥♥tards killed by him have the 3 body clues in the same 3 areas all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. Some more variety in finding those clues would have been great. But no : scan epidermic level,muscular level and skeleton. You're done. The boss fight? The butcher from Wanted. You're done.4) Hush : a forced scene with Morgan Freeman,ops. Lucius Fox. 3 minutes and Hush is butt♥♥♥♥ed,again.7 - DLCs and overlall additional contentHarlet Quinn DLC was a llama's spit in the eye long 5 minutes.Literally. Asking for a 40€ season pass before the game came out on PC was awful,dreadful and un-ethic.Batgirl's DLC lasts 45 minutes and doesn't show anything new from the base game.8 - PC PortI have a great Gaming PC and the game itself goes on 30fps on ultra-Nvidia-tailored optimization. Not more. Checking you game files integrity WILL DELETE CHUNCKS OF YOUR GAME. The game itself will crash  at least 3-4 times during your gameplay and WILL USE MORE THAN 3 GB of your memory when it's running.9 - Challenges :They're pretty easy,except for the Batmobile's ones. Prepare to rage.10 - Enemies' total awareness and common sense :The devs said : "" During Stealth rooms enemies will counter you,adapting their tactics in order to outmatch you. ""  F-A-L-S-E.REALITY : they will learn ( was about time after 3 games,i'd say) after you wipe out the 30-40% of them; even if they learn,they're still too slow to react properly. Stealth is easy . Too easy. No matter if they added the heavy patrol guard,the drone controller and the medics. They still aren't a serious threat.11 - FEAR TAKEDOWS :Holy cupcakes. The hardest thing to do in steath is do deal with several enemies at the same time. This new skill will delete the problem,allowing you to pretty much obliterate any real issue you could have in those clueless rooms filled with scaredy cats enemies.To sum up :This game could have been better AND IT HAD TO BE. Devs were just too lazy on not optimizing the game,not improving side quests and NOT MAKING THE GAME HARDER. A wasted chance to make the last Batman game unforgettable.Verdict  : 4 / 10			"

												Edited Version after latest patch: Dec. 9/ 2015Short Version of my Specs: FX-9590, R9 270x, 8gb RAMPros:-Batman-Rocksteady, I trust always, will fix this game. -We won the fight comrades! Warner Money Bros lost!-Actually playable now. More information in Cons.-Incredible game. Rocksteady created the final masterpiece for the Arkham series. NOTE: FINAL GAME. STOP ASKING ABOUT NEXT ONE NUBS.-Beautiful city and detail. Huge area to explore and utilize movement choices. Cons: -Too much Batmobile♥♥♥♥♥♥ WAY TOO MUCH. Just please Rocksteady. I know the nerds were ♥♥♥♥♥ing but you didn't have to go this far.-Boss fights are boring. Seriously. The important ones are mostly Batmobile fights. No melee fights. Batman Arkham Origins wins in terms of best boss fights.-The game still needs more work and performance adjustments. I'm dropping to 30 fps sometimes.-There are bugs that will mess up the mission and you have to restart from checkpoint. Like thugs/militia teleported into the ground or building thus not letting you progress.-Horribly optimized still. Normal textures requires at least 3gb of Vram. That is just hilarious. It's not even GTA V.-The game just doesn't look clear. Turning off film grain doesn't even help. The game still needs visual help compared to its gameplay trailer.Anyways, I hope Rocksteady does release more updates. They are probably just busy pumping out more dlcs right now for it. Or Warner Bros is.			"

												Still terrible. It seems the pc version of this game will never truly be fixed. If you're running a top-of-the-line system, you might find this playable (although that's not a guarantee) but otherwise you should stay away for performance reasons alone. Even if you get things running smoothly, it's still not a very good game. The story is...fine. Incredibly predictable, but fine. If you've read even a few issues of Batman published within the last decade you're going to know exactly who the Arkham Knight is the moment you meet him. There's also just way too much going on. In addition to the core story missions, there is a glut of repeatable side missions that focus on different members of Batman's Rouges Gallery. The problem is that once you've played one kind of these missions, there's no reason to play any more of them except for completion's sake. All the penguin missions are identical, as are all the Two Face missions, as are all the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Riddler Races, etc, etc. Which brings me to the biggest problem in this game, one you doubtlessly know about, the batmobile. It sucks. It's completely antithetical to what the rest of the game tries to offer, and it's forced upon you again and again. Why would anyone who enjoys the satisfying, rhythm-based combat or the puzzle-like, predator sections want to play Missile Command with tanks? It's boring and feels like a tax you're obliged to pay to access any of the fun stuff. It's also weirdly tied to the Arkham Knight, so it makes me resent his inclusion in the game even more. Wanna go fight Scarecrow's goons? Too bad, you gotta make it through 5 waves of Arkham Knight tank-faff first. What's more, by being so watered-down the fun stuff isn't even that fun any more. The combat is pretty much the same that it's always been (although the few sections you get to team up with another member of the bat family, wherein you may execute cool team takedowns, are pretty fun), and there are so few predator sections (which were my favorite part of the series) that the game doesn't feel like it has room to experiment much with them. Don't even get me started on the Riddler garbage (too late!). In Asylum, the Riddler stuff was essentially a bunch of fun extras that led to a really cool secret. City was a bit more ambitious but it was all fairly do-able. In Arkham Knight there are over 240 of those ♥♥♥♥ers, not to mention awful races where you'll blow up the batmobile umpteen times trying to memorize patterns in a lethal (yet somehow hideously dull) car-based version of Simon Says. And they use this♥♥♥♥♥♥to gate the real ending of the game. That's right, if you want the conclusion to this pile of dross you're going to have to sift through a whole lot of it. In summary, Arkham Knight is a mess. Even without the technical issues, it's still an overstuffed game where all the good bits are suffocated under the sagging, bloated flesh of bad mechanics and repetitive design. Please don't buy it.			"

												Having 100% the game, I think it was a swell time. Opinions are split on the use of the Batmobile, but people clammored for it for years and then when they got what they wanted, it turns out it wasn't what they wanted. It's quite silly. There's a nice balance between playing as Batman and using the Batmobile, though the devs did want to give the Batmobile a time in the spotlight.I've only played the game way past the original release disaster, and even when buying it on sale I was worried the game would just crash left and right. But I've installed it on my SSD and had 16 GB RAM - everything was fine, sans the occasional bug. Even then, sometimes the game had mild cases of pop-in, but nothing show-stopping.It's definitely worth giving the game a chance now if you've been on the fence.			"

												So apparently this game now requires 12GB of RAM. I fail to understand why a game such as this requires so much RAM. Furthermore, one could assume that a company like WB would be able to fix issues FOUR MONTHS after the release date. Nope. It is ridiculous. I personally have played some of the game and while I must admit, the storyline is actually pretty good, the combat is also pretty decent as it always has been as well. The main issues are the constant stuttering even on the lowest setting. I could play Witcher 3 on max settings, could play Borderlands on max settings, could play Skyrim on max settings, can't play Batman Arkham Knight on lowest settings.			"

												Is an incredible game, easily on par with rocksteady's previous two games, and a batmobile which you will spend half the game in (But quite frankly, surely you have had enough of gliding and grappling everywhere in the other games... At least it is change, however it can get extremely repetitive) Lots of side missions and the riddlers section has gotten alot of love, the race tracks are a welcome change of pace from the main game. But core Arkham gameplay has remained true to the last 3 games, with just a couple of new features here and there, like the ability to throw batarangs while gliding.Am keeping the Not Recommended rating just to send a message so that broken PC ports should never happen again upon release. Additionally where is everyone's DLC that they have paid for?Original Review:Steer Clear for now, regardless of your PC's specs, you will experience issues 99% of the time.			"

												The game clearly has memory mismatching issues. The developers decided that this isn't their problem and have put in their October 28th patchnotes that the game runs ""fine"" on a Windows 10 system with more than 12 gigs of RAM.That's a fancy way of putting ""Not our problem, buy more RAM""EDIT 10/29: ""Many people have taken note of our system RAM recommendation for Windows 10. We have run detailed performance tests on a variety of systems, and in doing so have found that memory usage and management on Windows 10 simply behaves very differently from Windows 7 and Windows 8, most notably with page file compression. Hence, our recommendation for Windows 10 users if this issue is encountered. On a related note, we recommend that the Windows page file remains enabled on all operating systems. "" I have so many triple A games from before Arkham Knight was released that play friendly with Windows 10 without needing 12 gigs of RAM, that i can hardly believe they can just sit there and say it's Windows 10's fault.

												The game still stutters profusely and runs like♥♥♥♥♥after two main patches, the latter of which did NOTHING at all to improve the performance! You need TWELVE gigs of RAM to get this game running smoothly on Windows 10 - yes TWELVE - and FOUR gigs of VRAM just to play the damn thing on normal textures, and even with 3GB it's a damn struggle to get this game working smoothly even on LOW! But that's not all - there's been no compensation for anyone who bought the season pass either and those that have been loyal to this damn series are being offered copies of games they've already paid for as faux-compensation.

												I've waited patiently for four months, but this game still simply doesn't work. I have a pretty decent rig - 16GB RAM, i4770k, 2xGTX 770 in SLI, and the game installed on an SSD, and I can't run the game at a tolerable framerate even when I bust the resolution down to 900p (which is quite an insult). Stuttering, tearing, sync issues - there's been no improvement since at least the September patch. I've been a PC gamer for 30 years and this is arguably the worst release I've seen since BattleCruiser 3000AD from a stability standpoint, considering the amount of time they've had to fix it up.WB, you've lost a customer for good.

												I will have this review split into 2 sections. One on the game itself and the other on the current state of the PC versions.So the final part in the Batman Arkham series and I can honestly say its an amazing way to end a very loved series. The game is a true love letter to anybody that is familar with the Dark Knight and has some references from some of his most memorable moments in history.Gameplay: This Arkham game has the most in depth combat system with everything you've known from the previous games and adds a lot more. To be honest it has gotten more difficult since it has more enemy varieties that keeps you on your toes to not mess up your combo. Same goes for the stealth sections which adds more features so you can experiment how you can take down your enemies. The Batmobile has be a mixed bag for everybody, IMO its fun. For the first few missions the Batmobile does feel like its been shoved in there especially the Riddler challenges but its still fun to use and you can also upgrade it. Whats new with the AR challenges is they include challenges for the Batmobile which can be racing tracks or combat and they aren't as good as the rest of the challenges IMO. The open-world aspect of the game has the most collectibles and side missions than the previous games. Story: Being the final part in the Arkham series, the story is amazing and has a really good and honestly a sad ending... But the story is told really well and references some of Batman's greatest moments from his comic books and is shown off very well. After like 20% through the main story you will come across a bit of a shocking twist with someone making a comeback... which I won't spoil! I would say this has the best story out of the whole series, just passing Arkham City and you will be amazed by the ending.Conclusion: Batman Arkham Knight is a great ending to one of the best video game series of all time and your a big fan of anything related to Batman you will have an amazing experience with this game. Combat is a lot of fun as well as the Batmobile which may be different for a some people but regardless I had an amazing time with this game.Rating: 9/10Now I will talk about the most controversial topic about this game... the PC port issues which I'm sure you all have heard about.When this game came out last year it was dubbed one of the worst PC ports of all time and they were right about that. The game would crash, capped at 30 FPS, broken textures, etc... So right now I can safely say that this game is fixed... but only if you have a 4GB graphics card. As I look at some videos everyone is saying the game runs fine as long as you have a lot of video memory on your GPU and if you have less than 4GB you probably won't have a great time. But for me running the game on 2x 980 Ti the game ran very good, it had some stuttering but 90% of the time it ran smooth and 90 FPS and didn't crash once for me. So take these notes as a warning before you purchase this game to see if your system will run the game well!			"

												While no doubt a controversial PC release, most, if not all, of the technical issues this game launched with have been well ironed out at this point. And outside of that I'd dare to say that Arkham Knight, while maybe not as exciting as previous titles in the series, is a great game. As far as gameplay goes, the freeflow combat system is still an incredibly fun and satisfying gameplay system to battle with, and the predator encounters are still tense and engaging. But both of these systems lack the shine they once had when the series first began all those years ago due to general franchise fatigue. But I can't imagine any way to make any real groundbreaking improvments on either front. The introduction of a playable batmobile seems to have been an attempt to battle this fatigue, and in some respects it succeeds. I found it exhilarating to race through the streets, chasing down enemies and completing races. But while they are fun at the start, on the whole the tank battles sections are not varied or complex enough to be very engaging. There is also an extremely dissappointing absence of interesting boss fights, which the series has lauded for in past titles. Almost every boss encounter is a slight variation of either the freeflow, predator, or tank battles systems. The legendary setting of Gotham City has also never been more detailed and full of life though. And not only in any other game, but also any other medium. It is an absolute blast to glide around Gotham and appreciate all the care and detail that was put into its construction. But the lack of complex interior environments is a dissapointment.The game's story is maybe its most impressive feat, and is anchored by a miriad of outstanding performances. The pacing is outstanding with each story beat being followed by an even better one. It has such an incredibly strong start, which it confidently builds on until the very end. Never before has there been such an enthralling narrative that successfully delves into Batman's mental and emotional psyche. But with that being said, my biggest complaint (in terms of both the story and entire game) is that many iconic Batman villians are given a bit of the short stick in their side missions. Characters that have dense wonderful stories in the comics; like Hush, Deacon Blackfire, and Ra's al Ghul; are quickly and unceremoniously rushed out the door in an obvious attempt to ties up all the series' loose ends. And while I consider this a true travesty, I'll still confidently say that Batman Arkham Knight is a great game.			"

												It's been one year since I wrote my first review (which has been promptly deleted). I refunded this game after finding out the abysmal compensation WB was giving us. I have just re-bought it during the Steam Summer 2016 sale, along with many others who refunded. And like those many others, I am not disappointed. The game runs smooth, graphics are fine, not to mention I can finally play this again with that free-roam mod. So if your computer can handle this game, it's worth picking up, now that it is fixed up. My favorite Arkham plot is still Arkham City. However, I find it difficult to play that again, because I am so in love with the combat and gameplay of this game. Atmosphere of Asylum was still the best too, but overall, this is my favorite Arkham game. 9.5/10 for me and, again, definitely worth picking up.			"

Performance wise this game is now well optimised and the nvidia settings may cause some frame drops if you turn that off the game will run very well. I got 60fps most of the time on GTX 950 with everything on high except textures due to vram limitation and nvidia gameworks on except for smoke and debris.The game looks stunning, no matter what the settings are.The story in this game, I liked it, rarely a game keeps me interested till the end and damn the riddler.

First contact: well, this is a disaster.Preordered the game, then one month later I bought a GTX 980 to meet the ""ULTRA"" requirements, and got another copy of the game. Then the game released, and I found myself with 2 copies of the same crap.The game ran incredibly bad, no matter the options I changed, but I kept playing, even with the unbelievable framedrops, because I love Batman. I couldn't stop myself from playing just from my sheer love of the Arkham saga. At least until... near the end of the main story, during a cinematic, the game completely crashed on me, while using 6GB of RAM. I finally decided to stop and wait for a patch before making a review.Fast forward to September, the first interim patch is released.Does the game run better? Yes, it does. Are there still framedrops? There are, specially with the batmobile (they drop even below 30). Can you run the game on max with everything on? No. Interactive fog makes the fps drop below 40, no matter how much I lower the other options like texture quality, shadows, etc. Do I meet the ultra requirements? I do. Will I preorder another game from WB or Rocksteady? Never.I love the story, the new moves, the voice acting, all of it, but... they took months to improve the performance of a game that was released in a sorry state (and failed to meet the August patch release schedule), and still can't make it work properly for a PC that meets the ultra specs. Way to end the franchise. Congratulations, Rocksteady and Warner.28th of October patch arrived, and nothing changed from September. "

												Don't normally rate games. Had to just this once.The negative sentiment here is not unwarranted. The game is unplayable in its current iteration.The game has severe framerate issues, frames are often displayed for over 30 seconds as if you are watching a powerpoint lecture. The game also has pitiful configuration options available, textures have two settings ""Low"" and ""Normal"", if there was an AntiAliasing option available I didn't see it, or it was a simplistic on/off function like every other setting (and the game is in desperate need of more anti aliasing). There are also significant texture streaming issues, with highly compressed textures flaunting themselves shamelessly in otherwise pristine settings.The game can look beautiful at times. The good news is the 1 frame per 30 second average will let you appretiate how beatiful the scenery is.			"

People who have bought this game and with season pass haven't been compensated or given a proper apology.They expect people who bought the season pass for AK to not have any of the previous Arkham games? Still a Batmobile heavy game, which makes it the worst Arkham game out of the four, with the worst Boss fights out of all the games just coz of the priority given to the Batmobile.IMO, in terms of the story and pacing,  Arkham Asylum> Arkham Origins > Arkham City > Arkham Knight.It is a good game , but I wouldn't recommend buying it for full price and reward WB games for their shinanigans on the PC market. Probably should wait for it to go on sale. "

												This game is another prime example why video games are superior to all other forms for media out there.Recommended for everyone interested in a solid batman experience, yes, even the fans who say ""its obvious who the Arkham Knight is"". Elephant in the room: PC port. I can tell you what i know from two systems.Before i do that, I'd like to say 2 things:1- i'd like to dis some people. Each outlet going out of there way to report the bad news to get clickity clicks and never ever cared about the PC gamer who just wants to enjoy a batman game. Since then, we never heard from them... CAN WE ACTUALLY PLAY THE MOTHER EFFING GAME ?  Certainly they're not reporting on it. There is something somewhere that needs to be overhyped.2- There hasn't been an update or patches recently. Latest is March 8th 2016 according to steam, but the link is broken on WB's site. You are buying this game ""AS IS"". Make sure you refund it within two hours if you can't run it.AMD System [FX 6300, R7 370 2GB, 12GB RAM and 30 FPS lock on lowest settings] -> the game sustains a solid 30fps on 1080p and doesn't look bad at all on lowest settings. Dips and pops are present, especially if you're traversing the world quickly.MSI GT62VR 6RE Dominator Pro [i7 6700HQ, GTX 1070, 32GB RAM, Gsync enabled on 1080p 60hz monitor] -> sustains solid 60 FPS throughout on max settings with Nvidia features enabled and only dips when the camera moves for a pre-scripted scene.All tested on Windows 10 64bit with latest drivers and updates as of December 2016. The game is most certainly playable without the need of bruteforcing with the ""latest and greatest"" hardware. Still has some issues.  Will NOT get anymore patches or updates.   Friendly reminder,Pre-ordering in video games means paying most to get the crappiest form of the product =)  "

One more night in the whole of Gotham City. From the first 5 minutes you can tell this is a different Arkham game. It's bigger in scope, yet the story is more personal. Characters are at their best or worst and Batman seems to oscillate between the two. Fighting is same old Arkham one, however it's been improved with new precise and brutal move-sets.  In predator mode you can take advantage of enemies fears and take up to 5 in 5 epic moves. For the first time, the batmobile is available, as a means to destroy buildings while driving or take out an army of drones. While it was designed to blend into game's events, sometimes it feels like the game blends into the Batmobile. The challenge room is equipped with multiple players, some of them even being villains from the main game, all of them having different combat styles and the maps that are available are consistent. If one wants more, there's plenty of DLCs to satisfy even the biggest appetite. With all it's features, the logical conclusion would be to call Arkham Knight the best game out of Rocksteady's Trilogy. Yet there's something more to talk about....This time around, Joker's dead but lives on through the people who he traumatized. Scarecrow and the new Arkham Knight are bent on taking down Batman for good, not as a man but as a legend. The other villains either decide to ignore Batman, not being a threat much longer or just want their piece of him while they can(Riddler is even more deranged).  With  new moves, tech and an unexpected game-changer, Batman finds himself attacked on different levels, putting up a good fight and yet he keeps sliding downhill. All characters and elements have a sense of finality in them. It's obvious they're all going for a change and it all depends on what happens with the legend of the Dark Knight.

The new villain, Arkham Knight, isn't as ""new"" as someone who reads comics might expect. He knows everything he needs to know about Batman in order to be a serious threat to him and his allies. Out of all villains, he's the one that hits Batman where it hurts most. But when he's taking the mask off, he's the villain that needs a hug. Scarecrow, despite looking more menacing and undergoing a more fatalist mission, is just as vulnerable as before. Truth be told, it's the villains in the side-quests that are more fleshed out and add to the Gotham dynamic. The Batmobile is as awesome as it looks, going fast though destructible environments and having a battle-mode which has it's own upgrades. However, the times it's used can be tiresome and provided you won't enjoy as much as other can kill the mood to play this game, as there are some challenging sections in the main storyline that consists of taking the Batmobile into battle. Through some points in the storyline and some side-quests there's some detective work included, which is handled somewhat better than Arkham Origins and sadly, there's not enough of that. Aside from seeing Riddler's machinations everywhere in the city, there's a militia that can be taken down through several ways, cleaning down the areas resulting in a safer Gotham City.

A nice feature this game also has is the photo-mode, which ensured that the screenshot section of the community hub looks as good if not better than the artwork section. Being able to edit the light and exposure, change camera angles, depth of field, having some graphic assets and filters good enough to inspire graphic designers is an invitation to capture certain events or places in Gotham the way you see it or view&capture it through different angles. It can be just as thrilling as being the photographer in a photo-shoot.  A lengthy campaign, plenty of side-quests that are a must-do, new game plus and the challenge rooms, which involve the biggest number of characters in the Arkham series + some racetracks for the Batmobiles, which has different skins: indulging in all of that made me stick around for almost 70 hours, the most I've spent in a Batman game and almost any game, as I'm a guy on a tight schedule. It's a high class game in every department. Performance issues are a thing of the past for most players. Previous games made you feel like you're Batman. This one makes you feel like you're more than that.  "

												PSA: Do not buy this game, The performance issues make the game near unplayable. It's sad to have to say this. I will continue to play the game for review, but for everyone else wait for a patch or get a refund. :(

			This is a PSA for Batman: Arkham Knight. The game runs very poorly on both AMD and Nvidia based systems. Please avoid this game until it is fixed.		

I will update this once I have completed my full review or after it's fixed, which ever comes first.			"

												You may notice at the top of the page that the Overall Reviews are Mixed but the recent reviews are Overwhelminhly Positive. At first, I thought this was a joke the internet was playing, like how the Cory in the House DS game has a 9.5 user score on Metacritic, but then I read some of the reviews and some forum posts and saw that people are saying the game is playable now. So, I picked this game up cheap (the game's reputation has lowered its price on third party stores) and I played it. Let me tell you, it was definitely worth it. Is the game playable? Yes. Is it well optimized now? Oh God no. There was a lot of stuttering when I first loaded up the game, or when I go to new areas in the open world. But, I'm a patient man so I was able to deal with it. It should be noted that I have a 4 year old card so some of the higher end GPUs will probably have better performances. Other than that, the only other bugs I encountered were small texture bugs. I never experienced any game breaking bugs. Now on to the actual game. How is it? Well, my recommendation should tell you that I very much enjoyed the game. I think it's the best in the series (which is not an opinion shared by many). I felt the story was extremely well done. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that the other Arkham games were really focused on the plot and the supervillians that Batman goes up against, but this game really explores Batman himself as a character. Again, some people were a bit disappointed by the story, especially with the reveal of the Arkham Knight, but I was fine with it. I was never a die-hard Batman comic book fan so I don't share the same point of view as those people. The gameplay is where the game really shines. I loved everything about it. Even the Batmobile. I had a lot of fun driving around Gotham. At first, the driving controls felt really wonky, but once I got used to it, it felt really great. Now the tank mode. A lot of people hated it, but I found it very enjoyable. You can probably notice a trend here...How about the ground combat? They improved nearly everything from AC. No longer can you ""spam Y to win"". They have added many new enemies into the game, such as electricty covered enemies and medics, that require you to change up your tactics. There is also a ""Fear Takedown"" ability that allows you to take out multiple enemies in one go without the enemy being able to react, which helps makes Predator Mode faster and more enjoyable. Finally, when travelling around the city, it is mostly unchanged, but they did buff the grapple boost since the city is MUCH bigger this time around. This game is a great conclusion to the trilogy. The story is very well done (but the ending was a bit weak), the presentation is godly (well, when everything is working properly), the gameplay is the best it has ever been, and the music OH THE MUSIC. The PC version is playable now and you can get it for cheap during a Steam Sale or on a third party site. If you are a fan of the Arkham series, you should get this game. If you are new, play AC first, then come to this.			"

												I'd love to give this game a good review, because the small amount of actual gameplay I've seen has been good thus far. I can't, though. Performance is horrendeous! I have a Titan X paired with an i7 5930K and 32GB DDR4 RAM. After fiddling with the setting:At Max settings: It has a baseline of 60FPS, but with erratic dips into as low as the 30s for no apparent reason while gliding and even worse drops at Batmobile sequences. GPU usage hovers around 65%.At the LOWEST settings: And this is where I get angry, the SAME thing. Baseline of 60FPS with the SAME s♥♥♥♥♥tic drops. GPU usage hovers around 50%.What that tells me is that the devs actually succeeded in screwing up the implementation of the very stable Unreal Engine. If console performance is good, then it proves that they gave NO THOUGHT to PC gamers and just did a barebones port with no optimization. And if the console performance is also bad, then the developer just sucks, period.Even the way they went about realizing that there were very serious AMD performance issues: It's like someone on the Dev team booted up the game on launch day on their home computer with an AMD card and went: ""Oh my God, it doesn't work!"" This means they did NO testing, period. If they had just booted it up on a PC they would have seen these issues, even with top end hardware.Or even worse: they knew about the issues and just didn't give a crap. They knew pre-orders would flow and their money would be made. Well, Steam has refunds now, so maybe this is a good way to teach the company a lesson.			"

												Game is still broken for many, I don't believe Rocksteady/WB did anyting to fix the game in the past 4 months other than stare at the wall and hope Batman himself would swoop on in and fix it. Furthermore no Sli or crossfire support?? needing 12GB of ram and restarting regularly ? this is beyond incompetent is this what the future of Triple A gaming has come to release broken games and run off with the money NEVER AGAIN Rocksteady/WB Offering games many of us most like own as compensation is equally insulting!!

Where are these so called fixes?Perhaps the biggest kick in the teeth is the 'we're sorry' package.  Any Batman fan already owns all the previous games, this seems like a cheap cop out to simply sell more copies of your broken game.  I really hope I can at least gift them to one of the very few people who didnt' pick them up for a few dollars during sales.I can say with full certainly that I NEVER buy aonother WB game.  ♥♥♥♥ you WB, ♥♥♥♥ you in a fire.

Despite all the negative publicity at launch, Batman Arkham Knight is a solid entry in the Arkham series that deserves a second look. [8/10]The Good:the most beautiful Gotham City created in gaming so far;built-in VRAM usage prediction tool to help tweaking the game's graphical options;good story plot (though at one point the plot armor seems to be thicker than average);Robin's fans will like this game.The Bad:some graphical features are nVidia exclusive.  One of them lags;built-in antialiasing support makes the rain blurry.  For best effect, use DSR;game still suffer occasional (but rare) glitches, like Batman falling through floor;lots of DLC, but only one is worth playing and contributes to the story;Batmobile.  While a refreshing experience on its own, developers appear to over-emphasize its existence in the game.The Ugly:you have to finish all Riddler's challenges to watch the full ending.Bottom line:The Pro's outweight the Con's.  Give it a try when it's on sales.			"

Had to go through all the trouble tweaking the graphics to at least being playable. For now i would not recommend buying. Its just dreadfully awful. Seriously, it really pains me to see such a loved game turned horribly wrong. Its beginning to look like a trend. Thank god for steam refund policy but i wont do that because i just love batman. I really do. But in the future i promise myself this wont happen ever again			"

												BATMAN A 2015 AAA Game?A=Alienating, A= Apathetic, A= A$$holes.I bought this game after hearing all the Hype from both WB and NVIDIA.The release date and reviews did not mention any graphical driver related problems.I feel betrayed as they have been silent after pulling the game and they have not given any explanation that makes any sense. They have not taken responcibility trying to dump all the blame on another dev studio.There would have been bosses looking into the progress of the PC version too.Also there was an NVIDIA team working on the game this means they too have kept quiet as they must have known it wasn't ready.I have read in reviews that there are some nice effcts running on the AMD hardware console version for PS4.I expect to see them also on my AMD Graphics card as they were shown in the advertising though I won't be holding my breath.NVIDIA have sold this game with £300+ Graphics cards so to all those saying they aren't so miffed as they got it for free? Really? you payed for the game with the card albeit subsidised by NVIDIA somewhat.NVIDIA have had this game on their Promotional mateirial for ages and this will hurt them in a big way again.I wonder if anyone has attempted to return their Graphics card with the game out of complete distrust towards NVIDIA as the game they advertised was clearly different to the retail product.You can not lawfully sell something that isn't as described that is a criminal offence.This is why they pulled the game to try any soften the legal blow. In my opinion the deception towards the customers and then taking their money should become a criminal investigation as this needs to STOP RIGHT NOW.If they knew they would be prosecuted at court and fined huge amounts they would end this con immediately.I would also like to know if STEAM have tested the game prior to allowing it for sale as they should check the game themselves as they too have been advertising it for ages to release it broken and then pull it from sale straight after?Stop treating PC Gamers like were idiots, we will not take this any longer.

												Confirmed. The game is unplayable. Horrible performance with Iron which is able to run Witcher 3 with almost all graphics settings on high (or better) without any issues.Feeling so sad. Really want to play with Bats more and enjoy another Arkham story, but unfortunately I'm not able to like many others. That's why I can't recommend this game now and I'm not sure if I ever do that in the future after patches. Just one question to devs, WHY?!Disappointment of the year.EDIT:After a couple of hours spended by editing the main config file and testing, I'm able to play on the lowest settings. Although less, it's still horrible.

												Arkham Knight's PC version fixed, I highly recommend it, I get the occasional bug such as getting no sound once in a while but it runs great on the GTX 980 Ti.Here's what I enjoy so far:It's an incredibly fun game that I'm gonna play for a long time.The combat is excellent and smooth, it may take you a while to get used to the combos/special combo key bindings, my friend played with a controller but I'm using Keyboard and Mouse.The Bat Mobile is super smooth and comfortalbe while driving or in Battle Mode where you're a drone killing machine.Gotham looks phenomenal, If you like taking screenshots you're gonna take a lot like I will.With DLC, you'll get many AR Challenges, Costumes, Expansions for various characters, More villains to hunt down for Gotham's Most Wanted, etc. I highly reccommend the Premium Edition while it's on sale since you will get loads of content.Less Riddler Trophies since they were a nightmare to collect on Arkham CityAnd of course, you're Batman so that's a win already.

												Batman: Arkham Knight offers high production values, a huge Gotham to explore, and a return of the hard-hitting, gadget-centric combat that Arkham fans love. The story, however, focuses too much on the pathetic Arkham Knight, a paper-thin character whose menace is all empty gestures. Add in poorly designed boss battles, and a forced collect-a-thon in order to see the full ending of the game, and Arkham Knight earns its mixed reputation. Recommended for franchise fans, but be prepared to like and dislike it in equal measure.Total size on my hard drive (with all DLC): 55.4 GB  (yes, fifty-five point four gigabytes)+ The graphics are stunning. Even if you have to play with the settings on low as I did, Arkham Knight is one of the most visually appealing games I’ve ever seen. Facial animations are equally impressive.+ Some awe-inspiring set-pieces and alterations to the landscape that happen as the game progresses. Can’t say more without spoiling it.+ Gotham is amazingly detailed. Dust, neon lights, crumbling brick and shiny steel. Simply fantastic.+ Most of the voice-acting regulars return, led by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill.+ Most of the major villains make an appearance, and some get interesting send-offs (Mr. Freeze was my favorite). Some even get a shot at redemption.+ Scarecrow’s toxin. It’s used very creatively. Can’t say more without spoiling the story.+ Mob combat is as awesome as ever. This is the fully-powered version of Batman who has access to all of his gadgets.+ Incredible variety and thoughtful design in the Predator Encounters (where Batman has to sneak around a room, taking out guards one-by-one).+ The team-up mechanic that allows for switching from Batman to a partner and back works well. It was very cool to go on missions with Robin, Nightwing or Catwoman.+ A lot of care and attention clearly went into the challenge maps. There are a lot to choose from.+ Lots of skins. Want Batman to dress up in the classic 1989 outfit (with the car to match)? Or perhaps the Batman Beyond outfit? He can. There are many more, as well as some alternate skins for Robin, Nightwing, and yes, Catwoman.+/- Too much Arkham Knight, not enough Scarecrow. +/- I was expecting Scarecrow to sound the way he did in Arkham Asylum. He doesn’t. He hits the same tones as Hugo Strange (nothing against the Strange voice). And why did Rocksteady re-cast the voice of Barbara Gordon / Oracle? The new voice (Ashley Greene) is all right, but I missed Kimberly Brooks.+/- The soundtrack lacks the heroic feel of the Arkham City and Arkham Origins soundtracks, but is absolutely beautiful in the calm / slow / sad sections.+/- The Arkham games have always had complicated control schemes. Arkham Knight takes the complexity to a new level. That’s good news for franchise veterans, bad news for newbies.+/- Optimization. After a disastrous launch on PC that was plagued with bugs, Arkham Knight ran well enough on my low-end gaming system (Core i5-4590 + 2GB R7 260X).

- You’ve heard there’s too much Batmobile. Well, there’s too much Batmobile. Sometimes it feels more like a Saints Row 3 tank rampage than Batman. Sad part is, Rocksteady was clearly so proud of their work on the Batmobile that they tried to incorporate it into as many parts of the game as possible.- You have to collect all 200+ Riddler trophies to unlock the complete ending. At least it’s not DLC, but still, this is bull.- The Arkham Knight is one of the weakest, most pathetic antagonists in a Batman game. His unmasking has no tension. And you actually have to fight him as a boss three times: twice in the Batmobile (awful), and once in a predator encounter (decent, but not a real boss battle). There’s much I could say about the Arkham Knight, but all of it would spoil the game in a BIG way. He is simply an awful character. - Bosses in general are disappointing. After the epic boss battles provided by Arkham Origins (admittedly by a different studio), this is a massive disappointment. For instance, even if you hated Deathstroke’s boss battle in Arkham Origins as a collection of QTEs, at least he and Batman fought mano y mano. The Deathstroke boss battle in Arkham Knight is – DRUMROLL – another tank battle. That’s right,  the greatest hand-to-hand combatants in the Batverse fight with tanks. Rocksteady’s lack of inspiration (or will?) to craft interesting boss battles was never more apparent than in Arkham Knight.- Have a controller nearby. Some of mini-games are incredibly frustrating with a mouse + keyboard.- Combat targeting is poor. “I’ll just use the bat-grapple to whip that gun out of his hands… No, not that guy, THAT guy!” Also some occasional input delay.- Much harder to achieve a smooth, continuous combo. Combat now REQUIRES the use of awkward key combinations to put together a successful string of attacks. And the whole ""climb up the riot shield"" for an over-head attack is as wonky as ever; Batman is as likely to flip over the target as he is to do an aerial attack. Add in the poor targeting mentioned above, and combat can become very frustrating to even experienced users.- A large part of the story hinges on Batman suffering from the after-effects of being infected with Joker’s blood in Arkham City. But… Batman found the cure for that, didn’t he? Apparently that wasn’t really a cure. Rocksteady just couldn’t make a Batman game without the Joker. The Batman Arkham games are some of my favorites, and while I enjoyed my time in Arkham Knight, I’m incredibly frustrated by the fact that it gets as many things wrong as it gets right. A good game as it stands, and if you’re just looking for more Batman, this game will satisfy. But Arkham Knight had the potential to be a “game for the ages” instead of “just another Batman game.” Rocksteady clearly loves the Batman universe, but it’s time for them to move on (and from their own statements, this will indeed be their last Batman game). Thanks for the memories, Rocksteady.			"

												If you've played  and enjoyed previous games in the series, it seems obvious you'd enjoy Arkham Knight. Since the PC performance issues have been mainly ironed out, Arkham Knight has become a worthy addition to the series. Combat: 8/10Pros: -Same tight combat as the previous Arkham games-New enemies-New characters and items to experiment with-New combo abilitiesCons:-Combat can become stale by the end of the game, especially if you've put a lot of hours into the previous entries in the series-Combat challenges start to feel grindy after a whileStealth: 8/10Pros: -Same stealth as the previous games-New, larger areas to perform stealth missions in -New abilities to terrorize and take out enemies-Stealth challenges have interesting (if occasionally very difficult) bonus challengesCons:-Some of the non-Batman characters can make stealth tedious because they lack a majority of his abilities (which could be a pro if you like those kind of challenges)The World: 7/10Pros:-A new map to explore (refreshing if you were frustrated by the tedium between City and Origins)-More Batman lore to come across-The Batmobile is fun...for a time-Lots of sidequests and collectibles (could be a con if that causes you anxiety as a dedicated completionist)-More villains to interact with than any other Arkham gameCons:-The Riddler sidequest in particular can become very tedious.-The Batmobile becomes tedious after a while. I tended to traverse the world as Batman, especially after the Batmobile is awkwardly made compulsory in a few big sidequests. -[SPOILERS] The final Deathstroke sidequest in particular feels like a copy pasted version of a main story boss. Especially insulting considering the Deathstroke fight in Origins. -Some of the sidequests attempt to wrap up loose ends from previous games in a messy, unsatisfying way. The Story: 7/10Pros: -A conclusion to the Arkham story-Returning characters and villains are a treatCons:-Some of the plot twists aren't surprising-Scarecrow feels overshadowed by the Arkham Knight, much like Hugo Strange and Ra'as al Ghul in City. Performance:Pros:-It's been fixed significantly since launch-Mostly consistent 60 fpsCons:-FPS drops in busy areas-The cape seems to cause some issues with particle effectsMy PC: Nvidia GTX 9708 GB RAMIntel i5 4960K @ 3.50 GHz			"

												Worst PC port I have ever played to the extent that I would call it a scam.1.  Game looks like garbage and has a jokingly small amount of graphical tweaking options that do NOT make it look better.2.  Game runs like trash with massive random fps drops and stuttering, even on pretty good machines.3.  FPS capped at 30 with reports that ini file edits screw up physics and cause bodies to float.4.  No way to turn off the enormous amount of motion blurr with reports that changing ini causes massive crashing.5.  No slider to change mouse sensitivty fixing it at a huge amount of sens.All of this is WITH the new Nvidia drivers AND the worthless day 1 patch.Get your refunds now.  Vote with your wallets and show this company what happens to their PC revenue when they scam us like this.  Because honestly they didn't spend a penny on this port anyway.			"

												Welcome to the horrible future of gaming. As usual, games are still being shipped broken/unoptimized. The 2nd video game crash since before the NES is coming. You all heard it here folks.Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.I'm running current drivers for GTX 970 and there is still stuttering. If you change the fps lock from 30 fps, the stuttering worsens. This feels like a watered down console port. Made to sate the egotistical console gamers and give them the satisfaction of having the ""superior"" version of the game.Wait a few days from release date or until they can patch the game and fix it.What makes this even more of a spit in the face of PC players is that the devs ask us to tone down our graphics settings so that their crap game can look even crappier while running less crappy.No quality control for a PC port that was advertised as being the best on an Nvidia machine. People pre-ordered this game for $60 and payed over $100 for a ""premium"" season pass bundle. The game is broken on release. Sickening.			"

												I can't honestly recommend this game. It's not a bad game - far from it. It's very well put together. The graphics are beautiful, the controls are polished, and the overall production is top notch. If wanted a prettier Arkham game with all the dials turned to 11, this is it.Plot wise, it's a bland mish-mash of multiple graphic novels -- I won't mention them here as not to spoil it, but somehow, Arkham Knight manages to muddle them together into something resembling a plot. There's a lot of other Batman references/characters inserted into the game, too, which also winds up being a confused mess. You'll complete a major plot point only to have Alfred pop up and tell you that the Riddler/Manbat/Two Face/Azrael/Mad Hatter (who for all intents and purposes is a better dressed Riddler)/Flying fire boy are up to no good and need to be taken care of. Gameplay-wise.... Batmobile, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batmobile. You spend about a third of the game inside of it, and it's not bad... but after a few missions it simply stops being fun and becomes another chore for you to finish before you can get to the good parts. Grappling through the city, fighting mooks, and sneaking around are where the series shines, and replacing that gameplay with 'just ok' tank/driving sections was a poor design decision. Combat is the same old Arkham Combat, complete with the annoying shield/knife/electrified enemies. Things get interesting when you get to play as other characters, but opportunities to do so are rare and are over far too soon. If you loved Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, and you really want more of the same thing, Knight is a good bet. There's a lot for fans of the character and the game series in here. Otherwise, it's just a mix villians  and random missions loosely held together by a muddled plot and really hurt by repetitive and boring vehicle combat.			"

A bad reception.People give Arkham Knight allot of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And I understand this because I know Arkham Knight had possibly one of the worst launches of all time, Rocksteady out-sourced the PC port of this game to a cheap and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Chinese company who had no passion for the game and only cared about meeting the crteria of being able to launch the game on a PC so they could make their pay-check.As Shigeru Miyamoto said: ""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.""This was the reason for Arkham Knights not-so-welcoming reception on launch, on PC anyway. And why it's still considered a bad game by most.But since it's launch people have neglected Rocksteady's dedication to this game. They didn't leave it in a broken state and cut their losses like many other triple A developers would have (Ubisoft is a perfect example). They worked effortlessly to make this game a true ending to the acclaimed Arkham series, and they have, the game runs perfectly on PC now after many patches since launch, and the DLC they've produced for the game adds many hours worth the couple dollars you spend on it.The DLC debacle.While the DLC was also surrounded by controversy and was very poorly reviewed for being incredibly overpriced at the time of its release, that is certainly not the case anymore. The only complaint about the DLC was the cost - so Rocksteady halfed the cost of the season pass and made the many individual items dirt cheap, while I don't care about $1 cosmetics I do care about the many story packs that were added as DLC, allowing you to play as a whole array of characters including villians such as Red Hood. The DLC wasn't a bad thing - it was just way too expensive when it was introduced and Rocksteady asked allot for very little for a long time, but this is not the case anymore.The Batmobile.When you go through the reviews for this game despite allot of them being negative you will only really find 1 common complaint: the Batmobile was too forced into the game and main story. And I agree, it was too forced into the game, hell the insanly built up boss fight for Deadshot was a tank fight we'd done 3 times before that you can finish in less than a minute with a fully upgraded batmobile, this really annoyed me esspecially after how awesome previous encounters with deadshot were in the other Arkham games. But don't let this fool you into thinking the batmobile is a horrible addition to the game - because the batmobile is next level awesome. It was just way too forced into the story.Give it one more chance to win you over.The game is quite cheap now and the DLC is basically a steal, if you're willing to goto third party websites you can pickup this game for about $5. Come on, for $5 you can just try it, it's the price of a cup of coffee for what might be the best arkham experience you might have; at the very least a great Batman experience.			"

They've released a patch that still hasn't fixed the huge number of frame drops/stuttering 4 months on and they're now saying it requires 12gb RAM because they ♥♥♥♥ed up so badly. As a thank you to everyone who decided to keep their game, WB are giving away free copies of all the Arkham series (Which anyone who already owns AK has probably already played) because they figured it'd be the most insincere, cost-free ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to everyone who bought it. ♥♥♥♥ WB.

												Cannot recommend this game after the botched launch and failure to patch. The game has now been 're-released', tagging all prior reviews as 'pre-release' in an attempt to invalidate negative reviews (The game was around ~40% positive at 're-release', which is almost unheard of), despite the fact that the game was very much released and only pulled after public outcry.Many of the performance issues have NOT been fixed as promised. There is a fairly serious memory leak, and their 'fix' was to tell users 'we’ve found that having at least 12GB of system RAM on a PC allows the game to operate without paging and provides a smoother gameplay experience.' (Windows 10), or 'If you encounter this, simply re-launching the game will resolve the issue.' (Windows 7). Other FPS issues, such as severe rain/batmobile slowdown as well as very clear object pop-in, are still present.WB has issued an 'apology' in the form of free past-Arkham games, but most of the people affected, who bought the game at original launch, or pre-purchased, already own these prior games, as they are fans of the series. It seems more of a simple promotional tool to pull in more new buyers (The 'apology' free pack is for anyone who buys the game for the next couple weeks, in addition to the past), rather than actually compensating those who were affected. New buyers actually get all the same content as pre-purchasers and original launch buyers, while also benefitting from a $10 reduced price.Performance aside, if you're lucky and have the game run well on your machine (it seems to be left to chance whether the game works well or not on any system, high or low end) the game itself is actually very well done and fun. Most of the characters, with the exception of the main antagonist (whose identity is made painfully obvious WELL before the reveal), are written and voiced well, and the different side objectives are mostly fun. The combat is fluid, as you'd expect coming from any of the past games. However, it doesn't add too many new elements. The one big new 'feature' is the batmobile, which should be a fun addition, but is shoehorned into any situation the writers could think of, and turns out to be very boring to use.EDIT: Oh, forgot to mention. One of the optional boss battles, with the Riddler, is locked behind obtaining ***every riddler trophy in the game***. Basically, you do his side questline, which was actually pretty enjoyable, win, and he says 'well, you haven't won until you do ALL my challenges, peace!' and runs away. As someone that likes doing side missions and completing side-arcs, this really bugs me. I'm not willing to run around for hours and hours doing boring little puzzles and 100% the game just to get to a new peice of content/arc closure. I gave up and just watched it on Youtube.===================================================================All in all, with the performance issues, horribly handled launch, poor community support and self-serving 'apology', I can't recommend this game at anywhere near $50. Even if you buy it with a good rig, it seems to be a 50-50 shot whether or not you'll have performance issues that hinder your play. The actual gameplay and story is fun though, so it may be worth taking a risk (or 'demoing' it to test performance, then buying) once it goes on sale for $10-$15.			"

												Performance:Date: November 15th, 2015 (After the game was ""fixed"")i7 3820GTX 660 ti16 GB DDR3 ram7200 rpm HDDEverything set to off/low except anisotropic filtering x16. Getting 25-35 fps average. I know my 660 ti isn't top notch, but I can still run most games on high just fine. So this is disappointingly low performance for such a big AAA game. *Edit: December 30th, 2015 - Another patch has been released and I bought myself an SSD. Mostly solid 30-40 fps, but inside the GCPD its more like 28 because there is so much stuff in there post game. And I get the occasional dip to 28 when there is a lot of destruction going on when I'm in the batmobile. I think my SSD has more to do with the framerate bump than the latest patch though as I've read of others getting big framerate boosts when using an SSD on this game. Its playable now, but only after I bought an SSD, and even on the lowest settings its still a very pretty game. Still going to keep my review as a ""No"" recommendation because its still very poor performance from such a big budget game. They spent more time making dlc then they did fixing their broken game. Do not support this game.=========Story:About the Arkham Knight character being ""an entirely new character"". That is a lie. Its an old character. False advertising.Thomas Wayne narrated a trailer. He is not in the game in any form. Just an FYI in case you got your hopes up about hearing more from him.If they had just done the ""Arkham Knight"" like he was in the comics, the story would have been decent IMO. Not trilogy ending worthy, but decent. But because the marketing flat out lied about Arkham Knight being a new character it completely ruined the reveal and the buildup to the reveal for me. The buildup for the reveal is kinda weak as well, if they had set it up earlier in Asylum or City or even Origins, then it would have worked a hell of a lot better as a trilogy ending. I still would have known what was coming, but at least it would have been set up better.=========Gameplay:The batmobile starts out pretty neat, but the game forces you to tank fight in it WAY too much, especially in the latter half of the game. And not only that but the tank combat rarely ever changes, the minor additions to the combat do nothing to change it up and it becomes a chore every time you hear someone on the comm say tanks incoming. Some of the puzzles where you have to work with your remote controlled batmobile are neat, but then the game forces you to use the batmobile for a majority of the puzzles and it gets tiresome.Predator takedowns (I think thats what they were called) are awesome to look at, but somewhat exploitable if you're half decent at stealth takedowns. And once you upgrade it you can pretty much clear an entire area without even trying. Low risk, high reward gameplay. =========TL:DRIf you can ignore the performance issues, accept a rehashed story, and slog through all the tank combat, then you'll find an average Batman Arkham game. If it ran perfectly I'd probably give it a 7/10.But because it runs so poorly I give it a 4/10			"

												NOTE THE GAME IS STILL UNOPTIMIZED! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!So here are the basics.-They patched the game and re-released it. Yet, the game is still UNOPTIMIZED! I get 60fps on high settings at 3200 by 1800 IN BATTLEFIELD4. This game, I get 30 to 40 when gliding around (or driving real fast) the city at LOW settings at 1080p. What the hell? The game also still suffers from texture rendering issues, although it's been less occuring. Seriously, f(uck) you WB games and F(UCK) YOU ROCKSTEADY!!!!!!-The story sucks, at least the bit about the arkham knight. It was too predictable and the true identity of the arkham knight was a let down; it was waaaaay too predictable. It would have been best if they got rid of the arkham knight and just focused more character development on scarecrow and batman. plus there is a third ""main"" villian in the game, and it was just too much heads for rocksteady to deal with. I recommend you spend your 50 bucks on Phantom Pain, a better game that actual runs well on high and medium end computers. both games have a so-so story though.			"

												Awful performance. First the game is locked to 30 fps by default. Despite Nvidia's website saying it supports SLI, I get absolutely no usage on my second card, unless I dedicate it to PhysX and the performance is still abysmal. There is a serious lack of graphical options, leaving you with texture quality (low and normal), AA (on or off), level of detail (low, normal and high), shadow quality (low, normal and high), and Gameworks options. It seems to completely break RTSS overlay across the numerous games I've tried to use it with, requireing a restart to fix.Glad I played $30 for the ""Premium Edition"" including the season pass from a reseller. Although refunding it would have been a better option. Seriously WTF Rocksteady? I was just bragging about how I trusted you guys, and couldn't wait to see what your next project will be outside of the Batman universe. Well forget that. You have a lot of trust to re-earn.			"

												I wish I could be the batman on release date. Brand New Nvidia 960 w/ new drivers3.2 ghz i5 CPU16 gb of RamBasically way past minimum and mostly past recomended and I could only play past the poison ivy part and introduction to batmobile combat before getting tired of the constant stuttering and inability to even watch cutscenes because it freezes all of the time. Rocksteady better be releasing that patch in a couple of days.This isn't to say the game is bad, but if I can't play the game at all then obviously it has issues that need to be fixed before it gets the review it deserves rather than the one it getsEdit: Still no luck to getting it running smoothly. Been told that the pre-load files may have had something wrong and am currently redownloading. Only problem is for some reason I am only getting around 200 kb/s right now on steam while downloading from other sources is just fine (3 mb/s)2nd and possibly final edit until optimization patch comes out: I am now able to play with everything on the lowest settings and it still suffers from frame rate drops, small amounts of stuttering and audio desyncs during conversations and cut scenes. Other than these known issue it is a very good game. The story and side missions come rather naturally in most cases and the riddler is back to actually giving some riddles rather than small puzzles. The story is great so far with something that throws me completely off guard often. I loved Arkham City and Asylum and this game by far takes the cake for me. I will recommend this game only after the optimization fixes.The heat coming from my computer when playing this game right now also causes my room to become unbearably hot.And the latest issue is randomly the game will seem to alt-tab and whenever I try to re enter it crashes. Only happened twice now within the 7 hour time frame that I have been playing. Minor nuisance since the game autosaves a lot.Honestly it has been too long without another update and the first one still hasn't fixed the terrible preformance.Pros:The game itself is very fun. The batmobile is a great part of the game that helps with puzzles and overall is just a fun way to get around the city. Combat has been expanded with new enemies and the ability to pick up and use weapons. The one thing that will never make sense is why Batman must go out of his way to show boat when he picks up a weapon. He stands there for an extra 3 seconds flipping a bat instead of hitting people with it. The main story was amazing with a twist around the corner everywhere. Cons:Except for the Arkham Knight. That was the worst identity and was obvious who it was from the start (If you are a big Batman fan). Side quests are boring and repetitive. Looking around a alrge city for dead people was fun. Chasing Firefly in the batmobile each and every time was repetetive. Chasing cars for a while and following them to a stash was boring. Finding a mysterious creature and curing it was boring. They were all practically the same. Remember in Arkham City when the bosses were fun too? You don't get that in this game. Come to think of it, there wasn't actually any bosses. The Arkham Knight should have been a great boss fight, but it wasn't at all. It seems like every boss fight in this game either comes down to chasing them all over the place and taking them down or dealing with a bunch of adds and henchmen without actually fighting the boss.Batmobile combat is less than stellar. Shoot unmanned tanks and shoot more tnaks. There are tanks everywhere. Often times it will be 50 to 1 and you have to take them all. Often times I am frustrated by the batmobile combat because there is so much♥♥♥♥♥♥to watch out for and just isn't fun.Ultimately I wanted to like this game. I just can't when the entire game feels like Rocksteady didn't make it except for the story. Along with the fact that it still has not really had any fixes to issues like the stuttering framerate. Yes the game runs. But it also crashes and stutters every now and then.I can not reccomend this game at full price even if they fixed every single optimisation issue. The game is just missing fun bosses, new gadgets, and the only thing really holding the game up is the story.If you really want the game just wait for the GOTY edition at like 20 dollars. IF it gets GOTY I guess			"

												If you own Batman: Arkham Knight for PC or purchase it before November 16, 2015, you will get: Free digital copies of games from the Batman: Arkham library. The ""Community Challenge Pack” DLC.The Batman: Arkham inspired Team Fortress 2 items created by the Batman: Arkham community. A middle finger to the fans of the Arkham Franchise, making them wait 4 months for something that is still broken and a pathetic excuse of ""compensation"" that rewards only the newcomers to the franchise and zero for the actual fans who bought every game. Let's not kid ourselves here, a majority of people who bought this game also bought the previous games beforehand.			"

												It's not a bad game. I beat it 100% and I'm playing NG+ at the moment. It has flaws (boss fights, underused villains, battank) but Batman's gameplay, gadgets, and combat animations are some of the best in the series.But this doesn't mean anything if you can't play the game. And most people still can't. After waiting months for a re-release. And with nothing to show for it but the other Arkham games, which most people own anyway (seriously, who would pre-purchase Knight if they hadn't played the others!?!). Plus the DLC which just got released is so far underwhelming, and was not worth the wait for those of us who (by some miracle) could play this game at launch.Duck WB for this whole disaster. Don't buy this game. It's worth a cheeky play though.			"

												I've preordered both the base game as well as the season pass long before release. I've had some performance issues, but I really enjoyed the base game content. The DLC isn't really worth it so far (the story packs are nice short ""clips"" to play through and the Batgirl DLC is quite enjoyable, but other stuff is just skins or challenges, stuff I don't care).So far, I'd really recommend the base game. It has its issues, but it's a very nice end to the Arkham Trilogy (or Quadtrilogy if you want), especially considering the very great open world feel without the fear of missing anything significant before beating the game.So far I even declined on using that possibility to get a full refund on the game. I didn't consider it fair, considering I've had fun for nearly 50 hours (and still haven't solved all Riddler challenges). However, today I noticed this game popping up yet again under Steam's ""Popular New Releases"". I check in and what do I see?ALL REVIEWS WRITTEN POST-LAUNCH (BUT BEFORE 17th NOVEMBER AS OF RIGHT NOW) ARE TAGGED AS ""PRE-RELEASE"" BY THE PUBLISHER. THIS IS *NOT* HELPFUL.I could understand them marking old reviews from before the October (or was it early November?) re-release as ""pre-release"". It's dodgy, but still fair considering they took it off the market, etc.However, I don't see why they should have the right to claim reviews written yesterday, clearly POST-RELEASE as pre-release just to try to lessen their significance.Don't blame the devs, they've delivered a great game, but what the publisher is doing here is more than dodgy. I guess this also marks my last WB Games game for a long while, because this is nothing I want to support in any way or form.Update end of 2016: It took me a while to play through all DLC – and I still haven't finished the Mad Hatter one – but overall I can now definitely say that the DLC is not worth your money. If you're a real completionist, maybe during a sale, but overall none of them is significant in any way. ""Story DLCs"" all consist of a hand full of rooms (at most) and up to three or four fights or encounters. As amazing as the base game is (apart from that repetitive boss fight), so disappointing are the DLCs.			"

After getting really bad performance using a 780ti sli rig, i decided to disable sli and try benchmark the game with a single card which got me much better performance then the two. after editing the ini file I managed to hit 60 fps on max settings apart from gameworks (yay) However this is where the problems started coming in. As i loaded up the story, I started gliding around and noticed huge fps drops and stuttering. I lowered the settings bit by bit to the point where i was set to the lowest settings but was still getting stutters. In combat I got 50 - 60 fps which is great but too bad it isn't consistant throughout. I really was looking forward to playing this game for a long time but the drops are making this game unplayable right now, really disappointed but hopefully patches come at CDPR speed			"

												Fantastic game.  I would say this is my personal favorite in the series for several reasons.  I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible just on a side note.  #1 The combat is the most polished in the series with extra things being added like environment takedowns.  #2 It is the most difficult game in the series combat wise and puzzle wise.  #3 the batmobile is a great addition even though it's a bit slow.  #4 The cinematics/psychological exploration of Bruce Wayne's mind of the game are the best in the series from my perspective.  #5 They added more obsure and interesting villians from the comics.  #6 Finally, this doesn't really apply to a comparison with Asylum, but of the open world Batman games this one felt more coherent, meaning a lot of stuff didn't feel as fetch quest like with the obvious exception of Riddler and one or two of the other side quests like City and Origins felt (meaning I actually was interested in every part of most of the side quests, not just the end).  However, I can say people may not like the lack of proper boss fights in this game.  They still exist, but they are not as prominent as any of the other games (ie Poison Ivy (Arkham Asylym) and Mr. Freeze (Arkham City)).  Overall, the most complete and best open world Batman game.

												Batman Arkham Night is the latest assassin's creed super hero game from rocksteady. Fans of the previous games will feel right at home with the uninspired story, bad visuals, and boring gameplay mechanics. They actually managed to get Unreal Engine 3 to perform even worse than the previous games in the series, bravo rocksteady. Yeah, let's lock the game at 30fps on my 980 ti, yeah, that'll be good. Or should I say, cockunsteady? This year they decided that playing as batman in a batman game is boring, no body wants to do that. Instead, in the 2015 the year of our lord, 50% of the games missions are...you guessed it...TANK MISSIONS. Yes, finally batman can fully realize his dream of joining the army and blasting those isis ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to smithereens with his batmotank. Thank you rocksteady, for taking arkham city, jacking up the system requirements without making visual improvements, taking out all the fun, and charging $30 for a season pass. I'll get right on giving you guys the $30 for more super fun tank missions. Don't buy, just steal.			"

												Against my better judgement I preordered the game because the previous titles in the series all worked very well at launch. What can I say, it's kind of a letdown. I've played for an hour so far and the game itself is probably good.  The combat is fun as always and in contrast to a lot of other people I find the whole Batmobile gameplay quiet appealing so far.That being said, the performance and optimization of this game is a huge bummer.Arguably I don't have the best rig there is, but while I can play The Witcher 3 on high settings without any problems, Arkham Knight's performance is just awful.There are constant fps drops which really disturb the flow of the game and lowering the graphics settings doesn't really do that much, despite making the game look much worse than Arkham Asylum. On top of that, there aren't even that many settings to begin with ingame. You actually have to meddle with an .ini file to change things like Motion Blur or Depth of Field, settings that SHOULD be easily accessable through the menu.YES, you can change these options (which for some people will crash the game on startup, so good luck with that, I guess), BUT this still doesn't excuse the lack of a proper ingame menu to change them. It's Dying Light all over again. So let's hope there will soon be some patches to the performance as well as to the possibilities of configuration. In it's current state, the game is, at least for me, not fun to play.Another point of criticism is the magnificently intransparent DLC policy coming with this game. I preordered it and according to my vendor's advertisement I SHOULD have the Harley Quinn DLC....well...like many others I don't, and nobody really seems to know why. What I read on forums went from it being Gamestop exclusive to having been pulled by Rocksteady from the preorder last minute and now being avaiable through the Season Pass, which would quiet frankly be beyond devious.So all in all, it is a pretty messed up launch and I strongly recommend AGAINST buying it at this point, at least not for full price. I actually got it cheaper and I still am rather annoyed.  "

Posted: January 24, 2016
												Batman Arkham Knight is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Brothers, coming out on PS4, Xbox One and PC in June 2015.  The game is run using the Unreal Engine 3. The PC release of Arkham Knight brought plenty of controversy and issues.  The technical issues on the PC release almost forced Warner Brothers to suspend sales on the game in order for them to address the issues people were having. The game was re-released on Steam in October 2015 after a few patches in order to solve the technical issues.  Sadly people still reported problems with the game forcing Warner Brothers to offer full refunds on the game regardless of whether you met the regular criteria or not.  To this day, the developers are still working on technical issues which people are having. Before I start my review, I would like to point out that I played this game on a mechanical hard drive, with one nVidia 970 (my second one is being RMA’ed right now!), playing at 1080p with graphics turned on and the majority of the nVidia graphics options turned on as well.  On launch of the title, Warner Brothers recommended that the game be installed on a solid state drive, so as you read the review, please bear all of the above in mind. Game play in Arkham Knight is again, the same as its predecessors; this shouldn’t be taken as a negative thing though, as the game play is absolutely stellar. The combat system is as fluid and easy to grasp as ever, with some new and interesting combos and special take downs being introduced, such as double take downs when you are working with a partner on some missions.  Some new gadgets have been introduced, a remote controlled batarang which can scan the area for information, and a voice synthesiser, that mimics other character’s voices; this gives you plenty of different ways to use such as ordering enemies around and opening voice controlled locked doors. The major new game play mechanic that has been added in Arkham Knight is the Batmobile.  You are able to summon the Batmobile to your location when you are on foot or gliding in the air. The Batmobile has two different mods that can easily be used at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is the regular movement mode with little on offer in terms of firepower, as you are traveling from A to B. Battle mod turns your Batmobile into a death machine; as you utilise all of the weapon systems on board. The Batmobile can be upgraded using the points you are rewarded with for levelling up as well. Graphically, I was really impressed with how the game looked. The high resolution textures and rain effects are all stunning.  All of the characters look almost life like, and you can really appreciate this when you get close up shots on their faces; so much detail has gone into the modelling and texturing, to the point where you can see the blackheads on the Joker’s face! All of the game’s animations are done very well too; the Arkham combat system has a very fluid feel to it, so they need to be spot on or else it would just look out of place. The plot within Arkham Knight is probably my favourite of the series so far. It is the last episode in the Arkham series, so takes place after origins, Asylum and City. I have not read the comic book series so I missed out on a lot of the plot in between the games but the game does do a good job of trying to fill in the gaps.  Arkham Knight introduces a few new main characters to the fold if you haven’t read the comic books too, such as Robin, and a more starring role for Barbara Gordon. With plenty of the other regulars returning, such as Cat-Woman and Alfred. You will encounter plenty of the super villains, Scarecrow, Penguin, Two-Face, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Harley Quin, and of course, the Joker. One new villain, Arkham Knight also has a starring role and has an important storyline plot attached to him as well. Difficulty can be scaled depending on how hard you set the game. I felt the medium setting to be just enough challenge without hitting the brick wall. None of the boss battles in Arkham Knight are just generic fist fights, each of them uses a unique mechanic which adds some variety to the game. As with its predecessors’ the open world aspect of the game does a very good job of filling in lots of “blank space” with plenty of side missions and collectables to find. Most Wanted missions, Riddler's Revenge, collectables and AR challenges makes the optional part of the game full to the brim with content. You are also able to unlock different endings to the game by completing the side missions as well, giving you more incentive to continue playing after finishing. I have been playing for about twenty five hours so far, this has allowed me to finish a handful of side missions and the main story in the game. I will definitely be dropping a few more hours into completing the rest of the most wanted missions in order to unlock the alternative endings, but I can’t see myself wanting to collect the hundreds of Riddler items again after my fiasco with the past two games with them! Now, onto the technical issues.  As I said above, I am using a single nVidia 970 and the game was installed on a mechanical hard drive. The majority of the time the game was running around 57-60 fps. There are moments where the frame rate will drop to 30 for no good reason. I can understand if it drops on more graphically intensive scenes or when there is a lot happening, but it can sometimes happen when you are in a building with very little going on. Maybe this would have been different if I was using SLI, but even then, it has been reported the SLI makes no difference to the performance. Taking all of this into consideration it seems I was on the lucky side and the pure power in my machine seemed to pull it through to an acceptable playable state.My conclusion of Batman Arkham Knight may come as a controversial one, but like all of my reviews it is my honest and truthful opinion. I am going to highly recommend Arkham Knight. The game play and interesting compelling story make it a definite worthwhile play through.  I would only recommend this game to people who have a bit of meat in their rig to play it though, unless you are willing to sacrifice some of the graphical fidelity, please bear in mind all of what I noted in the technical issues section of the review and make your judgement on purchasing the game on that if you are on the fence. The game’s retail price on Steam is £34,99, I would also recommend that you don’t purchase it for that price, either get it from another source (definitely not GEE 2 AAAA hint hint hint hint) or wait for one of Steam’s sales as this game will go on sale for less than £20, and more than likely even more now.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												The fact that I have to run this game at 800x600 on Low settings to even get 30 FPS is horrific. I can run The Witcher 3 and Assassin's Creed Unity at higher settings, not to mention they look much better. Rocksteady messed up UE3, they screwed PC gamers, and the latest patch just adds DLC support and the only fixes are for the consumer to get 12 GB of RAM or restart the game regularly. Despite my amount of time (well spent besides the need for 100% to get the 'good' ending), I would not recommend anyone else giving Warner Brother, Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy their money for this pathetic excuse of a PC port			"

												Its an amazing game, probably my game of the year. But one of THE worst pc ports ever. I been lucky enough to actually be able to play the game at a somewhat normal Framerate. But I shouldn't drop below 60FPS at all when playing on a rig WAY over the recommended. Even after the update that they said would fix the game, I still have framedrops.			"

												The pre-release game footage, and steam 'screenshots' are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Even maxed out, the game isn't nearly as impressive as I was lead to believe. Not only that but the performance is♥♥♥♥♥♥ (GTX 980, i5 3570k overclocked, 8gb ram) This isn't a full review, but so far, expect the game to look a half step between arkham city and what you might expect it to look like graphically. Cutscenes are beautiful, though.Aliasing everywhere, lack of complex lighting (as compared to screenshots).Graphics aren't everything, and I have liked all previous Batman games, so I'll leave this as negative until the performance is sorted out, and I've played more of the game. It seems like it'll be pretty ♥♥♥♥ing cool, just as usual though, not nearly as cool as it was demonstrated to be. "

												Neither Warner Bros., Rocksteady, or Iron Galaxy Studios deserve your money for this half attempted port which released with tons of issues. Took months to fix and the entire time nothing was done to make things right with the PC community, just thanks for being patient in a situation where players had no choice but to either hang tight or get a refund.Go watch some Youtube videos of people playing the game to get the best it has to offer without any of the pain as Rocksteady loses their way by overpromising and discovering just how hard it is to deliver on those promises. Get ready to experience the Bat-tank, a wannabe Batmobile that plays more like it belongs in Armored Core than a Batman game and will leave you wondering how on Earth Batman avoids killing people while running them over in a two ton vehicle doing 90 mph. Watch as characters are marginalized to pointless side missions which feel like a reason to implement some weird puzzle mechanic or to merely make things so easy there isn't even a challenge anymore. Watch in awe as Rocksteady disregards their own story timeline and simply throws characters in where they don't belong because they already built that character model so who cares if we got the wrong Robin? Prepare yourself to be underwhelmed by every piece of DLC content that is not only overpriced but underdeveloped as skins look worse than they did last generation, new characters can't be used in free roam mode, and story content that leaves you scratching your head as to when any of this is supposed to take place.This is how they did it. This is how they killed the Batman.Good job Warner Bros., Rocksteady, and Iron Galaxy Studios for taking what should have been a surefire hit and doing nearly everything possible short of coming to my home and punching me in the gut right after I booted the game up to ensure this was a miserable experience. Save yourself even those couple of bucks you're thinking of spending on this because it's already heavily discounted because they lost a ton of money on this port. There are far better games to play than this and far better developers who will actually deliver a functioning game when promised without compromising their vision to make sure the console version is working and the graphics are as pretty as possible with gameplay coming second. There are times where even the voice actors are phoning it in because they could tell how ridiculous this was. Spoiler alert this game contains the most unconvincing death scene ever that leaves you wondering when a 12 year old took over writing duties and why the cast seems more interested in delivering as few words or emotion as possible before moving on like it never happened.

												Finished the game (Working on 100%) and I have to say I loved it. Like most people I had problems at first but I was able to solve them. I only had problems with a particular Nvidia Display driver version and downgrading the drivers solved all issues, but now the latest works just fine.I had already played all Batman games on console(PS4 PS3) so this was my second time with this game. I was able to notice that the PC port is infact inferior to console only in terms of stability (FPS), graphics are obviously better here on PC. It was still quite playable for me. Occasional dip but never below 30. Fitting end to one my favourite game series. Absolutely recommended.			"

												It's been a long journey with Batman. I've been playing Arkham games since november and I gotta say I had great times while playing those games. Wish they never ended but all good things come to an end, right? Arkham Knight is a great game in almost every way. They've improved combat A LOT since Arkham City, added new moves, gadgets, mechanics etc. Animations, movement, everything have been improved. I remember the first time when it came out. People were complaining about the optimization but it seems like it's been fixed now. Although they added Batmobile and improved everything, it seems like they've restrained some good things like boss fights. There are boss fights but most of them are tank battles. I remember only two boss battles that we had to fight with fists. Waste of an amazing combat system if you ask me. About the city... well... we still don't have whole Gotham to explore, instead we have three huge islands which is enough if you ask me. Apart from all of those amazing features, most thing I liked about the game was Red Hood. Buy the DLC, mod the game, and kill those filthy criminals. Like I said, it's a great game in almost every way. If you think your PC can handle it, buy it and enjoy!			"

												The treatment of WB and RS towards PC gamers with this game is very poor. I got this game Day 1 and waited for months for it to be at least in playable state. What we got was 1 patch in 4 months time, which made the game playable but not entirely fixed for most of the people. The lack of updates in forums was also unacceptable for a company like WB and RS. Now, the game is re-released and there are still major problems.  Also, the compensation they ' ll give us, the free Arkham games, is a joke since most of the people who got this have already played the rest of the games. DO NOT buy this game. If you do you approve the poor behaviour they had towards us and you support possible future ones.			"

 This review is updated and based off the version after the September 3ed patch So while this game has had a hard first few months, it finally got its patch. With this new patch, preformance was increased, the 30 fps cap is now an optional setting in graphics tab, and stuttering is minimum if you set settings to ones that match your PC build (but still consistant). Now to the breakdown.Gameplay+The characters, enemies and allies, are very well designed and voiced+This Batman game adds many new mechanics listed below   +Batmobile/vehicle's make for awesome gameplay   +New enemies, from Medics that revive enemies to brutes weilding Miniguns    +New abilites, such as the Fear Takedown and Counter-throw   +Have a helper during combat, for new items/abilities and duel takedowns+The map is large, filled with enemies and interesting side-quest+The AI is more adaptive with the Militia, such as radio checkins, seeing into and grenading vents, and drones+Selecting side-quest is a breeze with the new mission select wheel+The game is just amazingly beutiful-The game seems to lag more during batmobile chases, prefer to roam by glide to reduce lag-The game still lags a lot, and stuttering still occures-As far as I've seen so far, you cannot switch characters (i.e. Robin, Nightwing) outside of their missions, making them one-time characters, making their unique weapon-loadout pointless-PC controls are terrible, either adapt or use a consol controller PC adapter like I use-Some side-quest are very short, and makes me wishing they would make them longerStory (Warning, May Contain Slight Spoilers+The story was decently long, and interesting+Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight made great main-enemies+The Arkham Knight is a well-design character, personality and preformance wise+Has a good few twist in the story-One detective-mode crimescene in the entire main story, and a few mini-detective-mode crimescene's in sidequest. Wtf WB Games? They were one of the funnest parts!!!-Has a pretty obvious twist if you're a fan of Batman, knowing the comicbooks OverallThe game was very enjoyable to play overall. However, one feature that I really enjoyed from previous Arkham games, the Detective Crime scanes were lacking, very disappointed by this. The Batmobile made a heavy impact on the game, in both quest and campaign, making up for lack of detective work. This is, what I believe, to be a great ending to the Batman: Arkham series, however with WB games taking its sweet time releasing the patch, I feel like the PC version is dead and unrevivable.EDIT: With the refund option now avalible for everyone, no matter the hours played, I would recommend to refund the game for PC. While I do not recommend the game for PC, I do recommend the game for console if avalible.			"

												TLDR; 7/10 game running at a 3/10 performance. Game runs poorly, actual story is okay but ruined in the last hour, extra collectables were a chore and not worth the time and effort. Buy GOTY edition for cheap but the game still isn't good enough on PC. I will update this review with future patches.Please note, I have played Arkham Asylum and City both to 100% on PC/xbox 360. I have also played origins but did not 100% the main. This review will not contain any spoilers. I played at 1080 resolution at around 60/45fps with very occasional dips lower, with the lowest settings for everything. I have an i7 4770k, 16gb RAM and a GTX 770 and I played this on windows 8. I played the game on a SSD so loading times might be considerably better for me than the files on a HDD. When I played the game, I had the interim patch but from what I understand, the full release hasn't changed much. Also, I played the game with a wired xbox 360 controller on a 1080 TV on hard mode. Your experience may differ based on your hardware and software. Also I will not be including a full dlc review in this. Performance/appearance:Batman Arkham knight ran poorly on my machine. There was issues concerning large frame rate drops about (20-30 fps decrease), textures not loading for a few seconds, micro stuttering and large loading times. The performance is unacceptably bad for a game in 2015 with a major publisher backing the studio. The patches have improved the performance however, it is still not good enough for most gamers. You shouldn't be required to have a SSD, over 8 GB RAM and a 760+ for a performance this bad. I suspect more patches will be added in the future to improve the performance so if you want an update of the performance based on my parts in the future then send me a mail and I will see if things have improved. Batmobile sections were the biggest offenders of reducing the frame rate however the frame rate dropped at random during other portions of the game.I will say, the game was nice to look at with some cool destructions physics, lighting effects some excellent rain effects. If you are using an nvidia card the nvidia gameworks options look nice but they completely crippled my frame rate to around 22-18 fps. I'm not sure what the effect will be on an AMD card but I imagine it will probably make things even worse for your experience. Gameplay:Gameplay is broken up into a few different sections. These include combat, stealth, free roam, driving the batmobile and small detective section. These mechanics are used in part with the side missions and the main campaign. If you have played any of the Arkham games you know how the combat is and the free roaming however there has been minor changes which did make a difference to my experience with the game.Combat was much less precise than in Asylum or City. I found myself hitting enemies who I was not aiming for more than a few times which lead to some unfair deaths. My partner and a friend played the PS4 version and we found the same issue with their experience too. Some of the new enemies aloud for healing and revival which combined with existing enemies, meant combat lasted far too long in some sections. However, as a Batman veteran, the game was a nice challenge with the combat and it was nice for hard mode to actually feel like it was hard at times. Stealth is for the most part unchanged. You distract enemies, you knock them out, you pick them up one by one and you which if you have played any of the previous games you know the song and dance. There are some minor changes but they don't change too much bar getting the fear multi takedown ability which makes many of the stealth sections much easier. In response, enemies have new gadgets and tech but it is given at a nice difficulty curve. Freeroaming was probably the least changed mechanic but the most improved. The grappling hook has received a much welcomed boost in strength and you can go much further and faster than in previous games. I did have some issues with the frame rate during some of the very fast flight sections however they were not too frequent. The only down side to freely roaming the city is some sections will require you to use the batmobile. Which leads me to my next point. The batmobile was the worst bit of the game and unfortunately you have to spend a lot of time in it. As I mentioned in my performance paragraph, I found the frame rate was at its worst during these sections with the frame rate dropping significantly when driving very quickly. The batmobile is also used in stealth section in some ridiculous ways and many times during the game when i didn't know what to do, the solution as using the batmobile in some silly way. I get that this is a game and I should suspend my disbelief but I also didn't have much fun during these sections due to the dull tank controls, low frame rate and at the rate I had to use it. Detective mode has probably been one of the smallest but most significant changes for Arkham Knight. The main detective vision has been seriously nerfed giving less detail on objects, being blocked more often in stealth sections, not available in the batmobile and having a lower viewer distance. For most of the game this isn't an issue, however I will explain why it is an issue with the side missions. There are some decent side missions but some of the supervillains were pretty lame and their side missions were tedious with the same mission repeated several times. If you aren't going to try and get all the riddles then move onto my story section. If you have played any of the previous games then you will know about the riddler mission which involves collecting question mark tokens and taking pictures of question marks and small hints of characters from the batman universe. As I mentioned in detective mode, the vision mode has been hugely nerfed and now riddler clues are not highlighted at all. This means you are almost forced to go find all the riddler informants and constantly check you map which can be a chore at best and a miserable slog at worse. Story:As I mentioned, I won't be spoiling the game. I felt the Arkham Knight was a little underwhelming but it was to be expected. I would recommend avoiding IMDB pages and looking up voice actors if you don't want to know who the Arkham Knight. However, the identity was pretty obvious about 50% through the story. Parts of the best bits of the story are literally there to develop the reveal or the Arkham Knight and was some brilliant depictions of some of the iconic sections of the batman lore. There was a complaint I had that one of the best bits of the game and some of the story arcs of one of the characters was made completely pointlessly in the last reveal. This was a disappointment to me as it was one of the best bits of the game and probably the single most shocking part in any of the Arkham games.  Overall, the story was the only thing keeping me going and I found once I was done with the story, the fun I had with the game was diminished and I was getting impatient with the side missions. If you are compelled to collect everything like I was then go for it but if I were to do it for a first time again, finish all the side missions except the riddler and then watch the true ending on YouTube. Please let me know if I have missed anything and I can update my review to reflect my opinion on the sections I have missed.			"

												I'd return this trash if I could but it was free with my video card. If a game developer can't bother to finish their video game than they shouldn't release it as a finished product and pretend they had no idea the PC version of the game was messed up. Next time Rocksteady use the Steam Early Access program. The sheer scale of bad press combined with the ludicris amount you want for a season pass just sunk your own flagship product. Try again in 3-4 years (with far fewer pre-orders).			"

												When I bought the game (pre-ordered it), it worked fine. Sure it lagged a bit, but still, I could play it. Since yesterday's patch, it doesn't work anymore. I can't even start it. Plus: The so named ""TIMED"" PS4 exclusives will never become avaiable for PC or XBOX One. Why? Because Warner Bros. and Rocksteady don't care about promises. How many of you even reconized the information? I only knew about it because of CabooseXBL. So no 3000 Batman Skin, 66 Batmobile Skin, which isn't that cruel, but I really had appreciated the 66 Batman skin fitting in the 66 Pack. Also there will be no Scarecrow Map-Pack, which looked pretty awesome.Actually I spent 100 (Collector's Edition) + 40 Euros = 140 Euros (~150 Dollars) for a game, whose release changed every week, for a game, which only worked for I think 4 months, and for DLCs I can't play because somebody decided to not release them until the 10/28-Patch. I hope, there will be another patch fixing ALL problems. Thank you Rocksteady, thank you Warner Brothers,for the nice feeling of being slapped in the face several times.Seeing you turn into EA hurts...Still, the story and gameplay was great, even though the plot twist clear since the first trailer. Sadly, Psychomantis (new villain you encounter passivly through the entire game) was too strong.			"

												I never write reviews, but considering the state of this game I felt compelled to warn people.Do not purchase this game.Released broken, took several months to release several patches that fixed nothing at all instead opted to just add DLC so they can get more money. At least we get compensation right? Well I hope you haven't played the other Arkham games because that's all you get; and no they're not giftable.People with high end systems run this game like crap, with hardware better than PS4 that still struggle to get a stable 60fps on medium/high/ultra settings.Vote with your wallet. Do not support this sort of practice. To buy this game would be saying that you support this sort of crap. If you want more broken crap like this and AC:Unity then by all means go right ahead.			"

												So this game has some settings locked to ""normal"" in the graphics menu and is locked at 30fps. I run SLI 970 ssc's x2 and it literally isn't using the second card at all despite the game ready driver update stating SLI support. This port is completely useless and they've suckered people into buying it, I'm starting to get sick of this lying to the PC gamer community about games, hardware etc. We will always find out.			"

												I installed this game for the first time on June 2, 2015 on a laptop with a mobile Nvidia 970M graphics card and an Intel I7 3.0 ghz processor with 16 gig. of RAM; the screen flashed on and off in a way that would cause an epileptic fit in a healthy person then promptly crashed to the desktop. Now 4 MONTHS! later I install the game this evening after the ""relaunch"" of the game (ostensibly to negate all the previous negative reviews) and after double clicking on the games icon the screen starts strobing on and off like a poor mans Christmas tree and stays that way until I am able to select ""borderless windowed"" mode from the game options (no small feat since I can barely see the screen!) Oh and the framerates still dip well below 60 fps in most action sequences. Rocksteady......   SHAME!WB Games........  SHAME!Subcontracted crap PC porter...

If there's more than a few enemies coming at you don't expect to win that fight without retrying a few dozen times as the FPS are so low it's like watching a slide show rather than a game. 0/10 get Witcher 3 enstead.

												The game wont run smoothly. It stutters and crashes. Its unplayable.  Batman Origins was fine on my PC. First this is locked at 30 fps. Even then it was stuttering. I changed it to 60fps because it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥a 30 fps I just cant enjoy it. The game stutters and crashes. Maybe they will patch this. But as of now this is a big thumbs down. BTW Im running a 970 GTX and this is certainly not ""the way its meant to be played"". The game came free with the GPU and its a very poor showing of NVidia's product. Really hope they fix this. I cant understand why bother with fancy rain and debris if you cant run it at the bare minimum of 60 fps. Batman would not fight crime at 30 fps. That's something Aquaman might do.Edit. After all my anger. This is actually a great game and a very beautiful game too.			"

Posted: October 29, 2015
												I waited patiently for four months for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. to put this game back on Steam and fix it properly. I bought it when it was first up for sale, and the game ran very poorly for me, yet I wanted to know where the story went so I struggled through all the lag and stuttering and horrible textures to play through it to the end of the main story. I only own a PC and not any consoles so that was the only choice available to me to play through the game. I was really excited to play the sequel to Arkham Asylum and City, two games that I really enjoyed, and I am a huge Batman fan. I read all the comic books, and I watch all the movies and cartoons, so I was always going to play through this game, awful port or not.Now I will admit I don't have the best and most up to date computer in the world, but I find it more than adequate to play through pretty much any other game I might try to throw at it. I've enjoyed playing The Witcher 3, GTA V, MGS V and countless other great games on it this year with perfectly acceptable settings and stable performance. But somehow this game just won't quite run nicely for me, even after the update from a month or two ago, which did improve things for me and make the game run a fair bit better, it's still not quite right. The framerate jumps up and down like a yo-yo, from around 55fps to 25fps, constantly shifting. I'd prefer the game to run at a consistent 60fps but I honestly don't mind a framerate in the 30 range, but only if it's stable and consistent, but it is not in this game no matter what settings I put it on. It's kind of like watching a movie and somebody is constantly pressing the fast forward and pause button. The textures, which I have to play on 'low' as I have a 2gb VRAM card, have improved from the awful state of release, but I still see occasional objects that just look like a blurry mess. There's also still issues with dialogue going out of sync on cut scenes.What annoys me here is that this is a game running on Unreal Engine 3, a game engine that has been around for over a decade and developers really have no excuse for not being able to develop stable and well optimised games on it at this stage. I understand that it is a 'heavily modified' version of Unreal Engine 3, but it really shouldn't matter. And it most certainly should not be an engine that requires amazing hardware to handle a game developed on it. I believe Bioshock Infinite runs on UE3 and I run that game at like a stable 80fps with everything on max settings, different type of game admittedly, but really there is no excuse.Normally at this point I would say that graphics don't really matter, and it is gameplay, story and replayability that’s important. I would dearly like to say that about this game, but I just can't quite say that. I did enjoy many things about this game, it is basically the same as Asylum and City but with some cool new moves put in which work from the FEAR suit. I do love the design in this game. The way Batman's suit looks is seriously cool, and Gotham City is beautifully detailed and huge in scope. The new thing in this one is the Batmobile, I know a lot of people hate it, but I actually rather enjoyed it, but it is certainly overused. I particularly don't like it when you are literally driving the batmobile inside buildings to solve environmental puzzles. I get it, you've got this cool new thing, and you want to show it off, but there is no need to try and force it in to nearly every part of the game. I did like the story of this game, I particularly like the references to The Killing Joke, and how they brought back a certain character. Many of the moments in the story were very emotionally charged in a way that the previous games lacked. What is a shame is that the game lacks the great boss battles that the previous games were so memorable for. Scarecrow as the main villain I found particularly disappointing. I've always found him interesting as a psychological manipulative villain, but all the stuff about him in this game just basically comes to nothing. There's also another villain in this game whose story is a bit odd, without wanting to spoil anything all I can really say is that it's just kind of lame the way they try to hide something which is very obvious to any Batman fan. They could have just done his story a lot better, and it could have been amazing, but as it is, it's just kind of a messed up opportunity.I cannot give this game a thumbs up and I do not recommend it. It is not completely unplayable to me, and as described the game has a lot of commendable things. If you are a fan of the series and have to play it, then yeah get it, but do be aware that for a lot of people it is still unplayable. If you can get it on another system or are able to wait then don't get it now on Steam. Don't expect this game to ever be properly fixed. Warner Bros./Rocksteady have been saying for months about all the stuff they are going to do to fix it, but still haven't done all the stuff they said they would. They seem more concerned about getting the DLC up. Their idea of compensation is almost laughable, not that I ever wanted free stuff from them, I wanted a working game. But the way they treat their customers is disrespectful, and ultimately that is why I have to give this game a thumbs down.Edit: well the game now runs quite well for me, with some tweaking. If I lock the framerate to 30fps to get a pretty consistent stutter free experience that looks quite nice. It's not perfect though by any means and 30fps is far from ideal, but I can live with it for now. My thumbs down still stays though I'm afraid. It took too long for them to even put a graphics menu in with a fully featured set of options, and the attitude from Warner Bros just was not what I would call good customer service. Even with the game working alright for me, it's still a bit of a let down compared to the previous games in terms of story and gameplay. I can't help but wonder what I'd think of this game had it been released in the state it is at now. But I'll never know the answer to that unfortunately. "

												Rating: 8.5/10Overview: Open World Action Adventure The Good:+ One of the best looking open world games I have ever played. + This game handles one of my bigger criticisms I had with the previous games, the open world feels a lot more alive; cop cars chase criminals, military and thugs patrol the streets, etc. + I love the story and how many of the characters make a return and the roles they play. A fantastic way to finish the series. + The batmobile looks and plays incredibly well. The ability to call the car at a moment’s notice, seeing it drive through the streets as it turns right before you and then jump in and drive off without missing a second feels awesome.   +Solid sense of progression and upgrades. Gaining experience unlocks more powerful combat moves and gadgets. + AR challenge maps further the replay value giving you extra challenges. You can play as many different characters+ Riddler trophies makes a return. Many of these collectables have a little puzzle associated with them making them fun to collect if you are into that sort of thing. + Great voice acting and sound + New Game Plus- Upgrades carry over. The Average:+/- Given the calibre of this game I was a bit disappointed with the graphical and gameplay options. +/- Side quests that deal with villains are fun, however other side quests suffer with open world syndrome, i.e they start to feel repetitive over time. You can only disable so many road mines, military checkpoints, save so many fireman before you start getting tired of it. +/- The game is heavily designed around using the batmobile. Many objectives have you using the batmobile whether for driving or combat. If you don’t like the controls or using the car in general you may be disappointed with a lot of the missions. +/- Combat remains mostly the same. You can strike, counter, dodge, use gadgets and do a variety of special moves all while trying to maintain the combo meter.  The new addition is that you can now fight with a partner and do a special takedown moves. There are also a few new enemies to keep things fresh. The developers decided to make changes to the camera, timing and some changes to certain move sets which lead to a more frustrating experience. +/- This game features a ton of DLC, yet most of them never felt substantial. Most of the arkham episodes can easily be beaten in under 30 minutes and most of them play out exactly the same.  The Bad:- This is not a well optimised PC game.  This game is one of the worst pc ports in recent memory and even after many problems were fixed the game still struggles to play sometimes. You need a system above minimum requirements to play this game at a somewhat decent performance.  Conclusion:I love Rocksteady Batman games, they are some of my favorite games and if this is Rocksteady’s final Batman game then they should be very proud of their efforts. Though I love the game, the formula is starting to wear thin for me. If you played Arkham City and even Origins this game offers little surprise, you’ve done it all before except this time you have the batmobile.  "

												The Gameplay it's self is very impressive and fun to play, I really enjoy the Batman games, but I was promises a good quality game to play in June. I had to wait till September with a game that was supposed to be patched in July, instead we got an update on the patch. It works alright, during my gameplay there were dramatic drops in the frame rate at some parts, but the game was playable and I did enjoy it. However, I am not going to give this game a positive review because I feel cheated! WB and Rocksteady apologised to the PC community for giving us a crappy-not-at-all-ready-to-play game, well anyone can say they are sorry, but it means noting if they do not give us something to achieve our trust. We should get a free DLC for our troubles for an apology, I do not care if they are sorry. I want justice!			"

												As of 10/28 re-release game is still not fully optimized. GTX 780 on medium settings runs mostly locked at 60FPS, but while driving the frame-rate is all over the place. Goes as low as 30FPS. Blurry texture and texture pop-ins still persist.Graphics issues aside this game is just not fun as the first 2 games were with its tedious batmobile gameplay and cookie cutter side missions. It feels rushed and unfinished. It feels like Rocksteady needed more time to complete this game.			"

												Really disappointed is all I can say, playing on an i7-4790k and gtx 970 g1 getting stutters, judders complete pauses and fps drops beyond the 25 mark is unacceptable.After forcing myself to play through till the hour mark & the constant stutters I realised I didn't want to continue. This is after havinng to redownload the entire game 2 times from steam and waste countless hours.  Underneath it all it looks to be a fairly decent game but it is unfortunately unplayable and should never have been released this early & in the state it's in.Be Warned!			"

If you overlook disasterous release of Batman™: Arkham Knight it's a well elaborated game with amazing graphics.Arkham Knight brings large rigorous open world, Batmobile and with it the whole new system of drone fights. Speaking about Batmobile for one thing it's sad when drone fights become annoying when the game forces you to crush an army of them for hundered times over and over. On the other hand driving Batmobile through Gotham streets or on one of many race tracks the game offers is pretty enjoyable. It was for the first time I found Arkham challenges entertaining. Predator mode is terrific as always, including more features than before, new types of enemies and also gadgets. This is what developers did really great work with. However what I think is not done with great care or I could say was sloppily made is the story. Many think the story is the best part of the Arkham series, but in this title its predictable, rapidly escalating and not going too far. Best part of it are cutscenes which are joy to behold.Altogether I recommend this one if you have played previous titles.7.5 /10 "

EDIT #2 as of 6/24, afternoonIt seems like they've patched the Batmobile wrecking the framerate. This is a pretty huge improvement, since large portions of the game require you to use it. There's still a lot of motion blur (unsure if that's frames related or what) when moving the camera, and a couple moments of frame drop every now and again. Overall the experience is definitely improving, and the optimization issues are not impeding my progress in the game.EDIT #1 as of 6/23, late afternoonI was told about this thread, which has been very helpful with regards to stabilizing the framerate. Shoutout to Derp or whatever your name is for going over all the gamefiles and figuring this out. I also downloaded the ""game-ready"" drivers which apparently came out yesterday, you can read more about it here[www.geforce.com]. With all of that, the game is definitely playable but certainly not amazing. Still getting frame drops from rotating the cam and driving the Batmobile, but it has yet to go into slideshow mode again. If the remaining frame drops are eliminated and the devs fix up the game so nobody has to root around in the game files, I'll consider switching this review to ""recommended"". As of now, I wouldn't recommend the current experience to consumers (especially not at full price)My original reviewas of 6/23, early afternoonI'm leaving this up in full so people get an idea of what the game was like on release:Nearly unplayable in its current state. At first I thought the framedrops only occurred during cutscenes, until the combat started and the game became a slideshow randomly. God forbid you get in the Batmobile- for whatever reason that thing absolutely MURDERS the framerate.The rest of the game seems to look good, the combat seems snappy and responsive, and the gadgets all seem to function just as well as the other games in this series... I just can't play it when I'm faced with constant fluctuations between 14 and 25 FPS. I can barely make out what's happening on-screen and I feel like I'm going to get motion sickness or something. Yes, I've heard of the .ini file you can edit to unlock the 30FPS cap but all other reports seem to say the performance somehow gets even worse when you do that.I'm totally willing to re-write this review if Rocksteady shows they actually care about finishing the job. As of now, they've released an unfinished, unoptimized game that is not fun to play and I cannot say anything other than this- stay far, far away.			"

												You do not have the graphical capability to fully enjoy this game. Whatever you think, your graphics card is most likely not powerful enough to support this game. That's all there is to it.Against all warnings from friends, I pre-ordered this game along with the season pass to play it on launch date, like I've done with all of the Arkham series games. This is the first time however that I decided to get the game on PC, the last times were always on PS3. But since this game is next generation, I could not justify buying a PS4 just to play it, I instead decided to use my PC, which, while a year old at this point, is still very powerful, I can play most new games with the highest settings (Mad Max and Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain work smooth as butter with maxed out settings). This was not the case with Batman Arkham Knight on June 26.While I was one of the lucky ones to be able to play the game at all, throughout my playthrough I had only 2 crashes which came at two unrelated random points. But otherwise, I could play the game and I was willing to overlook most problems, chalking it off as it'll get patched in the coming weeks, I mean it's not uncommon. My nVidia GeForce Experience optimal settings recommended that I minimalise all settings, which to me was shocking, how needy could the game be? So I ignored it and wanted to experience how bad it can get. And oh man, it got bad. The framerate could not handle anything and would often drop down to 1.Throughout my gameplay I eventually had a system going where whenever I was out as Batman, I would set my texture quality to medium, shadow quality to low and level of detail on high, but whenever I was in the Batmobile and there was any kind of action, I had to drop the texture quality and level of detail back to low and back again whenever there were any kinds of cutscenes going on so I could enjoy the experience even slightly. But even then, I played the game and defended it, because in the end, when it all comes down to it, it's NOT a bad game.I enjoyed the Batmobile sequences more the more I learned how to handle the controls and the innovations in combat when you're controlling Batman were definitely the best so far. The parts of Gotham you get the explore (and it's not the whole city, just 3 parts of it) are big, but not overwhelmingly so, because the Batmobile makes pretty fast to traverse around. The usual controls were a bit changed however which did confuse me throughout the game, but it's nothing too damaging to the overall experience. I had fun, enjoyed the story which I will not spoil, but I'm pretty sure everyone knows at this point, and managed to complete my normal playthrough to 100%. I decided to leave the New Game+ mode for whenever the game gets patched and I can play it with optimum settings.So if I liked the game, why the negative review? Simple. This port is atrocious compared to the console ports. The PC port was a simple afterthought and was handled by another developer, not Rocksteady. So when push came to shove in releasing the game, all the innovations that Rocksteady made, were not translated properly and the game sufferred. As most of you know, it was so bad that WB had to take the game off Steam so that they could develop a patch. For 3 months. It is now October and the patch was released. Can people play this game now? Yes. Did they fix some major issues? According to them, they have. Have they really? No, the game still functions the same as it did before for me. I can still only play the game with minimum settings.Honestly, I think the only way they could have fixed it would have been if they reworked the graphics engine for the game and I seriously doubt they want to do that at this point. WB PR solution to this is to give out all the previous Arkham games out for free to the buyers who've waited for 3 months and not returned the game back in the first week. I already have all the Arkham games. I think most fans do. They're the ones that made us want to buy this sequel. Plus, the games have been on every other sale for around 5 euros each, so I'm pretty sure everyone has them. I personally am not getting anything out of being patient and supportive from all this time. From my perspective, they've done nothing to improve my experience.So no, don't buy this game. Not on PC. Wait a couple of years. Let it drop in price, naturally upgrade your computer with time, let them patch it over and over and only then you'll have a good enough reason to play it.Or go play it on the consoles now, it works perfectly fine there.

												I was hesitant to get this game, but an opportunity to trade for it for some left over Humble Bundle games opened up and took a shot. At first the game was a bit stuttery, and on occasions, the game would crash on me after getting killed. I thought the game was gonna be the huge mess everyone painted it to be. But i kept playing. I did some heavy defragging on my HDD and it seems to have helped. Haven't crashed since the 2-3 initial ones, and my framerate is more stable, although not at good as the other Arkham games, but it's with good reason, this game looks amazing. The city is much bigger.The game is running better than I expected, and am enjoying it. Specs: i5 6600K16GB RAMR9 380X "

Since I couldn't get the game to run, I went through the tried-and-true method of verifying the game cache. Literally every single file failed to verify.

												The forth game in the Arkham series (and the third developed by Rocksteady) is one that is in serious danger of collapsing under the weight of franchise fatigue. Early impressions are that it’s business as usual – A dark, brooding, po-faced adventure where you play a man who dresses as a bat while driving a funny bat themed car. Never is this bizarre tonal contradiction more acute than when you are afflicted with fear gas – after dealing with the terrifying nightmarish journey through your conflicted subconscious you return to reality and you’re still a man dressed as a bat.Let’s discuss the creaking, oiled leather clad elephant in the room before going any further – the PC port. On a 980ti at 1080p, with almost everything set to it’s highest I managed a mostly stable 60FPS on foot, and an uneven but playable framerate when driving. Turning on enhanced fog and debris brought the framerate crashing down, which puts it on par with most Nvidia specific features in games (hot garbage). So not fantastic, but a far cry from the car crash that the game was at launch.Let’s also discuss the smaller, leotard wearing acrobat elephant in the room – the batmobile. This is the big selling point of the game, and it’s clear a lot of work has gone into this. The developers are obviously very proud of their creation, and it takes any excuse to pan leeringly over it’s admittedly impressive bodywork, focussing on it’s plates and gears and seemingly extraneous transforming knick-knacks. You’ll be using it a lot whether you like it or not. Virtually every section of the game has a mandatory car section wedged in there, and it is almost entirely to the games detriment. Driving around Gotham is fun in short bursts, though in all honesty grappling and gliding is both faster and typically more entertaining, as well as granting you a superior vantage point to spot the game’s generous helping of side quests.Really, the bulk of Arkham Knight’s problems rest with the tank. You seem to spend half the game circle strafing enemy drones, and the tank combat never gets any more complex or entertaining. From the first battle, you’ve seen everything the tank has to offer. That half of the boss battles are also tank based just adds insult to injury – there’s nothing here that even approaches the creativity of the Freeze battle in City, a high point among a series rich in excellent set pieces.The tank also stretches even videogame credulity to breaking point – ploughing into a thug at high speed jolts him (totally non lethally yo) out of the way, and hitting a person with a cannon capable of shredding steel seems to cause nothing more serious than unconsciousness (and presumably the odd shattered pelvis). That’s to say nothing of the unsettling realisation that I’m playing a millionaire using my wealth to hunt the poor and dispossessed – admittedly a problem that has plagued any modern day interpretation of Batman, but it’s at its most crass here.It’s when the game is most like it’s predecessors that it’s at it’s best – the early portions of the game with Scarecrow are narrow and focussed, and the batmobile still novel enough to be entertaining. The trifecta of stealth, punching and puzzle solving is still engaging (though beginning to sag under the weight of feature creep), and the whole game is so polished you can see your chiselled, scowling face in it. Voice acting is impeccable as ever, though outside of the welcome return of Scarecrow the rogue’s gallery is limp – it was inevitable that by the third game we’d be resorting to repetition or second stringers (with the titular Arkham Knight himself being mostly an extended bum note).The side quests, featuring more colourful B-Listers (including a welcome appearance by Man Bat) are almost universally more entertaining than the main story – the extended Riddler sidequest inparticular is a high point, though quite how race circuits feature into his battle of wits is not particularly clear. The challenges are however varied and often require you to at least partially engage your brain, more than can be said for the rest of the game. Sadly, some of the other sidequests are Ubisoft tier busywork – including the interminable Riddler trophy ticklist, an exercise in mind numbing masochism which is gallingly required for the true ending.While this is a review of nothing but complaining, it’s worth noting that Arkham Knight is not a BAD game, not really – just one that is inferior to the games that preceded it, learning all the wrong lessons. Everything new falls flat, and when it sticks to what it knows it can’t help but feel a bit tired. I really need that middle ground rating curiously absent from steam, as this has got 3/5 written all over it – it feels like a cop out to say “If you want more Batman, you’ll enjoy this” but that’s really what it comes down to – more of the same, except the new parts that are a bit rubbish.

I got it free when I bought my second gtx970 and I'm still upset about this, so I can only imagine how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I would be if I pre ordered this game (which I don't  pre-order games anymore, ever since assasins creed 3)Hopefully the community can come up in arms and force the developer to fix this joke of a port by requesting a refund in mass numbers.I came into this franchise back when Arkham city came out, My first preorder (for ps3) which I loved at the time, then played arkham Origins which ran decently, but had game breaking parts early on (luckily it was patched and works pretty good now) Best case scenerio the developer show's that they actually CARE ABOUT THE PC PORT and will make a patch as soon as possible.If you haven't bought this game yet consider yourself lucky and wait until a patch comes out to make this game playable at respectable frame rates.EDITED:I still can't 100% or even 50% recomend this game, unless you have a 980ti and up, or a g sync monitor, but since the last reviewI changed the max fps from 144 to 60turned off sli profileand I'm now able to run the game around 45 to 60 fps for 80% of the time with the occasional dips to 30 Which doesn't sound great, but IF YOU HAVE A G SYNC MONITOR, and don't mind playing it in mostly low settings, the gameplay is refreshed enough with a story so far that is my favorite of all the last arkham games ""gameplay wise"", I personally do like the car mode and tank mode addition.PLEASE MAKE THIS GAME RUN BETTER DEV'S hopefully they patch this wtihin the week so people can enjoy this game on pc			"

												(Writing this late cause my old computer wasnt able to run it)Wow! I must say as a massive fan of Batman and the Arkham games (Apart from Origins) this is the true epitome of Batman lore. Nothing comes close as it pays homage to so many great characters, In detail I havent seen before! Nothing immerses me as much as a video game does, This is one of the reasons Batman: Arkham Knight is so great (and why I love video games so much :) ). Exploring Gotham is a treat gliding or driving the Batmobile, Announcements pop up from all over and the game constantly engages you to search all around the city. Each Villian has there own feel and interesting story to go with. There are many twists in the game which im sure would have more effect on me if i didnt already know what was going to happen ;) (Massive Batman nerd here), But the way they're revealed is great and enjoyable. The combat is great as always maybe a bit stale now, But this is the final batman game so its been well used and not overdone.There is so much i want to talk about, but it is hard to without spoiling the story and i hate when reviewers do that. I will just say this is the greatest portrayal of the Batman Universe to date and would recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in Batman, i know theres alot of fans out there but still... im really bad at ending this so im just gonna say GO BUY BATMANSSSSSS!!!!

												So, they relaunched the game. As for those of us who waited patiently, we got nothing in return. However, if you're reading this review, you likely don't own the game yet, so this shouldn't influence your decision.There is no SLI support. The game was patched to run better, but it is still far from fixed and not well optimised by any stretch of the imagination (they recommended 12GB of RAM if you're on Windows 10...). SLI support is still apparently coming, but perhaps Star Citizen will release before that happens. I don't recommend this game. It's fine as a game, the combat has far too much of the batmobile (which really isn't engaging or exciting). It hasn't really advanced from Arkham City all that much.Really, unless you're absolutely desperate for the game, you've waited this long, waiting longer for a sizeable discount would be advised.

												Great way of screwing an amazing game. Optimisation is poor and unless you have the best hardware you'll be having problems with this game. I totally recommend the previous three batman titles,but not this one,unless you're a total fan of the series. And 40€ for season pass?! Create a properly running game first,then drop the season pass to a reasonable price and then ask the people to buy it. You guys have hit bottom on the - good product/ proper price - scale.			"

Had freezing completely in my last session a few times. Its frustrating as I really want to play and enjoy this game like I did Batman AA and AC. I hope for all our sakes it gets fixed. Do not recommend.Update: I now have a GTX 980 Ti to replace my two 670s and it runs better but still like garbage after the rerelease. Must be the Windows 10 memory issue as it will run brilliantly for 30 seconds (80+fps )or so then the frame rate will tank to 35ish.Finished the main story line. Its a fun game, I really enjoyed my playtime when I wasnt being frustrated by the games poor performance.SpoilerMark Hamill makes the game. Seriously take the Joker and Mark's performance out of Arkham Knight and it's no where near as memorable. "

Batman: Arkham Knight is not a perfect game, but it has come a long way since launch. You can play it now, most issues have been fixed.I didn't play the game at launch because of all the problems regarding the PC port and I must say that the waiting has paid off with this title. One year later, after numerous patches, the game has fixed most of the performance issues and bugs. Best graphics in a Batman game so far deliver a breathtaking Gotham City that you get to explore at good frame rates. However, I noticed some frame drops in the Batmobile and I see that a lot of people are complaining about the same problem. In 50h of gameplay it crashed once for me, but I was very satisfied with the overall performance.The story is awesome and as far as I can tell you should play Arkham Origins, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City in this order if you want to fully understand and enjoy it. Skip Blackgate - that game is bad. Without going into very much detail: you'll get to fight against most adversaries from the Batman universe and sometimes your assistans will join to help. The Batmobile is a big part of the game and integrates vehicle combat as a new gameplay element. Most of the time you will use it as a tank to destroy drones and it gets repetitive, but sometimes you'll also need it to pass certain puzzles or transport captured villains to your headquarters: the GCPD building.Combat on foot is similar to the previous games - part melee encounters, part stealth sectors where enemies have fire weapons. A new  takedown system and gadgets have been added to Batman's repertoire.Gotham City is your stage once again, but this time you'll encounter more elements from the open-world genre. These come in the form of various optional missions such as liberating towers, taking out drones or disarming land mines. You can treat them as time fillers or new opportunities to test your moves and gadgets. On the other hand, the villain optional missions are more fun and make a better part of the story with mini-boss battles and cut-scenes at the end. All optional missions reward the player with Wayne Tech points needed for upgrading your suit, gadgets and Batmobile. Conclusion: A true sequel to previous Batman games that could have been the perfect ending for the series if it didn't suffer from minor technical problems. Still, worth playing for the amazing graphics, great atmoshpere and story.  "

Maybe code LB to do something else?I deleted the content and let it redownload, then tried again.  It actually mostly worked this time and I got through what seemed to be the first chunk of a mission.  But the framerates would randomly go from 60 to 0 and just freeze for several seconds.  Some of the still frames are quite well done;  I commend the modeling teams for a brilliant effort.

												Thank god for steam refunds. If you don't have a completely up-to-date system, don't even bother trying this game. I have a GTX 960 (not the best card but certainly not the worst) and with every possible setting turned to low/off the game was still completely unplayable. I'm sure there's a decent game under all that lag, but I guess I won't be playing it.Edit: I'm running an i7 3820 3.60 GHz and 8GB of RAM. Like I said in the comments, I've never had a problem running any game on medium-high and sometimes ultra. What I'm gathering from other people is that you pretty much need more than 8GB of RAM to run this game, which imo is ridiculous for a game that came out over a year ago. It could run fine for you or it could not run at all, the point is this game has yet to be properly optimized and it most likely never will be, so buy at your own risk.			"

												I upgraded my PC to a rx 480 and wanted to play a graphics intensive game to test it out. Lo and behold, bamham arkham knight, sequel to 2 of my favorite games, is on sale. I was aware that when this released the game had performance problems, but I was under the impression that a company would fix their game for 1/3 of their fan base after more than a year of its release. I was wrong. I boot up the game, excitedly crank up every single setting to the highest it can go and begin the game. I am immediately greeted with long and noticeable hiccups and dips. Alright then, I think, maybe I'm overestimating my new card. So I lower every single setting to the lowest it could go and see how it runs again. To my surprise, I still ran like absolute garbage, like they actively tried to make their game run as bad as possible. I want to play this, I do, but I literally cannot play this game. I'm not one of those guys who can only play a game in solid 60 fps, but what I'm getting is legitimately unplayable. It's like I'm playing this on a tablet. This is a batman game, so If you miraculously run this game well, then you'll probably like the gameplay.			"

The game is capped at 30 fps, it stinks the scam.We PC gamers, we're tired of being considered the 5 th wheel of the coach.My condolences to those who took the season pass.One more thing, do not buy Killer Instinct on PC, well done Iron Galaxy.

												I almost never review games so it shows just how angry I am. Admittedly, I had few isssues with the initial release. Stutters here and there, missing textures on occasion. But whether or not MY experience was bad doesn't matter. On the whole, it seems a huge number, if not the majority or people who bought this have found it to be unplayable. After three months, the devs finally release a patch supposedly fixing things and SURPRISE...there are still issues. What really gets me though is there way of compensating their loyal fans who stuck with them through the horrible launch. ""Sorry for ruining the final game in a franchise you've loved and followed loyally for years! Here's the other titles for free! Oh you already have them? Payed full price for them all? Well how about some TF2 hats!""Rocksteady/WB, if you read this (why would you when it's apparent you don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥, know I'll never buy a game from you again, and I'll make sure to tell everyone I know the way you treat your fans.It was fun while it lasted!

												Mandatory complaint about one of the game's many issues:Personally I did not experience any kind of crashes so I consider myself lucky in this department, I have seen and read of other's experiences with this. The only thing I experienced throughout the game was the drop in frame rates especially in instances where the batmobile showed up, cinematics, or entering a new zone. Hell even turning around really fast sometimes caused this. It's awful, it's bad, fix please.PC specs:i7 3770 @ 3.48 GB RAMgtx 660Win 8Actual game review:Despite all this I was able to complete the game to avoid the internet spoiling any major goodies this game had to offer. Overall I was pretty happy with the game. The story was great. The batmobile was really fun to drive and unlike many games that allow you to drive a vehicle the batmobile is unstopabble, you're not gonna get stopped by a bench, or a tree, or even a pillar. Boss fights is where I felt this game kind of dropped the ball, I know Arkham Origins is usually ridiculed by the fan base but they handled boss fights quite well, in fact all of the arkham series games did, but Arkham Knight kind of dropped the ball here. Your boss fights will consist more of fighting mobs or you in the batmobile. I definitely enjoyed the side missions this time around and the riddler's race tracks.			"

												This game is still not worth it. This is by far the WORST entry in the Arkham series, Origins included. Don't get me wrong, the game plays well and there are some stellar aspects (Joker related) - Batmobile is overused and improperlly used. Feels forced into the game. - Story doesn't feel coherent and is all over the place- 90% of the side missions are just an utter joke with only a few spots that feel like a ""story"" - Deathstroke battle in a tank......- Many dumb choices that ""Batman"" would never make or would be smart enough to figure out/not get fooled by. - Riddler races... Yeah, someone should be fired for these. They make no sense being apart of the game; More of that batmobile being used unnessesarily.			"

												Batman Arkham Knight is one of 2015's biggest releases.If you're on Console.WB Games has released another technological wonder; Arkham Knight! It's a wonder in a sense of ''how the hell did this get past play testing'', kinda similar to their last wonder of Mortal Kombat X.Over the past few months while Rocksteady was patching this game, I defended them, I said it worked fine for me, hell, I was happy with that September patch.This patch? It's more of a bittersweet situation. On one hand of the situation; we got all the DLC, which is a great thing for Season Pass holders like myself, if only I had gotten the content when it released like the Season Pass advertised.Then the compensation? YOU; THE PLAYER GET THE LOVELY PRIZE OF.... All the Arkham Games, cause you know, anyone that has this is, the final installment in the series, definitely wouldn't have the first 2 (or three if you count Origins) and a 2D sidescroller that they ported from the 3DS. Pretty much nothing in my opinion.If you're gonna offer compensation, offer it right. Also, the game is still bugging out even more after that patch.THANKS WB.			"

												I'm so glad they finally fixed this. Now I can pay to get all the DLC of the console version while it still runs like garbage on my computer despite meeting the minimum specs and cranking every setting through the floor. I'm not saying I expect every game in a franchise, especially one spanning multiple years, to have the same requirements, but on minimum it looks like garbage compared to the previous Arkham games... and somehow runs worse. I would almost be impressed if I hadn't wasted money on this. On the bright side, the latest patch improved performance from sub 15 frames per second average to sub 17 frames per second average, an improvement of not nearly enough %.UPDATE:As of November, the game is still shamefully broken, but at least there's more DLC support. In solidarity with idiots who purchased before knowing how broken the game is, the minimum specifications still reflect some fantasy port we didn't get so anyone who browses the store page will not know that apparently they need 12GB of RAM to get the game to run on Windows 10, because how to program. But at least the November DLC is supported with the new patches.			"

												Instead of optimizing the game, rocksteady put effort in mocking gamers with their stupid inside jokes. Haha funny, funny thing is I will most probably never buy a game from rocksteady and warnerbros again.Edit: There are no real boss fights, like in the first arkham games.Somehow all characters look ugly. They selected ugly actors for the females. The face of poison ivy looks like, as if she is a 45 Soccer mom. The other females in the game, don't look feminine neither their faces or bodies. Gordon and Bruce looks like some minecraft character. What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on with their jaws? Bodybuilding face, but body of some 12 year old.Batman looks very scrawny, for a guy who can supposedly benchpress 400kg. Do you even lift Batman? Battank is annoying, every few seconds you have to use it. I forced myself to play the game, because I didn't buy the game from steam to get a refund.			"

												-Bought retail version that had 5 discs.-Came back home, installed a mere 7GB from disc while having to download 30GB from steam.-Started the game after waiting 15 hours for download to finish, enjoyed 1hr of Batman running on MS powerpoint simulator.-Heard there was refund option, but realized cannot get refund for retail version.Now sitting here on Youtube watching other people play on PS4 with my controller in my hand pretending that I'm playing. It was a much more enjoyable experience than actually playing the PC version.			"

												When Batman Arkham Knight first came out on PC it was a complete disaster; I like many other PC gamers was very annoyed at how poorly it ran and how frequently it crashed; however I was on the lucky side of the stick and was able to complete the game. On October 28th the Interim Patch was finally released (as well as all the DLC up until that point); the game also went back on sale and things from here started to look up - the game ran much better and there were a lot more options available for PC users such as framerate cap, Anisotropic Filtering, higher quality textures, shadows and lighting. Since Oct 28th the game received an update every month (up until the point I'm writing this review) that would have performance fixes, stability improvements and included DLC that was being released monthly in the Season Pass.Batman Arkham Knight runs a lot better than it did on day one; provided you meet the system requirements you should have no issues running the game. Just make sure you have the latest drivers.I haven't focused much on the gameplay/story side because there are thousands of other reviews out there - I will say this; if you're going to get this game you need the Season Pass; the extra DLC, AR challenges, Story Packs and Skins really adds necessary depth to the game. I am quite happy changing this review from a negative to a positive - I would also imagine most negative reviews are pre Oct 28th. I'm not endorsing the state the game was originally released in but the fact is it runs a lot smoother; if you are still holding off buying the game just go and get it.While it may not be the epic finale we deserved it's still a great game any 'Arkham' fan should pick-up.P.S. I can guarantee people will rate this down because even 7 months later it's still the cool thing to hate on this game.			"

Feels like the performance is even worse now. Dont buy this game for such a ridiculous amount of money they charge here on Steam. You pay full price for a broken product that will NEVER gonna work and it will never be fixed.			"

												Steer clear, for now anyway.The game is riddled with performance issues on launch, 6/22. The game suffers from massive stuttering which appears to be caused by the game world streaming in the background. The game world seems to pop-in right before your eyes. Plenty of games are able to achieve smooth gameplay whilst also being open world. This is not acceptable, Rocksteady.Additionally, Rocksteady seems to think covering the game in blur filters, aggressive depth of field and what appears to be chromatic abberation looks good. It does not look good, and you cannot turn off these options within the game. The image quality is very disappointing. Instead of Gotham being beautiful, it looks like a washed-out blurry mess.I am considering a refund.			"

This has been the most epic of fails in the history of fails to which all future fails will be compared.Only consider this on a deep discount and you enjoy playing the ""get the game to run playably"" metagame or if they actually fix it someday.

WB's damage control is in full effect. the game has been delayed till fall 2015?! wtf just wtf, the consoles had a damn near 4 GB day one patch and pc has had literally nothing.This sounds like a giant lawsuit incoming especially with all the damage control going out.

												Where do I even start? I ordered this with the promo for my gtx 970 and thought I would be getting the Harley Quinn DLC I was grossly mistaken. Apparently on all other platforms people will be getting free dlc including the pc version IF you did not get it with the Nvidia Promo Bundle. What a rip off techincally this is a ""pre order"" but apparently the idea of preorders is now is subjective. It gets even better with this fine qoute from our friends at rock steady "": Arkham Knight. This is something that Rocksteady takes very seriously. We are working closely with our external PC development partner ."" They did not even have the decency to por the game within their own studios. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that they neglected to tell pc users that they would be using Denuvo DRM. In the end sure I got a free game but maybe next time they should give their consumers full disclosure so when making 329 dollar decsions they will think twice and buy a different brand video card. I was excited that it came with two free games one of them being the witcher which has had no real issues and the other bineg this broken game. Well done my hat is off to you guys at rocksteady I was going to buy the 40 dollar season of dlc but now that money is going elsewhere.			"

												Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Arkham Asylum and City. They're among my favorite games (City being my all time favorite). So naturally I was very excited for this game. I had full faith in Rocksteady after their previous works but unfortunately, they ♥♥♥♥ed up. Arkham Knight is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. You probably already know how horrible the port is, so I'm not going to talk about that. I'll focus on the game itself. Let's start with the story. I personally didn't like it. I found it cliche and boring. There is not a single memorable moment in the entire campaign. It is unbelievably cliche. Same with villains. Scarecrow was awesome in Asylum. Here, he is a joke. He doesn't do anything, just talks about fear. Arkham Knight is even worse. He is very boring and weak. He calls you a coward but hides behind an army of drones. His 'boss battles' are terrible. His identity is ridiculously obvious. If you have the slightest comic book knowledge you'll immediately know who he is and if not don't worry, game tells you who he is way before it is actually revealed. Also SPOILER ALERT I'm really sick of these people's obsession with Joker. I get it he's a good villain but he doesn't need to be the main villain in all Batman games. Oh yeah, you thought this was about Arkham Knight? Nope! Joker is the main villain again. ♥♥♥♥ you Rocksteady.Gameplay is also kinda messed up. Many people claim it's the best in the series but it's not. It has a few nice improvements and it has much more depth but it lacks the smoothness that made Asylum and City so great. Input drops, attacking an armored enemy instead of the normal enemy right next to him, losing combo for no reason are only some of these problems. The new environmental takedowns look cool but they are unreliable. Sometimes they cause you to drop your combo for no reason. Same with picking weapons from ground. The detection on these thing was so bad, I stopped using them after a while. Also the camera during combat felt a little more zoomed in than previous games and it often caused me to lose my combo. I also hated the new big enemies. They're essentially the armored enemies from City but they're so hard to distinguish in the heat of combat. In City, they wore red vests so you'd immediately spot them. Here, they look like regular enemies but just bigger. Fear takedown is also a new addition, it looks cool but its implementation is awful. Forget about relying on that thing. Anytime I wanted to use a fear takedown in a tight spot Batman just punched air and got me killed.Of course the big new thing in this game is the batmobile. It's fun for a bit but it's way overused. You use it to get around, solve puzzles, fight tanks. Game forces it on you so much. You can't take two steps without it and I'm sorry but that's just stupid. Just like Riddler race tracks. I mean, just think about it. Riddler creating race tracks for batmobile. Nice one Rocksteady.Arkham City had great side missions. Admittedly, they were a little repetitive. What I mean is, they mostly consisted of doing the same thing 3-4 times. Arkham Knight takes this to a ridiculous level. Almost every side mission in the game has you doing the same thing time after time again. Specially those god damn Militia missions. They're just a cheap way to increase the game's length in my opinion.Remember challenge maps? They're gone. They are replaced with AR challenges and these suck. You cannot play as other characters in them and they have awful blue walls around them. So disappointing. There is only one fun AR challenge and you don't even play as Batman in that one. More than half of these damn things are for batmobile. We get it Rocksteady. You're really proud of that damn tank. Stop shoving it to our faces.If you've made it this far you probably noticed I suck at long reviews and I agree with you. So I'll stop here. Batman Arkham Knight is a terrible port, it has a boring, cliche story, good but not good enough combat, way too much batmobile, the worst villains of the series, awful side missions (a couple exceptions) and a very disappointing ending. Way to end your legacy Rocksteady. "

												Underneath the issues and poor performance is a game I'd really like to enjoy. Underneath all the bugs, is a game I'd love to experience at its best. Underneath the missing graphical effects is a game I'd love to see in it's true form. But that is not Arkham Knight PC version. Arkham Knight on PC is one of the worst ports I have ever come across. I honestly did not think a game could be as horrible as AC Unity. But I am proven wrong. The game's mechanics seem very nice so far even though I am very early into the game and it's story. But the constant FPS drops and overall stuttering is a HUGE turn off to play this game to begin with. The lack of graphical settings to choose from is pathetic. The fact that the game is locked to 30 FPS and can only be disabled by editing an ini file is rediculous. I have seen many people trying to help each other out by giving out tips on editing the ini file to increase performance. Which is nice to see I'll say that. It's not often I see the gaming community trying to help each other out.But a AAA title should NOT and I repeat NOT be released like this to the consumers. It is utterly disgusting that players themselves have to actually take time to edit ini files to try squeeze out as much performance as they can even though they meet the recommended requirements or are even far above them. I've seen some people call others ""entitled"" and to ""relax it's just a game"" as well as ""if you don't like it, get a refund"" among other more nasty comments. Thats entirely besides the point and honestly, the people dishing out those comments need to wake up and realize that releases like this are just a big no. You wouldn't want to buy a physical product and have it barely work would you? ""Oh it's just a TV, it's ok that it stutters and that the screen goes black every 5 seconds"" I doubt you people would be fine with that would you?The point is that a AAA publisher and developer should not be releasing something like this to their consumers. Paying $60/+ for something that runs like pure garbage is just unacceptable. And WB deserves every bit of hate they get for it. They knew very well what the PC version was like. And they still released it. The story so far to me seems to be interesting enough. But I still feel like it's going to be difficult to enjoy it due to all of the issues present in the game. This game could have been an amazing PC release. But due to WB's lack of care and poor choices on the PC Port. I honestly cannot recommend this game to anybody. Unless it's bugs and performance issues are resolved, this game is something I would stay away from. It is not worth the money and honestly, I think WB is going to have to do a lot to make up for this. While I did not pre order the game. I was tempted to buy it shortly after it's release. And so I did. But I see now that it was a mistake. I hope that some big shiny pure patches come soon and fix all of these issues. Otherwise I will not be buying another game from WB ever again.  "

												Biggest letdown of the series. The story seems great but 4 MONTHS TO FIX THE GAME? Really. And you release updates on the status of the updates. WB had their money coming in from the console version so did not lift a finger to do anything about the PC version. The game was released intentionally with all the bugs as it could not have passed Beta testing in any way. Biggest FU to the paying customer I have ever seen from a game publisher.			"

												Please read this review before you buy the game!Batman: Arkham Knight is a great game! But the game is really bad optimized, i mean really. When i started to play the game i found out it's capped to 30 fps, but you can change it in the game files. but the problem is that when you drive around in the Batmobile you get around 10-15 FPS! And that is really BAD, because you don't want to play a game where you only have 10-15 FPS, you can't play a game with 10-15 FPS! So before you buy this game be ready for FPS lag, i would say you should wait for patching! But because Batman Arkham Knight has such a great story i would give it a 7/10. If the game was optimized it would give it 9/10!P.S. There is A LOT of spike lags in the game!			"

I definitely dont recommend this game, I got it for free with my GFX card, otherwise i wouldnt pay a dime to this company. Especially after the garbage pc port scandal, which is done by Warner Bros intentionally in my opinion,to prevent the game from getting pirated and get the most out of console versions meanwhile.

												Rocksteady should be ashamed that they released the game in this state. Don't be fooled: the problems with this port are not subtle. They cannot be explained away simply by claiming that the issues are uncommon and weren't uncovered by play testing. I have a 980 ti, one of the most high end and expensive cards available for purchase. I had to turn down the settings to achieve a playable frame-rate. In one instant I'll be at 60-70+ fps, and a second later, I'll be at 25, with no difference in the action on-screen. Oh, and don't forget, the only reason I was able to go over 30 is because I manually changed a config file that states any frame rate over 30 will make the game unstable. It blows my mind that a company would release a product in this state. It's all about greed. They are confident they can take your money, release an apology, and take their time fixing the most glaring issues in an economical way. Rocksteady deserves all the negative press they will continue to get, and more.			"

YouTube™ Video: Batman: Arkham Knight [PC Review] 

			Views: 398		

			My review of the broken PC version of ""Batman: Arkham Knight"", the last installment in Rocksteady's superhero trilogy. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook:...		

Game: Batman: Arkham KnightGenre: Action-Adventure Open WorldDeveloper: Rocksteady StudiosPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentCopy supplied by NvidiaBatman: Arkham Knight is the final instalment in the open world action-adventure superhero franchise that started in 2009, and is developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.STORYNine months after the events of Arkham City, the Scarecrow developes an improved and deadlier version of his fear toxin and threatens to release it in the city of Gotham. The police evacuates all the civilians and stays behind to arrest all the criminals that are destroying the city and to help Batman capture Scarecrow and the other supervillains (Two Face, Penguin, Riddler, etc.). Also, there is a new enemy in town: the Arkham Knight, someone who built an army and invaded Gotham with the sole objective to kill the Batman.Does this sound interesting? Yes, it does. Is it entertaining? Not really. While it starts strong, the story gets boring really fast: they try to make you care about multiple characters from the comics that barely made cameos in the previous games, the villains do almost nothing at all, the Arkham Knight's reveal is a huge disappointment and the 100% completion ending doesn't make much sense. Fortunately, the saving grace is the presence of an old character that comes back during the game, elevating the quality of the story quite a lot for me.GRAPHICSThe game looks spectacular: huge city full of details and easter eggs, constant rain, beautiful animations and varied environments make this one of the prettiest games ever. However, as we all know the PC version also features missing features and painful optimization: even though I modified the .ini files and used a tweak tool, there are still many problems with the performance. And this is without talking about all the glitches that are present, like enemies disappearing inside walls, objectives that don't activate, entire riots of enemies that run away.Note that this section will be updated once WB and Rocksteady fix everything, but we can't forgive them for this barely playable first release.GAMEPLAYThe melee combat is mostly unchanged: you attack and counter enemies in brawl, while also adopting different attacks depending on which enemy you are fighting. Some nice improvements are the possibility to punch downed enemy without losing your combo, grabbing bats and other weapons to deal more damage and to use environmental kills. In some sections you are also helped by Robin, Catwoman or Nightwing, who are playable for a small amount of time each.The open world is vast and features many tropes of recent Ubisoft games: control a tower, defeat strongholds, find collectibles. Fortunately, the varied environments, vibrant city and multiple side missions make this an enjoyable experience: gliding around the city, finding Azrael, looking for Riddler Trophies, saving firemens and helping the GCPD makes you really feel like you are the Batman.And now, to the most diving section of the gameplay: the Batmobile. When I started playing, I loved it: it runs fast but you always feel fully in control, the combat controls are tight and precise and there are some interesting implementations in some puzzles. However, after 10 hours where you have spent over half of your time shooting tanks and chasing cars, it gets really annoying. The game becomes repetitive, and because of the Batmobile's presence, all of the boss fights have been changed with big tanks to blow up, and stealth sections have been reduced way too much.While there are some nice additions, the side missions are very interesting and varied and the open world is fun to explore, the Batmobile is shoved down our throats and it becomes the most annoying element in the game, sucking most of the fun out of it.CHALLENGEEven though I started on Hard, the game is very easy to beat: I found the fights shorter and easier to win, the stealth sections with many covers and AI that wanders alone, the Batmobile chases repetitive and the tank sections a dodge-and-shoot borefest.SOUNDKevin Conroy, Troy Baker, Jonathan Banks, Grey Griffin and many other voice actors come back to the game, and they all work very well. The sound effects are great as always, as well as having the same powerful punching sound effects. The Batmobile also sounds fantastic, resembling the sounds featured in the Christopher Nolan trilogy. Nick Arundel also comes back as composer, and does a fantastic job enhancing your Batman experience.REPLAYABILITYOpen world full of activities, New Game+ mode, 79 achievements, upcoming DLC and a ridiculous amount of Riddler challenges make this a game that us fans will keep playing for a long time.Overall, I would recommend this game only when its technical issues have been fixed. Right now, the large amount of bugs, poor performance and missing graphical features don't make this a worthwile purchase. Also, the overuse of the Batmobile and uninteresting story will put off many players, making them miss the better paced previous installments. I wanted to love this game. I love all the others, and I went into this with high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.Story: 7Graphics: 5Gameplay: 7.5Challenge: 7Sound: 8.5Replayability: 8ENJOYMENT: 7FRUSTRATION: 8Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group "

												Wow! Early contender for worst launch of the year, this game is simply not ready for PC yet. Last minute removal of Pre Order bonuses (got the game for free but still...)Shouldn't have a 30FPS lock, no option in game for disabling it.30FPS constant would be an upgrade at this stage, FPS just fluctuates wildly, one moment I'm getting 60, the next 1, or less.Motion blur is horrible, makes fighting harder.Constant stutter.Running a 270X and a 3570k (Latest drivers), I know I don't meet the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t last minute minimum specs but I can play EVERY OTHER GAME IN THE WORLD, in some way shape or form.I can't play this game at ANY setting or ANY resolution, I even tried 720p lowest settings and still got horrific stutter/freezing.Avoid this game until it's fixed.

												Completely unplayable for people with really good PCs, that should destroy this game, not have the game destroy the PC.  Unnacceptable.  Will gladly re-review this after a patch, but only giving it 48 hours.  Shame on Rocksteady for not letting us know in advanced that it was ported from another company.  I paid $60 for a game from Rocksteady, not for Rocksteady to pass my preffered version (PC) to an ""external company"".  Just like the Call of Duty series, most of the EA games, the Assassins Creed series, the Halo series, and now the Batman series (or anything related to Rocksteady), I will never give them another cent.  Shame on them for letting this be released in this condition.  Rather have a week to a 6 month wait with delays than be a beta-tester for this game.  First, we should get a discount since this game isn't worth $5 in this state, and second, a formal apology for those that gave too much trust to a company like Rocksteady.			"

												Another great example what is wrong with the current Games Industry. Apart from the poorly performance of this port (hey we give you a game with your graphic card, that you cant run), it hurts me almost physical how aggresively the DLC politic is shoved down our throats. ""Season pass here, pre order bonus there. Join our useless portal to get exclusive stuff."" its like you have to visit the grandma who cant stands you and feeds you with all stuff of bad candy. It just feels wrong in every way. And dont let me start on the first impression I got from the stuff I saw so far in game. I mean, I loved the 2 other Arkham games from Rocksteady, but it just seems, like they run out of ideas and said ""f*ck it, lets put the Batmobile into it"". Yeah a lot of people want to drive that massive vihicle, but there is a huge different in ""wanting"" and ""have to"". Apart from that, the controls of the Dark Knights biggest toy, feels sluggish. But to be fair, that is just a first impression, maybe its something I can get used to. Oh and the graphical options are a freaking joke, like only the Clown of Crime could pull off. Most options can only be changed after restarting the game. The description of the different options are as transparent as a brick wall. Anti Alliasing = Yes - No...Really? Maybe, just maybe this will all be fixed, after a glorious Patch-Festival, but for now, dont buy that thing. In fact, that dlc policy that WB pulls of, only justifies a heavely discounted all in one version. I'm sorry for rocksteady, but that game seems way to rushed by the publisher. WB should look at another company with 2 big letters, because they are about to go down the same path.			"

												If you enjoyed Origins, you'll likely enjoy this. It's quite a play it safe sequel in terms of new features and story. Story constantly teases the whole ""how far will Batman go? Will he break this time?”. Story to me is a bit of a let-down, the trailers made it out to be that all these major villains are joining forces to kill Batman, when in reality it's just Scarecrow and Arkham knight, with the other villains just being side missions...quite repetitive ones at that. There is no sense of danger throughout the game, yes Scarecrow is threatening to blow up a chemical bomb, yes Arkham Knight has a whole militia in Gotham...but there is no one in Gotham....just a few thugs going for a joy ride. At least in City you felt some sense of urgency with Batman's declining health and the countdown to protocol 10, you had this feeling that you have to win against the odds. In this game, none of that.Gameplay wise, I can't complain, everything to love about the Arkham games is here and improved. More enemy types, more gadgets, better adaptive AI. It's fine, although a tad easy at times. You can take a lot of punishment, to a point stealth is pointless in some predator areas....not all but some. Batmobile is....meh? It's cool to drive around and how it moves around the city is pretty cool, you feel like you are in some badass tank/sports car. How it's used in the game? Some of the puzzle sections are quite fun and do require thought but part of me wished there was a bit less of it. Towards the end of the game it felt like a chore. My main complaint of gameplay are the damn tank battles...why? So many tedious tank battles...I haven't felt this bored from a side activity since the tower defence in assassin's creed revelations. Again, it's fine early on, but after a while they don't up the difficulty they just make you fight hordes of tanks to a point it’s just mashing the fire button while sliding left and right. Haven't mentioned anything about the PC port being god awful....It's embarrassing that a AAA title which was released back in June is stilling being patched. The game was playable enough for me to get what I wanted from it...which wasn't much. Regardless, it’s pitiful and no excuse can be made for releasing a game in the condition it was in. Once it’s patched up and fixed, I would say it’s an ok game. Better than Origins, not as good as the first two games. If you want more Batman, get it. The open world is fun and at times you do feel like batman, just feels like there was a lot more to be desired, or maybe they probably squeezed all they could out of the franchise. Just a shame it ended the way it did for PC gamers, even when they fix this game, to me it will always be known as that ok Batman game which was a terrible port. It’s like a big fart.6/10-For all you number people "

												I beat the game when it first came out. It wasnt exactly the 60fps my gtx 980 usually sings, but it was playable. Now I waited four months to start NGP and play the DLC (I own the season pass btw). Final update comes today and what do I find? WB once again unzipping their pants with that weird smile. The only dlc available to me(for free) is the stuff released on launch. My @$$hole can only take so muchUpdate 10/29....I now have all the dlc. I guess WB sure has ways of making a guy feel special, they're not too bad of a publisher! Afterall, I was wearing pretty seductive clothing with all that money hanging out.10/10  Would get buttfcked again			"

												It'll be nice to finally have access to the DLC Season Pass I purchased 4 months ago when the patch comes out Oct 28th. But my interest has waned and I have no desire to play this garbage port anymore. I've moved on to bigger, and better games, like Clicker Heroes. I get more enjoyment out of that than I ever did from Batman: Arkham Knight, which is actually quite sad.The voice acting is phoned in (which is disappointing, because Kevin Conroy is my favorite Batman); the graphics leave much to be desired (maybe this will finally be fixed with the Oct 28th  patch?); the music is forgettable; the big reveal falls flat; the lack of true bossfights makes the game a bore; and the heavy reliance on the Batmobile for advancing through the story is not only frustrating, but repetative and unimaginative.Well done, Rocksteady/WB. I should have gotten a refund when I had the chance.			"

												When Arkham Knight was announced I knew I needed to play it, so to wait for it, I started to play the 3 previous games.I migrated to PC gaming recently from consoles, so they were the first games I played on PC, the experience was awesome, graphics were amazing, history was incredible, I simple just love them.I bought Arkham Knight right after its release, but I was still playing Arkham City at that time and I still needed to play Arkham Origins, also at that time the complains about performance started and the game was temporally removed from Steam. I didn't asked for a refund since I really wanted to play it whenever it would be available again, so I just waited.When I finished Arkham Origins I was ready to start with Arkham Knight, at that time it came back to Steam and most performance issues were fixed, I'm not going to lie you, I spend some time trying to configure the video settings to get the best performance/quality, and I did it, my PC is an Alienware Alpha which has a GeForce GTX 860M graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5, it is not too big but worked for me. I was able to play and enjoy this game a lot.So now that I talked about the performance experience, I want to talk about my experience with the story of the game.For some reason in these games you really feel you are Batman, the missions and information got your attention, there are details everywhere and it doesn't feel repetitive like other open-world games. The introduction of the batmobile feels weird at the beginning, but you get familiar with it quickly, sometimes you really wish to have it right next to you. Personally I prefer the enemies that represent mystic, dark or powerful characters over the enemies that are just mobs or militia, which were the main characters on this game, thinking about this detail, I believe Arkham City was better, but for the rest, I think Arkham Knight is offering a great improvement, it is good to learn about all the Batman family story and work with all of them. I really recommend it because I loved it. Performance issues are fixed and this game is playable now, don't worry about it.PD: The batsuit in this game is the best suit I have ever seen in Batman movies or games, I really wanted this suit for Batman v Superman, but anyway...

												The best epic story of the Arkham Series and Rocksteady Studios showed us again how should a Batman game be. It makes you think like The Batman, makes you feel like him. It is just basicly letting you be ""The Batman"". If you are fan of the franchise, ignore the optimization issues, they will be fixed in time.

Posted: October 28, 2015
												===2nd UPDATE===Here is a couple things that need to be mentioned first. 4 Months ago Batman Arkham Knight was pulled of Steam, at the time before the first miniature patch I was able to play this game fine at locked 30 fps and it was smooth due to community fixes. We all know who that is and he has done more work than entire Rocksteady and WB combined. So 4 months have past and the interim patch broke my game much worse than the previous patch. So it was even more broken, once again I was forced to use community patches done by community and not WB and Rocksteady. Then today comes and I am expecting to play DLC's. As you can see from my playtime I already pushed over 100Hrs into this game. Well guess what, I have troubleshooted multiple times and yet to recieve all said DLC supposed to be released today. I was expecting to be able to play DLC's but that is not the case. From what I read on Forums the Season Pass holders have some serious issues and have been pretty much scandaled. Now Pros-Game runs decent if you lower your settings and not overdo things. Gameworks look good. -Story was very well done and even the Riddler challenges were decent.-When game ran smoothly on launch for me game mechanics were amazing and fluid.-Lots of funny references and well done comedy. -Unexcepted Ending though depends what you think is good.Cons-Rain textures still buggy, Only work every once in while.-Gamework options are horrible for performance and should not even be touched or turned on period-Game runs worse then launch day.-SLI is still not fixed for those with said setup-Villian claimed to be original isn't at all but a lie. Die Hard Fans Know him very well-WB support is horrendious-Apparently game now needs 12GB of RAM on Win 10. This is not realistic at all.-DLC Content not fully released to Season Pass Holders-Compensation done by WB is worthless if a diehard fan. If you own the games then your out of luck.-Promises still being broken and patch notes released are not even patch notes but a joke.All said and done I would not recomment this game to anyone and if you have a console then get it for that instead. PC right now has been treated poorly and WB has done nothing but lie through their teeth. Many Claims made and promises broken. Releasing the game with no performance gains is unacceptable. Many have claimed performance has yet to change.===New Information===After almost 6 hours DLC content is now downloading and can't wait to play said DLC's. Though I hear that for some game is even more broken now with DLC's installed so I am crossing my fingers hoping I do not fall into that category. Though even with DLC's finally being released finally I still would not recommend buying this game for PC. Get it for Console since it works marvelously on that since the PC community was not a priority.I will state though the story is fantastic and a masterpiece but sadly ruined by many of the game issues that plague this version. You can get the game running much better but you have to go really far out of your way to get the fixes and at least doable.===Additional Update===After playing the game after its re-release I will say the game still needs massive fixes.Without using 3rd party help from specific topics in Batman Arkham Knight forum this game would still be heavily unplayable for many. Though WB recently announced that until the end of 2015 refunds through steam and only purchased through steam are available to get full refund without worry of your playtime. I have obtained my refund and is still pending but time will only tell if the game gets any more serious fixes. On top of that WB also mentioned that they will speak to the community about things that apparently can not be fixed in the game. Reason why I got my refund. This is a warning flag in my mind and so be wary of this title. Tried playing the DLC's but some like the Red Hood DLC kept crashing and I felt there was no story with that DLC. Just mostly you fighting a bunch of enemies and majority of the Vehicle skins can only be used in racing which is a shame.			"

Disappointed and a little angry that they plopped out this pile after so many delays.

Posted: April 10, 2016
												I think it's important to contribute a review that doesn't just focus on the technical issues. I bought it recently and have played about 20 hours. I haven't had a single glitch in that time. Follow the recommended specs, and you should be fine.For the game itself, it's both good and bad. I still like Asylum the best of the series. I think it was actually the right size in terms of gameplay with a good progression overall to both main and side quests. This game is enormous, and it's really not always in a good way.First, the good:The Batmobile is pretty awesome. I was genuinely surprised. I thought it would by clunky and pointless like most attempts to add vehicles into established series are, but it actually plays really well. I think the chase side missions involving the batmobile are some of the most fun in the game. The pseudo-destruction reaped upon the city as you mow down statues and cleave off corners of walls adds to the feeling that you're driving an incredibly powerful machine. Mowing down an entire riot of baddies sending them flying in all directions is also entertaining. It's over-powered, but the game compensates for that by locking off encounters that should be fought without it.The new types of side missions are also cool. I like the addition of the flying drones, and the takedown method for them is clever. The different types of bad guys are managed well, and there are lots of creative opportunities for playing around with your abilities.The Mediocre:The story has its good points, but a lot of it is really melodramatic and predictable. Harley Quinn's voice is the single most annoying thing ever created. Picture everything she says as voiced by Jar Jar for added entertainment value. The way The Joker is handled is a lot of fun. I think that's the most entertaining part of the story. The part that's trying to be a Nolan movie just fell on its face for me. Yea, I get it already. Joker/Batman represent an ethical duality where they're both really two sides of the same coin. They exist outside the law pursuing their own view of the world at the expense of society based solely on their own beliefs. Blah blah blah. Please stop beating me over the head with it like it's not a simple, well-trodden idea. It works really well when they treat it as satire. The Joker has some great moments openly mocking you or egging you on. A number of times I wished I could actually choose to do what he suggested. That would've made a much better game in my opinion. There's also some good chatter of the generic bad guys commenting on elements of the world or just their own generic nature. When it tries to take itself seriously, it becomes dull in its trauma.The Bad:This game is huge. This seems like a weird thing to cite as bad, but it's so absurdly large that it becomes genuinely aggravating. The side quests are the biggest example. There's an entire wheel of side quests. I'm not sure how many there are exactly, but I'd estimate around 20. They're not just go somewhere, do the thing, and finish the quest type of deals. You go do the thing, and then five more of that thing appear an hour later. So you go do those five, but then still five more appear another hour later. After fifteen to twenty-five of them, you might finally be done. That's the case for nearly every single one of the twenty different side quests. Some things aren't even official side quests but still need to be eliminated anyway like the aerial drones.So you clear out a sector of the map. Then you progress in the story a little, and all of a sudden that sector isn't clear anymore. It's not filled with something new and cool though. It just has a few more of exactly the same time-consuming thing you already cleared out the first time. It's fun clearing out the aerial drones the first 5-8 times. When they start appearing four more at a time in the late game, it's just painful. The checkpoints would also be fun just a few times, but there are like 40 of them to clear out. Many of the side quests are really just the same thing in a ""different situation."" Rescuing firefighters, clearing military checkpoints, and clearing out watchtowers all involve taking out exactly the same clustered group of baddies in basically the same way. You're just doing it for a supposedly different goal. Every single one of those will have to be done so many times to fulfill their own quests that you'll have no desire to finish them. My hat is off to anyone who has 100% this game. That's a Sisyphean task to me.It goes further. There are 243 riddler puzzles. I kid you not. I'm actually bored just by the idea of going after them all. It's obvious someone just went through the map after they finished this massive city and stuck a trophy in every single place you could possibly fit one. It's obnoxious. All of this goes against basic game design principles. Have a clear and varied progression that increases in challenge. Most of the content in this game is the same thing over and over. The unfortunate part of that is it really takes away from the parts of the game that are well-designed and do present a varied challenge. I understand they were trying to make a huge epic conclusion, but they really cluttered it up and made it shallow by throwing in too much of the same kinds of content.Synopsis:Overall I recommend it. I paid about $13 for it on sale, and I think I got more than enough good content for my money. I'd pay up to $20 for it. Pay the price tag if you really love the series and know you can run it. The story isn't bad and does have both fun and cool moments. The batmobile is awesome to play with, and the city is fun to fly around sporadically wrecking baddies. Explore the more varied content until you feel like you've seen everything you want to, and then quit. Much of the extra content and side quests quickly become overly similar and boring. Don't plan to 100% the game. For reference, I did 100% Asylum and loved it. I wouldn't recommend even trying to 50% this one in terms of completing all side quests and clearing all sectors. It's not a fun task. Play through the main story and explore, and you'll have a good time with it. I'd say 7/10 for a rating.			"

												Batmobile™: Arkham Knight is the finale of Rocksteady's Batman series. The original title of this game was deliberately misleading in order to surprise fans when they discover the true protagonist of this game, the Batmobile. Drive around the stunningly beautiful Gotham City and take in the sights at a smooth 20FPS, all while blowing up unmanned APCs and blasting unarmed men with your taser. The gameplay is a mix between Twisted Metal and Burnout, you chase down cars, blast them with your cannons, then drive up walls. Gotham City has become so lawless even the laws of physics no longer apply. Team up with old foes and release plant spores all over the city, because your frame rate wasn't tanking hard enough. Unfortunately the good also comes with the bad. Just when you thought you were free from the universally reviled fighting segments from the previous games, you get kicked out of the Batmobile occasionally and have to control Batman. Fight through waves of mindless goons and throw a few batarangs so you can progress to the next driving segment. On the bright side, the dreaded challenge maps from the previous games were removed and were instead replaced by racecourses so you can drive your cool car around some more. The story contains the greatest twist out of all the Arkham games. You learn that Batman, the world's greatest detective, is unfathomably stupid. Watch as he discovers the blinking bomb shaped device in the road happens to actually be a bomb, and be drawn to the edge of your seat with anticipation as Batman tries to identify who the Arkham Knight is, because you probably figured it out immediately. Overall I'd recommend this game to driving game enthusiasts everywhere and fans of Harley Quinn's massive assHOLYSHIT.I know you've all looked, you can't lie to me.			"

												With a system thats currently middle of the pack between the min req. specs and current top end for pcs in general, this is still nearly unplayable. Sub 1fps during the opening scenes, and during the the batmobile scenes. 10-15 the rest of the time. Turning all settings to the lowest/off, and with the resolution at 1280x720, it's still not very nifty and windowed mode made little difference.And while yes, this is a BRAND NEW RELEASE... Dear god Rocksteady, your previous titles rocked our socks off, why the terribad performance this round?This plays worse than gta4 did after release. At least that had consistant lag for me, so it was playable, if slowly. the fps spikes are too random for me to bother with just yet.Waiting for an update.patch #1 update; controls randomly freak out and get stuck in one directional path (constant a press to head left for instance.) no improvement ingame (though expected, still sucks.) and the game exit crash is gone, as well as it causing explorer to lock up. some good, some bad.Most of the side missions require you to be fast and have split second timing. Sadly, with things the way they are, you can't even have multi second timing. I've gotten up and gotten a glass of water and come back to it just starting to unfreeze.			"

												Oh boy do we have a winner here guys.Ok first off, if you're not the slightest bit tech savy you have to deal with the 30 fps lock (which it constantly dips below on my 970). It's an easy fix by changing the setting in the ini file. what's weird is the benchmark runs at a smooth 60 with everything cranked up except the Nvidia options at 1080p. In game, the only time im experiencing the 60 fps is when i'm running around and during combat. Get in the batmobile, get slammed with drops to around or below 30fps (maybe thats why they capped it at 30??? Because its super noticible when transitioning to on foot). Same thing with grappling or gliding. As it stands the game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ i've been hearing the games runs exactly the same on 980s, and that was the ♥♥♥♥ing card they recommended to run the game maxed out. This game is a joke on PC. DO NOT BUY!!!Glad i got this peice of garbage for free with my graphics cardP.S. I can run The witcher 3 (also free with my card. Swag) at 60 frames maxed out 1080pSo clearly theres something wrong here and it needs to be fixed			"

												Still a broken mess after a 5 month wait for a fix. For compensation for people who bought the game gets every Arkham game before December and TF2 items that the community has to make in a contest. I didn't want any of that, I already have every Arkham game as a fan of the series, and I don't want the TF2 items, I wanted a working game to conclude a series that I enjoyed up until this point. As a final entry to the series this is the first game I requested a refund for as the developers who outsourced the game and the developers who ported the game don't deserve to be compensated for this hot garbage.And they have the balls the slap a patch on, call it good, and re-sell the game and all the DLC for full price (which as someone who also owns the season pass didn't get any of this), I know I'm not qualified for a refund, but this game shouldn't be qualified to be on Steam. ....................../´¯/) ....................,/¯../ .................../..../ ............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸ ........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\ ........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...') .........\.................'...../ ..........''...\.......... _.·´ ............\..............( ..............\.............\...

												Played it for about 2 hours (GTX 970) and while the story is great, there are soooooo many optimization issues. When diving, frame rate dips down into the 20s. The same goes for driving around the city in the Batmobile. Entering buildings can also cause these stutters. The lack of graphical settings is extremely disappointing. I want to play this game so badly but I don't want to play it until these issues have been resolved. it I'm really hoping for an update soon (and an apology).			"

												I stayed up to 1:00 am on a Monday work night in hopes of playing this game. Instead, I sat through 30 mins of the game unpacking and a game that is too laggy that it is unplayable. I can't even launch the game. I can't get to the main menu because the game is lagging so badly. I am sure that this problem will be patched soon, but I stayed up late on a monday to play it tonight. I payed for their game and their ridiculously overpriced season pass to get all of the pre-order bonouses in hopes to play tonight. I read some other reviews and others are having similar problems. Didn't rocksteady test this on PC before launch? If you are still deciding to get this game I would say wait for now, because it is not functional on PC. I will update this review once I actually can play what I payed for. For the time being, if anyone has any solutions that may help me out I would love to hear them. If someone can help me out I will help spread the word on how to fix this game.			"

												By far on of the worst PC ports I have ever had the displeasure of playing. I literally NEVER preorder games, but for Arkham Knight, I decided to, considering the series solid track record of PC ports. I own and have played all 3 previous games in the series, and they all ran beautifully on my set up (hd7970, intel i7). Enter Arkham Knight: A game with little to no graphics settings, a framerate that dips into single digits on the regular, and an awful DRM system. It's sad to see a series I have played and loved on the PC end like this. Do yourself a favor, do not purchase this game. From what I've read, the ps4 version runs at a near perfect 30 FPS, that's your next best bet if you wish to play this game at a reasopnable framerate.			"

Posted: October 28, 2015
												It still doesn't work well.Here's the story of Batman AK: it released as one of the worst PC ports of all time, if not THE worst one. WB tried to scam PC users by giving us a poorly ported, buggy, unplayable mess and the whole thing blew up in their faces.So what did they do? They removed the game from sale, of course, and promised they wouldn't put it back on sale until they managed to fix all the issues it had. It took them four months to do this.So, what changed during those four months? Here's a list:- Nothing.- Nothing.- A bunch of Season Pass content is coming soon for PC, but it doesn't matter since it's made up of either new suits that add no gameplay or 15 minute ""stories"".- Nothing.- Nothing.- The game still stutters like hell, making it more difficult than it should be, particularly when riding on the BatGimmick.- Nothing.- WB attempted to give fans who didn't get a refund or who buy the rerelease immediately a compensation in the form of the old Batman games. You know, the ones that anyone who gets AK already has.- Nothing.So, all in all, the game you're getting today is still the same mess it was four months ago. It seems they just spent four months twiddling their thumbs at the office and hoped to rerelease later, after the scandal had passed, with nary a change to the game.And the thing is, even if the game ran perfectly (It doesn't, not at all, it runs terribly) it STILL isn't a great game. It's not worth $50 or $60. It's a rehash of the previous Batman games that looks pretty but plays poorly, has an uninteresting storyline and has a batmobile tacked on as a gimmick that just won't go away and you can't get rid of because it's essential to the gameplay.So considering the terrible state the game is STILL on and the fact that even ignoring all optimization issues the game just isn't great and the season pass is a scam I can't possibly recommend this. If you're hurting for action games just get The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4. Wait a few years until maybe this thing has been fixed or it's in the bargain bin. It's well worth $5, but not even close to being worth $50.			"

												If my PC can handle the Witcher 3, I think it's fair to say this game should be no problem either. Sadly the performance is horrible, sometimes giving me less than 10fps (during the Batmobile sections). During the Batmobile sections, the vehicle would sometimes fall through the ground because the game couldn't load the map in time. I'm sure there'll be a patch and one day this game will be playable. Until then, I would not recommend this game.Intel 4690, 8GB RAM, ATI R9 720X.			"

												Besides the horrible release and most people not being able to actually play the game, I will say that the gameplay itself is boring and just not that fun. It's more like an endurance test to see how long before you punch your monitor because they WAAAAY overdid the Batmobile to the point of using the car is completely ruined for me. The game should be called Arkham Racer because it seems that's all I am doing is racing the Batmobile. The side missions all have the same formula; do something 3-9 times before you finally cath the villain. Moreover, the ""secret"" ending is just bad, and the 100% completed one is ok. I'll just go back to replaying any previous Arkham game and forget this one exists.			"

I'm severely disappointed. I know people say that they can play for like, 3 hours or so, I can't even play more than five minutes without having to stop. I love the Batman Arkham series it is very sad to see it go so downhill like this. I hope this gets resolved fast because I do not want to wait a couple more months for patches to fix this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.**UPDATE**Finally got the graphics to be normal, but once the gameplay starts NOW I just deal with major lag and still a huge drop of frae rate.. it's so annoying. Seriously guys, patch this game up, and do it soon.. for those who pre-ordered like me, changing everything as soon as the game came out is a definite FU to us.			"

												This game shows how corrupt the video game ""journalist"" industry have become.It is sad.How many 9/10, 10/10 reviews are out there by ""journalists""? Tons of them.Now these ""journalists"" are cough with their pants off. Not mentioning the horrible performanceon PC.I feel conned by reviews. They simply wrote glowing reviews to get money/access to game code weeksbefore launch.Hint to publishers: Instead do a larger beta. The performance issue would have been cough. GivingAMD/Nvidia at least 4-6 weeks to optimize the game/drivers together with WD/Rocksteady.From now Rocksteady is off my ""pre purchase"" list.The sad thing is that Arkhaam Asylum and City where ""game of the year"" titles. I loved these games.---Intel Devils canyon 4ghz/4.4turbo, AMD Radeon 295X 4gig, 16gig, 600meg/SSD and the gameis unplayable. Stuttering even at 1080P resolution. We talk single digit FPS.And its not Nvidias fault like many reviewers believe.People need to understand how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drivers for PC are today. Every single game needsto have hand crafted drivers from Nvidia/AMD/Intel. Every single game that is optimized is more orless a hack. Trying to hand-hide as much as possible without loosing information on screen.This is very bad for customers. We have no clear line who is responsible for games that do not work.Microsoft that is responsible for the OS/and DirectX: They are not responsible.The publisher: they cant write drivers. They may be responsible, but they cant do anything.Nvidia/AMD/Intel: They actually dont sell the game. They are not responsible.On consoles everything can be optimized since its the same hardware. But come on. How hard is itto just emulate the performance of todays consoles?  PS4/Xbone are not powerful systems. Even the CPUis not much better than Xbox360. (the huge leap in performance is mainly memory. From 480meg to about 6gigtodays consoles.This is Rocksteady/the publishers fault.Its their job to sit down with Nvidia/AMD and optimize drivers. And this even if Nvidia pays millions in buyingtons of games to give away for free.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥AMD customers just because some money (if that happened) isvery shady business tactics.  (and again: Its not Nvidias fault. Its Rocksteadys job to provide shipping gaming code to AMD for optimization) "

												To be honest, this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. I bought it a while ago before all of the patches and bug fixes and it sucked then. Keyword ""then"". Now, this game runs very well (at the time i was running a GTX 970 paired with a fx 6300 and 16gb of memory.) and doesnt seem to have any of the issues that have made its launch so rocky and controversal.Story:Single player is amazing, there is so much replayablitily and missions to complete (maybe a little too much). Lots of hours to sink into this game. The campaign/story always kept me on my toes wanting more. I would start playing at like 3pm and i would not realize that it was already 1 in the morning by the time i am done.Character development is on point, with great voice acting and story telling. It is everything that a true batman fan would want.Graphics:OMG the graphics are amazing, and now that i have a gtx 1080 and a i7 6700k i can crank the settings up to ultra and see the amazing artwork that was put into this game. The attention to detail is great.Controls:Great xbox, ps4 (any controller really) support. Usually with games like this i sit back and pull out my xbox controller and play. I cant give an honest review about the controls for mouse and keyboard, but you can always remap your keybindings.Combat system:Uh its a batman game. Its freaking great. Not as good as Batman Arkham origins but pretty good (Arkham origins was probably the best one of the series).Performance:The performance is really great now. At launch, the game had terrible opimization and was not primarly focused for the PC market. Now after many updates, patch fixes and free content i have to say the game runs very well. Even with my AMD fx 6300 (oc'd to 4.9 ghz on water) it was a complete bottleneck to my gtx 970. Once i installed the i7, i realized the true performance of my 970. This proves however that this game does not utlize multiple cores and really depends on good single core performance.SO SHOULD I BUY IT?:In short, yes...Why? Because its a great game that has really ressurected itself from the ashes that it created at launch. But now this game is kick♥♥♥♥♥with some of the best, most fluid combat ever.			"

												So, if you're still on the fence about buying Arkham Knight, get down and do it. It had a very rocky start, the game was barely playable for the first several months. However, after lots of patches the performance was finally fixed, and now it's clear that performance was its only downside. Batman: Arkham Knight is the Batman we fell in love with back in Arkham Asylum: epic, eye-catching and just plain cool.What's good:+ Proper epic story with lots of great villains and anti-heroes, proper Batman, proper Gotham again under a proper threat. I honestly believe that story is the game's strongest point. At times it's as intense as Nolan's Dark Knight movies.+ Amazing performance after patch (I get over 70 FPS with GTX 970)+ FIGHTS! AK has even more developed and dare I say hardcore combat system+ BATMOBILE! Not on is it cool by itself, but the outside and inside gameplay are practically seamlessly connected+ Lots of Batmobile-specific features, goals and fights, it's not just for show+ LOTS of challenges and DLC mini-stories+ LOTS of skins for the Batman and the Batmobile+ Joker is here and as cool as ever+ Thrilling game introNot so good:- IMO the main villain is one-dimensional, boring and whiny (thank god he's not the only one)- Alternative characters are available only in ministories; no free-roaming with Catwoman this time :(- As cool as other playable characters are, their fighting style is too similar to Batman's- Lots of pointless DLCs (like 1-skin DLCs), which I believe are a cancer of modern gaming and shouldn't exist- Even non-cancerous DLC content is rather short- Following in Assassin's Creed footsteps, Batman requires destroying enemy outposts, towers and droids that the main villan put over the whole city (to be honest, it's still a thousand times more interesting than towers and outposts in any Ubisoft game, and the types of these fortifications are rather varied, but still)- Batman's ability to not kill anybody is getting ridiculous. Not only he's strong as hell, he can also run knocked-out people over with the Batmobile (which is equipped with a machine gun and a rocket launcher, by the way), and the car is also capable of knocking them away with powerful electric blastsTo sum up, one of the best action games I've played and probably the best Batman game as of now.

												All the PC release issues aside... A huge dissappointment. The plot elements are clumsy and heavy handed. But the worst of it all is the Batmobile. This is NOT a Batman game. This is Gotham Racing and Tank Simulator 2001 featuring Batman every now and then. Replacing bossfights with repetative Batmobile segments is unforgivable.It reminds me of the Simpsons episode where they added Poochie to the Itchy and Scratchy -show. After a dismal initial reaction, Homer insists they keep the character, and that Poochie should be angier, louder and have access to a time machine. And when Poochie isn't on screen, all other characters should be looking around asking ""Where's Poochie?"". It feels like that was the thought process when developing the Batmobile for this game. Sucks.			"

												To be perfectly clear, I love this game, I think it is a fantastic game and it is one of my new favorite games, but you can't deny the fact that this game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor PC port.This game represents everything wrong with PC development. Let me make a list of everything wrong with this game.-Locked 30 FPS-Lack of graphical options-Horrible performance and frame drops-Graphic glitches (texture bugs/artifacts)-Constant crashes-Small, inexperienced team ported the game (12 people developed this PC port)So the game is locked at 30 FPS, and can easily be unlocked in a config file, but is cleary locked considering at anything above 30 fps you get constant FPS drops and it becomes an unplayable stuttery mess. I have a mid-range system too, nothing too high-end, but I should be able to mange 60 FPS at the lowest settings at 720p (Core i5 4690k, R9 270, 8gb Ram) but nope, at 720p low settings, I do sometimes get 60 FPS, but if I even move I drop to 40-30 FPS, and it becomes hard to do, anything really. It is VERY noticable while driving too, and it just becomes a headache. There are also only 3 standard graphic options (leaving out gameworks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), texture quality, which only has 2 settings, low and normal, shadow quality, which is low-high, and Level of Detail, which is also low to high. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed. This game shows EVERYTHING that is wrong with modern PC ports and this needs to change. As stated before, this is one of my new favorite games, but when it comes down to it, this is just an unacceptable port.*Edit: Will update after a patch is released for a more ""proper"" review of the game.

												WAIT for updates to this game before buying.While this isn't the worst PC port it does belong on a list of the worst.  It is a huge shame these days that big games like this are made for consoles and then ported, often by a completely different developer, to PC and a lot of them suffer for it.  This one sure does.I am pretty confideant that they will eventually make it right, but we aren't there yet right now.PC Port Problems:* Capped at 30FPS unless you edit a file* Textures are extremely low resolution, capped at MEDIUM in the settings and look very bad.  They look worse than on consoles.* Many players even with high end rigs reporting performance issues with framerates all over the placeMyself with an I7-4770K and a GTX 980, with DEFAULT settings in the game, get a min FPS of 15 and an average FPS of just 18 when running the game's built-in benchmark.

												Half way through August and still no fix, don't support this behaviour. I kept the game in faith that WB would put all resources into fixing this terrible terrible port, gave them more benefit of the doubt than they had earned but it seems they are content to take the nock and keep 3/4 of their resources firmly on producing more DLC.And if that's not true and most of the stuido are on this project then that just speaks to how much of a terrible product they tried to offload on us in the first place.But they know people will make excuses for them and we all have short memories. WB and Rocksteady (to a lesser extent granted) need to understand gaming culture is changing, they make A LOT of money from us and it's about time we started to band together as consumers and demand better quality from so called triple A products.I have cancelled my preorder of Mad Max and I'd urge you all to do the same - because what incentive do they have to QA a game that's already slipped deadlines, that they're trying to rush to market if they already have your money and you're content to give them an extra 2 months development time after you've already paid? Simply cannot support a publisher that treats the consumer base with such disregard.I'd like to add that of my 13.8 hours on record I've only progressed as far as the second island, the rest of the time has been spent trying various fixes, hardware set up's and ini tweaks.All to no avail as I still get frequent stutters, pauses and crashes.In this time I've upgraded my Graphics card (which works immaculately in every other new game in my library) I've updated to windows 10 and I've added another 8gb or RAM to see if the issue was the rediculous memory leak.Nothing. Can't even get a smooth experience at 30fps 1080p on a gtx980ti with a devils canyon I5 @ 4.7 and 16gb 2100 RAM on a samsung EVO SSD.For reference I play the witcher 3 at 1440p with everything on max except hairworks AA (on high) and foliage distance (high) @ mostly 70+fps.

												What a astounding♥♥♥♥♥♥up this game has been. WB release broken game. Hideously broken. Unplayable for most users. They released it KNOWING this. Huge public outcry, so they pull game from shelves. They then sit virtually incommunicado for 4 months and release a patch that actually makes it WORSE fro some users. More silence. Two months later they put it back on sale after another patch, recommend that you have a MINIMUM 12 GB of RAM to run the game, release DLC they charge a fortune for despite it being uniformly crap, and offer as recompense free copies of the other Arkham games which 90% of purchasers already own. I bought the season pass. I didn't get a refund, thinking (wrongly) that users would have the right thing done by them. I already own EVERY Arkham game, so for my patience and loyalty I get absolutely NOTHING. The behaviour of WB has been nothing short of disgusting. On these reasons alone I do not recommend you buy this or any other WB/Rocksteady game EVER. Play them if you like (and I'm sure you know how to arrange this) but do not give them your money. They simply do not deserve it.As for the game itself...aside from the stuttering cutscenes, the way the dialogue that can't quite keep up with the graphics, and the frame drops (and I'm running a system with 32GB RAM and twin 4GB cards but dual cards areen't supported lol) and the tearing, and all the extra NVIDEA effects that cripple frame rate....it's ok. The timing on the combat seems out but you get used to it, the batmobile is cool enough but overused (oh and you can't use the DLC skins for it in game, only in the stupid ""races"" which are just obstacle courses). The map is huge but a lot of it doesn't have much to do in it, aside from speeding past it in the batmobile. The story is ok, The gadgets are ok. The DLC is terrible - you can't even use all the costumes in game except in the AR challenges. Some of the new enemy types - medics, those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with drones - are a nice addition.As for the mystery of the Arkham Knight? Took me 5 minutes to get it right. Ho hum.  Is it anywhere as near as good as Asylum or City? No. If you want a good Batman game buy those. If you already own those get Shadow of Mordor (which is excellent just don't waste your time on the DLC) - the gameplay is essentially the same with a fantasy twist, you actually have to THINK to take down Captains,  the story is great and the Nemesis system adds a brillaint new mechanic. If Arkham Knight was super cheap - under $10 - and you have 12GB of RAM - MAYBE. But frankly just don't give your money to WB, and play something else - there's a ton of far more deserving games and publishers out there. Buy Phantom Pain or ARmello or that Rocket soccer car game everyone seems to like. Hell give the money to a homeless guy or your favorite charity. Flush it down the toilet. Buy some meth. Whatever floats your boat. Just don't give a publisher that thinks treating customers like♥♥♥♥♥♥is ok any of your hard earned cash. Vote with your wallets, it's the only way they will learn. And Warner Bros. ♥♥♥♥ YOU. You're on the List.			"

												Barring all the performance issues (of which there are many), this is a horribly mediocre way of ending what was once a fantastic series. Every twist can be seen coming by anyone who's even glanced at a piece of Batman lore, the new Batmobile mechanics are run into the ground by unimaginative and uninspired level design, and the hand to hand combat has never been simpler with the addition of several game-breaking gadget moves that utterly ruin any strategy the combat system had left after City.If you need a level of comparison as to how sub-par this game is: It's like they set out to make a game more bloated and ham-fisted than Arkham Origins.The sad thing is, they accomplished it.

												LIVE REVIEW!I'll be adding as I go on.  Let's get started:HOUR 1Game crashes on first launch, which is only fair as I seemed to be one of the few souls who got to play all 3 previous installments with zero technical issues.  Second time works, so I set about tweaking settings since my GTX 760 is not going to be able to handle this game on max.  Unfortunately, as messing around with these settings requires several restarts, this quickly becomes tedious as the game sticks diligently to its setting of launching succesfully 50% of the time.Additionally, Geforce Experience seems to be on the fritz, so I decide to reboot the PC.  Nope, Geforce hates me too, so it's to time to uninstall him.  While waiting the mandated 20 minutes for that to happen, I go hunting for a fresh copy online, and with so much time on my hands, hit the forums for some light reading, upon which I learn that Geforce seems to not be doing so well in the customer satisfaction index side of things.  Thinking quickly, I decide to forego a software install and opt for just the drivers.  Whew, that was close!Google Chrome tells me that should be done in 2 hours (thanks to the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥mongering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dickless wondercunts at the DSL company).  I tried launching the game anyway, but the failure rate has rocketed up the charts, like a boy band single, to 100% currently.  I'm going to validate the files then see how many times I can launch the game while the driver downloadsHOUR 2Well, the validation seems to have helped, but even with all the graphic settings turned down low, the game is still stuttering a lot, particularly with the driving, and the low-res textures are quite nasty, especially the outdoor thugs who are supposed to be wet from the rain and instead look like they're covered in tha goop from the pods in the Matrix.  Having said the Batmobile is hella cool and I can see how gorgeous this game would be if I wasn't trying to run it on a potato. Last but certainly not least, playing as batman himself feels like slipping on your favourite jacket.One thing that surprised me is that with the bigger map and bigger streets, this is the first game in the series where I'm happy to just sometimes wander the streets on foot instead of zipping about with the batclaw or just sticking to the Batmobile.  The city feels a lot more real than the compact Arkham City and the semi-fake one from Arkham Origins.  I can't wait to explore.  time for some dinner, then a driver install, and we'll see what's what.More to come...			"

												I managed to get this game to run by having my computer open it in windowed mode (it isn't full screen but it runs very smoothly this way, this may help people encountering problems). The fps lock is annoying but not game breaking, it rarely became a problem. The dialogue is off from the mouth movements of the game models and there are awkward pauses between dialogue during cutscenes. The game itself is fantastic, once they get their crap together and fix it I'd definitely recommend it. Again, I'm playing it in windowed mode so it isn't full screen, it wouldn't even open normally.			"

												As it stands now, just days after release, this is by far the most horribly ported Batman game ever released by Rocksteady and WB. From an unknown studio that handled the port to being absolutely crippling on a full AMD rig this game is a lackluster ending to a well received and fantastic series.I'll be honest, I've gotten no more than 10 minutes into the actual game at this point as it completely cripples my rig. Running a top of the line AMD system with dual Sapphire Tri-X R9 290s in Xfire I get no better than 20fps, tops. FPS range from 0-20, at tops, and the gameplay is the most fantastic slideshow you've never seen. An 8GB patch 2 days after release did nothing to improve performance. Needless to say, this supposedly fantastic Batman game will be sitting in my Steam library awaiting further patching. If you're running an all AMD rig, be very, very hesitant upon purchasing this game. Besides most of the AMD users unable to run the game it seems as even high end GPU users from Nvidia are even having problems. Folks running dual 900 series are getting the same slideshow as me. Anyway. Unless about 2 months have past I'd save my money and invest in something else if possible.EDIT: November 9th, 2015So, the game has been ""out"" on pc since the end of June this year, then was taken off Steam completely because it was so bjorked and now has been back for, I""m guessing, about a month almost now. So, since I had absolutely no luck with previously trying to get the game to run back in June I figured I'd try one last time. My previous try cost me an hour and a half of my life wasted on this game trying EVERYTHING to get it to work in some capacity. As you read prior, I had NO luck. None whatsoever.    I am happy to tell you that at this time the game seems to run pretty damn well now. It took 4-5 months and some HUGE patches but on an ALL AMD rig it seems to be working really, really good. My specs are in my Profile and have not changed except for the AMD driver #. I ran it using the AMD driver 15.7.1 and the game kept telling me my driver was out of date. It wasn't. It IS the current driver for most AMD GPUs. I did, however, switch over to the newer beta driver 15.11 and the messages stopped and the game actually seemed to run somewhat even better.    This is by no means a FULL review of this game. It's a trial and error ""report"", so to speak. However, I don't think my actual ""thumbs up, thumbs down"" review will change. WB stumbled way to long, delivered an extremely shoddy product and in return for PC users trouble ""gave"" us what DLC was available to console owners up to the patch. For an ""epic"" Batman finale we PC users deserved a better product for what we paid. I will give kudos to where kudos are due and WB and Rocksteady bent over backwards trying to ""fix"" the game. The unfortunate after-shock of all of this is the game is still very unplayable for a LOT of people. I will say this in fairness. I ended up buying the PS4 version because I was so disgusted with the PC product. With WB making refunds applicable til the end of the year, regardless of time spent, I'm guessing I'll be going that avenue and seeking recompensation for this purchase after I spend another couple of hours ""fooling"" around and testing the game further. If it exceeds my expectations, who knows? Maybe I'll actually just trade my PS4 version instead.			"

												Pros+Amazing puzzle+Smooth combat, one of the best game combat so far imo+Stunning visual, no matter you set the graphic to low or high, it would still stunning+Great batmobile handling+A lot of mission variation (MAIN MISSION)+Well designed gotham map+Pretty good story+Lot of outfits+Worth price+Joker existence as illussion in batman mind is just made this game felt so awesome.Cons-Overused batmobile, seriously if only they just made 2-4 batmobile mission it would be better-Repetitive side mission, but too annoying if we not complete it, military things almost ruin the game-You have to complete every damn side mission to unlock ""actuall ending""? My God it's fine if there's a lot of variation, interesting story, creative mission design that motivate us in side mission but cleaning up tanks with batmobile multiple times+collect every single riddler trophy? Nope nope nope-There's a boss fight in every side mission if you had completed it, it suppossed to be an epic fight but really? It's highly ruined because you just do the same thing like normal side mission, just with higher difficulty, not for all side mission but for some, it is. there are some variation in some side mission ending like pyg's, riddler's, azrael's, but rest of it really really sucks. The worst part? There's a side mission that u have to confront deathstroke at the end, i was thinking about fighting deathstroke like in arkham origin and it suppossed to be epic, but, once again, batmobile ruin it, you have to fight him in tank battle.Just buy it if you love arkham series, have decent PC, didn't mind about insanely repetitive side mission			"

												After waiting for moths for the game to be fixed. As of 10/28/15 SLI/Crossfire support is still lacking. What is the most upsetting is that this issue was apart of ""Day One"" discussions and it seems that no meaningful work has been done to resolve the issue. Again it seems like the game wasn't really ready for launch but was pushed out anyway. I suspect by December the game will be playable.It is sad that while this game was in disrepair the devs were also focused on DLC content rather than fix the problem. This clearly outlines their goal of  short-term profit rather than building and maintaining a customer base.			"

												I'm writing to say that I purchased and played this game to completion before it was re-released, and I find the weird hand wavey dismissal of the reviews given by the initial release gamers as dishonest and silly.Take your lumps, WBI and Rocksteady. You released a buggy PC port. I muddled through, but played with incomprehensibly bad frame rates and then you guys bungled the post-release support. Lessons learned: don't preorder. Don't buy WB games on PC until the GOTY edition drops into the $20-30 range.			"

												An Open Letter To WB Interactive Entertainment:You sons of ♥♥♥♥♥s,The community waited three years for this, some even spending money for the phoned-in, hollow, shitmuck cash-grab of Arkham Origins to prove to you that this third game was something fans wanted. Something we would wait for. Something we trusted Rocksteady to deliver on. How did you choose to reward this show of faith? By carving Rocksteady's final love letter to a beloved character and franchise into bite-size DLC and mandating the Playstation 4 be the lead platform for development. You gibbering, mouth-breathing,♥♥♥♥♥♥filled♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Your inept meddling in the creation of what could have been one of the most well-recieved, well-reviewed, and fondly remembered gaming series of the last decade has caused it to be little more than a raspy death rattle in lamentation of what could have been. ♥♥♥♥.Some would call it irony that all of your ill-advised decisions to ""maximize product ROI"" has led to such a costly and, frankly, embarrassing public relations nightmare; rushing a product so obviously far from completion onto market and emphasizing day-one purchases by surgically excising all the notes and chords of the experience and offering them as pre-purchase incentives has earned you nothing but scorn and derision from anyone with a voice.Your corporate ineptitude, short-sightedness, and complete failure to understand the very market you seek to monetize has done you no favors and, most reprehensibly of all, has damaged Rocksteady's reputation, leaving the young company with a black mark that will not fade for years. They are the Arkham studio, and where once that association brought acclaim and praise, it is now met with muted applause, the low of this final act still burning raw in public memory.WB Interactive, you have failed. You'll point to console units shipped and worldwide sales totals as a counterpoint, but you know full well the truth. You won't be shocked as you hear your name spoken with barely-concealed scorn at trade shows. You'll be hurt, not insulted, that studios grow cold to your embrace. You'll understand that the bewildering, naive choices you made in handling such a beloved franchise will have chilling effects lasting years. You turned a profit this quarter, now pray for the next.			"

												So this game had a horrible launch. I think we all know that.But it's gotten a lot of work since then.It's not perfect - I've had a total of 4 crashes (all while gliding in the air, oddly), the Batmobile controls could use some fine-tuning, camera glitches and zooms weirdly when flying the Remote Batarang through vents, performance isn't great, and some of the Riddler challenges are frustrating as heck - but it's still worth buying. Having just gotten 100% completion (First time I ever did that in an Arkham game), I can say that this is a worthy entry in the series.  Better than Arkham City for sure, probably better than the others as well. Gameplay is great, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous, the story and writing are as excellent as ever, and it's overall absolutely worth the price of admission. I finished it a few hours ago and I'm still grinning.If you were scared off by the fiasco of the original launch, give it another try.			"

Why was this not addressed before hand is beyond me.			"

												As of October 28, 2015.  Game still runs failry poorly.  All the bull surrounding the ppor optimization aside, the controls for this game are what bother me the most. They have changed so many of the familiar controls to account for the batmobile and after several hours of playing I am still pressing the wrong buttons. And the poor optimaztion doesnt help with controlling the batmobile, the game will stutter when you call it and frequently stutters when going around corners. Maybe a driver update will help... but who knows.			"

												Even though it launched in a catastrophic state on the PC platform, it is a very enjoyable open-world game and a decent conclusion to the Arkham trilogy.Practically a must-buy for every fan of Asylum and City. But beware: As of this review, the game still suffers from a huge number of technical problems, so I would reccomend waiting a few month before buying it.			"

												First of all, there's a 30 FPS cap, that's bad... You can easily fix it with a quick googe search, so it's good now, right? Kinda... Not really...The game is not well optimized, we need some stutter fix. When i just spin the camera i drop from everything between from 68 to 21 FPS. Super annoying when i'm gliding, as it can drop to even 1 FPS. I even used the performance test in the game and got solid 48+ FPS atleast, it looked smooth and quite sexy. Not what i get in the game though, it's not as sexy. :/As long as it is like this, i do not want to recommend it. But atleast in the little sequence where i got into a fight, it was good, it felt like Batman combat, smooth 40 FPS, hehe...EDIT:Other than that let's review the rest of the game.As of now i've gotten a bit more play time, so i'll break down somme of the elements in the game.Combat:I love it. The basic combat is easy and satisfying, it looks smooth and cool and you just land a sick punch after another. There are some more advanced combat, where you can sneak upon enemies and take them down easily in a chain from 3 to 5, a mechanic that makes it easier to take down armed enemies and it's a reward for stelathing.The Batmobile:It looks amazing, it's such a massive tool and has a beautiful design. The driving however, feels too heavy, it feels like you're driving a boosted tank, steering it is kinda weird, but powersliding works fine. There is however a combat mechanic in the batmobile where you kind of control it like a 4-legged sliding robot. This mechanic feels great, really. You can strafe with small boosters and steer through tight spaces easily and your winch to pull down stuff on the map is awesome.Story so far: SPOILERS, maybe?I'm still just in the beginning, but the main villain is Scarecrow(I love Scarecrow) and it's about his new chemical experiment(zombies, kind of?) and so far the interaction and cutscenes are pretty cool. I must say, it gets you in the story fast and keeps going like that as of now.Graphics:This game is beautiful. On High ofcourse. It does look good Low, but you can see the lack of details up close, especially on the batsuit. The rain/weather looks good enough to make a darker atmosphere.But as it is poorly optimized i'm running my game on Low still. Could go High, but too many frame drops in movement.Memory:It's a really RAM heavy game.I have 8Gb of RAM. While playing on Low and no AA. 3 Monitors, no programs other than Steam open. ~85% memory usage. Open Google Chrome, 95-100%. Just a heads up.PS. Will edit as the game gets updates and I get further in the story.			"

												It took WB four months to kinda fix the game after the initial buggy release. There are still stuttering issues, frame drops, and the system requirements are still ridiculously high considering the graphics. WB and Rocksteady's handling of the crisis and the community was either intentionally dismissive and hostile or incompetent (i'll leave it up to you to decide). If you pre-ordered the game and decided to wait and see if they could fix the game you spent up to $60 on congratulations you now own copies of the previous Arkham games... you know, the games you probably already own. Oh, and more bloody Team Fortress hats. This was either stupidity on WB's part or absolute genius, either way, they win. I'm glad it is finally released I guess, but ultimatly it wasn't worth the wait. Rest in♥♥♥♥♥♥WB. Oh and P.S don't bother with the season pass. It's barely worth $10 let alone $40.			"

Reinstalled today and it still runs terribly on low settings. This computer can run the Witcher 3 and every other game I've thrown at it on high. It should definitely be able to run this game at least to the standard of the console versions.

PC players couldn't get their dlc until Oct 28th. four months after the release of the game. It's too bad, because I actually did enjoy the game. Except for the Riddler stuff, that was bonkers.			"

												Breaks my heart to say, as I am a huge fan of the series, and Batman in general. I think the content and gameplay is good to great, but the port is just so terrible. I bought the game and the season pass on good faith, I sucked it up and played through it at 30fps, even though I upgraded to 2 980s solely for this game. I got the 100% ending, and decided to sit and wait on new game + and DLC until the performance was patched and the game reached its full potential.Now it is rereleased offically, 2 or 3 big patches later, and not only is there still no SLI support, something that has been promised since the whole inital fiasco in June, but single 980 performance just can not maintain consistent 1080p 60fps without major visual concessions. I tried the first post release DLC side story with Batgirl, and it was a janky and jittry mess, even in small enclosed enviornments.All of this with the recommended 16gigs of ram, and a system well above the recommended specs.This is not the port we need, or deserve.

												Bought it on release day, it ran like crap. Just picked it up in the sale and my god, it's like a whole new game. R9 290, i5-4690K, 8Gb mem, everything maxed except for shadows and it runs between about 45 to 60 FPS with very little stutter, or at least no more than I'm accustomed to from slapdash console ports. Which is to say, infrequent and bearable.Is the game any good though? I don't know, only played about two hours so far. What I do know is..... the combat feels like it has far less weight to it than in the previous games; it feels more fluid, looks far more badass with all the leaping and froing, but it also feels easier somehow and as a result less engaging.The batmobile isn't great. I mean, I play batman games to swoop around above city streets like a giant armoured lunatic, stalking my prey with my ominous cloak flapping meancingly in the wind. I don't play them to drive around, running people over while failing handbrake turns into buildings. If I wanted to do that I'd reinstall GTAV. So, the fact that the button that always used to be detective mode has now been mapped to GET IN THE bloomin' BATVAN on the 360 controller.... yes. This creates comedy. Plus, it drives like an excitable sponge.Gotham looks gorgeous. I'm quite looking forward to finally giving it an explore.Anyway, I'm going to give this a tentative thumbs up. Only because it's Batman, which is bound to be moneys worth, and it now works, and it's on sale. If the batbuggy bugs me out enough through the game I might reconsider, but right now, considering my play time, I see no reason to be churlish.Update:Okay, a couple of more hours in and I can happily say I'm having a blast. The batcart is not winding me up, in fact it feels quite well integrated into the game, the combat is just as much fun, and the story is beginning to suck me in. On this basis, that tentative thumbs up is a definate.			"

												★★★★☆ ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" PROS:- Huge island which looks simply stunning. Its bustling, detailed and just brilliant.- Value for money, a good long main story with lots of good side missions keeping you busy and spoilt for choice.- Storyline, I love the Arkham games and this one ties it up nicely. Couldn't wait to find out who was the Arkham Knight!- Once again, awesome use of the fighting mechanics (Not dated imo), lots of gadgets and environmental kills.- More difficult, I thought this one was harder and required a thoughtful use of the environment and the gadgets you have to hand.- Batmobile, lots of people found this part of gameplay flat. Whilst it heavy in quantity, I thought it broke gameplay up nicely. Driving feels insane, love destroying things in my path. If you upgrade wisely then you can be a real menace.CONS:- Its no secret this game has struggled with issues. Everyone's had them, whilst I didn't have them as bad, the game was still choppy in places and crashed on a couple of occasions. At the price you can buy this game now, I wouldn't see this as an issue.- Some side missions are longer then they need to be. Why carry out the same process multiple times? Just feels like a ploy to lengthen the game. VERDICT?Well I had immense fun with this game and in my opinion was the most enjoyable since Arkham Asylum which remains my favourite. This game can be bought for less then £5 now in most places...making it an absolute steal!			"

												The patch has finally released. Seeing major improvements in framerate but occasionally stuttering and very long startup times. Due to the state of the game at launch and the time it took to release the patch I cannot recommend. I am hoping that the developers take further action to fix the game and make up for the launch, until then I will leave the review as negative.			"

												Rockstead screwed Pc fans.  They tool the money and RAN.  I missed out of the refund because I figured they would patch it soon and then the DLC would be hitting.  Needless to say, It's a few months later and I still can't even SEE the dlc, let alone download or play what I paid for.In all fairness, the game play can be great, and there is a lot of great stuff, but over all?  I wouldn't recommend it.  They really lost track of who Batman is, some of the VO is subpar, the story is kind of weak in terms of the Arhkam Knight, WAY too much time was spent on the Batmobile and not things to do with it making missions tedious after the first two or three times, there are numerous times they take the Batman Mythos and just wipe their asses with it... much like they did with the PC players...Even If you're a die hard Batman fan, or even just a fan of this series, this game can easily wait until it's $7 on a steamsale.  Don't pay full price for this, and certainly don't waste money on DLC that you'll never see either.  Wait until it's all out AND on sale.			"

												The worst PC launch in history. It took them over 4 months to partially fix the game and then once they finally do fix the game and re-release it they come out saying you need 12GB of RAM just to run the game without problems. Even worse, the only compinsation that the people who bought the broken game and had to suffer with an unplayable mess for 4 months were copies of the previous Batman games which we clearly already have LOL get the ♥♥♥♥ outta here WB. Dont make a console port again unless its like Mad Max k thnx bye.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A COMPUTER WITH LOWER SPECS THAN THE ONES USED ON THE SPACE STATION.			"

Even at 30fps though with GameWorks stuff all off, it still runs poorly whilst managing to massively underutilise the GPU and CPU, quite an achievement in one way I guess, I've no idea how they managed that.This is on an i7 3770 @ 4.3GHz, a 980 @ 1430MHz and 16GB of RAM.

												I love the other games in the Arkham series, and played them with no issues. Frankly I play a ton of games both old and new, and rarely do I find a game to be just totally unplayable on any of my computers. It was a huge disappointment that this game had so many performance issues it was really unplayable to begin with, and even after their couple of patches it is barely playable with low fps in many areas and still some graphical artifacts. If you do somehow manage to get the game running at a decent speed (which requires a better graphics card and more memory than any other game I have come across to even begin to play), then the game itself is okay but has seemed to me to be the weakest in the Arkham series since it ends up centered so much on requiring the batmobile. It is a lot of fun to have a new toy, but you are required to use it so much that it ends up feeling like a racing/tank shooter game half the time. The rest is pretty good and most of the things you liked about the previous games (if you haven't played them, you should) are still in there to some degree. I am sure it will be a great game in 5-10 years when it is patched either officially or unofficially the way it should be and when most people will actually have computers that will run it reliably.

But since the dev/publisher gave up on the game and  are pulling weird stunts like rereleasing the game a couple of times to make old reviews invalid and getting the game on the fron page etc I will still leave my review as a negative.The game if playable is a batman game as you would expect. If you liked arkham city/origins you' ll like this one as well. (That simple :)) The game has a better map design compared to arkham city. The story aint bad as well. It is more atmospheric compared to origins or city. The care is a little bit too overused. THe side quests and map tracking of places you have to go is subpar though.			"

												Even if it was working well, which even after months of patching and the games rerelease it isnt I would still not reccomend this game to anyone who has played the previous games. It adds nothing really to the gameplay and just feels the same after playing the last 3 games, The formula has gotten stale.What it does add is a Bat Tank™ and when you are forced to use it those are the worst sections in the entire game, Using the batmobile to drive around and solve some puzzles is ok I guess but flying around is a lot faster and funner so the entire Batmobile is an addition that adds really nothing other than repetitive and boring tank battles with forced dialog to emphasive that batmans tank isnt actually killing anyone at all all the time. Its pretty dumb sometimes(Also the villians are really dumb, Why drive around probably expensive remote control drone tanks when all you would need to do is put one person in them and batman wouldnt be able to defend himself against them) "

												Well, what to say about this game...The game itself is great, feels and plays much better than previous installments, I had a lot of fun in these 5 hours that I (tryed to) play, even though I didn't like the previous games very much. The story is also very interesting for me, and the mission design is awesome. I gladly recommend the game, even if you're not a fan on the series (like me), but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T BUY IT FOR PC. If you have a console, be my guest and have fun. If you don't, then you should probably pass on this game. The port is TERRIBLE. The game barely runs on 30 fps, doesn't matter which graphics options I pick, while for example Witcher 3 runs completely maxed out without issues. The game also has a FPS lock on 30 so unless you edit a game file by hand, you're not going any higher than that. And last but not least, the graphics features are worse than the PS4 version. How the hell is that even possible?TL;DR:Buy for console, it's an awesome game.Don't get it for PC, it's terrible. If you don't have a console, just pass on the game.			"

												Batman Arkham Knight is the last game in the series of Arkham this is the finals for Rock Steady and boy have they dropped the ball. In one year time none of us will remeber a singel boss battel from this game!! While we still talk about how epic the boss battel against Mr. Freez was in Arkham City or Rasha Goul.I must say that I am disappointed the second game Batman Arkham City was a big difference compared to Arkham Ayslum where boss battels was epic and memorabel.Arkham Knight focus to much on the batmobil you do almost everything with it platforming stealt sections boss battles turning off fires making toaster and etc.The pacing of the game is all over the place too and how they did the Arkham Knight was too obvious. The Story was good but the pacing of it could have been overall better.Lets talk about the pc port which has no graphical option u expect from a pc game in 2015 and its locked in 30fps. The port is in so bad shape that Warner Brother removed it from Steam 25 June and asked unhappy customer to ask for a refund for the game. When has this ever happend to a major trippel A game?While Batman Arkham Knight had good graphics and improved combat system the boring boss battels, the constaly forced use of the batmobil and pacing of the story made it for me not a finaly worthy enough for the Dark Knight.In 3-4 years time I wont remeber a singel high point of this game while Batman Arkham City I still remeber the moment I fought Rasha Ghoul or When I went away with the money with catwoman and they reviewnd the game. I give this game ***/*****  while a soild game its a step down from Arkham City and did not end with a Bang.			"

												I tried to like this game, I really did. I loved the first two games (Origins was meh), and this one was certainly fun with the BatTank.But damn it Iron Galaxy, this is one of the worst PC Ports in ages, and yes it is a port. In addition to the HORRID graphical glitches, framerate drops and others that have been mentioned by over 4000 reviewers, there's other glaring issues that show that whoever ported this doesn't know what they're doing.You know the control scheme used in the first three games? Yeah that's completely gone now. Instead, takedowns have been relocated to ""alt+1"" from the usual places on the keyboard, so when you press e to try to take down badguys, you'll go ""huh"" as the auto-takedown move is now moved to a two step combo that forces you to think about it in the middle of combat.Want to drop down quickly? NOPE. Rocksteady decided to make use of that middle mouse button, and now it's been included in all ""ducking into grates"" or ""dropping from ledges"". Worse, trying to execute a drop attack from a ledge makes Batman just jump to the left on his perch if you're on a ledge for some reason.The absolute worst part *SPOILER ALERT* is when you're in the Ace Chemical Plant trying to minimize the bomb's explosion radius. For some stupid reason, the devs thought it'd be fun to make Batman move HIGHLY VOLITILE chemicals in the form of one of the worst forced ""mini-game"" segments I've ever seen.I'm assuming with a controller you're suppposed to ""slowly rotate"" the analog stick to try to (and I kid you not) ""slowly remove the chemicals while a weird conveniant sensor on top goes from green to red on how much moving is done"" to ""walking it over to another area"" to ""repeat proccess but backwards"". If at any time the sensor is in the red you have to stop everything because any more movment causes you to explode and you have to do the damn segment ALL over again.It's even worse wiith the mouse because the ""control"" scheme just shows the mouse, and if you jiggle your mouse back and forth it will most likely be too fast and cause you to EXPLODE. Even trying to rotate the mouse in tiny circles can cause the sensor to go from green to ""ZOMG DON'T EXPLODE"" last stage red.So overall, this is a pathetic excuse for a PC port, and I don't reccomend getting it until they patch this thing hard.

												This game is easily the poorest send off for a franchise that I have seen to date. Utterly broken and ill concieved, the game was not even ported by RockSteady, the original creators of the franchise.This port was done by a company called Iron Galaxy who messed it up royaly. SLI still does not work and performance patches have not been released except for an ""interim"" patch which barely made the game playable.I cannot give much of a review as to the storyline, although what I did manage to play was enjoyable, but repetitive. The graphics are sub par for the UE3 engine. The batmobile, I kinda of like the idea behind it, but its overused and does not fit the batman character.The treatment of the community by WB and Rocksteady however has been abysmal, and I hate to say it, but this should really factor into your decision on wether or not to buy this game now. Do you really want to encourage a developer and publisher to continue to push out sub par titles knowing that they will still have customers?			"

												As others have stated the game has very poor performance, which is odd considering that the PS4 this seems to be ported from runs on a modified HD 7870 GPU which is about the same as the old 660 GPUs and I have issues with a 770, and even people with Titan's and 980's can't run it. So what is there to say? It's locked at 30 fps. Most of the graphics settings are hidden in the INI files. And lastly it experiences massive framerate drops at odd times. In short it's not ready for prime time. If you have it, refund it.			"

Ge force experience say I don't meet its requirements and asks me to put it to the lowest settings. The game looks amazing and I know the experience will be amazing but while it has these techinical issues I will not play it (as this was not the way it was inteded) untill I read that It is all fixed. Thumbs Down for now, this kind of poster child game for Nvidea shouldn't of had a problem on release. Avoid and play something else like witcher 3, GTA online or whatever for now and give them your money when it is in a real released state for PC.			"

AVOID.I will update this should the game ever be truly fixed, but it's looking less and less likely.Arkham Knight is a great game, ruined on PC by a terrible port, made almost bearable over the course of several months. However, this is *not* why I'm telling you not to buy this game.I imagined writing this review closer to Christmas, praising the game and giving Rocksteady/WB a verbose metaphorical pat on the back for taking the time to fix it fully. Unfortunately, the developers (or more likely, the publishers) have recently decided to forgo bringing the port up to par.Temperamental shader and texture glitches have been present and untouched since June. We will never have multiGPU support, and, more importantly, the game's horrible memory allocation - a side effect of heavy optimization compromises made for consoles - is never going to be improved.Arkham Asylum, City and Origins are all great PC games which will be enjoyed for years to come. They're classics.As it stands, Arkham Knight is still a mess. I'm not sure how anyone passionate about making games could submit a port of a game of this calibre to Steam, and then come out with this half-hearted ""well, we tried"" attitude to fixing it.			"

												I do not reccommend anyone buy this game on PC. Get it for console. The story is great if you have been following the games since Arkham Asylum.  The combat it more diverse due to the introduction of new moves and gadgets. The batmobile is a huge plus. I played this game the day it came out and fought thru the issues. After I completed the game entirely I totally forgot about the experience due to the innumerable amount of issues.2 Patches, 4 months later and this game is hardly an improvement from what it was on release date. BUYER BEWARE!!!EDIT: The Developers have announced there will be no SLI compatibility or support for this game. I myself have an SLI setup and have been waiting many months for it it to come out. After the last patch where SLI was supposed to come out and it didn't, I realized there would never be an SLI profile for this game. Please take your money elsewhere.			"

												Definitely the worst port I have ever played. The reviews are all truthful in how poorly it runs. The stuttering is out of control making me think that the game has frozen in some parts, mostly when the batmobile is involved or I am gliding. The  stuttering can in some cases then throw the audio out of sync in cutscenes by as long as a few seconds. A lot of textures on walls, doors, or panels don't fill in making it look like it has textures out of the ps2 era. There are the least amount of graphical options I have seen in a PC game.In terms of an Arkham game, it is mediocre at best. Nothing of the story all that compelling and the game seems much more empty than other Arkham games. The emphasis on outside environments rather than strategic indoor sequences that actually made me feel like Batman in the other games make this game lack in memorable Batman sequences. Overall, this game needs a decrease in price and Rocksteady and Iron Galaxy should be absolutely ashamed in how horrible this port is and how they have treated PC games as second class gamers.			"

												You would think that after about 4 months since the initial release they'd fix the game. But nope, still the same garbage that won't even run. I don't even understand how this game could get relaunched on steam.If I could play it, I would give it a real rating. But as of now its a 0/10 for me due to the fact it crashes at launch, and when I can actually load the game up (it rarely happens) I sit at ~12 FPS on a high-end machine.Never buying a game with Warner Brothers on it again, and I will be highly skeptical of any game with Rock Steady on it.

												Ok, let's start off. First of all, I'm not going to go into detail about the numerous performance issues I've experienced. You can find all of them in other people's reviews. I'm having the same problems everyone else is, and I won't elaborate. Seriously, Rocksteady?It's not just the fact that the performance issues are atrocious itself that's the problem I have with this release, though. The hype train for this game was moving faster than the Enterprise at warp speed, ok, and it was the size of 3 multiverses. Not only that, but the game was even delayed for a month, presumably to ward off ♥♥♥♥♥♥ releases like this one, and it obviously flopped horrendously. You can't honestly tell me that you tested this pc port and greenlit it for release, which is bs, because you knew how heavily anticipated this game was.  There's not that much more to say, to be honest. This is apocalyptically horrible and unacceptable by any standard, let alone Rocksteady's. Until this is fixed in its entirety, I refuse to touch this game in any form, and I would extend to anyone reading this review the same advice; do not buy this until it has been completely rectified. Onto the final point of this review, does anyone have an ETA on when this is going to be fixed? How long did it take for The Witcher 3's release to be repaired, and is Rocksteady working on Arkham Knight's  right now? The reason I ask is because knowing how long it took to patch Witcher may give me an estimate on this game's fix.  Please leave a response if  you have an answer to any of these questions, I would massively appreciate it.EDIT: WOW! Ok, so going even further into the ♥♥♥♥♥torm. This is just great. People are actually defending these devs? Are you kidding me? Everyone's who's defending this♥♥♥♥♥♥is saying things like, ""Broken PC ports should be expected at this point, it comes with the territory."" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. That might be the acceptable standard for a game published by activision or EA, but with Rocksteady/ WB this should not be tolerable, especially considering the game we're talking about. Releasing a broken product at full price is not acceptable. and SHOULD NOT be the norm!  There is no argument to be had there. Anyone who thinks there is should go see a psychologist. This is just plain wrong, and needs to be protested.			"

Sure, you can modify it in the engine text files. But the reason it is locked to begin with is clear.

I've got a 970, and the game struggles, and that is with the latest drivers that were suppose to fix everything. The actual gameplay is good, but the fact that this is what they consider a ""release"" is just depressing, avoid it until they either optimize it, or you're rich enough to have a small supercomputer to run it.

												This game in its current state is more than playable. I run an Intel i7 with 8 gigs of ram and a 4 gig GTX 960 and average around 55 FPS in 1080p on Win 7. There are some frame drops at certain times where a lot is going on but really not that big of a deal. The graphics are done with extreme detail even down to the assets. I understand the complaint from those who pre-ordered as I would not be happy either. Now I am not saying it is okay but we all make mistakes. Now to rate the game as a whole for what it is worth without a childish hop on the bandwagon review. I will talk about this game going forward for anyone who would like to purchase it.The open world design grant a great backbone to this games development which also subsequently allows for DLC to be added into the game seamlessly. The vanilla ""story"" if you will is great with a twisted plot that any comic/batman fan should enjoy. You can attack many different scenarios in a way that suits your playing style. If your bored you can wander the streets like in a GTA game and cause havoc or in this case beat up some bad guys. Now how does the game run. My GPU is NOT overclocked and I get 55+ FPS 90% of the time. I can only imagine a 970/980/TITAN to be way better. This is with all my settings maxed out on high with the exception of the nvidia interactive smoke, fog, rain, etc which is disabled. Now if you don't have a 900 series GPU or 4+ gigs VRAM this is where it might get tricky. I does use most of my VRAM. I don't have a 750 ti so I can't compare. As I don't know how it will run on 2 gigs VRAM or the older GPUs. It may be a struggle. I can say that anything above a 960 4GB shouldn't get a complaint.I suggest every future reviewer leave your system specifications in the review so it can be judged for accuracy.			"

												Great game, great story, great visuals.  Was working fine for me, until they decided to FIX things, now can't play.  Do not buy until they fix the issues.  Plus by then it will be $39.99 by the time they figure it out probably.			"

												Don't bother buying this game if your PC specs just barely match the minimum requirement, the FPS is much better yeah, but there is still texture streaming issue, and memory leak that haven't been fixed yet, they probably optimize the game for the likes of GTX 970 or equivalent, if you have lower specs than a 970 than don't even bother buying this game.

												I will try to summarize the complaints and go in-depht a little bit about them in this review.-Game capped at 30 fpsI tried to solve this by changing the config files, which made my game crash on start. I was forced to delete the config file that I changed and verified the integrity of the game cache in order to make the game functional again. This resulted in my game getting unnistalled and forcing me to download all 33GB again.-A bunch of DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tThere is nothing we can do about this except not giving them money or typing really fast on your keyboard while breathing heavily. Luckily I got this game from the NVIDIA promotion, so hopefully they did not get a cent from me.-The options menu is a jokeThe texture options have two levels: normal and low, there is no way to disable motion blur, depht of view,etc...This game lacks and kind of in-depht options menu necessary for a modern PC game. Unless I'm dumb and missed the advanced options button, in that case: Sorry.-The game was ported to PC by 12 peopleSeriously, this is not a joke. The PC port was outsourced to Iron Galaxy Studios, which had 12 people in their development team.Proof: http://s.pro-gmedia.com/videogamer/media/images/pub/large/iron_galaxy_batman.jpg-Performance is sad.I have a gtx 970 and a FX-8350, this rig is capable of running Witcher 3 on high-ultra at 60fps, however I am barely able to get 40fps constantly in this game.-Warner bros refuses to fix the game""The Recommended Spec is intended to deliver an experience on par with the current generation of gaming platforms.""

												I have attempted running this game on a GTX 970 with an i5 4690k, and another system with a GTX 680 and an i7 4770k.I do not usually write reviews for games, but this is a case where one is warranted from everyone who has had problems with the game thus far. I for one was able to play through about 20% of the campaign with variable framerate between 20 and 60 fps, but now cannot launch the game at all. A verification through steam did not fix this issue. Capping the Framerate again did not fix this issue. Launching from another computer does not fix this issue. This is at the least incriminating state, Rocksteady spitting in the face of PC Gaming and at the most, a deceitful falsely marketed (NVIDIA’s Play at 60fps GameWorks Preview) cash grab from a portion of their audience that has supported this franchise from its inception.Batman Arkham Knight is, as you know by now, capped at 30fps, a setting you can turn off, but one that is not entirely helpful with a frame rate as varying as it has been on my end. It is best played at its capped frame rate as the drops are less frequent and far less jarring. Textures fade into their high resolution version long after actually approaching them and multiple bugs turn this into a port worse than Unity.The game itself, well it’s a Batman Game. If you enjoyed the previous Batman Games from their incredible combat that has been stolen and implemented into some other great games, to the detective mode for solving and stopping murderous plots, this game is what you want. It’s the previous Batman games, but improved in their mechanics. The hits feel hard and connect with great audio and visual representation, and it’s hard to believe that the Bat is not killing these people as he runs them over with the Bat Mobile... The world feels large, but that feeling began to leave me as I dashed around corners in the Bat Mobile noticing the same locations I had seen. As the game went on the world felt smaller and smaller. It is no Witcher 3. Like I said before, I was only able to get around 20% of the story done, so I cannot comment on the merits of it, but as far as I have seen, it has been alright. Typical Batman plot lines, but plotlines I do not mind seeing again. Scarecrows fear toxin does its thing in this game so far in a more subdued fashion. I can only hope that these sequences become more hallucinogenic as time goes on. And hopefully that time will be soon as I would like to continue playing this game, but unfortunately cannot even launch it now on the GTX 680 System.This was a game that I was so looking forward to. It is terribly disappointing that this had to happen like this. All I can say is “♥♥♥♥ Dave Lang!”			"

												Games shouldn't have to be patched on launch.  When I first bought it, it was running at sub 10fps at times.  I thought it was my graphics card not being able to handle the game, but hell, I have the recommended GTX 760 it suggests, and in any case, I'm playing on a combination of Low and Normal settings.   After I installed the latest NVIDIA drivers, it works better, but it still is capped at 30fps which is laughable for a game of this calibre.  Since I've played about ten minutes beyond the two hour threshold, I am stuck with the game, but I hope in time the game gets patched and allows for 60fps gameplay.  This is extrremly pathetic.  I can't believe Rocksteady has fallen so far from grace.			"

												Such a shame, a much anticipated game for PC user's ruined by bad porting.Considering that the consoles are x86 based and share much in common with the PC, it beggars belief that this has been ported so poorly, while I'm sure patches will come along to get this to a vaguely playable state, in 2015 you shouldn't be rooting around in .ini files to get the game even barely playable.The game itself looks like it could be amazing, and i'm sure once it's patched to not stutter like a madman when it rains or you're driving around, gliding around or taking on more than 7 enemies in one go it'll be great, but right now I can't recommend this to anyone.Unless you're a sadist, or a fanatic, or enjoy random FPS dips and juddering.

												Don't even know where to begin. So disappointed by this release.Was looking forward to playing this but I simply cannot.They game runs, but has a lot of graphical issues. The one that bothers me the most is the low res textures. They're horrible and they're everywhere. How is it even possible to release a game in this state? You clearly must not give a f*ck about your fanbase on pc Rocksteady. The sad part is that there really is a nice game with a cool story underneath all this technical mess, unfortunately you just cannot enjoy it. Too bad I bought this from a 3rd party store, or else I'd be refunding this right now. Avoid like the plague!			"

												The game, for release, was about 3 months of non-stop under 30 fps, and even my gtx 960 was not able to stabilize the frames. The story was a bit meh, being predictable moments and at the very least, when they said the arkham knight was going to be an ""original"" character, they shouldve kept it original. The gameplay was satisfactory though, but waiting 3 months to play at 60fps, with all the while i played the whole game on 30fps, was disappointing to say the least. Arkham city was flawless, how did you mess this game up?UPDATE #1 - As well, they shouldnt of have to force you to use the batmobile, as they intended on using it for this game. I respect and follow the idea, but some areas were literally either focused on using the batmobile, or complete impossible without it.			"

												The game itself is great. But it runs like dogshit, so until it gets patched/fixed I do NOT recommend this game AT ALL.Let alone how greedy they are with the 40euro DLC season pass, are you serious? You can't even finish your game and you price your DLC almost at the full game price? Is Ambient Occlusion DLC? Is 60FPS DLC? That would explain why it runs like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥Worst PC port in a long time, sad because the game is really really good.And for those that might say ""Maybe your rig is not good enough"" I could run witcher 3 60fps 1080p on ULTRA.my overclocked GTX 780Ti was having no issues at all even with hairworks on (but I had it turned off because I didn't like it)In this game, I put everything on low with all the NVIDIA gameworks turned off, and I couldn't hold 60fps almost at any time + it made my card overheat to like 82C in less than 30mins of gameplay.Witcher 3 which is by far heavier graphics wise never pushed my card higher than 68C.

												With an FX-8350, 8GB of 2133mhz memory, and a GTX 970 ACX SC 2.0 I can not even play this game. Maxed settings it is locked at 30fps which is BS since the benchmark shows I can play 50fps steady. I can play the first scene as the detective, watch the cutscene, then it crashes. Same with the benchmark, it finished then crashes the game. Not even that the game has poor performance, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. If it actually played I'd get a steady framerate, but I can't even start playing as batman before crashing.~~UPDATE~~ September 3rd Patch ~~Game somewhat runs now. I was finally able to beat the story. Amazing story, great fun side missions, framerate is improved, but it still drops to 30fps in intensive scenes from 70-90fps. The game also frequently crashes with the error ""Rendering Thread Excpetion : FATAL ERROR"". This is apparently a common problem with no fix. Some people claim new drivers helped or turning off gameworks, but I have no nvidia features active and I am on the latest drivers so neither is the problem. The game is just broken. I can play for 20-40 minutes between crashes. This is the ONLY game with this problem. All other games work flawlessly. I will wait for future patches before starting a New Game+.			"

												Re-release Review:With the game's re-release, I went and tested it again for half hour to see any changes. There's still frame drops when summoning the Batmobile and drifting with it. This is with 1080 and all maxed with the following specs: i7, GTX970, 16GB RAM, SSD (OS, Steam, and AK in SSD), with all drivers updated. In short, it didn't feel like there were any changes at all - way below 60fps and occassional dips to single digits when summoning the/drifting with the Batmobile. For me, this means the Excavator encounter, chasing something/someone, and fighting myriad drones are still going to be sh*t. There are still texture streaming changes that if there are a lot of things going on or you quickly look at an area with lots of textures and details, the texture streaming is not always fluid and seamless - you still notice some textures load slowly.There are reports that gliding slows it downs too (aka framedrops), although I didn't experience it. There are still the gliding bug/glitch where you will do a nosedive, even if you didn't initiate it - I still experience that from time to time.Some people couldn't start the game, which could be something about users changing game files, according to WB official statements. The solution is to delete the changed files and then verify cache, so the files that were deleted are regenerated, using the latest version of said files.Some reports the game takes a while to start, which could be affecting mostly those running the game in mechanical drives (non-SSD), which is still bad - the game shouldn't be too taxing that mechanical drives become a problem. If I'm already experiencing slowdowns and (sometimes) texture streaming issues with the game in my SSD, I'm certain it's going to be worse if I put it in one of my mechanical drives with 7.2k RPM.The re-release/patch notes did not identify any gamebreaking bugs that were fixed, such as the locked door trap bug, or the drone bug. Also, it seems that to run the game without paging, you need 12GB.Verdict: still Not Recommended. 6/10As stated, they barely fix anything, as far as optimizing it further and fixing known bugs and glitches. It seems that they prioritized getting the DLCs and the re-release ready.However, they intend to make amends for those who waited for a game that's still far from ""optimal"". They intend to give those affected with the entire Arkham library, along with a community challenge map pack exclusive to the PC version for a while (supposedly about a week) before it becomes multiplat, and some Arkham games-themed TF2 junk.Here's the problem with that:- What if you already own all Arkham games? Are you just f*cked? Will they even let you choose another WB game?- What if you don't like any other Arkham game? Can't you choose some other WB game? Can't you get a Season Pass of any WB game instead?- Another challenge map pack? A story pack would've been better than another challenge map pack, or character/Batmobile skins pack (there's a lot of that sh*t already), or another race track pack.- If you don't play and don't intend to play TF2, the last giveaway is useless.BAK with Interim and Windows 10:It seems that switching to Windows 10 made it slightly worse. Now I'm playing 30-45fps on average, 10fps on the low end - 2fps being the lowest. Maybe I should not have switched to Windows 10...03 September 2015 Interim Patch: Well, the interim patch came out and it slightly fixed the frame drops and crashes. At least for me, it doesn't crash anymore, but it still drops to 10fps or less when certain things happen. And yes, it's usually when I summon the Batmobile, or driving it. Gamebreaking bugs, from what I read in the AK forums, are still not fixed. The big gain from the patch is the inclusion of the high res textures, fixed rain effects (still some issue with it, revolving around saving and loading the game), fixed smoke/fog (still some issues with it, such as reduced duration and interactivity issues), and inclusion of other settings to tweak graphics. Film grain and chromatic aberration can be toggled now, which is good. It's still not optimized enough, and that's with the game in an SSD. I broke my ""one rule"" of not putting any game with Denuvo sh*t in my SSD. As mentioned, there are still frame drops.Also, some people are still unable to run it or unable to run it as expected (maxed out everything at 4k on some machines with SLI and multiple ""monster"" GPUs). But this review is about my experience with the game.My verdict: still Not Recommended.The game, as stated, still needs further optimization. But if you meet at least in between the minimum and the recommended specs, and don't mind that the game is far from the expected ""perfection"" that some were hoping it would be (like me) and don't max everything, then you can buy it if you want and it will be playable. If you're all about ""I WANT TO MAX EVERYTHING, TO THE MAX!"" and have monster rigs, then don't buy it yet, as those with monster rigs are still facing issues.There's also some issues with DLC. For now, DLC is still inaccessible, if you bought the Season Pass. You also can't buy the Season Pass yet, or any individual DLCs. Some DLC content are short. The Batgirl and Robin DLC, if you're a seasoned veteran and know what you're doing, you can finish it in under 1 hour - that's short. The Harley Quinn and Red Hood DLCs are extremely short that you can finish each in under 10 minutes - you can finish Red Hood's DLC in under 5. The ""Challenge Maps"" aren't the traditional challenge maps that you can customize, like pick a character that will play in that map or pick modifiers/handicaps. The racing tracks, I never really like - if you're into racing, then go get that DLC. The bulk of the Season Pass is skins.  EDIT:Re-release info: Still not recommended. 6/10 Interim patch info, with Windows 10: Still not recommended. 6/10Pre-interim patch info: Added 2 gamebreaking bugs found (so far), a possible gamebreaking bug (the Minus key not working), and lowered score from 4-5/10 to 1/10.

The patch is installed, and now the game won't work. What a joke. Glad I paid all this money for it. Did anyone bother to test the patch before pushing it through?			"

												I love the game that's buried underneath a legendarily awful PC port. Combat and stealth are still great, it has a good story with epic set pieces, with great music and performances, and the Batmobile, while the game relies on it more than it needs to, is still fun to ride around the city.But the way it was ported to PC - both before and after its October rerelease - is so appalling and insulting that I have to say if you're gonna get this game at all, get it on Xbox One or PS4.

												You deserve better!Do not buy this game for fulll price it is NOT WORTH IT.  The reviews are only *mixed* because of trolls just making joke positive reviews. Cons:Game does not get steady 60fps with gtx 980 even on lowest settings(frequent drops to under 30 regardless).  Game still hogs memory for no reason, and apparently the windows 7 memory leak was never fixed(i can't confirm this as i updated to 10) but it's something to be wary of.Too many batmobile boss fightsPros: It's a pretty good arkham game, open world to explore with intersting things to do.  Story is pretty telegraphed but as a batman fan it was still engaging enough for to keep my interest the whole time, and the voice acting and delivery for the most part was terrific.  I felt the batmobile stuff was fine for the most part but the real fun in the game is flying around gotham city defying the laws of physics.If you want arkham knight, get it at a discount or get a console and have the experience the game was designed for.  4 months off shelves and it's only moderately playable, you deserve better.5/10			"

I got this game with my new Gtx970 but if i payed full price like many others I would be horified now.

												I love batman but I cannot condone WB on tagging all the launch reviews as ""PRE-RELEASE"". They're not, the game was broken. Don't support WB, but in some form however you need to justify experiencing this game does deserve praise. Even though this port is very, very buggy and over-all terrible; I can obtain 60 FPS frequently and the FPS drops are either to 40, or a quick lock up. The game's pace, outside of car CHASES sort of makes this okay. Arkham Knight is an awesome game so far and I would hate for anyone to miss it (especially Arkham fans) just because of really bad reputation. It does get a little long in tooth near the end however; though I feel this about most of these games.  Maybe don't buy it now but even if this game doesn't get a new patch and fixed, this is worth playing at some price.			"

												Im a big fan of the Batman movie/game series. Sadly the launch of Arkham Knight was really 'weak"" with many major problems, it was a really bad console port. I think i was really lucky, because i don't have those problems, just the 30fps limit (btw. was a default setting :/ ) The dev's solved many thing's after re-releasing, it was not a perfect one, but more playable for many gamers. Now /ATM/ it's perfectly playable, i saw that in many threads. Btw. I hope they have learned from their mistakes.If you like Arkham games you won't miss this one!! I think it's the best Batman game ever made!Awesome graphics and story, sound actors made a great work! (mine was a preordered game - because of the major problems, there was a chance to refund, i don't do that - and after this i got the Batman Arkham Origins game with all DLC's for free. Thanks!)			"

												I'm sad to say this but I am changing my stance on this game. I'm not one of the individuals that had any issues with the game. I did experience some random freezing and some random total system reboots. Still unsure what caused them. I've gotten to the *yawns* Riddler questions phase where you have to find the riddles to get the full ending and just lost interest in the game. I tried to stay an avid supporter of it, and if WB had changed their stance on the DLCs which are like 15 to 60 mins of game play to complete with the Harley Quinn and from what was reported to be the case with Batgirl, I'd be likely still supporting it. However, the PC doesn't get any DLCs until it gets fixed... This game has became one of the biggest let downs I've ever had in any game I've played or even modded. It has its issues, running at 3 monitor 1080p, its very low FPS isn't all that great. Running single monitor, is a let down too cause most action seems to happen off screen. Sadly, there is another issue with this game that nothing will be able to fix. The leaderboard for Steam use of this game, is not infalable. I mean literally you can get every star for every AR challenge without breaking much of a sweat by... cheating. Its a single player game, so cheating isn't that bad... but if you're playing with friends and trying to best each other, it can get to be unfair to the others. This isn't really all that bad, but... it happens.Also, one last thing. The story line isn't as immersive as it should be. However, if you think you can get by without using excessively the batmobile/bat-tank... You're likely missing most of the game's content.UPDATE: August 6...Well, looks like it may be August 31 before an update happens, but at this rate, I'm likely to not replay this game ever again. I mean having completed everything but the Riddler's challenges, its pointless to go back and do everything over again in my book.			"

												Let me start with the fact that I am a massive Batman fan.  I've read many many comics, watched the various TV shows, cartoons, and movies, and have played all of the games.  I've played the games primarily on the PC.  This game's story is pretty good, and without giving spoilers fans of the Dark Knight will likely pick up hints of who and what the main story is based on.  Gameplay is about the same as the previous incarnations, with the addition of the Batmobile (which is so fun to drive around in and blow crap up that I've spent hours just tooling about the city.)Rocksteady has managed to make Gotham feel large with a unique feel for the various districts and islands.  You spend much of the game going from place to place, with numerous side quests and missions to complete if you so desire.  The scope of the game feels bigger than the previous titles.That being said, the game is incredibly unstable.  Every single time I launch the game I have to go into a configuration xml file and change a field to fix the constant resizing issue.  I'm playing on a top of the line system with a 980 and I still get hiccups at 720p.  That's right, even with the settings reduced I still get major stuttering at random times.  I can live with that, but it's annoying.What I can't live with, however, is the fact that the game lost my saves.  I cannot get the damn thing to load my saves (All I get in the slot where it usually says ""X percent complete"" is a message that says ""This save data was created using a newer version of the game. Please install all relevant updates to continue using this save data.""  I'm on the final fight of the game.I've invested more than 30 hours doing all of the side missions, main quest, etc and now I have lost everything.  I'm incredibly upset by this.  Unfortunately I've passed the return period otherwise I would return this piece of crap.tl;dr wait for the updates - don't bother beta testing for WB			"

 Update on the re-release patch (28/10/2015). Still as broken as it ever was, windows 7 + 8gb ram = memory leak after less than 5 minutes in the batmobile, a bit longer on foot/gliding. Game can easily be completely unplayable on your system due to a memory leak and there is not a thing you can do about it, even the dev team gave up on fixing this issue. Just for reference, my PC runs AC Unity at a constant 30 fps with all settings set to high, so it's definitely strong enough to run this game, hell, it runs fine for 1 minute, it's just that this game's memory management doesn't function properly. I reinstalled it 5 times on my PC with various gpu drivers, and all kinds of pagefile scenarios I could think of, it just doesn't work properly on my machine (I guess after having great luck with running AC Unity and Watch_Dogs - this one runs at above 50fps most of the time on high settings, my luck with bad PC ports had run out) - to save yourself a headache, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC!!! Don't reward sloppy PC devs with your hard earned money, please.  The rest of my review was written on release date (the actual release date) and editing it even slightly would probably just p!ss me the eff off, so I'll leave it like this, unless the game actually becomes playable at some point. If you're one of those people who thought Origins was a bad Arkham game, has Rocksteady got a surprise for you.So yeah, let's make an UE3 game look like it's using Cryengine 3, but let's definitely not buy a Cryengine license, cause money yo!If you have a card with 2gb of vram (if you have less, look the other way, the game will not run at all), be prepared to lower the settings to the bare minimum (that's right! all 3 settings, all of the 3 settings that are 3... THREE... 3... 3... 3, not 2, definitely not 4, but 3), lower the resolution below 1080p and expect huge fps dips and chugging and even complete pauses in gameplay (0 fps). This is always present in the driving sections, and often while gliding across the map or diving to take out an enemy.Can't turn off blur, depth of field, dynamic lights or shadows, film grain, chromatic aberration, you can just make your game look super blurry by lowering the textures, and have all these wonderful frame dropping filters on, to make your eyes bleed a bit more.Let's say a thing or two about the gameplay (after all I suffered through this game for 20+ hours so far) - It's a mix between the good old Arkham Asylum/City laser precise and very responsive combat, and some of the worst predator encounters I have experienced in an Arkham game, the enemy placement is a mess, there are too many enemies in every predator encounter I came across, and they decreased the number of ceiling grappling points drastically, so often you're in underground shafts or making those 2 ceiling grappling points work somehow.The story ""SO FAR"" is not great, I'm not enjoying it regardless of the frame rate. The Riddler challenges with the batmobile are either a puzzle or a race against the clock, the races are just horrible and tedious, puzzles are decent but not great, all in all the Riddler side quests are not that good. The open city batmobile sections themselves are totally unneeded, and battling the tanks while you're in the car feels like a mediocre Playstation 2 Japanese giant robot game, it's just tedious and dumb.I have to say though that the car does come in handy and is used in really interesting ways at times, but that's only in scripted main story moments.Voice acting and music are of course top notch, not a single complaint there.Catwoman looks hot!Oh yeah, you can unlock the 30fps cap imposed by Hitle... I mean by the devs, by editing an .ini file, but what's the point really? :)I'll update/rewrite the review and maybe even change the rating if I feel the game is actually worth buying when (more probably ""IF"") they fix this mess.So, unless you have an nvidia gtx 900 series card or a titan, I suggest you stay away from this game for now.edit: They actually increased the game's price by 5 euros. XDedit 2: and now you can't even purchase it from steam, because it's so damn unfinished.			"

												Warner Brother's handling of this game has been so poor it's driven me to write my first Steam review ever - and a grossly negative one at that. Performance of this game has improved since it's initial ""release"" in June, but so minutely that one could describe the change as from ""complete and utter dogshit"" to ""wow, this is a pretty awful port"". The mere fact that WB tried to pawn off the unpolished turd that was Batman: Arkham Knight in June was tantamount to spitting in PC gamers' faces. In my mind any attempts by WB to rectify this have been a knee-jerk reaction to the huge backlash at the games release, and the coinciding then-recent advent of Steam refunds. Now here we are at the end of October, with a still barely playable, ugly, crashing game. To put the brown icing on top of the poop cake, at the time of this review Season Passes are not even properly working, rendering a multitude of gamers unable to access content they have rightfully (over)paid for. The cynic in me who has seen WB's past transgressions wonders if it's some attempt to squeeze money out of unaware consumers by letting them ""accidently"" but DLC after already purchasing the Season Pass, in one last attempt to juice the PC gaming community for money until ""post-patch"" reviews are all out and everyone realizes this game is still a turd-sandwhich.Do not buy this game. Do not support Warner Brothers. I regret every moment of not refunding my initial purchase of Batman: Arkham Knight back in June, hoping against hope that WB and Rocksteady would pull through and deliver the game they promised us in good time.I do not recommend Batman: Arkham Knight			"

												I am a huge fan of the Arkahm serise so it breaks my little hobbit heart to see the game in this miserable state. I was shocked by the frame rate being locked at 30fbs and so I looked for a way to unlock it. However even with the frame rate unlocked the game still ran pretty badly. At one moment it runs at 80fps the next its at 10fps. Not to mention that whenever you decide to use the batmobile the frame rate hits the ground. All in all this game is great but was made unplayerable by its technical issues and I am thankful for the steam refund system and I urge everone to use it untill they fix the game.My specs:-i7-3770k overclocked to 4GHzAMD R9 200 Series8GB RAMSSDPS: when you google the word issues the game appears in the first page			"

The limited graphics options is laughable.*update* updated my graphics card driver but still getting stuttering at first... edited the ini file to remove the 30fps limit which is BS. Plus a few other optimization settings, why they didn't include it in the graphics option menu is beyond me since it is pretty basic like msaa and bloom enable/disable etc.tried to disable motionblur but that just crashes my game. so have to re-enable it and try to live with it.

												It really depends how much you like Batman when it comes to this game. I freaking love batman so i will continue to play this game and eagerly await the fixes to come from rocksteady. I imagine they are completly and utterly embarrassed by this launch on pc and they should be. Changing pc requirements just hours before release of the game and then the 30 fps lock? Hoping for a quick fix but they really need to take the time they need on this one. How it got released in this state is beyond me. As for the game and its mechanics they are better than ever the batmobile is totally bad♥♥♥♥♥and batmans new abilities really make you feel as if you're seeing him at his peak. I can only imagine how cool this game will be when it is running properly. I'm not going to reccommend this game but if you're interested definitley follow the updates and pick it up when its playable.			"

												Hi guys! I think I should tell you straight-up: Arkham Knight is a FANTASTIC video game. If you don't mind 30 FPS and have an Xbox One or Playstation 4, I highly recommend you get it on those platforms! Unfortunately, you're reading this review on the Steam digital distribution service for personal computers, which I assume means you're gathering info on what the game would be like if you bought it from Steam. The answer to that is: It's dogshit!During the long hiatus where it was unavailable for purchase, Arkham Knight received one patch that addressed bugs and performance towards the end of September, and that was it. While improvements were made, the game's performance is still quite poor, and many of the errors that plagued launch haven't been fully fixed! Rain effects still don't work the way they do on consoles! As those of us in ""the biz"" like to say: Man, what a crock!The patch that accompanied the relaunch added support for the game's DLC, and that's it! No improvements to the base game whatsoever.If you install this game on an SSD, and have 16 GB of RAM and a high-end i7 and like a 980 Ti, great news! You can actually enjoy this PC game! But those of us who haven't upgraded our PC in the last two weeks are kinda screwed. If you are reading this review in the year 2018, when the game is $10 on sale and everyone has nuclear reactors in their computers (I mean, I assume, anyways) then your sheer strength of hardware will probably overpower the shoddiness of this port, and you will get a wonderful video game for your troubles! For those of us in October 2015, though... Yeah. We're screwed.			"

												Edited after more playtime.Buying AAA titles on launch day is like picking up the soap in a prison shower, gentlemen - sometimes you get lucky, and other times you kinda just screwed yourself. - 30 FPS cap (yes there's an .ini fix, but come on m8)- strong motion blur that can't be turned off (in my case, the .ini fix causes a fatal crash)- lack of sensitivity sliders- lack of most post-process options- slim graphics options (e.g. textures are either 'Normal' or 'Low', AA is 'On' or 'Off')- unskippable intro movies (come on m8)For those wanting to use the .ini fixes as a stopgap, the issue is that raising the FPS cap to 60 causes strange stuttering with an i7-4790k, GTX 970, 16 GB RAM when traveling. Nvidia GameWorks on or off doesn't seem to affect my performance. There's bad pop-in, so it looks like it's poor optimization. Makes me wonder if that's why they put in the 30 FPS cap, and why many of the reviews were console copies. If you want to stay at 30 FPS, the motion blur at that lower FPS gave me motion sickness. In my case the .ini tweak for that results in crashes. Poo on you, Warner Brothers.I've played roughly 4 hours now with the 60 FPS tweak and it makes the game playable. For the most part it's a good game (the Batmobile isn't the best), but the technical problems and lack of PC options are really frustrating. Frame hitching and odd dips in frame rate can ruin the fluidity of the combat and driving portions, and personally it irritates during cutscenes.It's a poor PC port .ini fix or not. As it stands, can't recommend it to anyone on PC. Wait for a patch (or two) and see if they address these issues.In a perfect world, AAA publishers wouldn't be dropping soap in the shower in the first place, but I asked for it when I reached down to pick it up.

Posted: June 30, 2016
												It is frustrating that i waited years (been with the arkham games from the start) for the conclusion to my favorite gaming franchise, only to later find out i had to force myself to play it in slideshow speeds. My build as of the time was an MSI GTX 970 4G Gaming, i5 3550 @3.3ghz and 8gb DDR3 1333mhz. The game would underutilise my GPU heavily, based on MSI Afterburner statistics. It definitely is the worst optimization i've experienced on a PC game, and i did begin the game the second it launched. Even with gameworks disabled, and tweaks by other users didn't help the game. It was possible to run the game at a locked 30fps, but 5-10 minutes in or so, you'd drop frames drastically to like 5fps. My assumption was that because the game offers no loading screens (aside from launching the game in the first place) it relied heavily on a good hard drive speed. This was why there were so many delays in the first place on consoles, and why the game was originally capped at 30fps on PC. It was because the game was designed to utilise your hard drive speed to sustain 30fps. IronGalaxy (who worked on the PC version) didn't bother to improve the hard drive streaming issues, and it's the reason why anyone's GPU could easily be under-utilised, even if you unlocked the frame rate cap. I waited patiently for the game to be patched, which took a few months. Performance definitely improved after the patch, but i still had poor performance. No way of sustaining 60fps on a well capable 970. I complained about the performance with a negative review and said we consumers were deserving of refunds. Good thing i was allowed to get a refund later, even if i put 20 or so hours into the game at the time. I forced myself to play the game at launch simply because i wanted to complete the story before anyone spoilt it, so it was a bit of a trap for me as i didn't think i would be eligable for a refund. I later upgraded my computer with 12gb of ram, and an SSD. I partially did this upgrade with Ark: Survival Evolved in mind, as that game also relies heavily on your drive speed and ram amount. I eventually decided to buy Arkham Knight again. I installed it on my SSD this time. The performance definitely improved, thanks to the fast drive speed. I do get drops to the 50s at times, but it's a CPU bottleneck that you can't blame the game for, and it only happens when gliding around the city. Graphical options are 'mehh', barely a difference between low and high settings in performance if you have the VRAM. Also suffers from a lack of actual options to tune you graphics. Ambient Occlusion options and other Anti-Aliasing methods would have been welcome. You can still modify the graphics settings in depth if you access the ini files. The default Anti-Aliasing method has to be the worst i've seen in a game. It's apparently a form of SMAA which surprises me, as it just seems like a blur filter. The aliasing remains horrible in the game unless you downsample from 4k. MSAA options would've definitely been nice, but all i've been able to do is force Reshade SMAA for a better anti aliasing setting than the default option. It's good way of tackling some of the aliasing without much of a hit to performance. I also use Reshade to inject the game with my own Ambient Occlusion settings (I recommend SSGI). The game is also capped at 90fps as your highest option, though you can unlock this cap in the ini files. The game is solid underneath. Arkham City is still my favourite of the franchise, which surprised me as i expected the gameplay improvements Arkham Knight would offer to make it hard to go back. Arkham City certainly made Arkham Asylum feel a bit lacking after you played City, though both are still phenomenal games. What Arkham Knight ultimately suffered from, was the batmobile. The story is decent in my opinon, but the batmobile especially towards the end of the game feels like the biggest chore i've ever been forced into in a game. I understand that Rocksteady wanted to add a new gameplay option to keep the game fresh, but tank battles ultimately led to a lack of actual hand to hand boss fights in the game. It should've remained optional, and perhaps only as a driving mechanic too. There's no way you can expect all fans of the Arkham games to appreciate the batmobile, and i only notice about 1 in 5 people who are fans of the franchise actually like the batmobile. It's more likely you hate it rather than like it. I still however find fun in the game, This is because of mods and challenge mode in specific, which is why i've been able to dedicate so many hours into the game. As of 1st July 2016, the game is on sale and it's a steal for the price if your rig can handle it. It still remains a game that offers one of the higher end experiences that gaming can buy right now.			"

												Originally I gave this review as a thumbs down beacause it was flooded with a thousands of performance issues. Fortunately most of them has been fixed, but certanly not all. I have a powerful desktop with a 4790k and a 780ti and yet I still get frame rate dips into the 40's albiet infrequent but at normal settings. This is not because the game is so intense it's maxing out my hardware as it is im not getting full usage. I would say the performance is acceptable at this point. However the main issue now is crashing. I can't play the game ever since the september patch for more than 10 minutes without a crash, im sure not everyone will have this issue but in a way it's worse than having lower frame per second. That being said the game is clearly still unfinished and I can't reccomend it despite being a great game in story and mechanics. Truly the best of the series on those fronts.			"

												hmm, I was not sure about this episode but, as the time went on and the story progressed, this Batman is a worthy installement and deserve to be played. The story is deeper and darker then the other Batman's and shows how the existence of the Joker is linked to Batman, how Batman would not be who he is without the Joker. In terms of graphics, everything looks good and most of the issues have been corrected. There are still some little bugs here and there but nothing that I would considere game breaking. Support for Nvidia surround is very good and, with a GTX 1070, I was able to run 45-60 fps without problems on ultra settings. I would recommend playing the game, and also complete the riddler challenges, as the ending with completing that part adds to the story. Anyway, find it on sale and play it, well worth it.			"

												As with almost everyone on here I'm having major issues with the technical aspects of the game. Glitches are everywhere, I would strongly recommend waiting to purchase this game to see if the developers fix the game or go get it on console if that is your thing where I hear these glitches are not so prevalent. This game from my first 3 hours of play could easily be a 9.5/10 but the game is just riddled with so many technical problems that will have to be patched that I currently can't recommend the game on PC in its current state.Sadly this developer just went from having my confidence to not, I will never buy a game from them this early again because I can't trust that they will probably test it for PC. It really feels like they either did not test it on PC at all or just didn't care enough to bother with a day one fix. "

												First thing I did, was turn off V-sync and do a performance test, with a GTX 980, i7 4930k @ 3.4GHz, 16GB RAM. The game has a minimum FPS of 70 and a nice stable average of about 110. Playing on a 144hz monitor I was happy with this, went to play the game and surprise surprise it's locked to 30 FPS.I played for a while anyway as it was bearable, the gameplay I got through was nice, there are some nice little twists already and the Batmobile is not too shabby.There are about 5 minutes of unskippable logos on start up, which is very frustrating when trying to change settings which require a restart.I changed an ini file to unlock the FPS, and added a launch option to stop the logos from showing (-nologo). If this had worked, I would be recommending this game right now because for all intents and purposes it's great so far. But what happened instead, is that it crashed on launch, claiming that it couldn't find the main executable file. I checked my game files and they were all there. So I went to verify the integrity of the game cache and it ♥♥♥♥ing DELETED THE ENTIRE GAME! So that's a day wasted downloading it again, because at 33GB it takes me a fair while to download it. Having it on the discontinued DVD doesn't help, because it only contains about 1/5th of the files needed.I have to repeat, if you have changed any of the files for the game, do not verify the integrity of the game cache, because for some bizarre reason it will delete the entire game.And why have a performance benchmark test and just lock the ♥♥♥♥ing game to 30 FPS, what♥♥♥♥♥♥is this?

Problems happen at launch, but they shouldn't be this huge! After a few attempts at alt+enter it started working. The game itself is good, but the launch should have been pushed back to deal with these issues. So far I'd say 6/10 (factoring in the horrendous launch issues to a great game.)

												Do not buy this even for 10 bucks at the current state. Port is a buggy mess that needs lots of optimization and fixing for it to become playable with Batmobile. Also just 4 graphics options other than Nvidia stuff, really Rocksteady? :| On top of it all it seems game uses Denuvo as well. I had more faith in you Rocksteady but you let us all down.Kinda funny that they forgot to remove the 30fps lock but they remembered to change sub id's and remove Harley dlc from Nvidia codes an hour before the release in EU. Great stuff WB wonderful stuff.Edit-So finished the main story and must say this is the best Batman game period. Story is superb and gameplay is awesome even tho Batmobile is bit too much over used. Its a damn shame that Warner and Iron Galaxy screwed up the PC port :|			"

												So I pre-ordered the game to ""Be the Batman"" and when I started the game you play as ""Officer Owen"". False advertising, not recommended.I can run Witcher 3 on high with hair physics on but according to GeForce experience I don't even meet this game's minimum requirement although on the store page it says the recommended requirements for Arkham Knight is lower than Witcher 3. Clearly this is because of their appalling optimisation. Also, please fix the stupid bug where if I try to run the game on fullscreen, all it ever do is flicker and I can do nothing about it. One more thing is that I didn't get either of the pre-order bonuses: Batman Beyond skin or Harley Quin DLC by pre-ordering the Premium Edition game, what is with that?Drone combat gameplay is so overused to justify the Batmobile makes me want to shoot myself, what is the fun in dodging and shooting 40 drones when diffusing a bomb?Edit: They fixed the fullscreen bug.

												I am really, really disappointed with the performance of this game. Forced 30fps framerate cap? No SLI profile at launch? No graphic options to disable motion blur? Right now this game is playing horrendously on powerful hardware. Not OK. It's obvious the PC version of this game got very little love by the dev team. For a AAA game, this completely unacceptable. The new nVidia driver even states that there are SLI optimizations. This is an outright lie. I forced alternate frame rendering in the control panel only to have FPS drops that made the game virtually unplayable. I've since disabled SLI and am using the second GPU for PhysX only. Playing with everything maxed out at 2560 x 1440, the framerate ranges from 15-55 fps, and it is all over the place. The game itself seems like it would be great if the performance wasn't giving me a headache from stuttering and everything else.Thanks, Obama.UPDATE: I feel like I need to add that the game is amazing fun. After many, many .ini file tweaks and nVidia tweaks, I have the game playing at a (fairly) stable 30-60fps. Obviously this large gap is still indicitive of a very poorly optimized, unfinished game, but I am at least able to play it. For those seeing the reviews on Steam and staying far away, I can recommend staying updated on patches and at least playing the game if Rocksteady ever manages to give the game any PC-version love.It's the worst port of the best game of the year right now.

												Oh how this game couldv'e been great. Huge potential right here, but sadly, Warner Bros just screwed it up. I love the guys at Warner Bros, made many fabulous batman games, including this one don't get my wrong, but the performance in this game that many people have experienced is atrocious, it really is. Bad framerate, stutter, sceen tear, you name it, it has it all. The performance fix that came out seemed to have made it worse aswell. I mean seriously im going to go out and say it, you massively screwed up on this one Warner Bros, im sorry, but you did. As a PC gamer who expected this to be a great title on the pc to be sadly misdirected like this, I can not reccomend this game. Do not buy it unless your sure you can get it to work better for you, which is not really garunteed at all.			"

In its stock form for me atleast the game is playable and enjoyable. However, I want to increase the FPS and thinking this might have negative effects of the makers of this had to fix it to 30 in the first place - will it be unstable at anything above ? its also been pulled from steam - so Im guessing I aint getting a patch or bug fix any time soon, and Im now reluctant to want to progress in it incase I finish the game then they release a big patch had greatly improves the performance, graphics, and various other problems ? I love the actual gameplay - its just a shame its packaged in this air of confusion and disapointment that Rocksteady seem to have given the finger to PC gamers everywhere. :(			"

												Before I get to why you shouldn't purchase this game AT THIS MOMENT, I want to take a second to let you know that deep down, past the shoddy pc port, there is a truly magnificent game worthy as the (supposedly) final installment in the Akrham franchise. The core game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Now to why you shouldn't buy the PC version AT THIS MOMENT. The PC port is absolute♥♥♥♥♥ The game is currently a broken mess for both AMD and Nvidia users. Unless you have a super overkill rig that can brute force through the super poor optimization this game has, you are most likely going to find a host of technical issues ranging from an unstable framerate, all the way to horrible texture streaming. Here are the core components of my rig: i7-4770k @ 4.0 ghz16gb DDR3 Corsair Vengeance @ 1866 mhzEVGA GTX 970 4gbThis is well passed the recommended specs for Arkham Knight and I should be able to run this game at Max settings with atleast 60fps with the exception of a few intense situations. As it currently stands the game fluctuates between 20 to 120 fps. The Batmobile is the worst offender and you will often experience stuttering and framerate tanks during the Batmobile sequences. Texture streaming is also a huge issue. The only things in the game that stay consistently textured properly is batman and the batmobile. Everything else tends to have very poor texture streaming resulting in objects that clearly are mean't to clean up texture-wise as you get close to them, but don't for several minutes, or not at all. I found this most noticable on catwoman's suit (which usually never get's her HD textures streamed) and the various door's in the Riddler's hideout.You will also experience a host of bugs and glitches as well as random stuttering that at times looks like the game froze.Overall, do not buy this game at launch its a broken mess but once these issues get cleaned up you are in for an amazing game.EDIT # 1: Welp, I just encountered my first progress-blocking bug which prevents me from collecting a riddler trophy so I can't 100% complete the game for the full ending. I had to watch the full ending on Youtube because of that. Thanks Warner Bros, you completely ruined this experience.			"

												The game has now been put back on sale, but the optimization is still absolutely awful. If you haven't got absolute top-of-the-line hardware, you're not going to consistently hit 60 fps.Even if you decide to cap at 30 frames per second, the frame pacing/timing is off, resulting in stuttering and hitching. High textures makes the game run disgustingly slow - turning it in to a juddering, stuttering slideshow.Also, according to their patch notes, the missing rain effects bug has been fixed, but that's not true. Rain effects are STILL missing after all this time.For comparison, this is what we should have: http://i.imgur.com/98lwypo.gifInstead, this is what we have: http://i.imgur.com/VcdpQRr.gifI've given up any hope of this game being well and truly fixed. Whoever worked on this dogshit port clearly were either incapable of fixing it, or just weren't willing to put in the effort to fix it properly. I wouldn't be surprised if I learned that they spent most of their time getting the DLC working instead of improving the base game.This is coming from a massive fan of the previous Arkham games. I'm utterly disappointed, and everyone involved in the making of this port should feel ashamed of themselves.			"

It is a shame too, as the story was really compelling, gameplay engaging, and visuals really well done. With the game itself being flakey, I cannot recommend this game.

												Batman: Arkham Knight is (ostensibly) the final chapter in Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham X series. In it, Batman faces off against Scarecrow, who is seeking revenge for Batman throwing him to Killer Croc in the first game, and the titular Arkham Knight, whose identity you can guess without even playing the game if you are familiar with the comics, and whose identity becomes obvious somewhere in the middle of the game even if you’re not.This game continues on in the tradition of Arkham City and Arkham Origins in that you play Batman in an open-world city. The map is even bigger this time around, and you are given the Batmobile to drive around in.The Batmobile is the big new feature of this game, and is very similar to the one seen in the Dark Knight trilogy of movies. It can turn into a tank and move around in any direction while in tank mode. This is essential for fighting the army of tank drones, autonomous vehicles which attack you and the city throughout the game.Alas, while these sections are okay, they suffer from one major problem: it doesn’t feel very Batman-y. Given that these games are about feeling like Batman, this is something of an issue.Alas, the rest of the game has little meaningful innovation. The fights in this game are bigger than ever, with a fight in the Batmobile against 60 drones, and fights against large numbers of goons appearing at various points in the game, as well as even more complex predator encounters, where you sneak around and pick off armed guards, including medics who can revive their allies, people who you can’t see through walls with detective vision, and huge goons with miniguns. The biggest innovation in the predator sequences is the so-called fear takedown, where you can take down a whole group of goons in sequence from hiding without them being able to shoot you while doing so.Alas, this isn’t very innovative, and the predator sequences and the fighting with goons sequences don’t feel very fresh or new. And while that’s okay to some extent, the lack of really interesting new enemies is kind of discouraging.Added onto this are the boss fights, or rather, the lack thereof. This game is very obsessed with the Batmobile, and unfortunately, a lot of the new boss fights are Batmobile centric. And indeed, the main boss of the game is the Arkham Knight, who you fight over and over again in various guises. This isn’t so bad – the fights are actually all unique – but they’re big on flash and not so big on substance. Cool fights – like the Mister Freeze fight from the second game – aren’t really on the menu here, and while some of the fights are okay, and sneaking around blowing up tanks in the Batmobile is kind of neat in its own way, in the end, it feels a bit repetitive at times after a while.The other villains are by and large much less interesting, sadly. Two-Face and Penguin make an appearance, but they’re just reskinned mooks, and are taken out in the same way. Deathstroke shows up again but is in a tank which is mostly a rehash of a previous fight in the game, Man-Bat is not really a boss at all, and while Firefly is a different take on the fight, it doesn’t feel terribly boss-like and is more of a racing sequence. Indeed, apart from the titular Arkham Knight, the only real boss-feeling enemy in the game is the Riddler, who pilots a gigantic mecha to take you out after you solve all of his riddles… again. This is actually a somewhat interesting fight, in part because it makes use of the switching mechanic which shows up in a few fights where you fight as two characters in the same fight, switching from one to another as you do team attacks, or just when you feel like it.Unfortunately, the Scarecrow himself doesn’t show up in any meaningful capacity as an enemy – gone are the cool sequences from Arkham Asylum, replaced by and large with cut scenes. There are a couple of neat sequences, particularly towards the end of the game, but ultimately the game doesn’t do a whole lot with Scarecrow.And indeed, this leaks over into the story as well – Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight are both pretty generic and uninteresting, and the game as a whole is a mostly bland revenge plot with one real twist which is kind of neat and involves the (deceased) Joker. Indeed, the Joker is again the highlight of this game, which is kind of sad because he’s, well, dead the whole game. On the whole, the plot isn’t terribly interesting or exciting, and it feels very much like you’re just bludgeoning your way through, rather than taking control of the situation in the way that it felt like you were doing in Arkham Asylum.The game as a whole isn’t very tight. I 100%ed the game and took about 70 hours doing it according to my Steam play time, though I suspect it was less than that and I just left the game running for a while a few times while alt-tabbed out. And unfortunately, this game felt long, and not in a good way – the game doesn’t have a whole lot of interesting tricks to it. Instead, there’s just a lot of content, but it is all the same content – drone fights, brawls, and predator encounters, and frankly, only a few of them are really memorable. There are over a dozen bombs you need to defuse while fighting waves of drones, but these fights are all very samey. There’s a neat sequence where you need to sneak around and take out “cobra tanks”, which are only vulnerable from behind… and then you end up doing it five times or so. The fights with goons quickly wear thin and don’t offer much new, and the predator encounters basically all feel very similar, with little meaningful variation. Sure, ostensibly the later ones are more difficult, but I never felt very threatened and they basically felt pretty rote, with only the invisible to x-ray detective vision enemies really mixing things up at all.There are tons of side quests, but they ultimately almost all feel samey, and only the DLC ones really felt like they did anything interesting. The DLC ones felt much more interesting, offering more divergent experiences, such as dealing with the Mad Hatter putting you in a pop-up book (which was, while basically a bunch of mook fights, at least visually interesting), going through a downed zeppelin prison ship, and racing through frozen waters to save Mr. Freeze. These are all much more memorable than the main-game sidequests, which were pretty repetitive and more or less followed the formula of “go to location and fight a bunch of mooks 3-15 times.” There wasn’t much in the way of interesting story to them, and they felt pretty superficial.Likewise, the Riddler has left something like 240 trophies around the game, plus dozens of destructible objects. Most of these just feel like they’re there – just a trophy lying around somewhere for Batman to pick up. Very few felt like actual riddles, and while there were some vaguely interesting puzzles, and the Riddler was actually kind of fun in his pretentious way, there were just an enormous number of them and collecting them felt like a bit of a drag. It might have been better if there had JUST been the Riddles, or if there had been something clever about the whole thing in a problem solving kind of way… but alas.And really, this is the case with pretty much everything in the game. There’s a huge amount to do here, but a lot of it is just the same thing, over and over. It is an open world game with a huge area, but the dungeon type areas – the places where you go inside and fight through a place – are actually pretty small and are few and far between. Why spend so much time on a huge open world when you could instead create interesting environments for Batman to navigate? Is it really fun flying around over the city, or driving through the city in the Batmobile, when there’s nothing terribly interesting to do in most of it?This is a game which is bloated. It isn't bad, but it is a treading-water sequel - more of the same. Lots more.			"

												Still very buggy, I don't know what Warner, Rocksteady and their partners did during the 4-month hiatus but this game still definitely broken.Noticed on one instance the Stagg ballooon stage (room getting Stagg's prints) fps is *solid* 14-15, relaunching the game seems to have *fixed* this. Sheesh... On Windows 10 btw, 16Gb RAM, weird I still encountered this despite the 12Gb recommendation.Update: upgrading my GPU from a GTX 780 to GTX 1070 does little in terms of improving game performance. Everytime you drive the batmobile the frame rates are just all over the place.			"

												Arkham Knight is the ultimate experience of being Batman. You get to actually drive the Batmobile and then as a bonus, IT TURNS INTO A TANK!! How awesome is that?? I had a great time with Arkham Knight and even found every Riddler trophy.It does suffer performance-wise though, with lots of frame-drops. The launch of this game on PC had many problems that are mostly, but not completely fixed. Still, the company put alot of work into it post-launch to fix most of the problems and it is fixed enough to be fully playable on PC without too much hassle.			"

												Straight to the point, this game was a disaster on release for heavy technical issues.But now, if you have a machine strong enough to run it, this is the best Arkham game of all.Even if you never played an Arkham game before, you should try this one.Game is beautiful, story is rich, combat and stealth encounters are fun, and all in a big Gotham City to explore. Oh, and the Batmobile is a nice addition.The most complete Batman experience yet.			"

												I've played City, Origins, and now Knight, and of those three I can say this is the best game in the series. I haven't played the original Arkham Asylum, but I believe most regard City as better, so I can safely say that Arkham Knight is at least as good as Arkham City, if not better.YMMV, but the PC issues seem to be fixed for me. I have an i5-6400 and a GTX 970 and could play everything on max bar some of the physx stuff like the smoke effects, with 60fps, min 45fps at times in the batmobile. I dipped below 45 very rarely to the point where it was perfectly acceptable. While it is an unfortunate blight that the PC port had such severe issues for so long, if you haven't gotten the game yet consider yourself lucky that you get to have a fresh experience how it should be played.Overall it is everything that Arkham City was but better, great story that really delves into the psyche of Batman's character, very fun gameplay (while some find the batmobile fights a bore, I think they're exciting and not ""un-Batman-like"", nothing is lethal!), and a healthy mix of stellar side quests. Some are alright, never was a fan of the Riddler's stuff, and the Firefly missions were a bit lame, but everything else was pretty interesting and not too overbearing. I recommend having a healthy balance of the side mission and the main story missions, as if you want to access the games true ending you have to complete most of them (you can do everything except the Riddler pretty much, it's really not too bad).There is some more secret stuff story wise that you can only unlock if you complete everything, aka including all of the Riddler's painstakingly tedious ""riddles"", but you can just look it up on Youtube once you're done, it's nothing major and I'm sure most did that :)10/10, if you liked any of the other games, you'll love this one. 33 hours to ~95% completion. Get it.			"

												Arkham Knight as of today's patch is still way too inferior to the console versions. Hold off purchasing until WB Games gives firm assurances that the remaining problems will be resolved. We're talking micro-stuttering, missing textures and graphic effects. collision detection, cheap on/off AA, severe performance drops in at least two areas of the game, one during a story-critical segment that makes it impossible to tell what is going on. Today's patch appears to have only added DLC support, not fixes which are much-needed. WB and Rocksteady are being very opaque over their plans for the future, or even if they are going to make the game run as it should on PC. The memory leak on Windows 10 is still there. The ambient rain effects bug caused by loading an existing save is still there. Ambient occulusion has a habit of not always appearing. SLI and Crossfire has still not been fixed and neither nVidia or AMD have released any driver updates for them. With there being no noticeable improvement since the September patch, it makes no sense why WB and Rocksteady would consider this to be fit for re-release but for the DLC finally being ready. UPDATE: I've started a new game to check some things out and will update this review soon.			"

Put the PC problems aside (and there are lots of them) the story is weak and predictable, the Batmobile is so clunky and annoying, and the extra DLC content is just not worth an extra  $40.

Posted: June 23, 2015
												Summary of current issues, then thoughts on the game itself.At present - June 23, 2015 - Arkham Knight has a humongous amount of technical issues affecting the game. One of the primary ones is that the game shipped with a 30 FPS cap built into it. No matter what hardware you have, it doesn't go beyond 30 FPS by default. You can change this by editing your (Drive Letter Here):\Steam\SteamApps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\BMGame\Config.ini file by looking for the MaxFPS setting and changing the value to whatever you want. You can also turn off stuff like motion blur and the like from there, too. Though your mileage will vary in terms of how successful you will be with changing any of these settings. But this 30 FPS cap is literally just the start of the issues with this game. I've asked around, and I can't find a reasonable level of settings, normal and up, at 1080p that will make this game run consistently at 60 FPS. I have an Nvidia GTX 970, a nice i5 processor, plenty of RAM, and an SSD. I'm sure this is a technical challenge of a game to make, but I am certain my system should be turning out a better performance in this game than this. In the higher-up city level of Gotham, the frame rate jumps all over the place. Some of the jumps are just annoying, and some are far more noticeable, with lots and lots of stuttering. On ground level, I haven't really had too much of an issue with that, surprisingly. Combat has been relatively smooth so far. But the Batmobile is a whole other story. The framerate is literally out of control when it comes to the Batmobile. It drops from a smooth 60 FPS down to what appears to be low/mid-20's, only to shoot back up to the mid-40's, all within a second! Moving the camera around to re-angle the Batmobile is a surefire way to tank the FPS almost instantly. Firing the riot control equipment from it often results in a microsecond sharp FPS drop. Many effects seem to be missing or extremely poorly implemented. Ambient occlusion just doesn't seem to be in the game at all. Something is very wrong with the way the game produces rain effects. The PlayStation 4 version of the game has working wet water effects, and provides a clear picture that this can't be what it was meant to look like. There doesn't appear to be any option to change the antialiasing solution the game includes, and it isn't very good at any detail level. Shadows are far too sharp and look very canned. I tried the game with the smoke and paper effects turned on. This might not be entirely the fault of Iron Galaxy's poor port here, as other games utilizing Nvidia-exclusive effects also have a performance cost to use them, too. However, very predictably, if you turn on the Nvidia-exclusive features, you take a massive hit in performance - which is already a pretty tapped-out thing in this game. The quality of the textures is overall very poor. I've seen some in the game that look to be placeholder textures. You don't even have to get The game is also using Denuvo DRM, and this has a negative performance impact as well. It is certainly not neglible. For non-technical issues, the game has an appalling amount of downloadable content, almost all of which is presently retailer-exclusive. As in, each retailer got something different in exchange for preorders. Warner Bros. totally boned over people who got this game as an Nvidia promotion by switching out the keys from ones that included Harley Quinn DLC to keys that don't have it. It's such a meaningless thing to do, and it is a total jackass move from start to finish. When not considering these technical issues, I actually like the game itself, and it's sad that it is necessary to overshadow what is likely a fantastic game by issues like this. The plot starts off extremely strong. I think the concept of mostly-unified villians against Batman united under Scarecrow is a legitimately interesting one. Scarecrow lets the developers do things and take risks they would otherwise be unable to due to the nature of the character - as seen in the first Arkham game. Combat is extremely iterative, but still very fun. There have been a few new enemy attack patterns that have been included to mix up combat even more, and Batman has new weapons to utilize against them. If you've played previous Arkham games, you know what to expect, and it's still very good, fluid, and fast. Enemies still don't really work together, and that's sort of a letdown. It feels like that would produce a lot of good opportunites to vary up combat and give you more of an incentive to utilize your weapons.Gotham is an absolutely massive environment. By far the largest environment in any Arkham game ever, and it isn't even close. This lends itself very well to the mission structure of the game, in ways that hasn't really been possible in Arkham City and even Arkham Origins. There's a lot more missions that you can do in Arkham Knight than in prior games, leveraging the massive world here. There's also varying types. You'll still have thug encounters, but you'll also have specific parameters, challenge missions, and Batmobile missions. You seem to level up much quicker than before, and it's a good thing. You'll gain experience and eventually skill points when you reach a new level. Waynetech upgrades are much more plentiful this time, as you'll upgrade combat moves, personal attributes, Batmobile attributes, and gadgets. There are still tons of puzzles to solve, secrets, things to find, and so much more. It really could be a fantastic game, if only this terrible port gets out of its own way.			"

Blurry and slow texture loading even on the highest setting which is only normal 3. Hardly any graphic settings such as MSAA or even FXAA you get a choice of on and off what a waste of a good system, i reccomend you buy some other games because Warner Bros could learn a thing or too from Rockstar as far as Porting goes.

												Edit: November 4th 2015 - still runs like trash!Playing at 1080P on Low settings will cause you to run out of VRAM on a 2GB card so you have to run at 900P! (Can't get a decent stable framerate with a GTX 950 at all)The Batmobile driving sections for me are where the most issues are. (I was following Gordon who was driving a police car and the game dropped to around 15 FPS) The frame rate goes up and down and up and down and will probably make you motion sick.The rain is still borked and AA settings is very poorly implemented and not up to the task. I had to install the game on a SSD to get it to boot properly as it was taking several mins to start from my 1TB HDD (Common issue since last patch) I've got 16GB Ram and it makes no difference to performance despite developer claims that 12GB or more helps on Windows 10. (I also have a swap file as well) If you have a GTX 970 or 980t Ti you can probably play this as you have the GPU power and VRAM to throw at it. (Don't expect amazing framerates however)If you have a 2GB card I would say forget it and save your money or buy it on a Console instead. (There is a good game here, although the Batmobile is over used to the point of tedium, the combat and story are good and have evolved from the original games) I can't recommend the PC version to anybody with all the unresolved performance issues. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My original launch review below.Currently runs like hot garbage on a GTX 750 Ti, Nvidia's humble mainstream 1080P card is crippled by this game, barely utilises all 4 cores of my overclocked 860k and floods the VRAM of my 750 Ti. Framerate falls off of a cliff when you get in the Batmobile.  Needs a patch or two before it functions properly. Graphics Options are limited, 30 FPS frame cap cripples performance.Edit 1: I got a playable framerate other than a tiny drop once at 1366 x 768, however the batmobile sections still make my eyes bleed from framerate tanking.The fighting in this game is much better than the previous games as Batman has a greater moveset from the off. I will be more positive once there is performace issues patch.			"

												Whilst the game on my inital impressions looks fun at it's current state it is unplayable due to poor optimizations Pros: - Voice acting seems nice- Story seems engaging- Looks beautiful with nice partical effects - Combat is really fun and button mashing feels great- cool collectables and costumes Cons:- Horrendous optimization which include:- Random FPS dips making the gameplay and general flow of the action terrible and removes immersion  - The game by default is capped at 30 fps (this can be changed in an ini file). Anything above said fps leads to stability issues and 30 fps is just unacceptable    - SLI & Crossfire scaling is not , at present, where it needs to be, rendering some secondary cards useless - The batmobile is used a bit to much for my liking, It is pushed abit to much but some people may enjoy more than me.The crux of this me not recommending this game is due to poor optimization . The consensus in the gaming community is that even on the highest end of systems (gtx titans) this game is running at unacceptable framerates . It makes more sense as to why this game was soo cheap on certain websites and that review codes for the pc version where not made widely available. Rocksteady outsourced the pc development to another company and this has resulted in a bad version of the game making it to store. They have aknowledged this and are said to be working on this and hopefully will result in better performance down the line.Patches resulting in better performance in time is par-for-the-course in pc gaming and should be accepted that things will get better as driver support improves and the game is patch but, it is not acceptable to launch a game in this state and expect people not be angry. That is why i will, at this time, not recommend this game, Wait a while for performance improvments or buy it on console.			"

												Worst game i have ever bought. they say it is fixed but it isnt, it is worse then it what it was before. I even took screenshots as proof. I preorder this game like  dummy and had to wait about 6 months for them to fix it and they scred it up worse. i would not recommend anyone buying this game and never again will i preorder another game from WB. I might never buy a game from them again period. Not worth $90 for the premium edition			"

												Guys, you don't have to get mad! I know what happened here. Clearly, Rocksteady created a REAL fear toxin that was released upon us all when we bought the game! It's temporary, I'm sure. It'll wear off eventually. It's why we think this game's a complete piece of♥♥♥♥♥But, on to the serious part.I was really hyped for this game. Truly, I was. The issues people have been facing in this game are unbelievable, and it makes me very aggitated. I expected better from a Batman: Arkham game. This pc port is one of, if not THE, worst I've seen. Now, my computer can't run this game well. (Not in the way most are experiencing. I have yet to upgrade my PC to actually TEST the gameplay myself, but I had to write this as a warning.) Yes, this is a WARNING. WB, Rocksteady, WHOEVER ported this over and WHOEVER did not fix these issues: I will not pre-order or buy a AAA title again unless this issue gets QUICKLY fixed. When I get my new computer in a couple of weeks, I will come back and give this game a proper review. Still, be warned. If you do not swiftly act and make this port top-notch soon, I will have to warn others (Although, who DOESN'T know how horrid this port is?), which can hurt your sales, and hurt other AAA sales. I'm sure others are already doing this.YOU CAN FIX THIS. You can make this right. Fix this port. Make us, your customers, happy. Make us not regret buying this for full price and getting a practically broken game. I can understand this mix-up if you act fast. Many games had horrible launches. Battlefield 4, Watchdogs, Mortal Kombat X, and, oh, ARKHAM ORIGINS AND ARKHAM CITY are some good examples. Don't let this become a trend. Fix this issue.I know you can. JUST DO IT. YES, YOU CAN. You said you'd do it tomorrow yesterday. Just.. DO IT. Don't let OUR dreams stay dreams! DO IT.You broke my heart. Mend it.Thank you and good luck (For now),Leelah[EDIT] - I forgot to mention that this game is automatically locked at 30 FPS. Beware. This is for ALL computers.			"

												Even after the patch and the re-release this is still a very, very crappy port.

But I can't play Arkham Knight without suffering major stuttering, even with all the graphic settings on low and every effect turned off. It's not unplayable, but it's so far from being optimized.

												Ok what the ♥♥♥♥ WB!**DISCLAIMER**Most of the text on the bottom is me venting on my terrible experience with the game, my REVIEW of it however is this:The game is actually good (e.g story, characters, atmosphere etc) BUT WB ruined a game I was waiting 2 years for.If I played the game on PS4 I would have given it 7/10 but because i played the atrosity that is the PC version, I give it a 4/10. Alright, when the game released, I was one of the lucky ones, the game didn't crash at all the first time, no technical difficulties, no crashing, no texture ♥♥♥♥ up. But then the new update on the 1/9/15 came and completely ♥♥♥♥ed up the game, I mean just completely ♥♥♥♥ing up everything (look at my screenshots to see what i'm talking about). And now with this 'new'  update (28/10/15) that's supposed to 'FIX' everything... THE CAME WON'T EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING LAUNCH. I veryfied the game cache, restarted my pc twice, and REINSTALLED THE GAME with the same ♥♥♥♥ing results. ♥♥♥♥ WB ♥♥♥♥ this game ♥♥♥♥ everything to do with the Arkham games on pc for the future (and it really makes me genuinly sad to say that because I love the Arkham games). If you really want to play this game WB has basically forced yoy to buy a PS4 or XBONE... ♥♥♥♥ WB "

												I think this game is probably wonderful. I don't know for sure because the advanced graphical settings are missing entirely. Not in a Launcher, not in the options, just in some config files in your installation folder that will (according to some good people on the internet) crash and reinstall the game when changed. Furthermore, ambient occlusion, motion blur, realistic fabrics effects, etc. are locked ON, and unaccesible.This means that a Nvidia 760 GTX will NOT run this game at over 20FPS on the lowest settings the game lets you try. However each and every of those 20 fps will look beautiful (plus a lot of motion blur). Enjoy your slideshow. Hope a patch will fix this 'overlooked issue' soon. Maximum 6 months.Enjoy!			"

												Just a continual slap in the face from WB/Rocksteady. Their way of compensating this mess of a game is to give free versions of the games most of us already own. I was stupid to stick it out this long in the hopes that this patch would actually solve anything. Talk about spitting upon the customers. Instead of optimising anything they just say Win7 owners should restart the game every so often and that Win10 owners should be fine....if they have 12GB of RAM. Absolutely unbelievable, they can't fix anything. How a game can be this messed up on PC and performing below par, especially compared to consoles in this day and age is beyond me. GTA 5 works brilliantly and so does MGS5, go play those instead and ignore this trash. 0/10.			"

												This game was given to me as a pre-ordered gift for my birthday.  I wanted to love this game.. I really did.  Prior to this I actually considered moving from a GXT 780 to a GTX 980 TI, just so I could get the game free and enjoy it at max settings.  I loved all the other games.. so I tried to ignore the pains and play through all the hitches and graphical issues.. stuttering.. just so I could go through the content.  This was back in May.  5 months later and there is barely any improvement and absurd suggestions such as upgrading your system to at least 12GB of RAM (For Windows 10 users)?!  Restart the game if you have issues on Windows 7 because of paging issues?!  The only things these publishers listen to is money.. and law suits.  So, I'm taking them up on their offer and just refunding it.  Returning it back to my friend who can use it for better things than this half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥triple A title.			"

												Truly Disappointed in this games Optimization. I run Witcher 3 at 2k (1440p) at Ultra Settings Maxed out and average 75 FPS, and this game I have to turn off a couple Nvidia Gameworks settings, turn it down to 1080p, use Nvidia Control Panel to Override any settings including AA and Vsync because in-game settings are awful, changed the FPS cap from 30 to 120 (because my monitor is 120hz) and I still get FPS drops constantly from 80 FPS to 50 Fps instantly, with stuttering non-stop. The Main issue is SLI does NOT WORK at all. I'm using RivaTuner to watch Temps, GPU Spees, fan speeds etc and only 1 GPU is doing all of the work, the other is only using 8%? Like wtf. The Driver update specifically came out for this game with ""SLI SUPPORT"" but obviously not...I started up other games and my PC and SLI is fine so this game doesnt use SLI properly and is just disappointing. I was really looking forward to spending all night playing this game. How can you be at 91FPS and then it just drops to 53 instantly because you do a U-Turn in the Batmobile? Really? So much for enjoying this game...I'll wait for a patch.			"

												So there are currently tons of issues with the game. I can only write this based off of my time with the game thus far. My current setup is an i5 4690k, MSI GTX 970 Sli, and 32GB Ram. Currently this game doesn't support any sort of sli gpu scaling, so the best option for anyone running sli is to disable sli and use your second gpu as a dedicated physx card. Doing this as well as editing the .ini file for 144 max frames, I'm still getting framerates from the high 110's to as low as 45fps with everything maxed out and the Gameworks options turned on. The game does tend to stay around 70-80fps for the most part though. I'm also using a Gsync monitor, which does help with the variable framerates and frame drops. So for me the experience has been pretty decent. The game is really fun a few hours in, and it really does look amazing. Keep in mind that nearly everyone is having major issues with the game running on very capable hardware. The game definitely needs some major patching to get to the great game that is hidden beneath all these bugs. I really hope Rocksteady get on it, and give people the game that they purchased. That being said, I can't in good conscious recommend the game in it's current state. Maybe in the future when a lot of the issues are ironed out my thoughts will change. But it's luck of the draw right now. If they get the game working as intended I would highly recommend it to pretty much anyone, but until then it's a pass.			"

												--- UPDATE ---I now managed to have a completely playable game at ""max"" settings. No more giant frame drops and smooth driving. I suspect two things happened. My AMD beta drivers were not properly installed ... did a clean instal which made a huge difference. And second, it seems that once you get past the initial tutorials, the game runs better as well. Either way, I still recommend people wait for a patch, but if you can't, know that it's 100% playable with an r9 290.Game-wise, the game is super fun. I don't regret buying it anymore, but DO wait for a patch. Watchng all the early reveals at 5fps was a real bummer.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---Running an r9 290 and I get amazing stuttering during fights and use of car. The game is not worth playing right now. This is not a ""slow"" card. It should run. I'll shelve the game and wait for patches. If I hadn't gotten a good discount from gmg I would be quite annoyed right now. Previous batman games were great. Don't buy it yet.			"

												Really laggy on my computer (anywhere between 5 and about 30 fps). Next to no graphics options so motion blur is always on. Horrific stuttering. I've got the latest graphics driver everything and this problem persists. Would definately not pay any money for this. Got for free and still dissapointed. Specs : I7 4930K, gtx 680, 16gb ram			"

												I love batman and the Arkham series, but this game is just a trainwreck! Even after 2 patches(that took like 3/4 months to finish and fixed very little) the game is still a broken Memory leak ridden mess. Waste of money unless they patch this properly. Its a damn shame cause the gameplay and story seem like fun.UPDATE: You can keep 're-releasing' this game to push the reviews as 'pre-release' version... Amounts to consumer fraud basicly, WB you suck and I will never give you money again			"

Posted: June 23, 2015
												It *pains* me to write this review because based on the little I was able to enjoy of Arkham Knight, I understand why so many people are saying it's one of the best games they've ever played. What was already just shy of perfect in Arkham City has been refined and tweaked seamlessly, making the gliding, combat and exploration an absolute joy. Slicker than an oiled up ♥♥♥♥♥ at a fishing derby. Contrary to a lot of people's opinions on the batmobile, I love how it handles. It's a blast to plough through the streets of Gotham and see thugs run and cower in its wake. The first hour of the game's story also dwarfs that of City's or Asylum's by a long shot and in spite of the fact that it is nearly impossible to avoid spoilers online, the less you know about what happens, the better. Whenever I can play the game to completion, I know I'm in for a wild ride. Unfortunately, this bungled botch job of a port utterly ruins any fun you'll have. I would prefer to remain optimistic that the Day One patch will sort a lot of these issues out, but I've also been neck deep in the launch disaster of Mortal Kombat X, which I foolishly spent $100 dollars on. While the issues I personally have experienced with Arkham Knight are *nothing* compared to the mass of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t High Voltage is responsible for, many other people have it much worse, even on better rigs than mine too. Perpetual black screens, the city not being rendered in hell, some people can't even start the ♥♥♥♥ing game! Even when I fixed the capped at 30 FPS problem, tweaked the texture options, enabled MSAA and disabled the NVIDIA Gameworks settings, (which are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t by the way) my game would randomly just die after running well enough for me to enjoy myself and think I'd figured out a way around the issues.The fact of the matter is, releasing a port like this is unacceptable. Bungling the launch of such a high profile game is inexcusable and deliberately withholding PC review codes to avoid a PR disaster is practically criminal. There is NO excuse for this, especially not from a studio that's released two of my favorite games of all time...but, the sad fact of AAA gaming these days is you can't trust anyone. It doesn't matter what they've released, how great the footage looks in commercials or gameplay vids, what you might want or hope the game is like, chances are something horrible awaits you. I dread the releases of Fallout 4 and Metal Gear Solid V, should they choose to follow in Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X's example. For now, save your money. If Rocksteady can fix things in two weeks, I will edit this review to properly discuss the actual *game*. If not, I'll get my money back and see if the Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition is worth a damn...I swear, these bungled ports are the work of The Joker.**EDIT** At this time, Rocksteady has proven their utter contempt for the PC gaming community and I've requested a refund. I advise everyone who hasn't already to do so, because until the inevitable Game Of The Year edition comes out, you're in for the same ride as MKX. Good luck to anyone who sticks this out, yer gonna need it.

**ADDITIONAL EDIT** So, year's almost over, Arkham Knight's back on Steam now and it's *still* not fixed. ♥♥♥♥ me, am I ever glad I jumped ship when I did. Selling the game for $10 less and offering refunds isn't going to fix anything WB. You ♥♥♥♥ed up. Admit it - admit that you're lying, deceiving, useless, money grubbing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and be done with it.In the time since I wrote my initial review I've also had the opportunity to play the game on a friend's PS4 and surprise surprise, it's not great. It's not a *bad* game but after that first hour I was incapable of passing the story quality nosedives, the acting gets hammier than a pig farm and 80% (not even kidding) of the main gameplay becomes Batman: Tank Warfare. Want to swoop down off of rooftops in the larger areas of Gotham to beat up bad guys? TOO BAD, drones will insta-kill you. Biggest disappointment of 2015, hands down. It'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.			"

												Me, being a huge Batman fan, had saved up just enough money to buy Batman Arkham Knight, I came back from the closest store with 3 Steam cards. I bought the game, waited in agony and anxiety for it to download (13 hrs), then started it. I knew that people had had problems with this game before, but I figured that because they patched it, it would work better. Over this Summer, I bought a brand-new gaming computer. It runs every game that I have played so far perfectly. When I launched Arkham Knight, it crashed. I updated my video drivers and retried. About 3 minutes into the game, I was not even able to play it because of the lag and general issues. (keep in mind I am playing this on my NEW GAMING PC on LOWEST SETTINGS) I would love to play this game but as of right now, it is not worth the money, downloading time, or patch crap. I am getting a refund.			"

												Arkham Knight is far from flawless. Some optimization issues will likely pop up. The Batmobile? It can be fun but some elements it was designed for, mainly puzzle solving and racing, are simply bad. However I still really loved this game. It takes from Arkham Asylum and Arkham City (with a little bit of Arkham Origins on top) and melds it to make a compelling narrative with the best elements of the series. Except for some of those new Batmobile elements. :pWill the Batman maintain? Or will he be broken?			"

												There are plenty of reviews up about the performance of Arkham Knight.That being said, there are patches to address these issues, and while it's sad that a high-calibur game had enough issues to warrant pulling sales, I want to talk to people who may be thinking of getting the game after the sales hold is released. I've heard talks of a 'Game of the Year' edition may be made at some point. While this is hilarious given that the game can't be bought on the PC, this is sure to be confusing for people who don't have a console and are looking at picking up the game.For context, I have a good system with the game installed on an SSD. An SSD seemed to eliminate almost all of the performance issues for me. So, I was able to play through at release and it was relatively smooth. That being said, I can see a difference in the game after the patches.I have enjoyed all of the Batman Arkham series so far and was eagerly anticipating the finale. The graphics in Arkham Knight are amazing and there are moments of pure awesome Batman-ness in this game (for example, Fear Takedowns will make your jaw drop every time). All of the iconic Batman moments are in this game; but is that enough?I feel this game doesn't play to it's strengths. They've made predator mode very powerful, but only rarely do you get to unleash the full power on thugs. The story moments that are supposed to be strong aren't and the points that aren't supposed to be strong are. The Batmobile is a ton of fun to drive around, but they rarely make good use of it. When I say that about the Batmobile, I want to be clear: there are 2 'different' vehicles; the Batmobile (drives around really fast), and the Tankmobile (manuver around and shoot stuff).If you don't like the Tankmobile, you will not like this game. It is like 90% of the game, and while fun for the first few fights, every fight is essentially the same + more tanks than last fight. There are 2 major Batman villians known for their hand-to-hand prowesss... that you fight while they are in a tank! WHY?A friend put it to me like this ""I just want to play as Batman. Let me punch some people, sneak up on some guys and drive around. If I wanted to play a tank simulator game, that's what I would have gotten""I can understand that Rocksteady really wanted to have the Batmobile in the game and they likely came up with the Tankmobile and all the enemy tanks as a way to justify it, but there is way too much tank fighting in the game. When a mod is released (I'm certain it will be) that drastically cuts down the number of tanks and/or tank fights... I will seriously re-evaluate this game as if that was the way it was meant to be released.I do highly recommend to make use of the optional Batmobile toggle button via the menu.For me, Predator mode was awesome... I just wish there was more of it or it was longer. The Bank heists were awesome and I'd love for there to have been more. The past games had some good 'detective-y' bits that were fun and different, This seems to have been thrown in as an after thought via 1 side mission. There's ways this could have helped the game: There's a side mission where you rescue firefighters from thugs. Only, they seem to be randomly distributed throughout the city and end up being very difficult to find after you've gotten a few. Some detective work to lead you there would have fit right in.There's 2 mission types that use the real (non-tank) batmobile: commanders patrol the city in APCs, which you have to chase down and a mission that basically has you race/chase a villian. There really isn't that many of these missions and they certainly are fun. Would really like for there to have been more. Something along the lines of ""Batman! we just found out things are going to explode... on the other side of the city! How can we get there in time?!"" would have worked just fine. There's a challenge map that has you race to a location, battle a hand full of tanks, then race to a new location and repeat a few times... I quite like this, despite what I said about the tank fighting. You're not overwhelmed with tanks; you're more concerned with doing it efficiently.Combat is kind of hard to breakdown. It's the same basic formula that has been so great over the years (with enough new things to keep it interesting). Getting into a fight with the average joes on the street corner really isn't fair at all. You just demolish them. However, there are prepared/armored/armed guys that hang out in very large groups. It kinda seems like just being awesome with the combat system isn't enough, you have to find a good opening into the fight to really make sure you survive; but the game goes out of it's way to make sure that you don't get to make those good openings. I've also heard that it's quite daunting to have so many moves and enemies that you have to attack in particular ways. Then again, there are the team-ups with other heros that are a blast, but you aren't facing the tougher thugs, so it's not like you really need their help.Summary:If you're on the fence about this game, I'd recommend watching some videos of the tank battles and see if that appeals to you. There are a lot of good console reviews praising the tank fights as fun, so that may be something for you.If you've played the other Arkham games and just want to 'complete the story', you'll end up playing at some point anyhow.For everyone else, I'd just say get Arkham Origins or City instead. That is way more Batman-like than Arkham: World of Tanks. Maybe when the price dropsOh, and don't even bother with the DLC. The 'Story DLC' is simply 3 or so rooms chained together. Can be done in 1/2 an hour... very much not worth the $.			"

It's a fun game for consoles, but the devs have ruined the PC port. bg tbh			"

												Batman Arkham Knight is the final installment of the Batman Arkham series. It takes place in a deserted Gotham city with all of the criminals loose. Scarecrow is at large throughout the game with the Arkham Knight. Scarecrow plans to fill Gothams atomosphere with his deadly fear toxin. It is up to Batman to stop him. I loved this game. Rocksteady really hit a grand slam with this. It has an even bigger grand scale than what it was in Arkham City. There is so much to do in this game that it will last you for hours on end. The story and all of the side missions are fantastic of course. All of the performances for this game were flawless with Kevin Conroy and John Noble. The Batmobile is also very badass and it is really joyful driving around gotham in it. But I still found myself flying on rooftops instead of driving the batmobile. The fighting in this game is better than every as well and they did a good job with creating the different sorts of enemies like the medic. One thing that slightly annoyed me about this game was the obstacles that you had to use the Bat-Tank to get passed them. But overall, this game met the hype, even surpassed it. But I am giving this game a thumbs down currently until Rocksteady fixes the PC port. I tolerated all of the issues but as of now this game is better to play on the PS4 and Xbox One. 8/10+ Performances.+ Insane combat.+ All of the side missions.- Bat-tank objectives.- Crappy port (not counting this against the score).

												I got this game for free after buying my 2nd 970, and I would much rather had a cash-back rebate for the cost of the game. If you want a detailed review other than ""The PC port sucks, don't buy"" and want an actual review of both the game and performance, read on. On the ""Bad PC Port"" side: Bugs, glitches and performance problems galore. To begin with: Half of the options in the menu don't even give you information as to what you're turning on or off, or to what level you are turning things up or down. Option choices in the Graphic's menu looks like a game from 2003. Anti-Aliasing? On or Off. Textures? Low or Normal. Shadows/Level of Deatil? Low/Med/High. That's it, those 4 things are your graphic options. The only others are 4 Nvidia Gameworks options that can just be switched On or Off and that's only if you're running an Nvidia card; AMD guys get completely left out. There is no real ""setting"", it's either on or off. There's also no FOV adjustment or any sort of finer adjustments that are commonplace even in Indie games. Running with a 4790k @ 4.86Ghz, overclocked G1 970s in SLI, 16Gb of 2133Mhz GSkill RAM, and installed on a 550 Write/520 Read Sandisk Extreme Pro SSD on what I assume to be ""Ultra"" settings, the game runs like a stop-motion amateur film more often than not, and when it's not stuttering, there are graphic issues or *constant* crashes. Most of the time the Batmobile is on screen there are FPS issues. Which unfortunately ends up being a real pain as the Batmobile IS the game. Many sections are fast-paced chases or require you to maintain certain distances; something very hard to do when it's stuttering like King George VI. Even pre-rendered video has stuttering which is beyond unacceptable. Optimization is so poor that on the built in ""Benchmarking"" feature my setup can barley keep an average 60-70FPS running standard 1080p with everything ""on"". And with the actual game itself hard-capped at 30FPS, it struggles to maintain that meager framerate. Although you can edit an INI file to make the game cap at whatever framerate you want, it's been stated by the Devs themselves they don't recommend doing so. There are several graphical bugs, clipping and pathing issues, texture issues, pop-in textures, poor textures, occasional draw distance issues, lighting issues with seizure-inducing random lights randomly appearing at certain camera angles, as well as several instances of crashing straight to desktop. Get used to seeing ""Has stopped responding.""As for gameplay, my negative opinion doesn't revolve solely around the ""It's a horrible PC port"" complaint. I would of disliked the game even without the several performance issues. The whole Batmobile thing ruined the game for me, as they just shove it in your face way too much. When you are 100 feet underground and there are perfectly placed roads and platforms to maneuver your Batmobile around, you get pulled right out of the game. The previous games in the series were also about stealth and the awesome combat system. The Batwing and Batmobile are not stealthy. They are used for getting from Point A to Point B; occasionally a secondary purpose of getting Batman out of a tight scrape or literal Deus Ex Machina. This completely spits in the face of the previous games. Clonking around in a wannabe Ironman metal suit isn't stealthy, driving through a city destroying cars, walls, buildings, or anything you run into while firing a minigun, a cannon, and missiles isn't stealthly. Building the whole game around GTA: Gotham ruined what could of been an amazing game. The Batmobile is tied to nearly everything in the game, from bosses, to minibosses, to exploring, to sidequests. Especially Riddler. Anything Riddler will involve the Batmobile. Even if you enjoy the Batmobile, it very quickly becomes tedious after the 8th Cut & Paste tank battle. If you want to further a plot line, prepare to have to use the freakin car. ""Evening the Odds"" was a fun little gimmick, and the Batmobile could of worked if the entire game wasn't built around the damn thing, and tank battles didn't happen every 10 minutes just 'because'. The unique Arkham combat system is also ruined by it. Random fights around Gotham are worthless, award no XP, and you find yourself either completely ignoring enemies or going on a GTA5 rampage with your Tankmobile. Those two choices get old very quick. NPCs will run away from you in terror any time the Batmobile is near you. Random fights around Gotham are worthless as experience is only given from combat that happens during the main story or sidequests. The gameplay has also been dumbed down way too far. There are no heart monitors, using remote controlled batarangs to disable them or any sort of strategy. Just charge in, use easy-mode ""Fear Takedown,"" and you can literally take on half an army in the ""Predator"" sections of the game without varying up your moves at all.Gadgets are extremely underused, new gadgets aren't used anywhere to their full potential, and old gadgets from previous games are thrown in without consequence or reason. One gadget isn't even given to you as a necessity for furthering the game, it's ""found"" simply to give variation to Riddler trophies and end-game content. Again, everything revolves around the car. Even if you ditch the car and go without it, you won't get far without needing it to progress or having to use it to not die to a horde of tanks. What new gadgets that are introduced would be fun to use if Stealth was still something you considered in this game. I found myself just charging head-first into all battles instead of planning out attacks and using stealth like in previous games. The only time any sort of skill or planning is needed is for Challenges; and that's another issue. There are so few Challenges in this game compared to previous titles. But watch them spoon feed us VR combat challenges in paid DLC. Boss battles are very lackluster. One ""Boss Battle"" involving a well known and loved villian is another run-of-the-mill tank battle you've seen 4 dozen times. The climax? A 5 second cutscene showing you both jumping out of your tanks, and a single punch to the face. Ta-Da! Then a cutscene of shoving someone into your Bat-Carseat. And get used to that routiune. Much of what made previous games in the series fun is just completely nullified. There are a few sparse Pros sprinkled around thankfully. The combat system is upgraded from games past, and seems more fluid, although the AI seems to be a little dumber and rarely attack in large groups of 3-4 and prefer to attack you one at a time like Lemmings, even on hard. You aren't forced to counter everytime your Spider(Bat)sense goes off, and can instead dictate the flow of combat yourself moreso than ever which is nice. The grappling and flying system is much improved, although it's wasted as you'll just end up needing your car once you get to where you're going. And the game has a compelling story, although the game spoils itself about half-way through which was a letdown. Also on the story front, it's sadly a very short game. If you completely bypass any non-essential sidequests or missions, I'd estimate this game could be completed in less than 15 hours. I'm just over 50 hours and am 98.3% complete, the only thing remaining are a few Riddler trophies. So don't expect tons and tons of gameplay hours with this. To end everything, the Pros in no way outweigh the cons. And when a game looks better and runs better on a $350 console than it does on high-end $2500+ PCs, there's something seriously, seriously wrong.**Edited as I progressed further, encountered more bugs, glitches, and issues with gameplay. Also, a decent amount of my actual in-game timer is from leaving the game alt-tabbed or falling asleep a few times. And even with some of my time not even being in-game play, ~50 hours of gametime will net you 100% completion and then some. But there's no real reason to even consider a NG+			"

												*******************************NO SPOILERS*********************************Probably the best Batman game ever made. I want to start off by saying that I didn't really care for Batman before playing the first Arkham game, and ever since I've fallen in love with the voice actors of the main characters, especially Mark Hamill as the Joker.This game takes place after Arkham City, with a new cast of main villains, namely The Arkham Knight, Scarecrow and another familliar face in the Batman series which I won't name (No Spoil). There's also many returning classics who play minor roles, such as the Penguin, Two-Face, Riddler, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, etc.)Arkham Knight has, by far, the biggest explorable map of all Arkham games, hence the introduction of the Batmobile to get around faster and complete many of the speed challenges. The storyline is on par with other Arkham games, with a quite predictable ending (even though some of the plot twists are quite good). The characters are well portrayed, the combat mechanics are better than ever, some of the puzzles will force you to think and the optionnal content is very good. I would recommend this to anyone who has the hardware to run it. The game had alot of optimization problems at the start, but at this point I think it's safe to say that most have been patched, and the game hidden behind that crappy launch is actually one of the best Batman experiences out there.

Visuals available on XBOX One and PS4 are non existant on the PC port. A 30 FPS lock is a big NO for PC gaming. I barely get 50-60 FPS once removing the cap running two Titan Xs in SLI at 3440x1440P. Witcher 3 which is more graphically intensive than this game gives better FPS.			"

												Although it greatly pains me to do this, I'll have to thumb down this game for now as it is currently in a broken state.I have been a big fan of the franchise after playing Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and having a blast with them.I decided that I will pre-order Batman Arkham Knight as a way to send out my support since Rocksteady and Warner Brothers gave me such a treat.Wrong move. I got royally screwed.Batman Arkham Knight was the first (and definitely will be the last) game I pre-ordered. Sad to say that I was given a half-cooked product that suffers from graphical, frame rate and stability issues.It's not totally ""unplayable"" but you will definitely not enjoy playing Arkham Knight with the stutters and constant drops in frame rate.The previous titles, including Arkham Origins fare way better than Arkham Knight, at least on my system.However, I still believe that Rocksteady and WB will be able to keep their act together and provide a patch that will alleviate and hopefully resolve all the problems soon.So I won't be invoking my refund right with Steam just make damn sure that you'll fix the game when you do.Here's to hoping that Rocksteady pushes through with a Batman Beyond game with the elements of the Arkham franchise.***EDIT***After the patch this October 30 I was in high hopes but now I can't even actually launch the game anymore.Getting a refund and just gonna purchase Dragon Age Origins. This was such a downer for me. One of the worst experiences in my gaming life.			"

												Second release: So nothing has changed. The games is still unoptimized mess (well, compared to what we had for the first 3 months it is amazing). The only good thing they did is actually promising every single Arkham Game and TF2 items for those who kept this abomination, except that a ton of people already had other Arkham games, since there is no point of buying this one, if you haven't played previous installments.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS IT IS 90% OFF!NEW: Well, the fixed a lot of problems so now I can play at 60 fps (still not stable), with low textures and shadows (otherwise fps is around 30 fps). Do I recommend this game? No, and I never will. There is a thing called YouTube, go there if you want to see how the story ends. Don't EVER buy it, just to show developers that people are smarter than they think, so they won't be able to release a broken product just to fix it later. Go buy The Phantom Pain that is perfect in every way, or go buy Mad Max, that works perfectly at stable 60 fps on max settings and is fun to play. Stay away from this game even though they fixed it. It is the worst Batman game out of Arkham series (including Origins), and not because, but thanks to one of the worst launch ever. Because it wasn't working players where looking critically at the entire game, not just optimization, and oh boy it is bad. While the main story is a lot of fun (except for Arkham Knight, because this character was awful), but every other aspect is far from good. Every single side-quest is boring and univentive, the Batmobile is pushed down your throat until you scream ""STOP!""DON'T buy this game.OLD: I was able to play it at 30 FPS (not stable) with GTX 960, FX-8320 and 8 Gb RAM... on lowest possible settings (and really low resolution) until it crashed 30 mins later. Saying that this is the worst possible port of a AAA title is not saying enough. I really hope that every single person in Iron Galaxy and WB Interactive Entertainment who had something to do with PC version will get fired and will never be able to work in his entire life, dying alone and broke. This is just insulting. I was going to pre-order Mad Max, but now I will think twice before even buying it. ♥♥♥♥ you WB and ♥♥♥♥ everyone at Iron Galaxy, for ♥♥♥♥ing up Batman for the second time for PC.			"

												As you can see, with my nearly 25 hours on record, I was somehow lucky enough to play this game and get it working without many problems. It only hard crashed once, and i didnt see any noticeibly dreadful perfomance. I did however experience a large drop in FPS whenever I used the batmobile in the open street, which was very nausiating to look at. Overall, the story and the gameplay, if you're lucky like me to be able to get the game working, is very satisfying and one of the best games in the arkham series. However, I personally would not take the risk of buying a broken game until they fix this, which you cant anyway because its off steam, and just go buy it on console. TL;DR: Amazing Game, Terribad Port and you should just get it on console. Kinda sucks to be part of the PC master race right now..			"

But it's at least very playable now.Another thing is that the fps is capped at 30 for no apparent reason. It can easily be fixed in an ini file, though.			"

												After many hours spent in Gotham I can say this: Arkham Knight has succeeded.It may have cost Warner and Rocksteady an amount of time to fix what was broken, but lets face it, mistakes happen, apologies have been made and free DLC was given to compensate.Although the game has its flaws, the overall experience as the Batman is satisfying. The combat still stands, with some new shiny gadgets and a new Batsuit. There were some point during game when I thought that some gadgets from previous games would have been a warm welcome. When I was faced with some breakable walls, I wanted the improved Batclaw for example. Instead I had to fly trough it, which let to some frustration when my speed wasn't fast enough for the third time.The Story is a direct sequel to Arkham City, I will not spoil any major plot points here, but if you are really spoiler sensitive skip to the next paragraph. **MILD SPOILERS AHEAD** The story begins around Halloween and this time Scarecrow takes the lead together with his new angry army general The Arkham Knight. Scarecrow really takes all the credits when it comes to charismatic villains, while the Arkham Knight mostly sounds like a spoiled child.I found a lot of enjoyment in all the little side stories, but overall I was disappointed in some resolutions at the end of the chains. Especially if you invested 15 hours to defeat the Knight and the real battle isn't really face to face.The second story I was disappointed about was Deathstroke, I really expected a Arkham Origins epicness, but after all the taunts the story arch felt flat.Overall the conclusion of the Story (or at least the Scarecrow story) was satisfying and imo, better than Asylum (where are talking about the ending).If you are a gamer who decides to buy a game depending on the length, than this game is worth it. The amount of side objectives is immense, the main story takes about 15-20 hours, and along the way there are many extra missions you can take up like saving firemen crew, stop bank heists, chase villains and of course the infamous riddles.These riddles are not always as fresh and new as they felt in Asylum, and I think Rocksteady over did it a little.Although some are very clever created, a lot of them feel as extra fluff to keep you going, especially as you need them all to get the real ending. YOU READ IT RIGHT, you need ALL THE RIDDLER TROPHIES to get the real good ending.With 243 trophies on the counter, it takes a enormous grind to complete.Of course you can always watch the ending online if it suits you, but if you are like me, you want to earn it by doing it.If all the Riddler challenges and trophies were interesting enough it would be less of a chore, but they aren't, at least not all of them. 150 would have been a better mark.This game introduces you to the full advanced Batmobile. Although I really like to drive around and felt all powerful in this handsome Wayne toy. The shine wears off after hours of gameplay. It has to fit in the story, fit in the game. But to many times it felt as if the game has been built around the Batmobile and thus makes it ""so convenient."" You use it for: Boss battles, challenges, Riddler trophy locations, reaching areas etc . It's like everyone knew Batman was gonna bring his car, so they prepared for it, which feels odd. In the end, it is so overused that the real boss battles from Asylum, City and Origins have no place here, because the Batmobile saves the day every time.Conclusion, Although the city is deserted again and the story tries to sum up a reason for it to happen, it kinda feels lame. It would have been such an enjoyment to finally be the hero for Gotham's civilians, but again we are stuck with thugs only.In the end the game really delivers on fan service, almost every iconic Batman character has to come pass, all the little stories within Gotham are well executed. I think it's sad that some characters haven't got more screen time this time around. The gameplay is solid, but the Batmobile is overused. The pacing could have been a bit better with a bit less of the trophy hunt. The story delivers, the graphics are outstanding and the soundtrack makes the experience complete.7.5/10			"

												Disclaimer: I got this game for free through a Nvidia Newegg promotion along with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for purchasing a GTX 970 graphics card. ---PerformanceHaving played previous titles of this franchise in the past I was excited to try this one out however much to my chagrin it was (and at the time of this review) poorly optimized. I have a relatively decent system and I can ultra or near ultra basically any game on the market today @ 60fps. This game was locked to 30fps and while using the Batmobile the game would spontaneously drop below 20 fps with microhitching and shuttering around every corner.  Make no mistake this game will put tremendous stress on the drive it is installed on.While defragging my games drive I found three seperate installation directories of this game; 2 of which had apparently became corrupted and had been redownloaded by Steam since it could not detect the directory. It took almost half a day to remove this corrupted data and out of fear of permanet damage coupled by the sad performance of the game I decided to ultimately uninstall. On September 3rd 2015 Warner Bros released a patch for this game that was supposed to significantly improve the game stability. Based on the immense negative public outcry that has been rekindled because of this long anticipated patch I will not be revisiting the game as it appears nothing has changed.GameplayIf you are new to the Batman Arkham games it should be noted that combat is generally satisfying. You have access to many hi-tech gadgets and toys that you would expect a billionaire playboy crime fighter to have, as well as the martial prowess of the infamous Batman. You combine these unique advantages to take out criminal scum across Gotham City for the first time ever fully displayed in this franchise. You are not limited to a specific area such as Arkham City or Arkham Asylum and are free to explore within a set game paced progression based on the main story which has you track down a mysterious figure known only as the ""Arkham Knight"".  Even though Batman is incredibly strong, his enemies are numerous and in this title they can be exceptionally dangerous. Instead of fighting thuggish brutes you are now in the crosshairs of private military contractors trained to hunt and kill you. They are outfitted with good gear and trained in ways to defeat your tactics. The Fear mechanic has returned but is not as prevalent as in previous games and because of this they will be less likely to expose their vulnerbilities or break formation while attacking them.  You have to be careful and plan out your attacks from the shadows if you hope to actually win on the harder difficulties as enemies will not give up and one simple mistake can turn a ""wild goose hunt"" into a fully fledged fire fight. The Batmobile as previously mentioned is included heavily within this game. Given the size of Gotham City and the various missions designed to incorporate it's inclusion into the game, you will spend a good amount of time cruising around the city blowing stuff up, running over bad guy cars, and tasing them senseless with your electrified bumper (of great justice). Unlike previous Batmobiles though, this one comes equipped with a cannon - making it essentially a tank - and the NPCs will never let you forget this fact.Stealth is a key componet of any Batman game and graphical/performance issues aside this title keeps in line with tradition on this front. Being able to take your enemy out one by one is still my favorite way of dispatching packs, especially when you hear their dialouge change from ""LETS DO THIS HAHA!"" to ""We're all f*****"" several discovered bodies later. Nothing significantly new was added and as far as I can tell they did not remove anything from the other games. One of my peeves with enemies in this game comes from the lack of identifiying new enemy types or annoucing that they now are a threat. In previous games when a new enemy type appears you would be introduced to what they can do and more importantly how to stop them. In this game, you have to be observant and look at your enemies in detective mode to see what they are carrying, as well what armor/clothing they have on. Certain special enemies such as the medic can revive up to 3 unconscious baddies while stun stick guys do crazy melee damage and are better off taken out with batwings. Final thoughtsI will not go further into explaining the story so that nothing is spoiled, however I did enjoy what I played and was happy to see certain characters make an appearance. Overall this game is really good but is a terrible PC port. If you are a fan of the series or of Batman I would suggest picking up a copy of this on your favorite console and giving it a solid playthrough as the PC version of this game was not handled right and suffers from botched development.

												An amazing end for an amazing franchiseBUT NOT YET IT MIGHT WORK LIKE A PIECE OF CRAP ON YOUR MACHINEMaybe my PC was built when the stars aligned and WB blessed it... because for a reason or another my experience with this game was actually pretty damn fun if not mentioning the 30fps cap. No crashes, and only one single gamebreaking bug that didn't appear again.The batmobile is kinda forced at points but there are some sidemissions involving not any of it.			"

												Even in spite of everything it took to get this game working, it's still not very good. It gave me two main impressions: 1) it's more of the same of the past 3 Arkham games and 2) the Batmobile is so over-represented in the missions that I'd rather have just played either of the Transformers: Cybertron games instead. On top of that, getting the 100% ending is pretty weak sauce - you're better off not wasting your time with the Riddler puzzles, as they get super repetitive and boring between finding them and then solving them quickly thereafter. YouTube is a much more viable option to see the additional 4-5 min of footage. Overall, I'd say appreciate that Iron Galaxy totally botched this port of the game for those who got full refunds already - they saved you money and time in the long run. edit: the other fun fact is that there were at least two lies made during the advertisement of the game regarding plot elements that sorely disappointed throughout.

												Meh .Bigger is not always better as seems to be the trend these days.They did a fantastic job of making a huge void of life and charm uninteresting boring world.All kinds of places to explore just nothing cool to find. Huge packs of mobs to fight but really no reason to fight them. The batmobile is bad♥♥♥♥♥but the automobile combat and puzzles that are a larger part of the game are not that good and honestly it’s been done better in a hundred games over the last 20 years and if I wanted to shoot tanks for hours I would have played one of them.If its collecting objects and solving repetitive puzzles with meaningless combat and chasing achievements is what you enjoy then you’re in luck because this game has it in spades.But for me its always been about the story the characters the depth and lore of the world that keeps me mashing buttons to get to the next part of that story .but not unlike a lot of great franchises these days that seems to be second to collecting orbs or trophies and statues and DLC for costumes or skinns that have no impact on the game at all.

												Don't buy it unless they fix it.Framerate drops, audio stuttering, textures not loading and the list continues on. Even with a PC that exceeds the requirements, the game is not playable. So be a champ and vote with you money because that all they care about it seems. Gameplay - Story is interesting and the Melee Combat is better then ever, but the batmobile kinda ruins the experience. Had it been just a gadget and not a major component it would have been a non issue, but a lot of missions are centered around driving and fighting in it, which is just not fun. If i wanted to drive a tank i would have played World of Tanks not a Batman game.			"

												Unfortunately, AK is a terrible, terrible port. - Performance seems to range from poor to random (I was gettting essentially 30 FPS, went to sleep, tried to play again and getting half)- The Nvidia effects are causing crashes as well as enormous performance drops- The game has a huge memory leak- VRAM usage is ridiculous - it basically eats up all the memory your card has even if it's not necessary- It stutters like hell- It takes nearly 10 seconds to fully load in some textures off my Samsung 840 Evo SSD, other users are reporting textures simply never fully loading- The game is capped at 30 FPS, you can remove the cap but it'll introduce instability and performance drops- There are very few graphics options, meaning the game has pretty much 0 scalability- No toggles for post-processing options like motion blur, chromatic aberration, depth of field, film grain or bloom- Motion blur is a big cause of huge FPS drops and stuttering- Verifying the game's integrity on Steam will cause the game to corrupt and delete itself- Performance is even worse on AMD cardsThe game itself seems to be quite good, but this is the worst PC port I've played since AC: Unity. And that's saying something. Iron Galaxy Studios appear to be behind the PC port - so I don't know how much blame Rocksteady or WB deserve. Regardless, this is a complete mess and a disgrace to gaming. Consoles are apparently having issues too, although nowhere near as many as us PC gamers. Add in the fact that people who got the game by buying a new Nvidia card were suddenly refused access to the pre-order DLC hours before the game unlocked and the fact that WB didn't send out any PC copies to be reviewed, and we've got one of the worst PC ports coupled with some of the worst business practices from the history of gaming. This is an insult to gamers, fans of Batman, and the hard work that's gone into the franchise.			"

												I don't even want my money back. I just want Rocksteady to come out and say something like this.    ""We realize that our game chugs more than a university campus. We realize that most of the noises the batmobile makes, are not in fact the batmobile, and are indeed the sounds of your computer screaming for some sort of help.  We've asked our Devs what was going on, and they replied by saying that, its not lag, its just permaanent bullet-time when youre driving the batmobile.""But seriously, stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this. More can go wrong playing this game than if you liqoured up a two year old and left him in charge of a Missle Launch Control Center. On a side note, this game has more rain than Cambodia in typhoon season. I strongly suspect that the people of Gotham left because of a violent flood, instead of the dude in a gas mask on a TV who beat up a Diner (even if it was Pauli's Diner, the roughest toughest diner this side of Laggity Mc♥♥♥♥ing Lag Of Lagsaton).

This might be enjoyable, but it isn't there yet. I don't think I'm going to pre-order anything anymore. I don't trust Rocksteady anymore either. The fact that they changed the reccomended specs a few days before launch should be considered false advertising. AMD users are basically screwed as well. They made damn sure Nvidia has their added features, but couldn't even make a playable game for AMD users.

												Important things you should know before you decide whether to buy this game:1. Even after 4 month of 'fixing' work from WB brothers, this game still has serious problems, which reminds me of Mortal Kombat X, also a piece of crap. And some guy from WB has just said, you need at least 12 GB RAM to 'run this game smoothly';2. It's true that WB will offer you free copies of games from Batman Library. For those who are new to Batman game,  pls notice, you can get them withing 10 bucks in any other website of key retailers, rather than pay more than 40 bucks to buy this game on steam and get them for free. Of course, if you are an old fan of Batman series who have already bought every game of its kind, in return to your loyalty and patience, you will get nothing! Isn't it amazing? Cheers!;3. Game itself, except for terrible optimization, is great. The whole story line is fascinating and new Batmobile is of great fun.  I would suggest you to buy a key from any other key retailers with much lower price to experience the game. ( I got mine withing 15 bucks).And some words for WB: You guys have really wasted this wonderful game on PC. It should have been one of the best games this year, but now... Batman is dead for sure.

												this version of the game is a joke, the textures are ugly and blurry. The game runs well enough but the graphics ruin the experience. A good test of a game for me is when I dont feel like running through it, but instead walk and absorb the environment and little details people work hard to put in the game. To take time and do all the side missions so I can be part of the world I am escaping into for as long as possible. The pc version has been stripped of all the graphics that make this possible. It is hard to decide whether this was pure incompetence or intentional, and honestly I am not sure which one would be worse. I am officially refunding the game after waiting since the launch, and several incredibly vague updates with no real indication of a time frame other than "" it will take some time"".

												                I liked this game a lot (this is quite clear from the fact that I continued to play it in the current state), but the terrible quality of the port cannot be ignored and the publisher has to be condemned for outsourcing the PC version to a small studio of twelve people for a game with a price tag of 50 euros (55?! Plus DLCs). It shows a lack of respect for the PC market and its customers and they probably would have gotten away and sold millions (just like Watch Dogs did) if there wasn’t the option for refunds. Let this be a lesson to any publisher that tries to screw up the PC gamers, as we are vocal and we made ourselves heard, through refunds and overwhelmingly negative scores that are not necessarily justifiable to the game’s quality but reflect our frustration towards this treachery.But is the problematic port making Batman: Arkham Knight a bad game? Nowhere near close to that. It is a true and true action game, without selectable dialogues or moral choices just for the sake of it as this is not a role playing but rather a very interactive experience as Batman following his rules and his unchangeable story. The story is flawlessly written and plays out in an unpredictable way putting an end to a six years long series that has done to superheroes video games what the Dark Knight series has done with superheroes movies (Can I get a Green Lantern series like these ones?!).                I can’t say that the game is worth buying now as its technical state is still a mess and playing at 30fps with heavily forced in motion blur is tiring. But in a few weeks or months when most of the problems are fixed it might be a title that should not be missed by fans of the genre and Batman alike.Pros:+ Excellent story+ Great world design+ Good graphics and physics+ High quality voice acting+ Lots of villains and heroes from the Batman universe+ Addictive gameplay+ Batmobile+ 40+ hours of gameplay+ Puzzles+ Completist’s heavenCons:- Horrible performance problems- Locked at 30fps (even if it's unlocked from .ini it is still unstable)- Lacks important graphics features and options- Multifunctional keys- Secondary missions can be repetitive- No serious boss fights- Batmobile is overusedRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/07/batman-arkham-knight-review.html "

												This games state at launch will be a downwards comparison for shoddy PC ports for years to come. Literally. Hopefully PC users will get a half decent and, more importantly, STABLE experience with this game soon, as I look forward to enjoying it and being able to reccomend it to others. As for right now, its an overwhelming ""NO"" from my perspective. Don't touch this thing with a ten foot pole unless you are MORE than confident in the fidelity of your hardware. Finally I seriosuly have to reprimand Warner Bros. for chaning their minimum requirements just several hours before the actual launch of the game, and since then the have release a statement claiming that further ""testing"" is still required to deliver the users and optimized experience. Ask yourself how long this game was available for pre order, and just how much of our money WB has made off this game, before it even officially came out. Then ask yourself why WB would find it remotely reasonable to claim that the testing on our behalf is JUST NOW beginning.			"

												Let me say this first : I, like many other players, love the Arkham games like crazy, even Origins, and what I could see of the content so far makes me believe this can be a great game.BUT WB ♥♥♥♥ed this up pretty badly by letting a subpar console port dev take the job of a real studio with an experienced crew. It's the same they did with MK X. And they lied about minimum specs, even corrected them 12 hours before release.The Question that remains is, should you buy this? Right now definetly not. In the state that it is in it is mostly unplayable. Heavy stutters, framerate drops without reasons, memory leaks, only a few ingame options for graphic effects and the important ones you have to tweak via the ini-file yourself AND they added a DRM-System (Denuvo) that is known to have caused preformance problems (Lords of the Fallen, Dragon Age : Inquisition) barely days before release. So if you really wanna buy a game right now you should better spend your money on something that works and not this steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥WB calls a working game.			"

												The PC version is locked to 30 FPS and is missing textures and ambient occlusion present in the console versions.30 FPS. In 2015.It doesn't matter what I think of the game apart from its performance, because this comes off as a scam product from a no-name indie developer. I cannot recommend that you buy this game. On the contrary, I recommend that you don't. Don't be a fool like me and give Rocksteady money for this embarrassing joke of a PC port.			"

												1. I have no problems with framerates nor crashes2. I have no major complaints with the batmobile.3. I've played AA, AC, AO.I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimal.AK, ah the end to a series that introduced me to Batman and just how awesome he is. Before I touched AA, I've always thought Batman to belong to the 'boring superheroes' group. After playing AA though, all that changed. I googled every characters that I encountered in the game, villians/heroes/sidekicks alike. Slowly immersing myself in Gotham, learning as much as I can in order to relieve the true experience in the game, and slowly liking it more and more. What really impressed me was AA's freeflow battles when I first took part in one. It was a first for me to experience such battles and boy was it fun!! So simple, yet so effective, some things are fixed, yet gives you the illusion that you are in control; ingenious, for lack of a better word. And I was glad things felt the same in AO and AC as well.Battle SystemAs for AK - Hits and misses, it's still freeflow, but things seems to have loosen up abit, as seen with the new introduction of rooftop hybrid-predator battles, as well as the controls not feeling as tight. I've made a couple of mistakes I'd never make in the previous three. But still satisfiying when you get no damage.Also, what is up with the distance batman and team can cover? I can punch a man here and leap 10km away (exaggerated, but srsly) to kick another, I didn't know batman crossed over and took lessons from Spider-man, damn, kinda makes the magic go away during the first 1 or 2 battles I partook. It wasn't this unrealistic in previous titles, afaik.They seem to have loosen up the grappling as well, you can pretty much grapple anything you can see right now, yep even things you never really wanted to grappled, lel. WORKS WONDERS when you are playing some of the hybrid-predator scenarios on rooftops /sMissions / Side MissionsLet me just say most side missions including the DLCs were well thought out and extremely detailed, the heart and thoughts that were put into these were pretty much amazing, majority of dialogues that were around were unique and there were tons of pressing A (Xbox controller) whenever I was in GCPD. Seeing the cells fill up everytime I go back was defintely satisfying too. HOWEVER when it came down to anything militia related, Good god they are the most annoying bunch I've ever seen, including Scarecrow and AK himself. It really gets tedious towards the end.Empty, meaningless threats - 'Muwahahahaha u will neber defeat me Batman!!' *throws 62 more checkpoints, 80 guard towers, 20 land mines and 32 Cobra drones.'Militia commenting that 'haha batman thinks he can win', when I've already twarted 3 semi-major events including defeating your stupid edgey commander!Look Scarecrow, AK, in case you don't know, I'm already 85% in the game and have already destroyed 6,000 checkpoints, approximately 3,200 guard towers, 5 land mines and 80 cobra drones and an almost complete genocide of your militia army, I'd need 200 GCPDs to accomodate all of them, AND YET YOU ARE STILL RAMBLING ON AND ON ON THAT STUPID SCREEN OF YOURS SAYING HOW YOU WILL DEFEAT ME WITH THE SAME OLD THINGS??? Those fear gas of yours should be relabeled as dumb gas.Now you may think I may be exaggerating a little, but as a completionist, I've 100% all riddler's challenges in AA, AO and AC and I'm already 82% in AK and intend to 100% to get the ultimate ending. So I don't use the word 'tedious' lightly.And just FYI, Riddler's mission aren't tedious. As a matter of fact, it is the star of all side missions in Arkham Series, it's so varied, and you always look forward to progressing, just to see riddler's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off face and hear him scream. Ladies and gentlemen, that is how you make a seemingly tedious progression not tedious - innovation, surprise, mix it up. Imagine all riddler's trophy sitting around only with no puzzles whatsoever, that is how all mlitia related side quests are.It's annoying everytime I have to go through it, and I have to say this is the first time I felt this annoyed in an Arkham series.Abilities,Gadgets4 letters - OP AF.Yes I get that Batman is supposed to be OP, especially since he is already established in AK. But srsly when you are in a game this long, with what I've mentioned above, all these isn't really helping. Back when I played AA, you can never help but feel that Batman IS there, just not quite since you need to level up to unlock abilities to progress, get that trophy, or simply kick people's♥♥♥♥♥in a more satisfying way. and you worked hard and progress for it.Well in AK It's 'here all these is for you' bruce wayne's parents died here's the deed and ten gazillion dollars style, now go kick some♥♥♥♥♥ Yep very fun inititally when you can already glide so high and travel so far, pull off all the abilities mapped to your controller in such complex ways, sometimes I don't even know what button I'm supposed to pressed.But when you have a game this long, you really need something to look forward too, and apart from comestical upgrades and abilities that you REALLY DO NOT NEED to complete the game, this really does make the game boring during the later parts. Oh look, drones - here a disruptorOh look, devices that can detect you in detective mode - here a disruptorOh look, devices that jams your detective mode - here a disruptorOh look, MINES!!!! - here.....-.-StoryAs much as my overly exasperating mish mash of words on how the overall interaction of the militias, Scarecrow and AK have been, the story is amazing, period. I look forward to progressing everytime I complete one part, but being the perfectionist I am, I have to go through all the side missions as much as I can before progressing, which really kinda gives me a love hate relationship for this game.And Joker, THANK GOD FOR JOKER I LOVE YOU MR J!!!!!!!!!!To sum it up, the story is like watching Blizzard's cinematics, you just can't stop! One of the main reasons why I will complete this game. Props to the writer, you guys have always been the best. BatmobileAn interesting addition to the game, I like it, however I think the main reasons why people are complaining is the controls, wow it really worked my wrists and it does get frustrating sometimes. Should they continue in insurgency, I hope they tighten the controls, it would be lovely. And do get rid of battle mode or at least please don't send 62 useless drones to my locations, NEWSFLASH I am THE Batman and this is my Batmobile, pls gtfo, thanks.Race courses by Riddler, damn well thought out as well, worth a mention.GraphicsTons of complaints back then, main reason why AK has a mixed overall review right now, but this plays smoothly for me, most things on normal, no crashes, Everything is Gotham, beautifully Gotham.The addition of Nvidia Gameworks is really impressive as well, especially lights shaft, interative fog/smoke and interactive papers, unfortunately my system is not a beast and I have to turn it off else there will be stuttering here and there, but it is a positive addition to the game if your system is capable of running it. Overall, I'll still give it a thumbs up for the effort you can see that was put into this game, however all newly implemented features require polishing, and for the militais, you sometimes can't help but feel the developers got lazy somewhere along the line.An explosive start to a seemingly smithering late game, worth a buy still as long as it's on sale.

												Maybe in a week or two, assuming they patch this broken ♥♥♥♥ing mess, I'll recommend it. Right now, it's just so horribly optimized.I seem to be fine just on foot, but when the batmobile is on screen suddenly everything just dies and starts to ♥♥♥♥ up. Good thing I didn't actually waste money on this game, thanks to the deal with a GTX 970 I bought giving me a free copy. Assuming they do fix the major performance issues, I'll change the review and go more in-depth with everything else. Not really able to get to the story, when I just can't play for more than 10 minutes before huge stuttering and performance issues decide to kick in.			"

												Worst PC port I've played in years. Runs like hot garbage on SLI GTX 980 Ti's. Literally howHas terrible post-processing effects you cannot disable even in a .ini like chromatic aberration and film grain.Comes locked at 30 FPS by default.No HBAO+, ambient occlusion, etc. Textures aren't that great despite using way too much VRAM.In-game anti-aliasing option is pathetic, just an ""Off/On"" toggle that enables a terrible form of FXAA. It's missing higher quality AA like MSAA that was in previous Batman games.Looks much worse than the previous Batman games in general. The Gameworks effects look pretty good, excellent smoke effects, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this game's visuals.			"

												Held off on this for about a week to let them work out the many MANY flaws. We have seen one patch but a lot of us are still in the gutter. My textures won't load. The only character who doesnt look like he wrestled with Clayface and never washed off is Batman. Having to turn down the graphics settings on a rig that can run all of todays games on max hurts the heart. Of course this wouldnt be such a HUGE deal if the game worked on the absolute lowest settings but it doesn't. The constant framerate drops and terrible textures make the game insanely hard to enjoy. Plus having to go into the .ini files to disable the 30 fps lock(I'm sorry what year is this?) is also very annoying. All of my friends who play on console have already long since beaten the game while I wait and twiddle my thumbs waiting for a patch that might fix these issues. I get down on my knees every night and praise the lord I did not pay full price for this atrocity. 10/10EDIT: So the patch came out a couple days ago in SEPTEMBER. Only 3 months since the games release. And the game is still broken for me.			"

												Where the hell do I even begin with this damn game....This is actually my secondreview. Though initially I gave it a positive review, claiming that, even though it didn't run very well, it was still a very solid game on the basis of its gameplay and story, and we shouldn't be so quick to judge it, considering they were hard at work on a patch to address the numerous issues that this god-awful port faced.That was five months ago. Five ♥♥♥♥ing months. And we just got the patch a few days ago. Since that patch, the game won't even start in fullscreen for many players, and those who can get the damn game running report that it's practically unchanged from the recent ""Patch""--the only thing that seems to have been added is the DLC that console players have been enjoying over the past half-year.Yes. The story is great. Yes. The gameplay is fun. But I can't recommend this damn game to anyone on any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platform on the simple basis that CLEARLY, they don't give a damn about the people who're buying their product. Clearly they don't give a damn about selling an actual quality product. Oh, and it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's another nail in the coffin.Update: There have been a few updates to the game since I rewrote this review, and I am less than excited to say that the biggest post-""big update"" flaw, that is, the game won't start in fullscreen for just about anyone, is still plaguing the game. You can, of course, run it in borderless window mode, but you shouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing have to.Update 2: I've long since lost count of the months, and I've long since given up hope of actually getting to play the new DLC, because the game STILL won't open in fullscreen. This hasn't stopped them from releasing more and more DLC, of course.Bottom line: I give up. The game doesn't work, and it never will work. It's sad, because I really want to love this game. Mechanically, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Graphically, it's more than beautiful, it's stunning. And the story? Apart from the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""reveal"" of the Arkham Knight's ""secret"" identity(Yes, you really did guess it right the first time you saw him), it's easily among the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen in any media. Even the AK's ""reveal"" is excused by his incredible motivation, and his stunning backstory.But you won't get the chance to experience it, even if you do buy it.			"

												This game is broken.  Even after a few patches, the game still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥  But having beaten this on a PS4 copy, which I borrowed, I can say the game isn't really worth your time even if it was fixed.  Even if you can play the game with your $10,000 PC you won't find much fun in cruising in the Batmobile for 10 plus hours of a 15 hour game.  The best part about the Arkham games was the combat, but with the Batmobile, forget about ever fighting anyone.  Instead if you aren't made to drive through an obstacle course, you have to shoot endless waves of tanks.  If you spend some time out in the streets fighting thugs you will be disappointed everytime they run away cause the Batmobile gets close.  I spent a lot of time running down empty tunnels before arriving at a dead end.  To get through I needed the Batmobile, but the Batmobile wouldn't just appear because I suppose there was a puzzle I needed to solve about 10 minutes the other way, but I could just easily grapple over whatever contraption they had ""designed"".This game literally takes the best part of the entire series and makes it the fourth thing you do. TLDR; Too much Batmobile.  Very little combat.  One, or two predator sequences.  Good story, but a chore to get through.  The challenge maps are the core Arkham experience, but without the story there really was no point in doing them.			"

												I have been more than patient with Warner Bros. and Rocksteady. They failed to deliver back in June, but everybody already knows about that, so let me skip to The October 28 patch should have fixed all the issues (about time, no?) Sadly, the game still lags and is horribly optimised. I cannot play this game unless I have the resolution so low that Batman becomes Blurman, and my laptop is better than the supposed ""minimum"" requirements. Whenever I go to the main menu, I see PlayStation buttons that then quickly change back to keyboard and mouse icons, just to remind me that this game was ported by Dumb and Dumber themselves.This game is a complete and utter disgrace and I hope that WB is held accountable for their neglect. I have looked forward to this game for years, and now, four months after the initial release date, I still cannot play it. I'm done. I will never pay for another Warner Bros. and/or Rocksteady game. I will try my hardest to get my money back for this steaming pile of batshit. "

												*DO NOT BUY YET HORRIBLY OPTIMIZED BUT IT IS A GOOD GAME*Ummm... so there is this part... maybe 5 min into the game where you  save a police officer  and they talk about how the city is over run and the odds are stacked against them. Then batman says ""im evening the odds"" *press E to even the odds*""Even the odds"" means you cut your already locked 30fps to 1-2 fps as it summons the batmobile. then its goes back to 30 as you are able to move the camera around again. *press W to accelerate* means ""kill the fps to 5-10""... This is just rediculous. I've played it on ps4 and the game is amazing, so i bought it for PC. Don't buy it for PC. Devs are working on patches for it... wait for them!I have a  i5 4690, 8gb gskill ram and a GTX 970 SC... so i can handle anything that is thrown my way pretty much.

I have to admit that it works with difficulty but worked on my PC. Driving through the city batmobile was difficult so I finished the game on 40% of the plot hoping that something will fix. Probably three months have passed and it is worse than it was. The image is so free Batman seems to walk in slow motion Batmobile ride is basically not possible.

												*DO NOT BUY YET HORRIBLY OPTIMIZED BUT IT IS A GOOD GAME*Ummm... so there is this part... maybe 5 min into the game where you  save a police officer  and they talk about how the city is over run and the odds are stacked against them. Then batman says ""im evening the odds"" *press E to even the odds*""Even the odds"" means you cut your already locked 30fps to 1-2 fps as it summons the batmobile. then its goes back to 30 as you are able to move the camera around again. *press W to accelerate* means ""kill the fps to 5-10""... This is just rediculous. I've played it on ps4 and the game is amazing, so i bought it for PC. Don't buy it for PC. Devs are working on patches for it... wait for them!I have a  i5 4690, 8gb gskill ram and a GTX 970 SC... so i can handle anything that is thrown my way pretty much. It's kind of sad to see new game this horribly optimized.			"

												Another Batman game, this time with the batmoble in it.Unfortunately it does not run as smoothly as the other three games yet costs more and during the porting process they didnt think it wise to allow customisation of graphical settings to allow a wide range of PCs to play it, hence the low score.Either upgrade to 16Gig of ram or wait until its patched before buying it.

												Why WB Games why?? Why is it that us PC gamers are to suffer always. Everynow and then there is a poor port of a game from the consoles to the PC. We PC gamers spend our hard earned money on expensive PC hardware and the end result is that you give us buggy games to play on them. Please improve your quality standards.			"

												Despite having apparently brought in Rocksteady to work their magic, all the patch notes are basically ""added support for new DLC"". It's never gonna be fixed.As for the game itself, the campaign is a pretty meaty one that more often than not has 3-5 side missions also vying for your attention at the same time. I thought the story was quite solid overall (with a couple really stupid moments and I called the two biggest twists LONG before they played out), and I think the combat's gotten a bit easier, for better or for worse. The biggest complaints I have start to set in after beating the game and going for 100%: despite that I had a lot of fun with the Batmobile, the game is horribly overreliant on it yet doesn't use it to its full potential (I'm pretty sure you use the winch all of ONE time to scale a building). Almost all the boss battles are overwrought Batmobile combat sequences, some are outright carbon copies of one another, and some aren't boss battles at all.And then if you want to see the true ending you need to get 100%, which gets tiring very quickly. Do all the ground-based outposts, do all the highrise outposts, take out all the flying drones, foil the bank robberies, rescue the firemen, and face a few hundred waves of drone tanks in the Batmobile to defuse all the landmines. Chasing down the APCs and Firefly were by far the most entertaining parts because they were actually somewhat challenging. 32 hours in, and NOW I can start worrying about all 340 of the Riddler's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trinkets.Despite all my complaints, the campaign holds its own quite well and is a pretty satisfying conclusion to the series; the shortcomings mostly present themselves in the side missions and postgame. Don't worry yourself over the Harley Quinn DLC, though -- it lasts all of 15 minutes and is barely worth the time spent on it.			"

												Batman: Arkham KnightHaving owned this game for about a year I can tell you I am supremely disappointed by this title and Rocksteady. I have waited until July 2016 to release my opinion on this game. Batman: Arkham Knight isn't a bad game per se, it just falls short in some crucial spots like game performance, which has impacted my review.Positives:+ Nice graphics, good lighting and rain effects.+ The concept of combat remains solid, with lots of different attacks. It's fun, albeit difficult to combo.+ Lots of unique gadgets to use, some that make a return from previous iterations of Batman and others are entirely new.+Very intriguing characters and a great story.+ Riddler trophies and mini puzzles are quite enjoyable.Negatives:- This point is entirely dedicated to the batmobile which is over-used throughout the game, becoming extremely tedious. Endless drone, cobra and APC hunting in side quests with extra tanks thrown in during the main story, make batmobile involvement beyond excessive.- Combat hotkeys are badly implemented into the game and they are unnecessarily complex...There's a crouch toggle and then a 'hold down' crouch button which makes no sense.To hide in grates I need to use the ""hold down' crouch + middle mouse, but I never use 'hold down' crouch usually, since it's outdated and pointless with a toggle crouch. So I'm basically using one key for a very particular action. The game is not streamlined at all. It's the same story for combos in fights. I don't use WASD for movement, I changed this to the arrow keys - but I still need to press the 1,2,3,4 keys to execute combos, which are half way across the keyboard. - Big technical issues at launch, which I let slide as I waited for patches to correct the problems. 6 months passed and the game still didn't run efficiently. With a Nvidia Geforce GTX 970, 8 GB of RAM and an i7 CPU, I expect Batman: Arkham Knight to work smoothly on a relatively high setting, but minor and severe FPS drops occur during batmobile pursuits and in certain areas of the game world to this day. This is a killer for the experience and very irritating.Overall score: 7/10 Disclaimer: I've scored this game 7 because the content is fantastic, it really is. It'd be a 9/10 if it simply worked. But it doesn't, so it takes a hard hit of 2 points. It's still playable, but it should be better than what it is performance wise.			"

												The Batman series has taken me along for the ride. I should probably explain upfront the elephant in the room; the thing that everyone needs to know and yet somehow no one seems to be talking about.In between Arkham City and Arkham Knight, the game was handed to an Ipad Factory developer and Warner Bros.-owned Warner Montreal. Warner Montreal has never made a blockbuster to save their life, so basically what that team did was copy Arkham City almost exactly, and try to bring back a few old faces from the Batman comic. They failed spectacularly. Arkham Origins was a complete flop.     The reason for this decision was simple. Rocksteady is a great developer, and Warner Inc is greedy. Rocksteady said, after Arkham City: ""We're not really happy with our engine. You need to give us a few years to improve our code."" Not able to compel Rocksteady into action, they redeployed Rocksteady's secondary assets to Montreal. The problem with this is it stymied development of Arkham Knight, causing the game's PC release to be glitchy and unfinished when it finally arrived. TLDR: A lot of these negative reviews reflect poorly on the publisher, not on the game. Arkham Knight is the natural progression of the Arkham series. If you haven't played the other games, you won't understand the story of this one. If I wasn't a Batman fan, I would probably be confused with the time skip even after playing the previous games. It was rather jarring after seeing Oracle in a supporting role in City, and then being bumped up to a major recurring character in Knight. A lot of the story was left out and I think it might have been more evocative to see what happened with the supporting cast. Oh well. Functionally, I like this game. It feels very very smooth. When you call the batmobile, it's like the game intelligently decides how to cinematically drop Batman's model into the cockpit. If you're in the air, the car will drive beneath you and try to land you seamlessly in your seat. On the ground? The car will drive past you and the Batman model will take a quick hop in the air. Want to get out quickly? The model will eject and the car will drift to a halt. It's very well done. A lot of effort went into asthetics. Combat is pretty nice. Improvements were made on the counter system. Now trying to fit your strikes in with blocks isn't such a big deal.  I was disappointed with a lack of innovative level up incentives. The ability to use one specific gadet while flying costs 4 tech points? Also, some of the upgrades didn't unlock in normal mode until you were way past used to dealing with certain annoying enemies. All of the gripes I have with Knight are with production choices. Scarecrow's voice actor ISN'T SCARY. He sounds too much like Hugo strange. Hearing his voiceovers as I'm driving around makes me want to yawn. Jonathan Crane is supposed to be a spindly little doctor with a sadistic streak. Where is that character? Production turned him into a generic-o-matic villain. The character is flat and not fun. On the flip side, there is a certain surprise actor who does an amazing job, as always, and the production team did a great job of standing him up. I wish they had spent a little more time on Scarecrow.Where is Jervish Tetch? The mad hatter is my favorite villain. All I get is a little sidenote in the evidence locker? shame. All in all? 8/10. It's a great game. It certainly has my vote for GotY			"

												So I liked all the Arkham games, including this one. In terms of gameplay, this is not a great departure from the last three games. You are Batman and you alternate between jumping from rooftop to rooftop beating up random dudes and then having fisticuffs with crowds of jerks. Like Arkham City and Origins, it's still an open world sandbox game wherein Batman fights to protect a city that seems to be populated exclusively with dudes who are lining up to rob a bank or knock over a jewelry store. Seriously, besides one building of cops, a couple of firefighters and Batman's assorted sidekicks, the entire city is just a pack of dip♥♥♥♥♥. It makes you sort of wonder why saving it is even worth it in the first place. Anyhow, that aside, the main innovation is you have the Batmobile, which is a tank thingie that's fun enough to use. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's not like the Batmobile segments aren't fun or whatnot. The story meanwhile is pretty strong, although due to the comic book origins of the series it pulls a lot of punches. I think this is supposed to be the last of the Arkham games, so you'd think that the creators would be more willing to kill characters. I mean, it's not like if you kill them in this game they're deleted from the comic book forever guys. But in spite of that, there are some incredibly good scenes and I was very interested from start to finish. Some plot twists are  presented a bit too obviously (the identity of the Arkham Knight is painfully obvious for about three hours), but most of it  still comes together pretty solidly. Until you get to the ending. Or well, I should say ""Until you see what the ending involves"". Because in order to actually see what happens at the end you've got to collect every single mother♥♥♥♥ing Riddler trophy. All 250 or so of them. I don't understand Rocksteady's obsession with those ♥♥♥♥ing things. Is it just a petulant idea that if you go through all this trouble making a big sandbox city that you ought to put♥♥♥♥♥♥around to make sure the player goes around appreciating all of it? Ugh.I ended up watching the ending on Youtube. It was alright. But the fact that the game locked it behind tedious collection quests is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Still, beyond that it's a good game. I'll probably play some of the DLC.			"

												I've played the other batman games on their release dates and it was no where near as horrifying as this. Thank God for Steam refunds. I will be asking for my money back. Now before you rip into me yes I played a little bit and only a little bit and no I do not think this is... this is not Rocksteady. Seriously wtf happened? So before you rip on me let me tell you why I will be doing this and why you should not buy this game! I apologize ahead of time for my language and a lot of it being beeped by Steam filter but I am extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ here.Anyways I booted up the game got really excited! Then I went to the graphics options and... what? This is the most bare bones options I have ever seen. I mean sure you got the special effects for Nvidia but... no changes in AA? No motion blur off? No Triple Vertical Sync?! Yikes... I had a little expectations but this was way way below them. I mean really low.Moving on to the game. Ok so I start it up voice acting sounds odd... on Jim Gordan. Is that just effects? Whatever. Music and rest of the voices are awesome. Visuals HOLY ♥♥♥♥! THIS IS AMAZING Oh whats this? Locked at 30 FPS??? Ah it's just a cut scene it'll fix itself after. Get to the cop scene ""Uhhh.... it's still 30 FPS...."" that right there made my heart sink. Jesus I was disappointed. Holy crap 60 dollars down the drain I was thinking at this point. I kept hoping for better. I said ""No this is Rocksteady... they have never disappointed.""♥♥♥♥ was I wrong. Holy ♥♥♥♥ was I ever ♥♥♥♥ing wrong. What the ♥♥♥♥ did I purchase here? This is not ♥♥♥♥ing Rocksteady quality. I glided over to Jim Gordon in what seemed to be... erratic FPS from 30 to 10 to 30 again to 35 (??? how? it's capped at 30.) then it goes to 30 again. I'm over here gritting my teeth saying what the ♥♥♥♥... over and over. This makes me start to think WB Games Montreal had their hands in this! Ok I land and start talking to Gordon. This is the point where I threw my headphones down. My 250 dollar audio techa headphones to the ground... and said ""NO ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥! NO! ♥♥♥♥ NO!"" Gordon's voice sounds like it was recorded in a ♥♥♥♥ing shoe box or by some amateur! WHAT?! NO WAY! NO WAY IN HELL! I am an audiophile and I noticed this ♥♥♥♥ quick comparing Batman's voice and Gordon's voice! LORD! THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH 20 DOLLARS! ♥♥♥♥! THE STEAM SUMMER SALE IS OVER AND NOW I HAVE THIS 60 DOLLAR CREDIT FOR NOTHING?! ARGH!Take this from a huge PC Gamer / Audiophile. I am not that picky. I played games like Hyperdimension Neptunia. That game is not exactly what you call PC optimized but they tried and it's a pretty good job. The visuals are not fantastic either. I expect that though from a small publisher trying to do a big game like that with a lot of Japanese voice acting and a low fan base in America. My point is I wouldn't have these expectations if it was coming from a company with little money. A company like WB who publishes a game like Shadow of Mordor then publishes this? HAH! NO! THIS IS NOT WORTH ANYMORE THAN 20 DOLLARS OR LESS! THIS IS CRAP!			"

												Alright so after waiting for 4 months for this game to be fixed I finally gave up since Rocksteady failed to fix it and it seems like there's not gonna be any more further patches (at least I haven't heard of any) I decided to finally get my hands on the final chapter of one of my favorite videogame series of all time. This review is 100% spoiler-free.Before we get to the review itself I gotta say what has already been said by thousands of people: this is unforgivable how bad this pc port is. Yes my pc is far from top notch but it's definitely above average (i5 2500, gtx 960) and even if it's not capable of maxing this game out, it should at least let me play on medium settings without any problems but instead it dips down to 40ies and still freezes in 720p/all low/everything turned off, let alone 1080p medium that I've mentioned. This is unacceptable and there's nothing that can justify such attitude towards pc gamers and fans of batman arkham series. But in the end I feel like we should put all the bias and emotions aside and review the actual game, not the performance, so here it is:Visually batman arkham knight is stunning and lucky guys who could max it out had their opportunities to enjoy amazing graphics. The city is indeed huge but surprisingly it doesn't feel empty at all. There are bad guys hanging out around every corner, cars, drones, tanks, helicopters, AR challenges, 15 side missions, activities are all over the place, you won't get bored, take my word for it. Oh and have I mentioned the most controversial addition to the series? - The batmobile! I think you either hate it or love it to honest. Not gonna lie you will spend a lot of time in it and if you dislike it then most likely it will ruin your experience a little bit. I personally loved it and how smarly it is utilized in the game: you don't only use it as a transport or a weapon but also you use it to solve riddler challenges and campaign puzzles and it may sound simple but again trust me you better see how amazing it's implemented in the campaign. The batmobile of course looks cool, handles amazingly while driving and as a tank it's really fun to use as well. It's definitely something fresh and new and improves the gameplay which has already been great since... forever. Speaking of the gameplay: it's as good as it gets, better than ever before. Batman's movement during combats and in predator rooms is so refined, so slick and smooth that I doubt it can be put into words. In combat batman became even faster and more creative, he uses walls to get a momentum for his leg punch (which looks absolutely fantastic btw), and he uses environment to perform finishing moves. His enemies became stronger, they require more devices, awareness and strategy from a player - mashing one button is not gonna cut it. They've added medics that can revive knocked out thugs, ninjas who dodge your straight attacks and then magically try to stab you from behind when they're out of your sight and big dudes now have shields! Predator encounters which I personally didn't like as much as the combat became so good I wish there were more: now you don't need to be directly behind your enemy to get a silent takedown, you don't need to jump off the ledge or any surface if you're above the enemy to get that silent takedown either! And yes that sounds like a small thing but trust me it becomes a lot more convenient and less frustrating. Batman can now break through any glass to get a takedown from both above and below, he can also break through glass to get to the vantage point too, and grappling from the floor vents all the way up to the vantage point through the vent shaft is my absolute favorite thing to do in the predator rooms. Have I even mentioned this new FEAR TAKEDOWN that allows you to dive down into a group of enemies and eliminate up to 5 of them in a row even if they stand relatively far to each other? And I'm so overwhelmed by emotions while writing this review that I completely forgot to mention about your partners that help you fight bad guys. Fighting back to back with catwoman, robin and nightwing was a lot of fun and ""duel team takedowns"" were satifsying as hell!So far it seems like I'm talking about a game of the century here, right? So at this point I wanna move on to the story and that's where things start to get a little mixed up and where my first gripes with the game appear. The story itself is amazing, it's so well-written and interesting that it literally doesn't give you a second to catch a breath, it makes you wanna play from the beginning up until the very end. What's the problem then? This game is called ""Arkham knight"", he is the main villian along with the scarecrow and he had to be someone whose revelation would blow our minds out and that's where this game makes a pretty big misstep, because his identity becomes pretty obvious way before the actual revelation encounter and it takes away a lot of tension and interest. It's not something that completely ruins it, but this should've been done better and there's no denying it. Next thing I was very unsatisfied with was the boss battles... the absence of the boss battles to be precise. I mean yes there were some weak boss battles throughout the main campaing but they were nowhere near the level they should've been as for THE FINAL EPIC CONCLUSION OF A FIGHTING GAME. I was expecting a galore of very difficult bosses, but unfortunately it never happened. After all an amazing story that kept me excited somehow made it up for the lack of boss fights and a terrible main villain revelation. The ending. I had to think about it for a while because I had to analyze it myself and I came to the conclusion that it was very fitting, satisfying and done right. It's dramatic and badass at the same time and I felt like what happened - had to happen so bravo to Rocksteady for a proper finale to this epic series.So that basically brings me to the final verdict. Despite a few important shortcomings that could potentially ruin this game completely I still feel like the overall experience was outstanding, so I give Batman: Arkham Knight a 9/10.This could've easily been a game of the year, a game of the generation or even a game of the decade contender if it wasn't for the mentioned cons and an awful pc port which drove a lot of pc gamers insane.

Explore the entirety of Gotham City – For the first time, players have the opportunity to explore all of Gotham City in a completely open and free-roaming game world. More than five times that of Batman: Arkham City, Gotham City has been brought to life with the same level of intimate, hand-crafted attention to detail for which the Arkham games are known. Most Wanted Side Missions – Players can fully immerse themselves in the chaos that is erupting in the streets of Gotham. Encounters with high-profile criminal masterminds are guaranteed while also offering gamers the opportunity to focus on and takedown individual villains or pursue the core narrative path. New Combat and Gadget Features – Gamers have at their disposal more combat moves and high-tech gadgetry than ever before. The new ‘gadgets while gliding’ ability allows Batman to deploy gadgets such as batarangs, the grapnel gun or the line launcher mid-glide while Batman’s utility belt is once again upgraded to include all new gadgets that expand his range of forensic investigation, stealth incursion and combat skills.

												The game is playable. I see no problems with it but people are still angry over it's release and they have good reason to be. The company should have listened to their quality assurance testers. They knew the mess it was for months and nothing was done about it. I'm sad, because it really is a good game that most won't try out because of the scandalous greed that is WB. As of this review, the game is playable. It's up to you whether or not you boycott Arkham Knight.			"

												I can not begin to describe what an abysmal port this game was to PC. In its current state I simply can not recommend it to anyone and here is why:My system specsAMD-FX 9590 4.70 GHz 8 core processor16 GB Ram2 Nvidia 760 GTX video cardsMy computer should be eating the current Arkham Night recommended system requirements for breakfast yet I get CTD, hitching, LOWER FPS in SLI than I do in single card....this game is just a mess. In 2015 a game running on the 2004 Unreal Engine with these kinds of faults is absolutely unacceptable. DO NOT buy this game until Rocksteady Studios pushes a ptach to fix it and notable reviewers give it a once over.UPDATE: 02 September 2015 - Game still has not had a major patch pushed to fix all the launch issues. 2 months and change after launch they have had to oush a patch and we got a very minor updated to stability.Do yourself and everyone a favor. DO NOT purchase this game, and kick Rocksteady right in the balls aka wallet. They are not deserving of the profit they would make. Tons of DLC being developed and distributed on consoles instead of focusing on fixing the PC issues.UPDATE: 05 October 2015 - Upgraded video card to a 980Ti (not just for AK). A major patch was pushed last month which addressed some more commonly complained about issues like higher graphics settings, Antisotropic filtering levels, uncapping the FPS etc. The game runs better but still nowhere near where it should. SLI is still unsupported, and I even with my beast of a setup still get CTD every now and again. Hopefully by the end of the month Rocksteady will have all the major bugs ironed out. Once the game is finally patched to completion pick it up on a Game Key site. Don't buy it for $59.99			"

Posted: September 16, 2015
												---------------------------------------------SPOİLERS----------------------------------------------This game has very bad sides. 1.BATMOBILE: Way too much Batmobile  especially ACE Chemicals mission. You have to use your friendly Batmobile to do EVERYTHING.2.DRONE TANKS: I wish we could destroy those drones without using the Batmobile.(I know we can do it with upgraded Disruptor but thats not what I meant, I mean with a EMP bomb or something)3.AK IDENTITY: Everyone knew that the Arkham Knight IS Jason Todd from the day that Arkham Knight  character announced.He should be Eli Strange, Prometheus or Anarky. Especially Eli Strange(come to finish his father job and get revenge from Batman), that would be AMAZING. And they could make an ""Under The Red Hood"" kinda DLC now that the Jason is not AK(as in my wish).  4.AK HQ: Based on AK name, I was expecting an secret base on Arkham Island or Arkham City but Arkham Knight HQ is an abandoned shopping mall. seriously what the hell?! 5.PLAYABLE CHARACTER LAZINESS: They gave Azrael the same moves as Batman and they got a reason because ""Azrael has watched and learned Batman's technique to become his succesor"" no because they are lazy as hell.They removed moves and gadgets from every character . Especially gadgets, Catwoman has no Thief Vision.6.AR CHALLANGES: Those stupid AR Challanges are NOT challange maps. 7.COMBAT EXPERTS: I was expecting more from Combat Experts. They have only one unique attack where they jump onto a wall or nearby ally and then leap to strike batman. expect from that they are Ninjalike enemies. I couldn't see and Hand-to-Hand attack like we see in the ACE Chemicals Infiltration Trailer.8. MILITIA EQUIPMENT: Guys with Jammer Pack was really making game harder but we get to see them one or two times maybe., and the guys with Thermal Imaging Headsets is no longer here. Seriously, two of Batman's strongest tactics is hiding at the vantage points and escape using smoke, how AK never tought that?9.LEVEL DESINGS: I want to have two ways of getting into certain places. One way is batmobile way, the  Second one is traditional. Not only it gives me a choice but also makes me wanna replay the game.10.SIDE MISSIONS:  Hush side mission was very dissapointing. Back at AC Hush side mission was  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Firefly side mission was bad too, just 3 batmobile chases. Back at AO Firefly boss was unique and very brilliant. 11.CHARACTER DESINGS:Some character desings were same as Origins (black mask, deathstroke, firefly(nearly)). 12. CHALLANGE MAPS: .They are releasing challange maps as DLC's that's annoying. 13.DLC: DLC's (expect Batgirl) like 10 minute challange map campaings and they didn't  take care of their stories. 14.RIDDLER : They were ""succint"" back at AC there was 440 piece and most of them was very easy.I think they sould made race tracks like conundrum in AC. I mean like when you solve 40 of them you unlock first race track, when you solve 80 of them you unlock second race track, that would be harder. After doing race tracks you just don't want  to collect all of riddler throphies for a stupid robot battle. 15.COMBAT: Combat has no such big changes. I like ""pick up enemy, critical beatdown, batclaw super stun, charged super stun, aerial jugle"" moves but like I said there was no such big changes. 16.TAKEDOWNS: Fear takedown was good but made game easier. Environmental takedowns was pretty good.17.EVIDENCE SCANNER:  Evidence scanner that when we were using to save Barbara Gordon was same as the AO's evidence scanner. (I am NOT talking about the one we  used at ""perfect crime"" that is deep tissue scanner) And we get to use it only once. 18.GADGETS: I think the REC Gun and Freeza Grenades lost their usage. explosive gel's Quick-Fire usage is the as Origin's detanator. A predator gadget known as Sonic Batarang is not here anymore! We only use Line Launcher for 2 or 3 times. Remoto Hacking Device and Disruptor was pretty good.19.BOSS FIGHTS: There was no Boss Fights just Batmobile tank battles. I waited for an legendary boss fight that we will do with Deathstroke and AK. They were just tank battles. 20.DIALOGUES AND ENDİNG: Back at AC we were hearing pretty good and funny dialogues. Game has lost this feature. Yes we are hearing dialogues in AK but they are NOT good.atmosphere is not a AC or AA. I love the parts that Joker talking with Batman(in Bat's brain). This really is the only pretty good thing that shows us the game's psycholocigal side. I finished all of the Arkham Games and I was  a fan of Batman comics before all 4 games release I can certainly say this game is the  worst portrait of Batman in last 40 years. I mean look at the ending. The man who knows 127 martial arts, crime fighter for 10 years, capable of take out 5 gunned man less than 5 seconds, worlds greatest detective, has genius level intelligence go surrender without a plan. Gordon is capable police officer. come on! He is only one gunned. No bombs, no guards, no tanks. He isn't even holds that gun at hand or point that gun to no-one's head. just get behind him Gordon and strike. They all act like (even Batman himself) they want Batman  unmasked and gassed.21. STORY HOLES:  From the very first trailer of Arkham Knight thought was all of Batman's villians  get together  to destroy Batman once and for all. But they all do different things. Two-Face has attacked the banks . Harley tried to save her ''Joker''s. We only saw Penguin suplying guns to The Arkham Knight. Others didn't helped Scarecrow or each other. Another thought is Scarecow don't want to kill Batman, he wants to destroy his soul. Then why did he send 45-60 tanks to Batman at some points of the Game  . At the GCPD assault 62 tanks came to destroy us(they were really wanted to kill Batman. If Scarecrow  don't want to kill then shouldn't be Scarecrow Game Over Scenes. They are like ''I didn't want to dead but oh well, I think I will say something). If that tanks weren't just drones, If they were manned tanks, As everyone knew, Batman couldn't do anything. And there is time problems.  Scarecrow could attack GCPD when Batman at ACE Chemicals or at the Panessa Studios taking on Harley. When Batman busy I mean.  But no he waited Batman to come GCPD.  And we come the biggest hole. Scarecrow has captured Batman with using Robin and Gordon but why didn't he used Barbara to capture Batman I mean the same way he did to Robin and Jim. You know before Cloudburst exploded. He can just capture Batman and reveal his name then exlode cloudburst. this would happen before jason's arrival so Jason could kill Batman(instead of saving him) I know that Scarecrow wants to destroy Batman's soul. He can do it by killing Barbara in front of Batman's eyes  and trapping Gotham under  fear .Batman couldn't do anything, but watching his friends and Gotham die. This would destroy Batman. And no one could save Batman because his friends can't even save themselves  Nightwing kidnapped by Penguin, Barbara Robin and Gordon kidnapped by Scarecrow, Jason kidnapped and Tortured by Joker, Catwoman captured by Two-Face and Riddler, even Batman himself got kidnapped by Harley. in Arkham Series they made Bat-Family (expect Batman) weak especially Nightwing.Even Harley was able to defeat Nightwing. This is very annoying.  Another thing is why didn't AK place cobra tanks at main gates of ACE Chemicals. Batman couldn't even enter the facility( Oh well, maybe Batman could enter the facility but without his Batmobile he couldn't do anything. With all this things, I can say story is NOT well-considered.			"

												If you have the hardware, just go for it. Best Arkham game so far. I have a relatively high-end PC and there has been almost zero problems with the port. The only problem was the initial 30fps cap that was removed.Hardware: i7 5930K, 32GB DDR4, nVidia GTX 980Ti, all maxed out, 1200p, 70-90fps. Half the game was played with a GTX 970 with same performance with antialising and nVidia extra effects removed.			"

												Simple. If you have a PS4, get that version.Running:i7 3770k (stock speeds)8GB RAMGTX 970 4GBGame installed on an SSD with a fresh install of Windows 7 Premium 64bit, latest drivers for all major components. Stutters a lot. Not as bad as some but certainly distracting and sometimes causes me to crash while driving in the Batmobile. Missing effects, blah, blah everyone knows the score by now. Just wanted to support the down-vote here.I'm tired of shoddy ports to the PC recently. If they actually manage or bother to fix this game it'll be too late. There is a good game in here and that's why I've persevered so far. I have a feeling I'll have completed the game at a sub-par quality by the time it gets sorted.I've put in a lot of time and money into my PC. I'm starting to wonder if it's been a total waste, if this is a taste of things to come from developers and how they value the PC community.Also, if this is ""how it's meant to be played,"" NVIDIA, I'd hate to see it on anything else. Same went for Watch_Dogs.			"

												I finished the game, but I have to be honest. It  was JUST playable. Extremely muddy textures when up close to anything. Was very choppy.I just want to say that this should be a lesson for companies who think they can just pump out one garbage port after another. It is going to take a lot of effort to win people back after this one. My game crashed countless times and was far from smooth.I think it is pathetic and shamefull that a company does not make a port with at the very least the basic options required to play the game.Why on earth should I edit the config in order to chance the mouse sensitivity? How ignorant does a developer have to be not to put something so basic into an option instead of having people make mods and edit config files?A fps cap on a pc game? Seriously guys?Lack of advanced options that have always been around.Getting really tired of the lazy ports, just more cash grab. On top of that you really expect people to buy basically the cost of another game for a season pass (which I found interesting it is for 6 months....?)I am sure that the parent company is who rushed this garbage out and it is sad because it was deffinately one of the best in the series for me (ok besides the first one).Will I reccomend it to someone? Well if you plan on really enjoying the game and completing everything right to the end...then no...I can not recommend this to anyone based on the poor performance and lack of options that should have been included right from the start.I am upset that I had no patience to wait for the patches to come out and I may stop buying games within the first year to avoid this crap and get things on sale. Deffinately not value for my money sorry to say.I hope they learn from this it is getting out of control with the day 1, 2, 3...20 patches and the ""hey give me 100 more bucks for content that should just be included."" On top of that the Harley pack....complete joke, no effort at all. "

												i7 4770k, 290x, 8gig ram for reference. No real issues running any other major AAA titles released this year.I'm roughly 40% completion of the game, 21 hours of play. I just can't justify putting anymore time into this game until the performance issues are truly fixed. Until then, I can comfortably say this is one of the absolute worst PC ports I've ever played, and can in no way recommend anybody pay any amount of money for this game on PC.Before the most recent patch on the 28th of October, I was able to run the game on medium settings around 30fps. Indoors I would rarely have framerate issues, but outside in the city it was miserable with lock ups, freezes and dropping to 5-10fps for 10s at a time, most prominently while driving the Batmobile.After the patch, I get 40-60 in the city but the stuttering happens much more often. The game no longer completely locks up on me, but fluctuations from ~50fps to ~20 make the game seem even worse. The Batmobile is completely useless, it's like watching a movie from the 1920s. TL;DR: DO NOT BUY. DO NOT SUPPORT THE SALE OF THIS GAME ON PC. IF YOU BUY THIS GAME, GOOD CHANCE IT WILL RUN LIKE♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Arkham knight is such an amazing game. When i started playing and the beginning part came i felt hyped. This game gives you countless numbers of missions to do so you wont be bored after completing the story. (Not the true ending) I personally love the batmobile and after getting the hang of driving it, It's extremely amusing. Pros:- Amazing graphics(even with bad gpus in my opinion)- You actually feel like batman- Enhanced combat and predator encounters. - Truly, an amazing story.- The Batmobile. Enuf sed- A great deal of sidemissions- Dual Play between characters isfantastic.- Riddler races were very fun but was a struggle.- _____ was in it, which i would've missed if he hadn't.Cons:- No real boss fights (ex. BAO's deathstroke)- Deathstroke was over exaggerated- Arkham knight was interesting but sadly predictable.- Some bugs, but not a problem for me.- An extreme amount of having to overuse the batmobile, but who am I to complain, I love it.- The races were hard, but after a ton of tries and attempts to punch a wall you'd get better.Well this is my review of Arkham Knight and the pros and cons.

												I've never had the huge problems other people did with the game because I bought a high powered rig last year (apart from the textures on my GTX 780Ti being such poor quality I couldn't even read them - making solving the riddles largely impossible).However, despite the game knowing I have the Season Pass, I skill haven't got the various Arkham Stories.The game directs my to the Steam website to purchase them (so they exist), and then Steam explicitly tells me NOT to buy them if I have the Season Pass.It's just another example of the poor quality of overall testing in the PC version.And I say that as a fan that has ALL the other Arkham games on Steam.

They just added the DLC and let it go not giving a damn look at the steam forums look at there last statement it is disgusting on how a company doesn't give a damn about the PC version.			"

												Pros- good story as usual- usual good combat- Mark Hamill brilliant once again as JokerCons- too much required use of the BatmobileI waited until recently to purchase the game because of all the reported graphic issues with this port.  I can say with my average rig (i7 920 2.5 GHz, EVGA nVidia 760, 8 GB RAM, old SATA II 1TB HD), I've been running the game with medium settings at 1920x1080 resolution and have yet to encuounter any problems. Worth a purchase for any Batman fans.			"

												I Can't Arkham White Knight This One.I have benchmarked this game on three different graphics cards and both consoles for more than 30 hours.  I've recorded and published at least 5-6 hours of video.  This game does not run well, period.A lot of people will say that it ""plays fine for them"", but then a lot of people are happy with 30fps.  Heck, a lot of people are happy with 30fps and Vsync off, meaning they are happy to play with screen tearing and a low, unstable frame rate.  I am not one of those people.  I didn't stray from console gaming to play games that perform poorly.  And this game performs poorly.Fact:  The PC port lacks graphical features the PS4 has.Fact:  The game shipped with a 30fps cap.People are claiming they can get the game to run at ""medium"" settings.  Folks, the game doesn't have ""medium"" settings.  It has ""low"" and ""normal"" for textures.  No ""high"".  No ""ultra"".  No ""very high"".  There is no ""medium settings"" preset for them to choose, and only three of the options settings even offers a ""medium"".  The others only have TWO choices, each.Missing settings:Ambient OcclusionChoise of AntiAliasingAnisotropic FilteringDepth of FieldMotion BlurFrame Rate selectionThose are things that are completely missing.  What's left is a couple of ""on/off"" toggles and two or three choices that feature a ""high, medium, and low"".People who claim to play the game on ""medium"" are just making up the definition of what ""medium"" means.I tell you this to save you the frustration of learning the hard way.The game has more features, and in SOME ways, looks better on PS4, but the PS4 version isn't that great, either.  Overall, it feels a little muddy, the motion blur on PS4 is worse, and the frame rate seems even lower over there.  So don't believe the whole ""the PS4 version is so great"" spiel.  The people who are saying that are basing it on the fact that the PS4 version does have some better looking textures and more of the promised Nvidia GameWorks effects.  (which sounds weird, I know)The performance of this game is distractingly bad, but it is not unplayable.  Heck, there were a couple moments where I treated it like a console game and almost had fun, despite its broken feeling.  This game is not terribly brilliant, right now, on any platform; and I say that as someone who has spent a good deal of time testing it on all three.			"

												The primary issue is, obviously, the terrible optimization. Even after the patches, the game was unplayable on my system and required a 270 Euros upgrade.The other issues come from a strictly game design standpoint. There is too much reliance on the Batmobile. Over half of the game is wasted on either shooting tank drones or solving puzzles with the Batmobile. Free-Flow and Predator not only have taken a backseat, they also suffer on their own. Free flow breaks combos far more often than in City (though considerably less than in Origins) and the sheer variety of enemy types can turn combat into a cluster♥♥♥♥. Predator mode fares somewhat better, but the uninspired level design undercuts the flow of constant movement that made Predator work in previous installments.If the draw for you is the fully-featured Gotham City, you'll be disappointed at how little there is to do in it. Outside of ""liberating"" the various areas (via taking down enemy outposts), it's a huge sandbox filled with criminals and empty boxes. As for the story, it's heavily derivative of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, the twists are woefully predictable and the characters are unsympathetic and internally inconsistent with the rest of the series.If you enjoyed the previous games, you may want to have a look at this one eventually (during a sale, the Season Pass is a must as it offers the only classic Batman bits in this product), but otherwise steer clear.5/10 would trade my driving license for a bat-bong.

												Ill start off by saying that this game could have been a masterpiece. Actually it probably is if your playing it on xbox or ps4. The main problem here is that the game runs like complete garbage. I waited to buy it until after the rerelease and as far as i can tell it hasn't gotten much better in comparison to previous reviews. FPS during cut scenes crash below 10 every time. During actual gameplay im lucky if i can get above 20. I am running a GTX 780 and I can barely play on low. I tried multiple fixes but none work, then i came accross an article online saying the devs recommend anyone running windows 10 (which in my case I am) have at least 12 gb of ram, I only have 8. This right here is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. I am able to run any other game on at least high with no problems what so ever. Even the Witcher 3. I have never heard of any game with that requirement. In conclusion the gameplay itself is great but due to the framerate problems I am having I wouldnt recommend this game at all. Im going to say either wait until things are fixed or just dont buy it at all.			"

												Awful PC port, with not only a poor implementation but also a sloppy interface that shows a lack of interest for the PC version alltogether:- Lack of a lot of options in the menus, only generic ones being available, which is unacceptable for a 2015 PC game;- Mouse Sensitivity is set to 30 (!!!) by default and there is NO OPTION to alter it in any of the game menus;- Motion Blur is HORRIBLE and there is no option to disable it in any of the game menus; additionally, if you do what any PC gamer does and go to the .ini files to force disable it, the game crashes, so no way to get rid of a very bad looking and poorly implemented effect;- There are VERY frequest FPS drops, which can easily be seen in the benchmark too even when you get a high average framerate; these break immersion continuously and make it impossible to enjoy the game experience;- Problems with resolution settings, when first booting the game it was set to a low resolution; changing it increased the size of the game inside a window which remained the same size! (like what the hell man?!? I could only see the top left quarter of the image now); this required a restart of the game to work.Sadly, due to issues like the above, you can't really enjoy and review the actual game, so I hope they have some serious patching skills, otherwise this game will be an undeserved skidmark on what was so far a very cool series.

												I've wanted so much to actually enjoy Rocksteady's sendoff to the Arkham series, but there isn't much love waiting for anyone that is purchasing this.  You might hear the odd exceptions where people have performance that is just nominal, but I get massive RAM usage and massive VRAM usage while playing a game with a framerate cap of 30fps by default.  That isn't just absurd, that's absolutely unacceptable.  This comes after finding out the team assigned to port this game were given 8 weeks total.  8 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weeks isn't time to do anything of this scope, and it is truly telling of just how little care or concern is given to consumers that just happen to game on a PC.  So while this game might be the true end of a series that has had hype and acclaim since its 2009 debut, it isn't something I'd recommend at this point.It is an honest shame, but our money means just as much as someone on PS4 or Xbone, so I don't really understand why it is we should get a subpar product for the same price.Edit:  It seems that our dollar means just as much as any other dollar, seeing as how WB has revoked sales of the game until it is up to spec.  Unprecedented given the size and marketing behind this particular production, but still a fantastic sign that everyone's displeasure is being recognized.			"

												Batman: Arkham Knight's gameplay is wonderful, and the combat and moves list has been greatly improved.  Batman's moves list is filled with so many great new additions which include new variations of old moves and animations. In addition, the Batmobile is nothing short of brilliance.  Despite these good marks, Arkham Knight is filled with technical issues that will most likely cause you to stop playing, and make you wait for the ""upcoming"" patch. As others have echoed, the Batmobile is incredibly fun to use.  The controls are slick, and nearly perfect.  You feel this sense of empowerment when you jump into the batmobile.  And like any other sandbox type of games, you may spend a considerable amount of time riding in the batmobile to travel from one place to another.  Your mileage may vary. From another perspective, this may become another Gearbox/SEGA launch fiasco.http://www.kitguru.net/gaming/development/matthew-wilson/arkham-knight-pc-port-was-outsourced-to-a-console-studio/To summarize the article:Batman Arkham Knight was outsourced to a studio called Iron Galaxy.  This studio has been known to be the ""radio shack"" of studios that does porting to PC.  This also explains why PC reviews did not go up before launch.  They knew there were major issues with the game, yet they pushed it out in this state anyway.This is a bad sign.  If Warner Bros doesn't order Iron Galaxy to patch the game, we may never see a patch that may remedy most of the issues.  And, considering Iron Galaxy PC porting team consists of only 12 people, I don't have much hope.  Technical hiccups that you should know about:Right off the bat, Batman Arkham Knight is locked at 30fps.  You can unlock it by going into the ini file in Batman AK steam folder - BMgame -> BMengine and make the changes you want.  Make sure that you go into BMSystemSettings and change the maxframerate to match the maxframerate in BMengine file.Okay, cool, the game can now run at 60fps.  Half the time it may run at 50-60fps.  As soon as you perform a bat dive, or propel Batman up to the nearest building, the performance will dip into what I would call ""crawl"" stage.  Sometimes it will hover around 15-20fps.  Sometimes, less.  Since you are performing so many actions in this game, you will be spending most of your time going through these framerate issues. There are many texture pop-ups that take several seconds to minutes to load.  This seems to be very uncharacteristic for the Unreal Engine. There were times when the textures did not pop up until after a scene was done.  It seems to be a glaring issue that occurs throughout many parts of the game.The transition from Steam overlay to Steam is bugged.  You can take screenshots in game, and later upload them, but they do not show up on the ""Activity"" page.  In addition, my review of Arkham Knight does not show up in my review page section.  User reviews are also not showing up on the activity page.Lastly, the post-processing effect graphics setting needs to be disabled manually in the configuration file, and some effects cannot be turned off at all.  I believe that Rocksteady used these filters for art style purposes. There are really low-based textures, and heavy use of ugly filters.  If you try to disable the motion blur, distortion, and/or depth of field in the ini file, it may crash your game.  So far, disabling post-processing motion blur seems to be the only form of post-processing effect in the ini file that doesn't crash the game. You are welcome to try.  Also, there is a very limited graphics option menu.  Very limited.  If you were wondering, and needed to compare PC rigs.  My specs:i5-2500K  (4.5GHz)GTX 970 SC ACX 2.08GB of RAMBatman: Arkham Knight Game Ready drivers (old drivers were cleaned using Driver Fusion, and I followed it up with a manual clean - cleaning the registry and folders)It is a fairly decent gaming PC.  Right now, Arkham Knight just isn't in the state that it needs to be in, and fingers crossed for a big update.  I don't think a small update will help matters.Final thoughts:Again, Batman: Arkham Knight features great gameplay with the same old Rocksteady formula.  There seems to be a really good game underneath all the performance issues, limited graphics options, and forced visual effects like post-processing. I will definitely change my review to a recommended review if Iron Galaxy Studios and Warner Bros make the necessary fixes that this game needs badly.  I can't imagine a studio would want to waste a great game to technical issues that could be patched.  It is feasible, and doable.  After all, Rocksteady did work extremely hard on Arkham Knight, but it is a shame that Warner Bros outsourced the PC port job to a third-party company with very little experience and competency.Not recommended due to major performance issues in current state.Note:  Will update and/or change the review if a patch fixes major issues.

												UPDATE: I was 96% through the game and it glitched me through the floor so now I can't finish the game. Yay!Alright so I've been play this game for a few hours and saw both good and bad things in this game. Unfortunately as most of you know there is one issue that completely ruins the game and it's the horrible optimization. But I'll get to that later. First let's talk about the good:-The combat feels great especially with fear takedowns to take out multiple enemies like a badass-Gotham City is massive and gorgeous to look at.-The Batmobile, while can be clunky at times, is a fast way to get around Gotham-The character design looks awesome.Now onto the bad which really overshadows the good:-Optimization (I'll rant more about that later)-I feel like the Batmobile feature is a little too forced onto the player. Almost all of the Riddler challenges are focused on the Batmobile itself-I can't tell if it's just me going crazy or if they made the gliding horribly slow. I guess in order to make the player use the Batmobile more they made gliding more sluggish. It might just be the dropping framerate.-30 FPS cap. That is a sin. But it doesn't matter since you will be dropping to 6 frames constantly.-The lack of effects options. On top of being poorly optimized the game has constant motion blur and particle effects that go nonstop. This causes the game to run worse whenever you're outside in the rain.About the optimization:Never have I seen a game so badly ported over to PC. I have a GeForce GTX 960 and at the very least I should be able to maintain a solid framerate. Even with everything set to the lowest settings, the framerate is all over the place. This is especially noticable whenever driving the Batmobile or gliding in the rain. The optimization completely ruins the game and keeps you from wanting to explore the city. You just want to get from point A to point B to hopefully get to an area where the game can run normally again. It's really sad for huge fans of the series like myself who wanted to enjoy the final game in the trilogy. Unfotunately the optimization ruins the game completely. I would recommend getting this game on console or wait until Rocksteady makes a fix. Until then stay away and save your money for something else.			"

												Sadly my issues are as many other people report. i7, Nvidia 780, 16GB RAM, and a San Disk Extreme Pro SSD. Extremely inconsistent performance with frame drops at 1080p. Unlocking the 30 FPS limiter only just makes that inconsistant performance all the more apparant.This was the first preorder I had made for quite some time, mainly due to the large discount Green Man Gaming offered prior to retail launch. I always told myself I would never preorder again due to what seems to be a growing  'ship it and then patch' mentality. I suppose I get what I deserve for not heeding my own advice, even though this is particulary extreme example of shipping a game not ready for prime time.This certainly will be the last game I preorder, at least from places that do not offer refunds (which Steam now provides).

												WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC.So I just played the game at midnight and wow....it's horrible on PC. It is full of stuttering issues, sound issues, and crashes constantly. If you are going to pick up the game, get it on PS4 or Xbox One.The game is capped at 30p, although, you can get rid of this in an INI file. HOWEVER, the framerate is still horrible in a lot of places and if you remove this cap, a lot of textures will take a very long time to load and will look downright archaic. When you get into the batmobile and move around the city, you'll be going down into the 10s when it comes to framerate. Sure, the GameWorks effects look BEAUTIFUL but the game plays like garbage.UPDATE: I've recently discovered that a lot of effects in the console versions (such as ambient occlusion) are completely missing from the PC port.UPDATE 2: Warner Bros. has come forward and said they are looking into the issue and, in the meantime, are taking the game out of sale.My rig:FX-8350GTX 970 4GB8GB of RAMPlayed at 1080p then 900p to see if maybe it was because my machine wasn't good enough. No, it's the game that isn't good enough.Sorry guys :c I wanted to play this game so bad too, but it's just frustrating..			"

When starting a new game (during the start of the coffee house section) the framerate goes from 70+ down to 4. That is with everything on max. After seeing that dip I just uninstalled it and wish that I could refund it (got it for free with my 2nd 970).			"

												Quite possibly the biggest disappointment in my lifetime (25yrs), not only was the game completely broke on release, the game has been ""re-released"" with the most shocking display of disregard for the customer.Onto the actual review of the game.Graphics = Excellent, the graphics give the game atmosphere and really give the impression of being in Gotham.Gameplay = Good, the melee combat system has been refined and makes every punch and kick have a real impact. The worst part of the game is the driving combat (really anything involving the batmobile is terrible)The best part of what make Rocksteady's game arguably was the sneaking and that seems to have been scaled back and not expanded on like the rest of the game.Overall A mediocre cash-in AAA game from Warner-Bros that clearly could have done with another 6-12 months of development.I will never buy another game from Warner Bros and will hope that Rocksteady can learn from this and never repeat it.4/10 MEDIOCRE sequel, killed in my opinion by the release meltdown			"

												I'm one of the few that was fortunate enough to be able to play through Arkham Knight originally; It wasn't always pretty: lots of crashes, but I was passionate enough about the game to beat the single player one time through before putting it on the shelf in hopes that it'd eventually get fixed. Now it runs even worse.TL;DR: Stay away from this game, Don't buy it. It runs like garbage. ♥♥♥♥ WB			"

												There are two things it does right: combat improvements and the narrative presentation. There are just so many things at your disposal when it comes to free-flow combat, and yes, odd stuff happens still, but the tight rhythmic gameplay is just better with enemy variety as well as gadgets you can use during the combat (plus, some levels have you fight along side your sidekicks and these sections are really sweet). It balances out the flow of the combat, intensity as well as strategy. As for the narrative presentation, Arkham series has always been a knock-out when it comes to fusing gameplay with cutscenes, and Arkham Knight does it best here.The problem is, the story itself is lackluster. The wholly unsatisfying ending aside, the main story fails to incorporate various characters and the world, and instead sidelines potentially very interesting villains away from the main story. Arkham Knight himself is an interesting character, yet, really, I don't think anyone who has read the comics (or like me who hasn't but knows some stuff from them) found it a revelation. Scarecrow's character seems to be a bit different, more like Hugo Strange with an obsession for fear gas. Not to mention that Riddler challenges are tied to the true ending to the game, they wasted Deathstroke on a stupid Batmobile section? And yes. Batmobile. Batmobile is made well. The control on that thing is marvelous. But there are way too many Batmobile sections. If they were varied or require methodical approach like some of on-foot sections, I wouldn't complain: except they aren't. Most of Batmobile sections are incredibly one dimensional. You attack all the drones almost exactly the same way, meaning you approach almost all Batmobile combat sections exactly the same way. Some of Batmobile puzzles are good, but seeing how most of them are associated with Riddler, you get tired of them.And that's what the game feels like: tiring. This is basically Arkham City with Batmobile. A lot of the level design is still the same (and they are still good), and that's not a bad thing seeing how Origin basically is like that and it's fun to play. But it has stupid needless stuff sprinkled throughout, plus the Batmobile. Playing all the filler stuff, I can't help but feel like I'm playing an Ubisoft open world game with better core gameplay mechanics. They even have bloody towers all over the place you have to tackle. Except I somehow found Syndicate worth getting 100%; this I just couldn't.Oh and if you don't have a PC with more RAM than 12GB, don't even bother playing it on PC. I have i7-6700HQ, GTX 1070 and 8GB RAM, and the game still stutters like crazy when moving fast through Gotham in Batmobile or flying.			"

												TL:DR I have to hand it to them, even with all the♥♥♥♥♥♥they got, they put in the work to fix it as much as possible. It actually runs now and while it is not perfect in terms of optimisation it has improved greatly.Pros:+PHOTO MODE: I love screenshots and Warner Bros games like to use this awesome mechanic now and its great. Every game should include a mode like this. Shooting incredible screenshots, showing off the details in the game is a great way to self promote your game now brb as i have hundreds to upload onto my steam account.+Fantastic Story: A great end to the Rocksteady trilogy with great characters and plot points. Batman has amazing development as the story progresses+Detailed and dense city: Arkham city was fantastic in recrating a criminal filled gotham but this game does it even better adding so much more detail+Combat: Freeflow combat is always fantastic and they improved on it even more, adding new ways to brutally break every bone in someones body but still be Batman+Stealth: Greater difficulty is added to the stealth with new enemy variants like someone who can detect and find out your position if you use Detective mode for too long, People with reflective camo who hide from detective mode. Enemies start to Batman proof the area if they suspect youre doing something, setting a thermal charge to set the whole grate system on fire if they catch you down there is very tense when you have to grappel up and out of the grate before the fire gets to youCons:-Arkham Knight wasnt really a big surprise: The writing done to reveal who the arkham knight was felt a bit lazy to me and shovelled in. *Spoilers ahead*  even if you werent clued in on who all the Robins were, Jason Todd is never really mentioned too much in any of the other games but gets a huge exposition slot about how he ""died"" in this game. Anybody who has seen a film or played a game with a twist before could have guessed it and i would have much preferred if the enemy was just Red Hood and not Red Hood with a bat mask on. -Batmobile Segments: the batmobile is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, it handles well and makes you feel like the batman... but the overdone, repetitive drone segments where all you do is click MMB to explode unmanned drones every 30 minutes in the story gets very old very fast-Optimisation is not perfect: My specs are fairly high (980 4GB, 16GB RAM, i7 4790k) and i still get some frame drops in the batmobile, i am on all high setting besides Gameworks Fog and Paper Debris. from what i have heard, frame issues are due to these gameworks settings but also 16GB ram or a SSD is reccomended for this game because it still has streaming issues so beware of that before you purchase however steam refunds are always there if performance is not satisfactory for you-DLC: i loved the extra chapters where you play as other characters because they included very neat dialogue or story progression and or minute details that i enjoyed (Harley Quinn's version of detective mode with all the crazy writing on the wall including things about MR J and such) but they were very short. i have yet to play A matter of family yet though and hear that has more content than those chapters. Suits and skins are kinda cool and you can use them without having to beat the game first, with the exception of some of the more elaborate batmobile skins because they are not fit to use the battlemode like the base batmobile.Overall on sale, this game is fantastic and a great end to the trilogy if you have a mid to high system to run it. Even without a sale it is at a reduced price due to the horrible launch and the wait that we have had to endure. Thank you steam for including a recent review section so people can also see that this game has improved greatly over time and is now worth the time that people who really wanted to put into this game but were turned off due to bad performance.

												Epic closure of the Arkham trilogy and one amongst best stories I've seen (or read)  about the Dark Knight.Consider this game as Arkham City on steroids - bigger, better and more of everything with lots of interesting things to do.I purchased this game almost 2 years after it's initial release yet the optimalisation is still not on the top. It seems like some parts of the game were left untouched and locked to 30FPS - other way I cannot explain it as the game runs smoothly on 60FPS with lots of effects and NPCs on screen yet I enter a small room with 3 dead bodies and the game drops instatly to 30FPS.The game itself is a brilliant ending for this franchise and I take my hat off to Rocksteady. Well done guys, well done!			"

Posted: October 6, 2016
												I have been playing computer games since 197X.  It's safe to say, I am not easily impressed anymore. It takes a lot to get me excited about, well, anything really.Furthermore, what I learned well over a decade ago is NEVER. BUY. PRESALE. EVER.And as most of you are probably aware by now, the PC port of Batman: Arkham Knight is probably the ultimate current example of why you NEVER. BUY. PRESALE.  EVER.ALWAYS wait for reviews.Fortunately if you're like me, kept it on your Wishlist, checked back on the reviews from time to time, and you waited until all the bugs had been worked out before purchasing this game, then you know that Batman: Arkham Knight is also the ultimate current example of the Best Action Game Ever Made and also Why The PC Remains The Ultimate Gaming Platform. Remember, I'm OOFG (Original Old Fart Gamer) so I don't throw out words like 'Best' and 'Ultimate' easily.  But if you loved Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, then I can't see why you wouldn't pee your pants over this one.  It's amazing.  There aren't enough glowing superlatives to describe my joy playing this game on the PC.  I didn't purchase this game until September 2016, which means I waited a LONG time after the release date to give this game a chance.  Based on others' horrible early experiences, I am very glad I waited, but based on the sheer joy of playing this game the past several days, I am very glad I didn't wait forever.Have no fear, this game truly is the great extension to the Arkham City story, characters, world, and gameplay that you hoped it would be.  Just like Arkham City was a brilliant follow-up and expansion of the Arkham Asylum universe, Arkham Knight really does do the justice to Arkham City that we all waited so long for, and had our doubts about after the godawful Arkham Origins.And also have no fear about the PC port.  I just got a new Maingear rig with the Dell Curved 34"" monitor and am running a GTX 1070 at 3440x1440.  Max settings.  Smooth as butter (58 fps avg, no hitching, although I always turn v-sync OFF).  While a system with lower specs may not be able to run this smoothly, it does indicate that Rocksteady has the port running the way they originally intended.  There are some games throughout history that represent a major leap forward and slightly older machines just can't do it justice, forcing PC gamers to begrudgingly upgrade just so they can truly enjoy that historic game.  Wing Commander was one of those games (gotta get VGA gfx now).  As was Wing Commander 2 (gotta get a CD-ROM now).  The original Tomb Raider (gotta get a 3D adapter now).  Half-Life 2, etc etc etc.  And yes, dare I say, Arkham Knight might just be worth dropping some coin on upgrades.  It does really depend on how much you enjoyed Asylum and City and how much you want another game like that but bigger & better.  Origins almost turned me off forever, but man I am glad I didn't give up on the series.  I would recommend buying the Premium version.  At $49.99 it is still $10 less than most A-list titles, but you get all of the DLC side missions and they really are the best of all the side missions so you'll be glad you have them.  They also tie up some loose ends from Arkham City, such as what happened to Hush.Some people don't like the Batmobile.  I don't know what's wrong with them.  They must really be looking for something to not like.TL:DR:  F.U.  BUY THE GAME (IF YOU'VE GOT THE REC SPECS)			"

												I know WB is evil and all but come on. It's one thing to release a broken game, I get that it's not your fault the third party you guys put in charge of the PC port screwed up. I get that you're reluctant to give those of us who bought the game day one anything special because you're already losing money on this product (WHY ARE YOU GIVING US STUFF WE ALREADY OWN?!.) But what you're doing is hurting our trust in you guys as a brand. I know I won't be preordering, or even day oneing a game of yours for a very long time. It's so unfortunate such a good game (from what I've heard and been able to play) is being overshadowed by this. Batman would be ashamed. TL;DR: It's a fantastic game, but WB hates us and just wants our monies.			"

												What a great looking game!!!Is what i would have said back in 2010.... Today? Not so much. Better be fun to play, wll change this review if the gameplay satisfies me. But this is NOT a ""next gen"" game, altho it really hurts me to even type that term.And about the issues with AMD, nothing wrong here, i didn't unlock the 30 FPS cap yet, but im running everything on full using a single R9 280X 3GB and the game is 100% locked at 30 FPS....

												Rocksteady is dead to me! It's sad that the final act in the Arkham games had to be such a broken mess, I had to force myself to play because I didn't want to get spoiled, but the port is still broken....and let's not mention the ""compesation"" that Rocksteady is providing....I mean, are you serious? Anyone who bought the game most likely already owns the previous ones so this is just a huge slap in our face. Goodby Rocksteady, I hope you next game will be a failure on all levels, and I hope you will all go bankrupt you greedy f*ks!			"

												Tried it with a GTX 770 and 16GB of RAM in January. All NVidia Fun Stuff turned off, settings at absolute lowest to start with. Stuttered on the opening cutscene and stuttered whenever I glided as Batman with zero enemies on the screen. Refunded. This is either the most demanding game in my Steam library by two or three times over or something is wrong.			"

												Minimum specs 660. Recommended specs 760. Actually have a 960. Game still runs like♥♥♥♥♥I originally ran The Witcher 3 with a 560ti (under minimum spec) and it still ran better on normal than this runs on low. A real shame too because it seems like there's a really great game hiding amongst all this mess. But you don't review a AAA full release like a ♥♥♥♥ing Beta tester, you review it as finished product you paid real money for and this isn't even close to being finished.3/10 can not play.			"

												Thought I was one of the lucky ones to have Arkham Knight running alright on my PC. Then everything changed (when the fire nation attacked) with this new re-release. When it was taken off of Steam at first I was like ""alright, I don't have a lot of problems with it so I won't return it. I'll play it and wait it out since I got the Season Pass as well"". Wish I had returned it now, the bloody game crashes when it launches and now the 5 MONTHS wait I did for the DLCs was completely in vain. Disappointed does not begin to cover my feelings towards the game, Rocksteady and WB Games at all.			"

												Arkham knight is my second favorite entry in the arkham series, just behind city, it features the epic conclusion to rocksteady's trilogy and some truly incredible story moments. The batmobile is an awesome vehicle, but it is overused like any great mechanic, the stealth for the batmobile in particular is what stands out as frustrating, but every other mechanic is perfected in this final installment. The fluidity of the combat, and the swiftness of the stealth. Batman has also never looked better, at launch the port was very incomplete, but now it runs quite well. Hopefully companies learn to put more effort in their pc ports, but only time will tell. At 30$ this game is a steal and I highly recommend it. TL; DRPros:+all of the gameplay+stellar voice acting+plethora of easter eggs for diehard fans+really detailed and beautiful world+updated graphics engine+improved port greatly since launch+replay value w/ side missions, riddler trophies, more challenges etc.Cons:-Overused batmobile at end of the story-batmobile stealth-lack of boss fights-occasional glitches Overall this is probably my favorite game of last year and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous entries in the arkham franchise especially if you want to see the conclusion of what happens after arkham city. Highly Recommended.9/10			"

												Right now the game is not worth your money i got a pretty good pc Intel i7 4790k 4ghz cpu and 16 ram and GTX 970 4 gb ram. I uncapped the game from the 30 fps lockdown to 120 fps. i got a soild 80 fps when standing still. If i move around and especielly to a new area the frames goes up and down. Using the GameWorks smoke effects takes my frame down to around 30-40 (It depends where i am at if i am outside 30 fps and inside around 40-50 fps) BUT THE STUTTER IS THE WORST THING EVER.! i said to my friend don't worry Rocksteady has almost everytime a flawless launch, but not here. Lucky i got this game for free because of my graphic card but don't buy this game yet Keep looking on the internet about this game when the patch comes out to be sure that this port here is fine again. SHAME ON YOU Rocksteady for screwing this game up so much!			"

Posted: March 9, 2016
												In this review, I am going to avoid the hyperbole that seems to run rampant with many of the other reviews but I should make it clear that this review is for the game now that it has been largely patched up. When it was first launched, Arkham Knight was a hot mess with severe performance problems pretty much across the board. The problems were so bad that the game was pulled from steam for quite a long time. I suspect that a great many of the particularly bad reviews were written during this time so they should perhaps be looked at with some scrutiny nowadays.  As it stands right now, Arkham Knight runs very well on my system (AMD 8350 Black edition, EVGA GTX 970 SSC, and 8Gb of RAM, 1920x1080) with a very smooth framerate and good overall stability (have yet to experience a crash). There are times where the framerate drops a little bit but nothing that meaningfully impacts gameplay in any significant way. It is worth noting that my experiece with this title at launch was very different, I had a much smaller monitor back then and got significantly lower performance. Whatever patches they have applied since then have improved things greatly and pretty much fixed the game entirely.  Moving away from performance, lets talk about the gameplay. Arkham Knight is probably the most refined Arkham title in the series. The fighting feels smooth and with the subtle rhythm elements that were (sadly) not really present in Arkham Origins. There are some new gadgets that mix things up as well as new enemy types. It certainly feels like a Arkham game usually does but enough has been refined that it does not feel worn out or boring.  The Batmobile is a major addition and it does tend to get more time than it really should (especially the Riddler puzzles that involve it). You will find that you spend a lot more time in the drivers seat fighting tanks and driving on absurd Riddler race tracks than you really will want to. As far as the car itself goes. I like the design, it has a very Tumbler'esque vibe to it while still fitting the more comic book style Arkham setting.  Overall, while the car is cool, there is entirely too much of it in the game.  The Graphics are a pretty big improvement over other Arkham titles. When you crank up the settings, it looks very striking with excellent lighting effects and detailed textures. It still has that somewhat muddy look that other Arkham games have but it does look very nice and holds up well to today's graphic standards.   On the subject of graphics, one welcome change is the inclusion of more realistic body types for NPC's and even Batman himself (with some suits). The older Arkham games seemed to only have one body type for male characters where they looked huge, like they were taking horse steriods. This one tones that down significantly and is much better for it.  Sound has always been one of the strengths of the series and this one is no different. Voice acting is rock solid with a fantastic cast and good dialogue overall. Some of the sound effects have become a bit too familier but it is not so bad as to be game breaking at this point.  The story is probably the weaker aspect of this title. It has some really good elements but it stumbles a lot. You will find that the main villains are not terribly interesting and the only thing really pushng you forward is the dynamic going on between Batman and his ""inner voice"" (can't say much more without potentially spoiling things). It is not a terrible story and it is not really bad enough to hurt the experience a whole heck of a lot but it does suffer from trying to fit too many differnet elements together somewhat awkwardly.   One welcome change is the general absense of Harley Quinn. I know she is a fan favorite but she really got played out by the time Arkham City was released. It is good to see that they moved away from her in this title as she would not have fit very well in the main plot.  Overall, Arkham Knight is a pretty solid entry in the series and a good refinement of the existing formula. It had a rough launch and will still suffer from the reputation it got during that time but as a whole, it is a good game that now runs and works much better than the sadly abandoned Arkham Origins.

												(Review written 9/29/2015)It's been over 3 months since launch, I have the season pass and all I have to show for it is a skin, and we have no estimated release date on a fixed version.  To top it all off, I'm stuck on a roof in new game plus due to a logic error in the design and no one seems to be addressing that issue (Google ""Arkham Knight stuck on roof Founder's Island""; I'm not alone).The good: I beat the game and 100%'ed it, then started NG+ and would have beaten that were it not for the game-ending bug.  The story was good and they added new gameplay mechanics to stop us from falling into auto-pilot from previous installments.  For as much hate as they got, I really liked the ""tank"" sequences (except for one... ""boss fight"" that was ruined by the tank experience).  The team-ups with various Bat-family allies was pretty cool and there were a lot of really neat moments alluding to (or recreating) classic moments in Batman lore.  I genuinely enjoyed it.The bad: The game's broken.  I have a GTX980 and 24GB ram and blah blah blah who cares.  It's a bumpin' system over here, you get the picture.  The framerate was wanting even considering these factors, and it plummetted during somewhat common occurrences such as powersliding the Batmobile.  When I was playing it, there was a weird bug where the lowest resolution textures would load.  They tried to fix this in late August--you know, two months after launch--but this patch, while a good first step, introduced some other issues.  I have this weird one where some building textures fail to render at all and appear as this weird, out-of-place, bright, confetti pattern.  I joked to my girlfriend that maybe this was some kind of surprise Crazy Quilt DLC, but I was stuck on a roof, so I couldn't investigate.There are no challenge maps.  Sure, there  are AR challenges, but you don't have the choice of characters you did in Arkham City (or even Arkham Origins) and there aren't nearly enough.  This severely limits the game's value.  There is no DLC for the PC version currently, meaning if you paid for the season pass (like I did), you paid $40 (or in my case, $30 -- thanks, Steam sales!) for a Batman Beyond skin or something.They said that they'd fix the game in the coming weeks.  Well, it's 3 months later and we have nothing.  The last status update was 26 days ago.  Even if they release a miracle patch that fixes everything, is this the kind of developer/publisher you want to support?  Avoid.			"

												You must have the Best CPU in the market and SLI TitanX's to run this game smoothly I guess. I was very optimistic that Rocksteady can deliver a great PC game with their last Batman Game, but unfortunately they truly don't care about the PC platform.Gameplay is pretty much the same as Origins, just the added batmobile that drops a lot of frames when driving.I'll probably wait a week for a performance patch, if they can't deliver then a refund is justified. They should have optimized the game before release, not after.If you are on the fence about this game, DO NOT BUY this if you have less than i7 4790k and GTX 980 and want a 60FPS experience. If you are contented with a stuttery 23-30FPS on their recommended system specification with FPS unlocked to 60, then I guess you will enjoy the game. (FPS is locked @ 30FPS by default)My Rig:FX 8350 4GhzGTX TitanXSamsung SSD 256 840 Pro12GB Ram-I can run most optimized games like Witcher 3, Dying Light, GTAV, etc. at 1440p at a constant 60 FPS with ultra settings (hairworks off).Batman Arkham Knight however gives me a stuttery 23-30 FPS at the lowset setting @ 1080p, with FPS unlocked to 60 in the BmSystemSettings.ini file.I think they are a contender for the worst PC release this year.And yes, PC games minimum FPS should be 60FPS at the lowest setting with a decent rig.

												First, the good. Batman looks great, darker and grittier than ever, and the new combat mechanics such as environmental takedowns and using melee weapons make you feel more like Batman than ever before. The batmobile is a great new gameplay mechanic.That's it. Now to the bad... aka the rest of the game.This is the worst optimized pc port/excuse for a ""big budget game"" i have ever played. When the PS4 gets better graphics and performance than PC and the framerate is capped at 30, you can see just how lazy a job Rocksteady did, especially by hiring Iron Galaxy Studios. Unbelievably bad performance, and even the PS4 got a patch before PC. A good majority of the game's textures are just unfinished. The only character who looks remotely polished is Batman, and even still there are no rain effects comparable to PS4. It is clearly not a question of the power of PC over PS4, but one of simple laziness on the part of the devs. It's 2015, Rocksteady, get with it.

												Having enjoyed the combat and overall gameplay of the previous games. I got this with my GPU as a free game, so I can't complain it is wasted money at all. but this game was ported so poorly, this is mostly due to WB outsourcing the PC port to a 3rd party porting team. They did a horrible job , so I don't blame Rocksteady, and I'm pretty sure they are as pissedd as most of their consumers on how WB handled this. This is a perfect example of publishers ruining good games because they want more money and to save time. As a currently learning concept artist and hoping to be part of a design team in the future, I feel as if this will push me away from my career, I don't want my teams work  to  go to waste because of some corrupt and spoiled company  wanting to get out it as fast they can and be able to haul in the cash. Overall. having seen gameplay on console and playing very little on the PC myself due to FPS issues and bugs. the game overall was pretty nice. however. I cannot give the game a good review currently, solely because of how it runs. This will change, if rocksteady ever decides to update their game and fix the problems. with a promised august date , and that now it is halfway through august, I won't get my hopes up.			"

												Even though i absolutely love this game, it saddens me to not be able to recommend it to you. I didn't have any problems with it, but there are hardly ANY graphical settings to be found here. There is also a 30 FPS CAP IN A GAME MADE IN 2015. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. The story itself is dissapointing because the Arkham Knight is easy to predict and gives you too many hints. The REAL ending requires you to get 100% completion in the game. Shame you have to dig into the .ini file to fix any graphical hiccups you may have. If you try to turn off motion blur, the game crashes at startup. Don't buy if you have an AMD graphics card. If you have the computer to beat the extremely beefy system requirements, wait to buy this until it gets patched. Shame on Iron Gaming, Rocksteady, and Nvidia. This is an example of ""If you're gonna do a job, do it right.""			"

												The worst game I played this year and I'm not even talking about the performance issues. [Played on release, some small details might be inaccurate by this point.]The Good:Joker BanterThe OK:Man-Bat exists.Batmobile gameplay *CAN* be more fun than on-foot tedium at times.The Bad:Everything elseThe story is just poorly recycled(and poorly written a lot of times) classic Batman stories cobbled together. Arkham Knight is exactly who you think he is.Have you ever jokingly wondered what a Batman game designed by modern Ubisoft would feel like? Well wonder no more, Arkham Knight is exactly that. Infact you could say this game is the Assassin's Creed 3 of Arkham titles.It even includes the CLASSIC Ubi towers you can climb to - destroy and road checkpoints to do the same. Hurray fillers.Three islands that carry the feeling of being fillers. Sidequests are unmarked, which sounds good on paper but it's an exercise in frustration - now you must go to each island and glide around like an idiot around the city at different levels(can be located in - air, top, mid, underground) in Detective Mode to find the next part of each sidemission while listening to sounds to find relevant conversation to locate said side missions.You can ease that a bit by destroying Arkham Knight's flying drones, which allows GCPD choppers to fly again and they help looking for side missions... if you're lucky and have detective mode on to tell which direction the sound is coming from and names of Island areas. Except doing certain story missions triggers the drones to come back, now you get to fly around all 3 island all over again to destroy drones.You get the same repetitive missions to do on each island. Some of them involve the Batmobile and destroying ## amount of tanks for each mission.Batmobile/Tank stealth sections are a thing. You get to quietly drive behind tanks and shoot them, then run away, it can be fun sometimes but I'm undecided on that.Remember Deathstroke from Arkham Origins? Remember the boss battle with him? Arguable the most intense bossbattle in the Arkham franchise, one of those extremely rare instances of QTEs done right. For some reason, in Knight, Deathstroke drives a tank now and that's how the boss battle with him plays out. You fight. In Tanks.Speaking of which, aside from things like the Boss battle described above which involve TANKS, they're gone. Knight has maybe 1 or 2 boss battles, one of them is Riddler. I cannot remember any others at this moment.Last but not the least, the 'true ending' - a small vague cutscene is locked behind 100% completion of the game, that includes collecting every riddler trophy.Maybe at one point this game had a soul, but it's past that point.

												It's no secret that Bamham Knight has had issues on the PC, even to the point of resulting in Warner Bros removing the game from the Steam store for a few months. Having heard that even after returning to Steam the game was still pretty buggy, I was expecting the worst, but what I got was considerably different.In terms of the port quality, they seem to have patched it up pretty nicely. My specs (a GTX 970, an i5 3570k @ 4.4 GHz, and 16 GB of RAM) were able to max the game at a pretty consistent 70-80 fps, and the only bugs I encountered were two minor graphical glitches that were fixed by reloading the checkpoint. It has some nice features that a lot of PC ports leave out, like a borderless windowed option and the ability to instantly swap between keyboard and gamepad controls instead of having to change it in the settings. The game looks pretty gorgeous graphically, though in terms of animation it seems like they haven't bothered to make new dialogue animations since Arkham Asylum and Batman is still seemingly incapable of moving any part of his body except his mouth when he speaks. Maybe I just got lucky, since a lot of people still seem to be having trouble, but it ran almost perfectly for me.Unfortunately, I can't say the same praises for the game itself. You may be expecting this to be the game that finally brings the full Gotham experience, with actual people to rescue or at least see like in other superhero games, like Spiderman 2. Unfortunately, that isn't the case, and instead Rocksteady wrote in an extremely stupid excuse for Scarecrow to plan for the city to be evacuated at the start of the game, leaving the same gallery of thugs you spent three games pummeling already. As a whole, the game would feel like ""Arkham City 2"" instead of being a dramatic leap like going from Asylum to City, if it weren't for one damning fact: at some point, Rocksteady forgot that they were making a Batman game, and decided to try their hand at making a World of Tanks spinoff. This game introduces the Batmobile, which doubles as a tank, and they must be very proud of their brilliant idea because they never stop using it. Literally almost every mission in the game finds some way to shoehorn the batmobile into it, to the point that even the Riddler now seems to care more about his passion for NASCAR-themed death traps than actual riddles. It's not so much that the Batmobile segments are bad, it's just that if I wanted to play Tankman I'd play a game about tanks, not Batman: Arkham Knight. If you thought people had to be exaggerating when they say you spend the majority of the game in a tank like I assumed, think again.In terms of the parts where you aren't stuck in a tank, it's pretty much identical to the previous 3 games except less interesting. The free-flow combat system was an interesting mechanic in 2009, but the idea has been so played out by both the Batman series and other games copying them that the novelty has faded, leaving the fights just feel dated and tedious. The predator-style stealth that the series was originally known for is almost totally absent, with most of the encounters being more of the ""jump headfirst into a large group of goons"" variety. The various side missions from Arkham City return, but none of them are all that interesting, and in their efforts to include as many villains as they could they failed miserably at making sure any of them got more than 2 or 3 minutes of screentime. Most of the side missions are just busywork, constantly poking you in the arm and daring you to waste your time. Do you really care enough to find and rescue 20-or-so firefighters for no real reward? Can you honestly be bothered to find the Riddler's god knows how many stupid trophies for the fourth time? Probably not, but you'll have to if you want to see the game's two extremely underwhelming secret endings anyways.Ultimately, where the game fails the most is the story. The Arkham Knight himself is probably the most underwhelming villain I've ever seen in a game, and even ignoring his awful surfer bro voice all he ever really does is brag about knowing everything about you and then immediately start whining and throwing an almost Riddler-level crybaby tantrum whenever you start getting the upper hand, making him seem more like a spoiled child than a villain worth putting in the title. He just isn't an interesting character at all, especially considering you probably already knew who he is before you even read this review. It feels like the only reason he was included was so that Rocksteady could have something mysterious and new to bring in the people who aren't interested in the comics enough to appreciate a game where it's obvious that Scarecrow is the real main villain. The storyline itself just isn't all that interesting, and tends to jump between plot points in pretty nonsensical ways and dropping them out of nowhere just as quickly. Bamham Knight isn't awful, but it's certainly not a game I'd recommend paying full price for. It doesn't feel like a satisfying end for what started as a surprisingly good series at all, and just left me wondering if there was something I missed at some point. But at the same time, I'm a bit glad that the series is at least over now; I'd rather see the series die average than live long enough to become mediocre.			"

												I title my Review, Batman The Longest Night in History!First off, the game is very well optimized now.played on 1440p max setting with a constant 60 fps. Now for the gameplay itself, Massive open world with lot's to do, lot's of riddler puzzles people to punch and no annoying civis you can run over, get a beasty car made to destroy an army, Lot's of fun to drive around destorying thing's and beat up people. The story is well made, tho it is kinda strange that you do everything in one night, I would recommend you pick it up if you like Open World games, Batman, great fighting/driving mechanics and a good 20-30 hours gameplay, much more if you do all the riddler trophies.I give this game a 8/10 - Well done Rocksteady on a great game.

												My Specs: GTX 960 2GB AMD FX-8350 4.0 GhzUnfortunately I cant speak for the story content of this game on account of I tried to suffer through the slideshow framerate and each of my sessions had me questioning both my gaming rig and WB as a company. It really is a shame. If this game had run like butter at any point in its existence it probably would have recieved my praise. Even after this relaunch my framerate slideshows regularly on high settings. The options menu tells me I need nearly 4gb of vram which is ridiculous. I can run witcher 3 on ultra 30 fps minimum and rock solid 60 with high settings. What bothers me most is the lack of worthwhile patches and the fact that I cant return this game because I bought an nvidia promo code. Because of this the final game in the series I cant look at Rocksteady or Arkham city the same way. This being the concluding installment ruined the rest of the series for me. This type of behavior from publishers makes me want to quit gaming. I dont think I will be buying another WB title until they redeem themselves with some fantastic ports and an apology to the PC gaming community. I dont know what else to say other than I'm appalled.Newcomers to the series don't buy this game. If you need your batman fix go play Asylum and City and stop there. Anything past that is a mediocre and broken installment.- BB			"

												I've withheld my review on Arkham Knight til it came back up on the store so it will not be considered a pre-release review. First, let me say that I pre-purchased the Arkham Knight Premium Edition back at the start of June due to the being a longtime Arkham-series fan, and had actually had my hopes up that this would be as phenominal a game as it had been advertised in previews/trailers. When the game originally launched, I could barely play it, as it was so horribly unoptimized that I was one of the 90+% of people that had to use a community-discussion workaround to make it playable. After I did get it up and running, the framerates I got weren't the best, but the game was quite playable with some moderate frame drops in overly busy areas. I completed the main storyline and a good amount (but not all) of the side content, and was satisfied with the story. However, I knew this was not the game I paid for, and sat down to wait for Rocksteady and Warner Brothers to clean up the mess they let Iron Galaxy Games make of the pc version. Over 3 months later, the September patch came out, and at that point I couldn't even launch the game due to changes they'd made in the patch. This infuriated me, even moreso due to the fact that the pc DLCs had still been held back and the console players were still enjoying their games while the pc community was still in patch limbo.Another month later, just a few days ago, another patch is promised to be released... and what did we get? No major changes except that they allowed the cumulative DLC-backlog that the original game-owners were due to finally be recieved and played. All the bugs/glitches from September were still there, and I still couldn't even start the game. I was able to figure out my particular issue and get into the game again, but the damage was done. I'll play the DLC from what I'm still owed in the season pass, but I frankly don't have the heart to even bother replaying the game again. This whole 4-month (and soon to be half a year at this rate) fiasco just reeks of incompitence and flat out apathy on the part of the developers. The pc version of the game should NEVER have been outsourced to a 3rd party to complete. The fact that Warner Brothers re-released the game in this state and offered people who purchase it all the prior Arkham games is just a flat-out slap to the face, as it literally amounts to nothing, since people will have probably already had purchased most if not all of those games.In conclusion, I cannont recommend this game as it is at this current time. It's a shame that the conclusion to the Arkham series had to turn out like this; I enjoyed many of Rocksteady's games in the past, but now I'm leery of anything they produce in the furture for pc, as I don't know if it'll get outsourced again.

The game-play itself is loaded with glitches - be ready to watch batman teleport from building to building or completely disappear from the map (It's only happened once, which is unacceptable) when engaging in combat. I anxiously waited almost 4 years for the release of the Arkham Knight, I'm devastated. This is easily the biggest let down of 2015 I say that becasue the story (I'm only 1/4 of the way so far) is beautiful in a very dark way.			"

												The opening CS made this game look promising but that delight turned to disappointment once I got into the gameplay.Anyways I'll sort this into pros and consThe Pros:1. Game seems fully playable now.2. Sound and animation is flawless during scripted cutscenes.3. No crash during my 30min+ gameplay which is a huge improvement from the constant game crashes players experinced prior.Cons:1. FPS drops occur occasionaly.2. Game is locked at 30 FPS it seems.3. Lip sync during gameplay is horribly off.My veridct:This game has a long way to go in my opinion to measure up to its previous installments and be enjoyable.I find it incredably hard to enjoy gameplay when I'm constantly able to notice the sluggish 30FPS this game is locked into. While fully playable now, the low FPS makes the overall experince second rate when compared to MGS:TPP that has flawless 60+FPS all around.Overall, if your willing to put up with 30FPS and ocassional FPS drops, go ahead and buy it. You shouldn't have to worry about it crashing anymore.If your want a high qaulity game however, I'd wait on this and buy it once everything's been patched up.			"

With a 980Ti, I'm seeing anywhere between 28-65 fps outdoors and 60-85fps indoors.  Getting into the batmobile still causes the FPS to dip, albeit not to the single digits of the June build.

												This game is awesome... on the PS4... Not so much on the PC. What I played on the PS4 verison is great, what I got on the PC verison when I first booted it up was a fatal rendering problem that seem to have deleted my entire game and I had to redownload the whole damn thing again. Oh and do not even think about checking the integrity of the game cache because that will also delete your game and you will have to redownload everything AGAIN! To say the PC performance issues really distract from this game is truly an understatement. Do not buy this game right now until Rocksteady/Iron Galaxy/WB fixes the problems.  I recommend if you bought it on Steam to just refund it. Everyone else who bought it off GMG we just have to suck it up and hope for the best.			"

												Mid 2015: Rocksteady publishes another batman after several years from the first one. The franchise remains badly optimized, heavily bugged and riddled with memory leaks, locked 30 fps caps, game crashes, preferential graphic card brand treatment, no 120/144hz support and... haha... still no mouse sensitivity settings in the game, after several releases on PC.I'm glad I purchased it at only a franction of it's price because it really isn't worth it. Rocksteady? You've earned yourself an ever doubtful customer, looking sceptically at your products.I do NOT recommend this game until it's at least somewhat patched, optimized and hopefully a little polished for PC KBM gaming.Assigning KBM shortcuts and performance options should not be considered an satisfactory PC port: there is a lot of fine tuning missing that was always overlooked in the Batman franchise.EDIT: Several months later, end of october patches: still runs badly. Despite implementing some basic improvements that should be present anyway in every single release, the game remains a failure on this platform.Max worth: 15 bucks, WITH season pass.			"

												When the game is working, it is a pure joy. The story is excellent, the combat is impeccable, and the vistas extraordinary. However, this fun is severely segmented by two issues: terrible performance and forced Batmobile tank sections.I, like most people, rate the quality of a super-hero game by how much it makes me feel like that superhero. Solving mysteries and punching baddies are important parts of the Batman formula, and the game does these excellently. However, lengthy (and frustrating) sections driving a tank fighting robots is very un-Batman like behavior. To put it into perspective, it is worst than Mass Effect 1's Maco.Secondly, the more importantly, the game crashes every hour of playing, and inbetween crashes the performance is absolutely shameful. Even on a 970, I feel fortunate when my framerate is a steady 30. I will amend this review if these issues are ever rectified.As it stands now, this company does not deserve your money. There is no excuse in 2015 for releasing a game with this poor performance, capped at 30 FPS.			"

												This game is still a mess.  While stuttering isn't as severe as the June build, the game's frame rate is very inconsistent.  With a 980Ti, I'm seeing anywhere between 28-65 fps outdoors and 60-85fps indoors.  Getting into the batmobile still causes the FPS to dip, albeit not to the single digits of the June build.  Contemporary AAA games to Arkham Knight - The Witcher 3, Metal Gear Solid V, Star Craft II: Legacy of the Void, Fallout 4, etc., are more deserving of your money.			"

When turned to low, the game looks like shiz, its really bad, ps2 bad on characters, ugly textures, terrible performance, glitchs with old man snitches, this game is a waste of my hard earned money right now. But.....I am getting a new graphics card so maybe it will be better then, right now im working with a gtx 970 strix and I bought a 980 strix waiting for delivery of it. Rocksteady...you let me down, you did the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥z people like activision do, how could you, I trusted you, me and you were buddies, pals, comrades. Now I feel like a ive just been giving sloopy seconds by someone who hasnt been tested. Please. fix these issues and then maybe our relationship can continue.So, update time, I have a gtx 980 now, and boy, haha, this is the worst, I cant even drive the batmobile anymore, I get frame drops, I get all the complaints others have made, so yeah, f you iron galaxy			"

So far my experience with the game has been fighting with it to start, when it finally does, it plays pretty good for a few minutes. Then the stutters come in and the fps drops are insane, the audio glitches and eventually the screen just goes black and my entire PC freezes.The game is literally unplayable in it's current state. After reading all the negative reviews, I thought I would be okay because I'm all Intel and Nvidia. Boy was I wrong. Intel i7-4770k, Nvidia GTX 980, 16GB 1600Mhz RAM, and I can't manage to play for longer than 30 minutes.What a shame.			"

												I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth but I am.  I got Batman Arkham Knight with the bundle ffor a Nvidia 970.  I wouldn't have bought either except that the combination made both atractive.  I live in a rural area so my computer has been downloading this game for 2 days.  I was looking forward to an evening of a new game.  Not so good.  It is choppy even in the opening credits on a brand new Nvidia GTX970 and an i7 with 16G of RAM.  I ran the in-game system test and it consistently got 60fps throughout the test.  But playing the game I am only getting 30.  So, I figured other people must have this problem.  I go online to find that everyone is having this problem.  I edited the ini to let it get 60fps, but it is still choppy.  I will go back to playing Witcher 3 and maybe come back to this in a month hoping that some patches have been made.  As it is, this isn't even a pleasurable experience to play.			"

If you were unfornute enough to buy the season pass too, you will find out you cannot access anything bar a few extra skins, terrible that even after the DLC has been released for extra story that people with season pass cannot play it!

												I don't write reviews.I did feel obliged to post this, though.I've been looking forward to Arkham Knight since it's announcement.  My computer is more than adequate.  It runs other games that are new just fine with all the pretty settings turned to ""burn my eyes with your beauty"".I pre-ordered.  I preloaded.  I waited for it to unpack at a ludicrously slow rate.I load the game up. Unplayable.   All of the cinematic introduction drama to this game was lost entirely in the ♥♥♥♥♥torm this game is in its current state.I tried the suggested tweaks found online and through Steam's guide section.The gameplay got worse.I tried to power through, but within the first 30 minutes of fussing with stuttering, and the frame rate dropping out and the game falling to zero frames, I just gave up.  I stayed up late just to give this a go.Unimpressed.  Really unimpressed.I hope this gets resolved quickly.  Rocksteady makes good games.But this is terrible.  Currently can't recommend anyone spend the money on this title until it's fixed.			"

												Played this game after it got fixed, gotta say it is amazing. The gameplay is good, but i hate the forced batmobile levels. It is like too much time is spent on playing in the batmobile. Some boss fights which can be epic 1v1 are fights with the batmobile and the enemy in a tank. Another bad side is the Riddle challenges, too many and not worth it. On the positive side we have fun and good story, many characters and options to play.I give it 8/10.			"

												It is such a shame that they boned the PC release of this game so hard, because Rocksteady is a solid developer and this is a great addition to the Arkham series.  The symptoms of the terrible port still persist, although I would say that the game was about 80% okay for me. The biggest problem I had was that, in racing around Gotham in the Batmobile, the game is forced to load tonnes of textures incredibly quickly, and when it failed to do so fast enough it would freeze and think for about 10-15 seconds before resuming again. Because a lot of the driving requires very fast reflexes, this could at times cause considerable frustration, and unfortunately this happened almost entirely one the first island, which soured my initial opinion. Other than this though, there was really only the occasional noticable bug that didn't get ironed out as the QA manpower was diverted elsewhere during the release crisis. This game was rightly made an example of, as WB's despicable release deserved no forgiveness from consumers, however it's a shame that it had to screw over what is actually a really good game by a really good developer. Now, beyond all that, let me say that this is one of the best looking games ever made. I read a debate on this topic that argued between this game and Star Wars Battlefront, and while Battlefront is all style and no substance, Arkham Knight has more than enough substance to satiate those coming from Arkham City. It again ups the ante over its predecessors and delivers the entirety of Gotham for us to play around in, and while Arkham Origins ostensibly did the same, Rocksteady actually managed to fill the space with character. The sheer amount of time that must have been spent on the art of this game is absolutely mind-boggling. Almost every inch of the city feels specifically crafted rather than copy-pasted, and on top that there're dozens of unique indoor locations to boot. The NVIDIA enhancements are pretty stunning too – the way the rain plumes off of your cape as you leap into flight never gets old - although most of them will test your hardware.In regards to gameplay, it’s much the same as the previous games, with a few new gadgets here and there. I'd heard a lot of complaints about the amount of Batmobile in the game, and I personally can't really see where the negativity has come from. The Batmobile combat isn't the most elegant, but neither is the hand-to-hand combat. Although I quite enjoyed travelling around in it, it can also be abandoned for the majority of the game, and travelling on your own is a viable alternative when you level your skills up enough. In short, I didn't find it to be an unwelcome addition to the game.This is the fourth Arkham game though, and there are signs of the franchise tiring. The Riddler’s riddles felt lazier and many literally spelled out the answer in the riddle itself, many of the villains make their third or fourth appearances and really started to feel recycled, and the combat system seemed (at least at the beginning) even more self-guiding than before. Some of the tasks also seemed more like busy work than before, but that might be a related to the sheer amount of them they've used to fit the size of the city, as well as my own personal weariness of the 'open-world formula'.  In saying that, the story is genuinely intriguing and I can't seem to put the game down. I played 21 hours in the first 2 days at a time where I was getting burnt out really quickly with other games, and I’d often find myself saying ‘one more mission’ until it was 3 in the morning. TL;DR - This is a great sequel to Arkham City, and exposes the fact that, while they own the franchise, in developing Arkham Origins WB didn’t actually understand what made an Arkham game so good. AK continues to keep the core gameplay intact whilst expanding the scope of the game, however, I can't see them being able to expand any further from here on. I can’t see them creating a bigger game world, or doing much more with the established gameplay, or using the same characters again without it all seeming tired. I haven’t finished this yet, and perhaps the plot gives it away, but I hope they don’t keep bashing out endless games in this vein, because I don’t know if there’s much more of the well to draw from in this same way. If this is the swansong of the series, it’s a shame that the release was such a clusterf**k, and as a consequence has scarred the game permanently. If you can get it cheap in a good sale, like I did, I highly recommend it, but I wouldn’t pay full price, as despite the fact that it's a great game, it’s still broken in a number of ways.			"

												Ok, I've bought this game after a year from release on summer sale. Devs told that game is mostly fixed.So why not, it is 50% off with all dlc. I've played for an hour just fine, but soon I started to get critical errors any time I glide, or ride batmobile more than 2 minutes (oh, you have to ride it more than 2 minutes). There is no fix, no workaround, and it seems there will be no new patches from devs, I've bought a BROKEN game. It is not laggy or buggy, this things you can workaround somehow, no,  it is BROKEN.And from community i see there are a lot of guys with the same issue, and it is mostly for AMD  cards like mine (r290).So if you want to buy this game, and you have AMD card, think twice. This game can run like the wind for you, or play you like a damn fiddle! You cant predict or be sure.UPDATE_________________________________________________________________After hours of testing different community fixes, I found solution.1) Forget about crimson drivers. I do not know if the game cannot befriend with crimson drivers, or drivers with the game. Or maybe crimson drivers do not even include Batman fixes.Use latest catalyst drivers (15.11)2) Try Batman Tweak Tool (you can find it in Guides), it really helps to optimize game settings and performance.3) Use super resolution (but I do not think this step is mandatory)Now I finally can play the game without crashes, shuttering and fps drops. But my review will stay negative, because it is not my job to sit hours and try fix the game, that already should be tested.I wand to pay the money and play the game with my brain dead..			"

												So I got this free with my brand spanking new EVGA GTX 980 Ti SC, which I've overclocked on top of the base overclock. This is in a system that has 16gb of ram and an i7 3770k. I've unlocked the framerate, turned off all nvidia features apart from lightshafts, and my fps just tanks to 30 and below every time I want to drive the batmobile, or glide as batman. it's a joke. It's a shame because, from what I have played, Arkham Knight is an astounding game. It's a mark above Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, but I cannot recommend it because it simply runs like dogshit. Hell, the console versions run better, and even worse, the PS4 version LOOKS better. The PC version has ZERO ambient occlusion. Nothing. It's gone. Also, don't even try to go into the .ini to turn off motion blur, because the game will most likely crash on startup. We're in the year 2015, and turning off motion blur causes the game to crash. Let that sink in people.Definitely do NOT buy this game until it gets patched, and when it does, I will update my review.I wish I could get a refund, and I got it for free.			"

												The Batman Arkham series has been one of my favourite gaming saeries ever. After playing through them on my PS3 and then again on PC, they blew me away everytime. Now with this port of Arkham Knight I am the most disappointed I have ever been with a game. Warner Brothers GAmes has specifically gimped the game so that it runs 'on par with the console experience.' It has no ambient occlusion, lackluster textures, no rain textures on Batman (which PS$ has), and worst of all a frame rate cap at 30 frames. I love everything else about this game. Seeing Batman knock somebody out with  a backwards headbutt was fantastic. The Batmobile does shoeget annoying during the tank parts. Do not buy this game, it manages to actaully look and run worse than the console versions.			"

In the last minute the Harley Quin DLC got canned for Nvidia code. I got this game for free and I still feel cheated.I cant even ask for a refund as it is a Nvidia code and didnt purchase it. So I ended playing the game in it's buggy state.I dont kow what some others are saying and being positive about it.Pretty sure they are trolls or ppl payed by Nvidia, Ricksteady and WB to post good reviews. At 30 or 60 fps there are stuttters and FPS does goes to single digits and sometimes even stalls while loading sections of the game.  I cant accept 30fps for a PC game my rig is far more powerful than a PS4 so 60fps is minmimum. The game is a poor port. Here are the bullet points====================- 30fps lock on PC? This is 2015 right?- Poor graphical options- Poor asset streaming causing stutter and single digit fps- Nvidia Gameworks showreel running at 60fps (misleasing consumers) - Increasing system requirements hours before launch and saying there will be issues- Canning Harley Quinn DLC before launch - 30$ season pass for content we are not sure of qualityShame on WB for trying to rip ppl off.

												Although it had a rough launch, this game runs well now. There are occasional dips in frames especially when you are in the Batmobile, however, I believe lowering some video settings can remedy that. The game itself is really good, combat is fluid and better imo, than previous Arkham games. Other than performance issues, I would rate this game 9/10			"

												Biggest disapointment of 2015. The game itself is actually great, so the fact that it runs poorly on my GTX 970 is very sad. Even after the wait the game still suffers. If you really want to play this game, wait till the GOTY edition comes out, hopefully problems like the unstable frame rate will be fixed.			"

Don't buy it until the developer fix and optimize it.Update 01:For now, there's only a little stuttering if you play it on ""Low"". But, still expecting the developer to make it better.Update 02:I can play it if everything is on ""Low"". Stuttering a little, but not really a problem.			"

												Batman Arkham Knight hmmmmmmmm....... Where do I begin.I am now 5 hours into the game and am enjoying it. The fact that I had to spend an hour of my time fixing a Stutter So bad that I couldnt make my way around the title screen (this is a known error with laptop Nvidia cards) I eventually managed to make the game windowed which fixed my problem and actually made the game playable. I can excuse this mostly because its day 1 or 2 and its perfectly resonable to have a few problems. BUT that is not the end, after scrolling through millions of forums about all the diffrent problems with the pc port i have come to the though of WHAT HAS ROCKSTEADY BEEN DOING FOR 3.5 YEARS. They must have been crazy to think that capping the frame rate at 30 was ok in 2015. Even though there is an easy fix for this. It is also apparent that people with top of the line graphics cards are experiencing terrible frame drops, I understand that rocksteady wanted to make this game incredible FOR CONSOLE but its not OK to pass off the PC port to another company when we were expecting a ROCKSTEADY game. For the first hour or so my game ran fine (apart from the weird cape glitch from AO) then after that i started to experience random frame drops and SHOULD I MENTION THAT IM ON THE LOWEST SETTINGS. Also the fact that this game on its highest settings looks worse than the ps4 and Xbox one. It doesnt even look anything like the videos that we recieved in the upcoming months and you might say oh thats cause it was all console footage, Well NO it doesnt even look like what we were promised in the Nvidia gameworks videos which were on PC.few... thats my rant over.Look i really wanted to recommend this game I truley did. The story so far is cool and engaging, the gameplay is amazing, the fighting is even more fluid than before and driving the batmobile is amazing. but i just cant recomend this game right now at its current price and in the state it's in. wait a few patches or find it at a lower price if you really want it. I loved the other games and it truly hurts that I cant't recommend this game.			"

												FPS is fixed-ish, but the game could seriously be better. One of my main issues is the Batmobile, puzzles rely way too much on this. The Batmobile should be something I want to use and can POSSIBLY use to solve a possible. It feels like a forced gimmick that seriously didn't need to be there. Second issue, Joker is in this game, AGAIN. You don't need Joker to make a good Batman game, hell even the fans were a bit dissapointed on that one. I'd say Arkham City, Arkham Asylum, hell Arkham Origins was better. 6/10			"

												At this point and time one cannot give this game anything but a pass. It's an unoptimized pile of poo. SLI doesn't work, very limited graphical tweaks. Not to mention it's a locked 30 fps, are you serious? A pc game in 2015 that is locked at 30 fps. That is absurd. Just a poor port, and to boot Rocksteady made sure to tell everyone they outsorced the port. I guess that is supposed to make it better.Pass, wait for patches and for them to bring it up to release quality. This is just nonsense and if you were thinking of getting a refund then do it and vote with your wallets.Also, if you look at the screen shots of this game. They look NOTHING like what you will get at 1080p maxed settings. At all. They are nice and clean. They are the raw definition of bull shots.Edit.Here we are in January of 2016 and the game still isn't up to release quality. SLI support has just been utterly dropped. Just a sad excuse for a game.			"

												I really wanted this game on release and it broke my heart to see all the troubles it had initially. Since it was on sale I picked it up, set a timer for 1 1/2 hours and played, hoping any troubles it had have now passed. As of this writing, I've played for 112 minutes and I'm not going to do a refund.My PC is not a large beast by any means but it can run things like Skyrim, Fallout 4 and the Witcher 3 with minimal issues. I can run Witcher 3 on medium better than I can AK on low. The game flat out tells me I am like 800 megs of VRAM short but the game runs. It drops frames and I hit slow downs sure, especially in the Batmobile but I havent had any game breaking crashes. The one issue I've been able to duplicate is if I stop after a session and start again later, I have to restart Steam entirely. Otherwise it just says ""running"" but nothing happens.I loved the other Batman games and I feel like I'm gonna enjoy this one too. Just make sure you have a beastly enough rig to tame it cuz this one is a monster.			"

												I haven't preordered a game in ages. I was extremely sceptic with every release, and with good reason. One failed launch after another, this past year has been a rollercoaster ride for PC gaming. I was sure the new Batman wouldn't dissapoint. I was POSITIVE that Rocksteady couldnt mess this up. I preordered the game. I was wrong. FPS is locked to 30 (really?). Unlocking to 60 messes up pre-rendered movies and the game crashes. FPS dips all over the place (PC benchmark option is not a valid test)Game looks nowhere near to what was shown.Cannot raise textures above normal. What the hell?I'm waiting for that day one patch. And I'm officially done with preorders. Too bad I bought the game from a reseller, otherwise this would have been my first steam refund.			"

												Finally beaten the story and the majority of the side mission with the most lag i have ever played in my life. This is a single player game, I get more lag out of a single player game than a multiplayer game. they said they will make a patch for the game a week or two after the release but we are PC gamers, were not going to ♥♥♥♥ing wait more than a day to play. The game over all is amazing! the story is amazing! The sidemissions are really fun!!! if only i could enjoy it with out the game freezing. Though I had just finished most of the game, when I reach about 67% it was unplayable, now i am about to finish I had to stop my game just right this review since I have nothing else to do other than wait for the game to unfreeze. Right now the game isn't worth the frustration. When they release the patch to end this nonsese then this will probably be the best game till Fallout 4 comes out. Not only that!!! but also the harley quinn DLC is only 15mins long. Might as well not have made it at all, comeplete♥♥♥♥♥♥ then when you finish it gives you a new story, only I only went 5mins in but it looks exactly the same. Not going to go throught the whole 15 hours of a laggy♥♥♥♥♥♥game to see whats new in this new story. Might as well uninstall after the game cause the story is now finished and there is nothing else to do in the game. Not going to buy the DLC since the Harley quinn DLC sucked.

												They actually pulled the game from Steams front page, not anywhere to be seen unless you search for it.4,395 neg reviews, I've been saying this was coming for a log time. As consumers but not only that also as a society we have been lowering acceptable standards for years. Each year the bottoms drops a little lower and we say, well its at 95% at least its not 90%. and then its oh its at 90% that's not so bad. Eventually we get used to garbage and we don't remember what its like to have standards. We feed stupidity and greed because we've been taught over dozens of generations that's what we do. We smile and nod and drink the kool aid because if you dont then you're stirring up the crowd and no one wants that. You will be cast upon if you stand out or act different or question those people that are above you. After all they are above you for a reason. It certainly can't be because their father was and his father before him, noooo. It must be because he's smarter, or better, or has things figured out so dont question it.Smile and nod, pay the money, buy the food that give you diabetes, buy the cheap gas that burns up your engine, plunk down money for early access games. No no please don't bring up the fact that they used to pay you for early access calling you beta testers pish posh. Yeesss yesss pre order games and buy DLC before its announced. Its good for you. After all we are only multi million dollar companies, how else can we afford to build your **bleep**ty little games you **bleep**ing serfs.**bleep** you WB and **bleep** you Rocksteady for getting into bed with a **bleep**hole company. Get some **bleep**ing integrity. I would say **bleep** you to whateverthe**bleep**name that **bleep**ty port company is but you don't go and buy dirty smack from the sketchy guy who has a reputation for cutting his **bleep** with poison and then get mad at the guy. You get what you expect, **bleep** product for cheap. They just did what they do they make half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ports and push em out fast. ok so update 06-23-2015: I have now had the game crash on me in 3 different places all within 15-20 minutes of each other. When you first get into the batmobile it froze but then played. Chased the car through the streets and when I jumped out it crashed.Went to get poison ivy, Fought the mini tanks and it froze but then played, put her in the back and it crashed.Said F it for the night. Figured today id give it one more shot maybe it will play nice...nope. Batman decided to jam his batarang up my kester for the last time.Did the batmobile weapons vr charge thing and when I finished it locked up, and half crashed (two face crashed?) Couldn't even task manager to kill it at first.Fool me once Shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me three times and well get a neg review on steam I guess.Sadly like many are already saying it's a little bit of a mess.Yes you can unlock the FPS through the config file but that's unfair for people who may not be comfortable with things like that.I get a game crash at the first batmobile scene. It locked up for a second jumping in and full crashed getting outPulling the DLC is a bullcrap move. I didn't think we would get it but it never said any where that we wouldn't so it was a ""wait and see"" kind of thing, but to pull it only an hour before release is just sad.Sorry guys, when the game runs it does look pretty but i'm over the whole pre-order bullcrap, DLC Bullcrap and nickle and diming consumers bullcrap. I haven't bought a game at launch in a LONG time because i'm just tired of seeing good hard working people getting screwed over.Please people if you read this the only power we have is our wallets, don't buy and they will start to change how things are done.And for all you jack asses saying its for people with weak cards, or they are trolling, or whatever.If it was a few people I might agree, but when 70% of people are having issues and rocksteady flat out confirms there are issues maybe you need to rethink your disbelief. Most people I see complaining have rigs that far exceed the min requirements. I personally have a brand new machine built SPECIFICALLY for this game so shut up.

												My Spec isNVIDIA GeForce GTX 770AMD FX(tm)8350 Eight Core 4GHz16G RamI started the game and it ran fine. I had the occasional framrate drop and the demo in the options ran at an average 50 frames with a drop to 36. What the framerate is when I'm actually in the game I don't know but it seems OK. I haven't touched the graaphics setting from what they were when I installed because whenever I do the game turns to mush but it says everything is turned to minimum. It also says that I'm running at 640x480 which is totally wrongI have almost no playtime in but everything seems good at the moment and I will update when I've played through more. I'm not going to recomend this game untill the issues I'm having with the settings are fixed though. I would have expected my rig to be granted more of the bell and whistles and not have to run on the basic level too. This is a premium priced product and I expect premium items to work in a premium way.(EDIT)I've spent some time optimising my PC for gaming. It's made a MASSIVE difference. I'm still running at pretty low settings but there are NO stuttering problems any more. I started out with some of the stuff from

												SHORT VERSION:Lie Down. Try Not To Cry. Cry A Lot.Another let down because of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port... the game is so poorly done that Warner Bros. suspended the sales of game on PC , says enough.LONG VERSION:Feels like Assassins Creed Unity all over again. Game has terrible fps drop downs no matter what spec u have , a 30 fps lock (which can be disabled in a ini file thank God) , almost no options to change in game...  seriously? Theres only like 5 things to change and then theres NVIDIA features which Im not even playing with due to whats happening with all of them OFF! It dosent matter if I run lowest or highest settings its all the same! The grain/blur filter which I personally hate in games cant be turn off. Game dosent even look that good anyways , to be honest it looks worst than console versions... has poor textures and ambiet occlusion comparing to PS4.Then there comes the dirty little trick they pulled off right before releasing the game ... the slimeballs... they changed the database of Batman games gotten from NVIDIA promo cards , so yeah if u have one of those they just ♥♥♥♥ed you up in the♥♥♥♥♥and took away Harley Quin DLC that u should get for preordering the game just before releasing it!How could they release this abomination? Were they drunk? On crack? Had a gun pointed on their heads? I do not know , what I know is it feels like an alpha game not a proper AAA finished product from the technicall side, they clearly must have known that and yet they released it anyways and they want you to pay for it 60 euro, maybe a walk of atonement like Game of Thrones style would be an appropriate punishment for what they did. If I had bought the game on steam I would go straight for a refund with no regrets telling them how broken this game is.You are really interested in Batman games? Just go play Arkham Asylum or Arkham City and wait for this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥to get some proper patches , yet another game from Warner Bros. thats really unplayable on release just like MK X. I will never get a preorder game from them again.Hopefully they will fix it in the nearest future so I can change the feedback cause I do really want to play and enjoy this game just like the older titles.EDIT:Warner Bros. stated that they are suspending the sale of Batman Arkham Knight on PC till its fixed with an apology to all unhappy owners of the game... there is still hope this game will be as it should in the first place.

												Good looking game but poorly optimised. fps drops when gliding around city, fps drops when in the batmobile, fps drops in cutscenes and fps drops in combat. It is impossible to play this game due to all of these fps drops and i hope a patch is released in the near future to fix major issues.			"

												After a long wait, the game seems to be fixed. I have a smooth 60 FPS and haven't experienced any crashes of glitches. For those of you wondering, I am running the game on a gtx 970 and a 4670k processor. More optimization has been added to the game to help out people with average to below average machines. I'm running the game with everything maxed out aside for the special ""nvidia settings"". I had recently owned the game before and the frames were jumping all over the place and had some pretty rough stuttering effects going on. Back then, I actually set the game to 30 FPS (most people consider this unacceptable) but I jump around from consoles to PC and honestly running the game on 30 FPS wasn't too bad for this title. So if you have a laptop/low-end PC, 30FPS was just fine. The Game itself is what you would expect from this franchise. Batmobile is a really nice touch, and the combat is always getting polished up. The DLC is really great. Now offers new challenges, bat suits, and batmobile skins. 1989 bat suit and batmobile, just awesome. I recommend the game to any batman fans and anyone whose still afraid of this game having problems should strongly consider giving it another chance.			"

												I really wanted this game on release and it broke my heart to see all the troubles it had initially. Since it was on sale I picked it up, set a timer for 1 1/2 hours and played, hoping any troubles it had have now passed. As of this writing, I've played for 112 minutes and I'm not going to do a refund.My PC is not a large beast by any means but it can run things like Skyrim, Fallout 4 and the Witcher 3 with minimal issues. I can run Witcher 3 on medium better than I can AK on low. The game flat out tells me I am like 800 megs of VRAM short but the game runs. It drops frames and I hit slow downs sure, especially in the Batmobile but I havent had any game breaking crashes. The one issue I've been able to duplicate is if I stop after a session and start again later, I have to restart Steam entirely. Otherwise it just says ""running"" but nothing happens.I loved the other Batman games and I feel like I'm gonna enjoy this one too. Just make sure you have a beastly enough rig to tame it cuz this one is a monster.			"

												Batman Arkham Knight is literally all over the place in terms of its content. Sometimes I think that it's a solid 9/10 game, but at other times it can be a 3/10 game. The first few hours of Arkham Knight are superb, they show off everything the game has to offer, and contain a stellar story. The ball was raised extremely high up at that point, but then you get to the rest of the game. Between the nonsensical and downright boring padding thats added on after the main story, (which by the way adds about 10 extra hours to the game) and the lackluster narrative, Arkham Knight takes that highly raised ball, and slams it through the poorly-textured floor in its final acts. Not to mention the performance which is all over the place with my GTX 970, sometimes I get a consistent 45+ FPS, while other times it can go as low as 15 FPS in the span of 5 minutes. There also just isn't much to do, after the story you have the option of New Game+ or playing one of the five challenge maps they have to offer, that's it. In the end, I don't see how a game that took 4 years to make, and had multiple studios working on it, could only muster about 18 hours of actual gameplay to offer to consumers. I wouldn't recommend buying this at full price, let alone on PC. If you have to play it, borrow it, or rent it, as its not worth 59.99+ just for 18 hours of gameplay. In the end, I give this game a 5.5/10 - Slightly Above Average.			"

												I hadn't played this game during the ""unplayable"" phase so I don't know how far it's come with all the patches but I'll say that running on my desktop, which is fairly substantial, it's not perfect. This pc is built for video editing which means that it's got fairly decent specs for gaming as well and 16 gig of ram. It runs every recent high end title that i've tried, like Alien Isolation, Rise of the Tomb Raider or Dying Light, absolutely perfectly and with beautiful graphics. I want to emphasise that I've never encountered a game that my pc has struggled with playing at the game's highest graphical settings before, so this issue is with the game and not an upgrading issue on my end. And while Arkham looks fantastic (although no better than many of the other games that run fine), it sometimes functions fine, and sometimes skips and lags an insane amount and unfortunately it's worse when the texture resolution and detail options are turned up.However, gameplay wise, it's brilliant. If you like Batman, you'll love it, if you like the other arkham games you'll love it. It's definitely worth getting, I just don't kknow if it's ever going to work as well as it should. The story is brilliant and the side missions are fun, the soundtrack, voice acting, etc.. all of that, just like the other Arkham games is top notch, it really is a great game.As for DLC, wouldn't really recommend it, the Season of Infamy pack has some side missions which are kind of fun but really short and definitely not worth the price. However, the 1989 batmobile skin is brilliant. It's cheap and if you're a fan of the 1989 Tim Burton Batman film, like me, then you get to go around Gotham dressed like the Michael Keaton Bat and driving the slickest Batmobile they ever put on screen.So i'd recommend getting it in a sale, I got it for £13 and that feels worth it but I think I'd feel a bit ripped off paying full price when, at this point, it still isn't entirely fixed.

												What can i say, i loved the previous games but alas even this one runs worse than that of Arkham Origins. I am running a 970, i72700k and 8gb ram.The benchmark fps is between 32 and 60, to me that is fine.In game however especially when either gliding or driving this game becomes unplayable. Stuttering to the point of the screen not even moving is an atrocity; ladies and gentleman we may have a contender for worse PC port of the decade, yes it may be worse than that of Unity. I love the look of the game and the story but even that seems somewhat rushed, while only played 15 mins you can tell the time was not taken when developing the PC version of this game. Rocksteady, i hope your reading this because you have just gone from one of my favorite companies to the worst, i put faith in your company and spent money on this game. You have the audacity to not even try to make the game playable. You better respond quick to this game otherwise a refund is inbound.Good points-It has Batman.Bad points-Poorly optomisedMemory leaks(also on higher cards)Maybe a hint of a downgrade but tbh not a big concern.unplayable game.So much for my 970 lasting at least a year.

												It's barely playable in its current state, it's graphically inferior to its console counterparts (It's missing ambient occlusion entirely as well as rain effects on Batman and the Batmobile, all of which are present in the PS4 and XB1 versions), it has a 30FPS cap which can be removed via the ini file but did little to keep at a high, stable framerate for my rig that is comfortably above the recommended specs, and after a few launches, it then refused to even launch again, instead presenting me with a mile long list of errors. This is not acceptable for such a high profile release, or any release for that matter, especially one where they have the gall for charge $60 for it.EDIT: This will be updated when the game is patched and functional, and while it was unacceptable to launch in this condition in the first place, I have to give credit to WB for suspending sales of the PC version while they fix it.

I really, REALLY wanted this to be the best Arkham game of the series, but alas they outsourced our PC port to the same crapsquad 12-man crew that did origins and had to hamstring several key elements of the game to meet the release date.  I asked for a refund after attempting to modify the game to play halfway decent but that never fully worked out, plus we don't get occlusion, we don't get high textures, we don't get the advanced rain textures, and they tried to hide their massive instability issues by softlocking it to 30FPS.

												It says I have only played 90 odd minutes well its closer to 5 hours (No net)Anyway where do I start? I am not going to repeat what others have said about performance there is enough of them and they are right.Gamewise?The city looks great in high textures it will look even better. (If we ever get them).Combat is as good as the first and second games and the upgrades look pretty nice.The Batmobile? Well at first I thought why? Then I started to get used to it and enjoyed its inclusion to the game.The main issues? I feel disconnected with the gameworld, but that might be the poor optimisation of the game and frankly pisspoor port. There really is no excuse for this.I have a conclusion but its almost like a conspiracy to make the PC version so poorly over the PS4 and X-Bone.Did they sabotage the PC version? Only an idiot would do that but I can't understand why a company with 2 really good Batman games would release this as there is no way they did not know the state of the game prior to release.Normal Textures? Seriously? I have a great PC and a 980Ti my game should not run like crap.Anywy I have ranted enough.Would I recommend this game? In its current state no... Wait 6 months till its hopefully fixed and there is a ton of DLC  and it is in the Christmas sale for under £10 ($15 if you are in the USA) Rocksteady this trilogy should have went out with a bang now it will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.

Never have I played a game with so many framerate and stuttering issues. Even powerful rigs can't keep a stable FPS at 1080p.  A 30 FPS lock doesn't help either. DO NOT buy this game.EDIT: Removing the 30 FPS lock helped the gameplay, more playable framerate. Still need a patch though.			"

												What can i say, i loved the previous games but alas even this one runs worse than that of Arkham Origins. I am running a 970, i72700k and 8gb ram.The benchmark fps is between 32 and 60, to me that is fine.In game however especially when either gliding or driving this game becomes unplayable. Stuttering to the point of the screen not even moving is an atrocity; ladies and gentleman we may have a contender for worse PC port of the decade, yes it may be worse than that of Unity. I love the look of the game and the story but even that seems somewhat rushed, while only played 15 mins you can tell the time was not taken when developing the PC version of this game. Rocksteady, i hope your reading this because you have just gone from one of my favorite companies to the worst, i put faith in your company and spent money on this game. You have the audacity to not even try to make the game playable. You better respond quick to this game otherwise a refund is inbound.Good points-It has Batman.Bad points-Poorly optomisedMemory leaks(also on higher cards)Maybe a hint of a downgrade but tbh not a big concern.unplayable game.So much for my 970 lasting at least a year.

												COMPLETED DATE30-Dec-2016 SETUPWindows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadRATING (rated as if released in 2016, expect lower score for some aspects)Optimization : AStorytelling : AGraphics : ASound : AControl : A Fun Factor : ABang For The Buck : Get it nowThis game ran smooth on my system with maximum graphic quality settings. Great storytelling and voice acting, but the main plot feel forced. I love the level designs including the Riddler's puzzles. The Riddler's puzzles are not as hard to pull as in Arkham City, but still satisfying to complete. The side-quests kind of boring because almost all of them either requires you to ""collect"" something or chase something. Driving Batmobile feels great but the tank battles although fun at first, becomes annoying later on. The city much bigger than in the previous games with great details but it feel unnatural because the citizen are only cops and bad guys (thugs and militia). The developer did take all the good things of the previous games and improve them. Highly recommended.			"

If *I* can finish the driving challenges in this game, ANYONE can. The car-to-tank mechanic allows for easy maneuvering around tight turns and narrow areas, and the coolness factor of the car and the tank cannot be overemphasized.Now for the negative: I did have to go to the controller for the driving time trials, as well as one of the side missions during the game. If, like me, you are a completionist when it comes to open-world games, you'll probably need a controller to get through everything.Am I nitpicking? Pretty sure I'm nitpicking.

												Batman: Arkham Knight is unplayable. The game literally sucked up a full 7.94 GB's of my 8 GB's of memory. So a definite memory leak is obviouls within the first 8 minutes of gameplay. Which is as far as I've gotten. :(The CPU usage ranged from 71% to 93% or more and NEVER stayed stable.  Audio stuttered, major frame drops, etc. To top it off, I did the PC Performance Test in game to ensure I had a decent FPS (average 40+ with Default Settings).  I would consider the current game performance an early Beta at best. Running an AMD Phenom II X4 965, 3.4 GHz  BE with a Gigabyte GTX 970 G1. My north bridge is over-clocked, so playing ANY other game is smooth.			"

												First the non recommendation is not due to the technical issues. The game is not the disaster it was at launch, but it still has some issues. This is the most underwhelming Arkham game in the the series. For Origins, I had lowered expectations, and it met most of them. The good bit: The graphics and detailing of characters is awesome, right down to the fabric patterns of Batsuit. The Voice acting and Music are great all throughout.And the rest: The story tries to be the concluding third act for Arkham version of Batman. Unfortunately, Scarecrow and Arkham Knight simply don’t have the caliber to be the “ultimate threat” Batman has ever faced. Anyone vaguely familiar with the Batman Mythos will be able to deduce Arkham Knight’s identity (No he is not an original creation). One of the most powerful element of batman’s story is used and squandered on Arkham Knight. Scarecrow does his fear thing, and the hallucination shtick is overused crutch to further the story. Most other Bat villains are relegated to Side missions. Gameplay sans Batmobile is the same as Arkham City, with changes being Incremental at best. Nothing really shake things up – the rythmic combat and stalk from height stealth section remains the same.And then there is the god damned Batmobile. An all purpose transportation/combat tank. Some genius decided to make it the spine of Arkham knight’s Gameplay. Every other missions requires the use of batmobile, and it wouldn’t have been an issue had it been fun. The Batmobile section is serviceable are best, but since they are overused so much, it soon becomes a chore. Tank battles soon devolve to taking on 30+ enemies. Batmobile handling is neither arcadey enough and neither gives the feedback and impression of weight that should come from driving a hulking armored tank at speed. Riddler’s Racing events are an amazingly painful experience. Which you have to do, including every other mundane thing to get the true ending.			"

												This is definitely the most ambitious Arkham Batman game to date, and it shows. Visually it's one of the best looking games of all time. It controls great, give you the tools to be the Batman, and for the first time ever you feel as if you can really roam about as the caped crusader all thanks of the inclusion of the batmobile. Sadly the game was not ported well to PC, and you need some of the beefiest tech to be able to run this game maxed out and with stable framerates. Even then you will experience stutter from time to time as assets load while you travel about. The game needs a lot of RAM, and even an SSD seems to be mandatory for it to be semi enjoyable. It's all a big shame, since this is as close as you can get to the ultimate Batman expereince, the game has tons of content (especially if have the season pass), but it never truly was finished to the standard we expected, meaning there are still bugs/glitches and performance issues to be had no matter what platform you play it on. On this basis alone I cannot it give it a thumbs up, but I wish I could! It is an extremely fun game, and if you can get it on a sale, and you have the system specs to power it properly, then you will still enjoy it, you will just have to swallow your pride and live with the performance issues.

												FYI, I played and completed this game back around when it was released.  I am a big fan of the Arkham franchise and loved Asylum, City, and even Origins.  Regarding Knight, I was one of the ""lucky"" ones for whom the game still ran reasonably well...either that or I have a high tolerance for sub-par performance.  Supposedly the game runs better after the patches, I can't be bothered to check since I am done and have moved on to greener pastures.  This game definitely gets a thumbs down out of principle.  WB / Rocksteady's behaviour in this matter has been a debacle and should not be rewarded despite their untimely efforts in remedying the matter.  Many people seem to advocate that they somehow deserve our thanks for patching the game and customers are acting entitled when asking for some kind of reparations.  This is certainly not the case.  While it is technically true that they owe their customers nothing beyond a working game, any company worth a damn when it comes to their customer service would do this and more in the interests of good public relations and customer retention.  The fact that they did nothing beyond patching demonstates a bare minimum regard for their customer base.  This, in conjunction with a $40 season pass that has been well-documented to be scant in it's offerings, is just sad and disappointing.			"

												Well, so much for a nice birthday present for myself. This game has so many problems... My computer is an average one, it can play most games very well on high settings, but with this game, I can't get it to perform more than well below average on the lowest settings no less! What is this!? The people who made this game have been working on it for years yet can't get it to work well on even the best of rigs on day one? I suppose it would be unfair of me to not expect a FEW bugs on the first day of release, but this is ridiculous!The only reason I got this now was because it was about $35 on GMG at one point, yet I realize that was not the best decision. Right now, the game is barely even worth THAT. Hopefully these problems get fixed soon. For now, I would not recommend this game, not until it is fixed and actually playable.			"

												To start off, let's discuss the most obvious bad things about this game. As we all know, Batman: Arkham Knight is expremely power-hungry. The game (for me) plays at a top 62 FPS but drops to about 40 when sprinting. When gliding, I get a 20 FPS drop. The game, at random times, will stutter and freeze, and occasionally my screen will go black, causing a driver failure. To my surprise, the game actually has never crashed on me. Now let's look at the good stuff. (Wait, what good stuff?!?! There isn't anything good about this game!!!1!!1!1!) Actually, if you ignoure the awful performance quality, the game isn't actually that bad. The level of detail in the game is extremely high. I can't even distinguish a single flat surface on any of the models. You at least have to give the guys credit for the modeling. The combat mechanics take some time getting used to, but are a piece of cake once you get the hang of it. The story is pretty well done, and the game overall has a good length in gameplay. I also like the fact that the game is open-world so you can exploure as you please. My overall rating for this game is a 3/10. [✓] High definition visuals[✓] Good Gameplay[X] Crappy performance.Other thoughts:Personally, I would wait to buy this game for the re-release to come out. Trust me, it's worth the wait.Update: For me, the recent patches have helped my game about 20% in performance. Not a lot, but enough for my satistfaction.			"

												Having been spoilt lately by quality AAA PC games from the likes of Rockstar and CDProjectRed, the initial release Arkham Knight comes as a real kick in the pants.My personal experience seems to have been on the mild side, but a 30fps cap, which when removed causes textures to look like they belong on a SNES, is wholly unacceptable.The gameplay is classic Arkham, with a number of neat additions. And blasting through Gotham in the Batmobile is a very satisfying experience, when the framerate doesn't tank into the ground.As much fun as the game is, just wait until it gets fixed.			"

												First of all, I didn't reccomend this game about the bad port (It's somewhat fixed so..). I'll compare this to the old games, yeah sure, this game has the best graphics, and the best map out of all 4 of the other batman games, the thing that failed though is the fact that there is basically no boss fight in this game, when I got to the part where I fought the chopper, I thought it's just a generic brute enemy that's gonna come out once in a while (like the titans in the Asylum) but no, I was in the middle of the fight and then I noticed that there was a health bar that kinda confirms it as a boss and I didn't see that chopper ever again, the Two Face, well I expected it at least like the one in the Arkham City where Catwoman fight Two Face, but Two Face was just another thug that wasn't any stronger than the other Thug. The Story is really crap and it was too repetitive and expected.

The other characters was a waste, I mean at least give me an option to use it on the free roam and the challenge map but no, they are just a one use only and they have less gadgets than before. I expected more Rocksteady, this was the last Arkham Game, the last time I blindly trust you Rocksteady and I won't ever buy your stupid DLCs!			"

												First of all, I didn't reccomend this game about the bad port (It's somewhat fixed so..). I'll compare this to the old games, yeah sure, this game has the best graphics, and the best map out of all 4 of the other batman games, the thing that failed though is the fact that there is basically no boss fight in this game, when I got to the part where I fought the chopper, I thought it's just a generic brute enemy that's gonna come out once in a while (like the titans in the Asylum) but no, I was in the middle of the fight and then I noticed that there was a health bar that kinda confirms it as a boss and I didn't see that chopper ever again, the Two Face, well I expected it at least like the one in the Arkham City where Catwoman fight Two Face, but Two Face was just another thug that wasn't any stronger than the other Thug. The Story is really crap and it was too repetitive and expected. And Finally....The Batmobile, I was waiting to have a joyride with it but then I realise it makes the game, The World of Tanks : Batman Edition. The other characters was a waste, I mean at least give me an option to use it on the free roam and the challenge map but no, they are just a one use only and they have less gadgets than before.

												I've played some bad ports in my time, this is right up there. When you load the game for the first time the first thing you will notice is the menus are capped at 30fps, strange I thought but I guess in game will be 60fps and beyond. The next thing I did was check the minimal amount of graphics options and ran the benchmark, first without the nvidia features on and was pleased to see the benchmark running at 60+fps, I then tried the various nvidia features to check for any dips in performance.Then I selected new game and realised it was capped at 30fps which makes no sense considering the benchmark is at 60+, so I was forced to exit the game and edit the ini file in config to get 60fps. Unfortunately it looks as if right now I'll have to play the game capped at 30fps anyway, with the fps uncapped the stutter is worse than anything i've seen, the framerate fluctuates anywhere from 35ish to 60 when gliding and divebombing, I couldn't believe I payed £60 for this including the season pass. This could be a worse port than AC Unity, I tested this on a single gtx 980 and SLI 980's, which made no difference to the framerate whatsoever.This game needs a mammoth patch.			"

UpdateAs of June 23, 2015 the game is playable, but optimization issues still remain. I recommend holding off on purchasing the title for the moment, because the performance issues are quite severe, and you will not have an optimal experience. What made the game playable for me was after a complete verify cache failure, the entire game was redownloaded, and the newer files seem to fix a lot of the stability issues I previously had. I cannot say this with absolute certainty but in my case I believe the preload files were ""unpatched"" or not a good version. If you are having issues, preloaded the game, and haven't redownloaded the game, I suggest trying that.The previous texture issue I had was due to me disabling depth of field. It seems that this game uses DoF heavily, and without it, it's quite apparently how low resolution the textures are. I hope they update the textures so that I don't have to use DoF.With my specs there are frequent drops in framerate anywhere between 30-60 FPS. I'm currently using RTSS to limit framerate to a maximum of 60, and have unlocked the 30 FPS cap and changed it to a maximum of 60 FPS.I don't have a complete picture of the game yet so I will not comment on gameplay just yet.Original PostAs of June 22, 2015, the game is unplayable. I will update this recommendation as patches become available.My current specs are as follows:Intel Core i7 2600k 3.8 Ghz (Liquid Cooled)AMD R9 290 (4GB w/ latest recommended drivers for the game)8 GB RAMSamsung EVO 840 250 GB SSDWindows 8.1 64-bitIssues:Crashed with a bunch of error messages.System locked, and had to do a hard reset.Sound cutting in one particular part of the intro section.Verifying cache lead to complete redownload of the game.Crashes sometimes when accessing options menu in-game.Texture quality is extremely poor for maximum settings (could be that high res textures are not included in the initial release package).Possible memory leak, as memory usage and page file usage seems to be much higher than the norm.Other IssuesCapped 30 fps (can tweak via .ini files)No detailed Post Processing options (can tweak via .ini files) like motion blur, or Depth of field.No mouse sensitivity options.

If your PC cannot run this game, you will know before your refund period runs out.This review is focusing mostly on the game itself and not on the issues that I was fortunate enough not to experience. Don't hate me!Now on with the review. I've graded each section with a letter grade if you just want to skim. And there's a TL;DR summary at the end. :)Performance Issues (Worked for me, but obviously not for everybody) - DSo you have all heard about the performance problems with this game. Yes; lots of people can't run this game on their computers, and I say that's a terrible shame, because I really enjoyed playing this game myself! This review is focusing on the quality of the game itself assuming your system can run it. Mine could, with only 1 or 2 environments where I noticed any significant lag, but not bad enough that I couldn't complete the game. Yes, shame on WB for how they handled this game, but this review is about my experiences with this game, not on how I feel about how WB should treat PC gamers. OK. We cool? Good.Story, Voice Acting, and Characters - A+Along with the other games in the series, this game delivers in a big way! The story is excellent. I think this game hasone of the best stories of all of the Arkham Games. And the voice acting and character development is excellent as always. This game drew me in early and kept me invested in the story through to the end. I even decided to 100% complete the game, which I rarely ever do with games. My one minor complaint with the story in this game was that the Arkham Knight's identity was too obvious, but it did fit the story pretty well, so it wasn't too much of an issue for me.Presentation (Graphics and Sound) - A+Presentationally, Gotham has never looked better! The environments are excellent, vibrant, and surprisingly well varied for a Batman game without losing the dark atmosphere surrounding the Dark Knight. The sound in this game, including the music and the sound effects, was truly exceptional. When you are blowing up militia tanks with the Batmobile, you can practically feel the impact of each blast. And taking down Gotham's criminals in hand-to-hand combat has never felt more real.Gameplay (Good, but not GREAT) - C+The only point where I was a little disappointed was with gameplay. It's not bad, but compared to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, it wasn't anything special. The Batmobile was done very well, and I had no problems with its controls, but the developers used it way too often. The boss fights were the most disappointing thing in this game. There were a few shining points, for instance, the part when you defeat Scarecrow and the final battle with the Riddler, but there were some characters that deserved a much better boss battle. Without spoiling anything, I was extremely upset that Rocksteady made one character's boss battle a tank fight, which was far too easy and didn't fit the character at all. Also, while I liked the final fight with the Riddler, collecting ALL the Riddler trophies and solving all the riddles got tedious  once I had completed the rest of the game. I'd still recommend completing the story mode 100% (they give you an additional cutscene at the end that makes it worth it), but be prepared for a lot of frustration getting ALL of the riddles. Nevertheless, that made finally punching the Riddler in his stupid face so much more satisfying! I was also disappointed that I couldn't free play as Catwoman or any other this time around, but with the city designed for the Batmobile, I can understand why, so it wasn't too big of a deal. (But wouldn't it be awesome if Catwoman could hijack any car in free roam and turn the game into a GTA clone? Please someone make that mod. I would even buy it if you charged for it!)Was that too long? Here's a TL;DR version! - Overall Grade: BThis game is worth playing as part of the series. I'd definitely recommend at least playing Arkham City before this one, and Arkham Asylum is still my favorite game in the series, but this game is definitely worth playing if you loved the other Arkham games (and if you have a system that can run it, of course)! That being said, buy it on sale, because WB doesn't deserve full price for how they handled the PC launch and the subsequent patches. If your PC can't run it, get a refund and try the console version. I'm sure that if you can get this game to work for you, you'll be glad you didn't miss out on it, even though it does have a few flaws.About the DLCOne other note, I purchased some of the DLC for this game, but it was mostly pretty disappointing. I'd say ""Season of Infamy"" (4 Extra Most Wanted Villains) and ""A Matter of Family"" (Batgirl) are worth checking out, but the others are pretty lame (unless you want to mod the game so you can use the characters in free play).

												I see some people love this game and good for them, but once I get through the main story I am done with this game.  Where the story in Arkham City was tight and well put together, this one seems to be average at best and very unbatman like in my opinion (right now seem to be endless shooting tanks ) and instead of the batmobile as fun option it is forced upon you at every turn, You want to solve a riddle go around a race track 3 times in the batmobile.  You want to disarm a bomb, batmobile.  You need to charge a battery, batmobile, and on, and on.  Very disappointed and I am one of the lucky ones that isn't experiencing video freezes everyone else seems to be having.  If this game didn't come with my video card I would return it.   I know I will probably get blasted by some fanboys but this is my opinion and I dare do be different than yours.			"

												Don't know what to say about this game. First of all, my GTX 970 still(November 15 2015) does not maintain 60 FPS while driving or flying (without Physix) and there are still glitches(I stuck glued to a roof, enemies fall through textures). But the problem, I think is in the other department. I remember the time when I waited for 5 minutes for loading of a 1-room location in VtM: Bloodlines and I didn't care, because the game was awesome! I just ate or did my homework during these 5 minutes:). And I could have overcome all the inconveniences of Arkham Knight the same way. But for some reason we all pay so much attention to graphics and insane for early 2000s 60 FPS here, because, I think, the game itself is not that big of a deal and you mostly play it for the picture.It is the same Batman game we played two times already. The fighting is the same, story does not shock you as it was in some moments of Asylum game. In my opinion it is even a bit worse: villains don't have much time and instead of mystery behind them present mostly structurized lazy side mission apearances. For example, to catch one of them you only need to race him across the city and beat him up 3 or 4 times. Every time he appears the same way and fight ends the same way. It feels more like a race-side-activity markers on the map of GTA game instead of ""legendary detective uses all his devices to find and apprehand a dangerous long time eneme in a dark chaotic city etc."". That is the difference between Christopher Nolan movie and a standard summer blockbuster. It does not mean the game is bad, but I guess I just raised my hopes too high about Rocksteady's talent. Or they just had to make another game according to the contract. Anyway I wish them good luck next time!			"

												Worst PC port I have EVER played. Yes, even worse than Dark Souls port. Also, in general the game does not seem as fun to play as Arkham Asylum or City. You have to spend like half of your time in this game doing boring and lame Batmobile combat against unmanned drones. I think we would all rather be beating up thugs, but a very large portion of missions require you to spend a lot of time with the Batmobile combat, which is just dodge, shoot, repeat. 6/10 game overall.

												I haven't asked for a refund, instead I played it not for a long time, but for as much as I played it back then the more interesting it got. All I can say it's that the story it's a really good one, captivating and the villans unleashing hell on the streets of Gotham, a hell far worse compared to the previous games from the series.Gotham it truly looks astonishing, never-ending rain reflecting all the distruction inside the city. I can for sure say that they really worked on creating this awesome Gotham with all the missions and investigations that you have to do, plus the engaging it results an awesome game with a lot of content and a moderate value of replay.You also get to drive around the batmobile, and here I get to say that this thing might feel a bit repetitive mainly because you need to use the batmobile where is not the case or when you might not want to use it but you need to use it and there is no way to get past an objective where you need to use batmobile without it and by this I mean,destroying a wall, pulling down something, EMP something and of course the chases which in my opinion are the only thing you need to use batmobile at. Villans have reasons to do what they do especially Scarecrow and these reasons and their actions can drastically change your opinion about them. Takedowns also got improved and you can now assits some unique combat moment, some brutal than the others.As I can notice, a lot of reviews has changed overtime and a lot of people now praises the game because of the optimisation it got since the release and I agree with them but also the game it's not in 100% condition of optimisation but it is in a far decent one compared to the initial release. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to buy it and are not sure if it's worth it although I have to say that this game it's not a dificult one so if you are seeking a bit challange you might want to stay away from it. Also I recommend it to people that had it before to retry it and enjoy it this time.			"

												Dear Rocksteady,          Thank you for this horribly optimized poor excuse for a port, I appreciate being dicked around after waiting almost a year to play this game. It wouldn't be so bad if my computer barely met system requirements and it was me, the consumers fault. That being said, I think it should be considered that this is a bad game, Why you might ask? Because when you have a game, that people released and said ""okay here you guys go it's ready"" and you click the play button, giggling with anticipation, the next things you see, define that game. So that being said: Arkham Knight is the worst game that rocksteady has come out with ever, Ill take you through the first 15 minutes: The opening cut scenes where they implimented time travel, and the use of bullet time really took me out of the game, then the coffee shop segment where things are really supposed to engage the story, rocksteady tried to portray the cop as a ""teleporter"" bringing a new superhero into the franchise. However this hero that we find ourselves playing as, shows his greatest weakness which is other teleporters jumping on your face. Now let's get to the opening where we get to play as batman, Batman starts his campaign against crime, not assessing the fact that his equipment is faulty, im assuming it's a story error in which rocksteady meant to tell us that everytime batman looks in a direction his helmet camera gets blurry and doesn't work. This combined with the fact that the batmobile seems to keep trying to go with the newly implimented ""time jumping"" theme.  Basic combat is also a joke because they nerfed the batsuit in the early parts of the game to the point that when you attack something it affects the visuals that batman is seeing and forces you to wait as the system keeps trying to reboot midcombat, I don't know that the libertys that they were trying to take with this game involving a teleporting cop, time-travel and batman going into a fight with faulty equipment to even the odds but I have no motivation to find out, as the first 15 minutes of this game showed me how awful a developer can be.Side note: If this is some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt, to get people to convert to a console by releasing a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor PC port. Because Rocksteady decided to line their pockets with all that Sony/Mocrosoft payoff money, Everyone has already seen the gimmicky preorders, that each console and gamestore has to try to get everyone to buy early and from them {i.e.) redhood dlc, no batmobile edition), then they truly should take a look in the mirror and say to themselves ""we are bad people"".  Disclaimer: This being said, I know that they could be trying really hard, and alot of games at release have problems and minor bugs, Also most of the gaming community including myself, Know nothing of the innerworkings or politics that it truly takes to publish a game and release it. This all being said, You don't release an unfinished game. Unless you intend on us playing it from alpha on, to bugtest for you. This is how fanbases get destroyed.			"

												Is it playable on on a GTX 860m? yes, the frame rate is kinda smooth on low. Does the frame rate randomly drop to the single digits when you explore the open world? Yes, it will drop to the single digits for a couple seconds than bounce back up to thirty.Does the frame rate randomly drop when you're in a small room? Yes, does the same thing as if i was in the open world. Should you buy this game in its current state? Either wait for the patch, or a major sell.  "

												At this point in time it is impossible to recommend this title. I have an i7 3970x @4.5 Ghz and a GTX 980 and the game was a stuttering mess. It appears to be a very, very lazy port. It is a shame, I really enjoy this series but I cannot support this kind of behaviour from a publisher/developer. Refund Requested. Regund Approved.			"

												Poor optimisation and now they've confirmed no SLI.With a good enough system the game may be fun but you'll need a very powerful system for a semi-decent performance and even if you take away all the performance problems it's still the most lackluster game of the Arkham series. "

												Literally the definition of unplayable. As in I cannot play it. Controllers detected but non-functional, despite a lot of effort on my part. And when I get through the unskipable intro ads and the unskipable intro cutscenes to the playable part, my character's view jumps to the ceiling and I can't look away no matter what I do. And oh yeah, that's after i downloaded all 36 gigs twice, because I made the mistake of verifying the game installation to see if that would fix it. Thanks for an awesome launch night guys.Maybe it's my fault for expecting the game I bought to work.			"

												I'm actually too scared to even run the game again, considering that it's already hard-crashed my PC twice, and that's just on the performance test! Even more scary is that just running the application screws with your PC, making a bunch of visual anomalies occur (Lots of people facing colored screens, cursor lock-ups, windows freezing, all signs of graphics card failure on healthy systems). There are viruses made specifically to harm your computer that do a worse job than this game does!			"

												What the hell were they doing during the time they delayed this game? Game lags constantly. Even edited the game files to help (Which I shouldn't have to do) and still didn't do anything. The DLC for some reason isn't available yet. The gameplay in itself is perfect however (top quality).Overall very dissapointed, one of the most anticipated games of 2015 has been let down once again.

												Let's start this review by saying, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Quite possibly the worst PC port i've seen in recent years, absolutely lackluster menu options of all categories, locked to 30 FPS unless you go tinker in the ini file and once you do, you'll regret itUnlocking the FPS seems fine but here are the problems i ran into changing other optionsTurning off Motion Blur : Will make your game instantly crashTurning off Depth of Field : Completely breaks Detective Mode (invisible units) and other parts of the game like no counter icons in combatHeavy graphical artifacting when looking at a specific part of the cityThe game is terribly optimized, i7-4790K @ 4.6GHz, GTX 980, 16GB @ 2400MHz and i've had sub 30 dips during Batmobile sectionsVery disappointed in Rocksteady, this port is lazy, lackluster and horrible and they totally knew that considering the lack of preview codes for the PC versionDo not encourage this, i wish i could get a refund but i didn't buy it on Steam			"

												I got Fallout 3(a game infamous for crashing win 7 or 8 PCs) last week and in 42 hours of playing it has given me less trouble then Arkham Knight has in 34 minutes of playing.I have a AMD Radeon HD 7600 Series and before installing the driver update (http://steamcommunity.com/games/208650/announcements/detail/207511695917042396) I had a FPS of about 15 to 20, after getting the update I had the same FPS and some of the worst graphics bugs I have ever seen.I am not mad Rocksteady, I'm furious, I have been waiting for more than a year and now it looks like I’m going to have to get a new PC, a PS4, or Xbox one to play it and while I’m sure the refund I’m going to get will help I can't afford that right now.

												Just don't.It is not actually a bad game. I'm even pretty sure it is awesome. but it is such a waste not to have waited for a couple of extra months.Bloody hell guys ? What were you thinking ?(Be sure that I'll update my review in either way when I'll be able to play the right way. Everyone should remember that Warner Bros is to blame for all the troubles and still suck at responding to them, while Rocksteady is really the victim here.)EDIT : so, the game has been re-released.  I still don't understand how I can make work a higly modded skyrim, huge Assassin's Creed maps, Arkham City with high specs while Arkham Knight still need a 4 gig video card and 12gig of RAM to work.Now I can also see that in low specs, the game needs more than 1G of video ram... For the record, I still want to play when I get the monster card I deserve, but I encourage everyone that is angry enough to get a refund.Shame on you Warner, I'll be closely looking who I'am buying to, now.EDIT2 : Irony in the end ? Now that I have 500 euros graphic card, the game is really good.... only now.			"

												The game looked outstanding from all the trailers. However, the game is completely unplayable. My computer is shy of minimum, but  if I could run Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and GTA V on normal settings without lag, I should be able to run this on all low settings (even video resolution at 800 x 600) with no lag. However, the game is so broken I can't even play the game with these extremely ugly and low settings. I am dissapointed and hope this is fixed so I can at least play the game (even if it is on all low settings) without lag.			"

I still don't understand how I can make work a higly modded skyrim, huge Assassin's Creed maps, Arkham City with high specs while Arkham Knight still need a 4 gig video card and 12gig of RAM to work.Now I can also see that in low specs, the game needs more than 1G of video ram... For the record, I still want to play when I get the monster card I deserve, but I encourage everyone that is angry enough to get a refund.Shame on you Warner, I'll be closely looking who I'am buying to, now.EDIT2 : Irony in the end ? Now that I have 500 euros graphic card, the game is really good.... only now.			"

												My first attempt to play this game ended in a total system crash.My second attempt to play the game ended in a crash after being told I had to restart to apply graphics changes.My third attempt to play the game ended after 25 minutes when Windows warned me I was nearly out of memory (16GB total).For the extremely brief time I was able to play the game, I was treated to visuals straight out of history, with gracphis options equivalent to a game ten years old.  The 30fps lock was completely awful and made for one of the worst gaming experiences I've suffered through in a very long time.In its current state, this 'game' is nothing more than an excercise in futility and frustration, and you'd only be paying to beta test, assuming the developers decide to ever actually address any of these issues. I highly recommend staying away from this piece of garbage.  If the developers actually do decide to attempt to fix any of these issues,Edit 19Aug2015 - It's been over a month since any communication regarding a patch that was promised two months ago.  Nothing has changed, the game is more or less unplayable and should be avoided at all costs.  Based on the lack of communication and action, it does not appear there are any actual active plans to fix this game any time soon.			"

The plot, writing, voice-acting and atmosphere deserve top notch framerates, graphics, and all-round flawless support. It makes me cringe to think that Arkham Origins might even be a better game than this one, and Rocksteady should therefore be ashamed of themselves.Arkham Asylum, as far as I can tell halfway through the Knight's story, is by far a superior game, in every aspect. Perhaps I should install that instead to be reminded of what it could've been.			"

I waited for this game for nearly 1 and a half year now and was so excited to play it on the midnight release. But as soon as I just went into the graphics options I said to myself: ""Alright this is going to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port."" I mean what the actual ♥♥♥♥? There are THREE graphics options THREE. Textures that strangely only go up to normal, level of detail and shadows. Then you got the V-Synch and FXAA switch, resolution and screen mode. That is the whole menu and this is just absolutley riddicoulous and a disgrace to all PC gamers in the year of 2015. And if that wasn't enough first they tease us with these 60fps Nvidia Gameworks trailers and then you tell me that I ♥♥♥♥ING have to deacitvate that stupid♥♥♥♥♥30fps lock by editing an .INI file. What the hell Rocksteady??? In addition the framerate is all over the place when you unlock the it. It is almost unplayable at times and there is this constant stutter and freezing while gliding and driving the Batmobil that makes it totally unenjoyable and takes away all the fun. (I am running an i7 4790k at 4Ghz, a GTX 970 and 16 gigs of RAM btw.) This is a prime example of a PC port done wrong in EVERY way.

												I can't, in good faith. Recommned this game. In its current state.The gist of my review. Is that it is not optimized for PC.Do not adhere to my opinion on if I thought it was fun or not. Since those factors are dependent on whether or not the game can run consistantly on PC. So the fun factor is not relevant. Since i did not have a true representation of what it should be, since it was lagging and stuttering.But It was fun when It played somewhat smoothly. Batmobile seems like it could be fun, just can't tell with the performance hit. The cutscenes kept dropping to 5 frames. So I missed some story elements. So can't comment on the quality of the story, nor did I play that much yet. The city does look dense and engaging. I want to play more, just can't. In this current state.I'm gonna try and edit the text file with all the settings in it. Remove some things. See if it helps with performance. Super bummed about this. I love Batman. I am willing to give the devs a second chance. I just hate having to wait for it.If or when they make changes. I will change my review to a positive one, with recommneding the game. I hope others follow my method, and not leave this game a bad review after they patch it with fixes.			"

												Update: It runs better now that it's re-released, but it still doesn't run well for an alarming number of people. Furthermore, WB's attempt to rectify the situation is beyond pathetic. If you're an Arkham fan who's be around since launch? Congrats. You get free copies of all the other Arkham games which you most definitely already own. Also, TF2 items. Eventually. Huzzah. Oh, and anyone who buys the game within a few weeks of the re-release gets the same. Final cherry on top of the crapcake? The launch patch was more concerned with getting support for the ridiculously priced DLC in the game so you could spend more money.Terrible form, WB. You just proved that you're worse than Ubisoft or EA. I still would not recommend spending any money on this turd, and I would be very hesistant to drop cash on other, better WB games like Mad Max or Shadow of Mordor. If you really have to play it, do what my buddy did and family share it from someone stupid enough to buy it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I don't think I've ever played a game with such a sharp distinction between the game itself and its technical performance. As a game, Batman: Arkham Knight is one of the best I've played. The cinematic presentation and story are second to none. The combat and stealth are fast and fluid in ways that the previous games only dreamed of. Both have tremendous complexity that provides a ton of options for dealing with foes above and beyond anything else in the genre.Of course, the big new addition is the Batmobile and it did not disappoint me. I have heard that some people really don't like it, so your mileage may vary, but I personally have been loving it. The combat is fast and loud, and the solid driving is made incredibly satisfying by some of the vroomiest engine noises you'll ever hear.So, why can't I recommend this game? As far as I can tell, I get fairly good performance compared to most people, and it still runs like garbage half the time. I'm running a Radeon R9 270x. Not a top of the line card, certainly. It's a bit slower than the 960. However, that's an Nvidia card which should clear the minimum requirements just fine anyway. Of course, the developers just happened to mention a few hours before release that AMD cards had substantially higher minimum requirements than Nvidia ones but there's nothing shady about that. No sir.Ironically, the game seems to have serious trouble loading stuff in irrespective of card manufacturer. Moving quickly, either in the Batmobile or just gliding around fast, will cause stuttering. Don't think you're safe with a brand new, top of the line card, either. Reports from all over indicate that the game very well may run terribly even with cards that would run anything else just fine.The follow-up question is, of course: Does the game look good enough to warrant this? Not even close. It does look great, certainly, but ""computer meltingly great""? No. Again, I've been fairly lucky to only get minor stuttering and relatively playable framerates, but there are still far too many moments that look a little too slideshow-esque to be comfortable. The game is incredible if you can get it to run, but there's absolutely no guarantee that it will actually run. On any system.As a finale note: the second this game gets patched into a working state, I will update this review. Batman: Arkham Knight has an amazing game buried deep down inside. There just happens to be no guarantee that you'll be able to play it.			"

												Sorry to make my first Steam review a negative one but I can't recommend this game at the moment. This a terrible PC version, it runs atrociously. I have a 760 gtx which is an older card but was able to run the Witcher 3 on a mix of high and ultra settings at 30 fps, this game will not run without serious microstutter and frame rate drops. The worst part is even the cutscenes look really bad, even worse than the main game as they stutter terribly and make it look like your playing the game off an old scratched cd.  There are almost no options in the graphics menu, the only choices you have are LOW and NORMAL. Thats it, no medium, no high, no ultra. 2 options for each catagory and about 5 catagories. This is simply unacceptable in 2015. You will notice I have almost no play time and its because it looks so sluggish I can't stand it. Unforunately for me I bought the game through a 3rd party website so I can't get a refund, so I have no choice but to hope it gets patched into a functional game. THis is really a shame becasue the game looks like it would be wonderful if not for the technical issues. Do NOT buy this until it gets fixed.			"

												Can't believe this.I preordered this game about a month ago, really hyped by trailers and also previous games, which run smoothly and without any problem. This instead is a COMPLETE MESS! I can run TW3 almost maxed out with my GTX 760 OC at 1080p and stable 30 fps, while I can't play Batman. I'm not overexaggerating. It's totally unplayable, even if I cut off all Nvidia stuff, it changes almost nothing. Stuttering everywhere, I can't even turn left and right with the camera coz it freezes completely.And ohThe Batmobile.I will only say, this ""[rb] to EVEN THE ODDS""*press rbGame Freezes for 2 minutes.Nice evening my dear bat.I had less than ONE fps while driving that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tank, it looked like a photo album with tons of blur and s**t.That was more like a powerpoint slideshow than a chasing section.Really, don't buy this, and if you did just get a refund.Look at my profile pic, that sums up really well my mood in this beautiful moment.Enjoy.Even the odds.

												I got this for free with my GTX 970 (Amazing card). Despite getting this for free I still feel annoyed at how they decide to release the game in this state. Doesn't anyone test anything anymore? I cannot hold a consistent frame rate and I am well over the recommended specs. The game is capped to 30fps which is just ridiculous for reasons I don't need to elaborate upon. You can remove the cap through editing the .ini file but it is ridiculous that they would expect us to do this ourselves, especially people who don't have the slightest clue on how to edit files. But it doesn't even matter if you remove the cap because the chances of you having a rig powerful enough to hold above 30 are very ♥♥♥♥ing slim as people with SLI 980Ti's are getting horrible frame rates. I can't even get past the first 30 minutes of the game because the performance is so horrible. I am convinced they capped the frame rate to hide the horrible performance, not that it worked very well.Also one of the newest and most hyped features of this game, the Batmobile, well it handles like a ♥♥♥♥ing shopping trolley, you know the ones with the wonky wheels and smell of♥♥♥♥♥♥at the back of Tescos. And good luck driving the thing, you will drop to 10fps and even lower when driving through the city and your game will just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥itself. The combat mode on the thing is just stupid and doesn't feel like it belongs in this game. Although I must admit it is funny driving around shooting a glorified spud cannon at people and watching them fall over, only to then shoot them while they are unconcious with a 60mm cannon and nothing happens....

If your a batman fan then this is for you as it will allow you to do all the things you wish you could do as batman.However i have to give this a negative review despite loving the game. The problem starts when it comes out of Rocksteady's hands and into the hands of the publisher and the people developing the PC port. I have no idea how or why they would take such a great game and completely ruin it. I wouldnt of taken any risks as this game was going to be huge but now rather than famous its the opposite and will have a infamous rep like ""remember how bad that batman game was on PC..."" Today is truely a sad day for batman fans and PC gamers.			"

Batman™: Arkham Knight 
A Screenshot of Batman™: Arkham Knight
By: Roomate Rawr




So much potential, squandered by a bad port. First of all, as everyone knows, there are big performance issues. Frequent bad FPS drops make it hard to play at times. There is NO SENSITIVITY SLIDER, and the default sensitivity is really high, which actually made me feel sick after about 20 minutes. The core controls are very bad in my opinion, which takes away from the immersion. For instance: Run, Evade, Glide, Grapple, AND Interact are all bound to ONE key. So even if you re-bind it, there is no fixing this. You'll find yourself pressing Spacebar way too often, and it starts to feel like Spacebar Simulator 2015. Also, re-binding doesn't always work. Even if you rebind a key, you'll find that often your preferred key doesn't work for certain things, and you have to use the original one anyway. Also, a lot of the default controls are just really weird. Hold Left Ctrl and press the Scroll Wheel to perform a takedown, for instance. It just feels like an all-around lazy port. They made the game for console, ported it to PC, and just threw it out for purchase. If you don't have a console, just don't bother. Not until it's fixed, and I really hope it is.			"

												After playing for around an hour now, I can say with ease that this game is all over the place. With a 30 fps lock and really awkward and sometimes ps2-looking graphics, it's no wonder this game is ""mostly negative"" with it not even 24 hours after its release. The game is horribly optimized, with it sometimes getting 70, then dropping down to 30. There are no sliders for AF, when there really needs to be one. The story is so far meh. The only things that look good to me are batman and the batmobile, that's it.Edit:WTF is this horrib thing? Am I back to my PS2 days?Also, don't even try and broadcast this to your friends. Both times it crashed my game and nearly crashed my pc. 10/10 would cry again.

												My PC exceeds the recommended system requirements.I will update this review later, once I've actually been able to play the game because so far, at the moment, the game wont even bloody start. The game starts tabbed out, and I can hear the sound running fine, then I tab in and it flickers and spazzes out like a donkey on acid. I also can't tab out of it again to close it, resulting in me having to resart my computer just to end the damn spazzfest. I then verified the game cache only to be told that ALL of the files for the game were missing, so now I have to download the whole bloody thing again, which took 6 hours to do the first time around. I freaking love Batman, and I love the Arkham games, but so far this PC port is pile of donkey turd.EDIT: After re-downloading the whole game, same problem. I've also noticed that it actually appears to be turning my screen on and off. Also the cache integrity thing is an actual problem that a lot of people have been having, so if you have this game DO NOT verify the integrity of the game cache as it will delete all of your game files. I have sent a ticket to  WB support demanding that they fix this completely unnaceptable mess of a port.EDIT: After finally getting back to my ticket  I was fed some rubbish by the WB support team claiming I did not meet the minimum requirements when my rig quite clearly exceeds the recommended requirements. They little advice that they offered was not useful in the slightest. I think I shall have to use Steam's refund system... *sigh*			"

												Got this game for ""free"" by purchasing a GTX 960 so I was able to actually play this game when it was delisted from the storefront. While I didn't have any performance issues, or at least none that left a lasting impression on my experience with the game I just can not recommend this game as a full price purchase. The story is engaging enough, and does feel like a complete end to Rocksteadys trilogy, but where it falls flat is the gameplay. Rocksteady trades out the interesting boss battles of Arkham City for tired drone battles and ""boss"" tank battles in the batmobile. The batmobile got way too much focus here, it's far more fun to glide around Gotham than it is to drive around it's (mainly) barren streets.Buy this when it's on sale for cheap if you truly feel you need some closure to Rocksteadys series but if not just replay the first two installments of this series.

												While for me the game is mostly playable since I have an i5 4690k and an overclocked GTX 980, the game only shows that I have 4009 mb of VRAM which is not true and to have all the settings maxed out at 1080p (GameWorks included) you need to have more than 4 GB of VRAMBesides that, what I have played  so far is a consistent 90 fps without any frame drops (I haven't played it since it re-released so I will edit if I encounter any problems) and I haven't seen any glitches so far but other people are reporting that they're having frame drops, even on an i5 4690k and a GTX 970. But without the glitches and frame drops the game on its own is great gameplay wise, is a bummer storywise. I won't spoil it for others but I will say that the Arkham Knight reveal is such a let down, the side missions are mostly boring but there is a couple I like, there's a side mission where you have to fight Firefly and the one where you learn about Azraels backstory is cool, but its still a let down. At least Catwoman offers you ""Special Hugging Time"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)So if I had to review this game honestly it would be a 6 out of 10, buy it when the Steam Winter Sale or Steam Summer Sale rolls around, but it's not worth $50. I got the game for free with my GTX 980.What a let down for the end of a great series.....			"

												This game isn't a masterpiece, but is is close to being one. This is had a lot of technical error upon its release; however, they have been resolved. Although, don't be shocked if you aren't able to run it at a stable fps if your gpu isn't at least as powerful as a 750ti. This is an exquisite game with impressive rain, smoke, and shadow effects. As long as you have a gtx 970 and an I5, you should be able to max it out. You might be able to get away with an I3, but I don't own one to test. Nonetheless, this game is a steal at its current price of only 30 dollars; I'd give the game a 7/10. I am removing 3 points for the sometimes clunky batmobile combat, Arkham Knight's character, and the fact that Gotham is abandoned once again.			"

It is still highly unoptimized and Warner Bros. obviously doesn't give a damn about people who didn't refund the game right after the first launch.All in all, it took them well over 4 months and the game still doesn't run that great and still has a lot of bugs and glitches. You should only buy it if it's on sale for a really low price. Otherwise, don't even bother.			"

												This game isn't a masterpiece, but is is close to being one. This is had a lot of technical error upon its release; however, they have been resolved. Although, don't be shocked if you aren't able to run it at a stable fps if your gpu isn't at least as powerful as a 750ti. This is an exquisite game with impressive rain, smoke, and shadow effects. As long as you have a gtx 970 and an I5, you should be able to max it out. You might be able to get away with an I3, but I don't own one to test. Nonetheless, this game is a steal at its current price of only 30 dollars; I'd give the game a 7/10. I am removing 3 points for the sometimes clunky batmobile combat, Arkham Knight's character, and the fact that Gotham is abandoned once again.			"

												Got this game for ""free"" by purchasing a GTX 960 so I was able to actually play this game when it was delisted from the storefront. While I didn't have any performance issues, or at least none that left a lasting impression on my experience with the game I just can not recommend this game as a full price purchase. The story is engaging enough, and does feel like a complete end to Rocksteadys trilogy, but where it falls flat is the gameplay. Rocksteady trades out the interesting boss battles of Arkham City for tired drone battles and ""boss"" tank battles in the batmobile. The batmobile got way too much focus here, it's far more fun to glide around Gotham than it is to drive around it's (mainly) barren streets.Buy this when it's on sale for cheap if you truly feel you need some closure to Rocksteadys series but if not just replay the first two installments of this series.

												While for me the game is mostly playable since I have an i5 4690k and an overclocked GTX 980, the game only shows that I have 4009 mb of VRAM which is not true and to have all the settings maxed out at 1080p (GameWorks included) you need to have more than 4 GB of VRAMBesides that, what I have played  so far is a consistent 90 fps without any frame drops (I haven't played it since it re-released so I will edit if I encounter any problems) and I haven't seen any glitches so far but other people are reporting that they're having frame drops, even on an i5 4690k and a GTX 970. But without the glitches and frame drops the game on its own is great gameplay wise, is a bummer storywise. I won't spoil it for others but I will say that the Arkham Knight reveal is such a let down, the side missions are mostly boring but there is a couple I like, there's a side mission where you have to fight Firefly and the one where you learn about Azraels backstory is cool, but its still a let down. At least Catwoman offers you ""Special Hugging Time"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)So if I had to review this game honestly it would be a 6 out of 10, buy it when the Steam Winter Sale or Steam Summer Sale rolls around, but it's not worth $50. I got the game for free with my GTX 980.What a let down for the end of a great series.....			"

Let me preface this by saying that I'm not recommending the game in its current state. When roughly a third of players can get the game running in the first place and an even smaller subset can have it working pretty well, there's a massive problem. WB is attempting to fix the problem, but the fix certainly hasn't been quick and current players get nothing for their troubles.That being said, I'm one of the lucky few that's been able to play this game with very few hiccups. There's a pretty big memory leak somewhere on Founder's Island that causes me to have to restart every 20 minutes or so, but that's the main problem I've been dealing with. I can also only play the game on low graphics settings, which is ridiculous. I don't have the greatest rig in the world, but I expected to be able to play with higher settings. I'll note my specs at the end of this review for anyone curious if they can play.As far as the gameplay itself is concerned, I actually like it a lot. Many people have complained that you're spending most of your time in the Batmobile, but it's about 50/50 for me and I like it that way. It's a nice change from previous games without completely changing everything. The actual fighting is the same as I've seen in Asylum and City, which is a big plus in my book. There are some new enemy types to keep it interesting, but they're not really common until the later parts of the game.The story itself isn't super spectacular and was very predictable in parts, but that's what I've grown to expect from these games. Anyone with knowledge of the lore will figure out what's happening pretty quickly, but the game is still very accessible to someone who's never picked up a comic book. I was very happy to see that Robin and Nightwing had decent roles in this one as compared to the previous games, which was actually what led me to get the game in the first place. I would've liked to see more with them, but it was better than nothing. It was also nice to see a lot of lesser-used villains. I admit, I'm not the most up-to-date on my lore, so a lot of the villains were new to me. It was a nice change from seeing characters like the Mad Hatter.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this game. I would not have paid full price for it (I got it free with a new video card), but it's something I probably would've picked up eventually anyway. Now if only WB could pick up the pace and patch it so everyone can enjoy it.For the curious, my specs:GPU: GTX 970CPU: Intel Core i5-3570K @ 3.4 GHzMemory: 8 GBOS: Windows 7 Home PremiumGame resolution: 1920 x 1200FPS: Usually 25-40; some cutscenes are 60+			"

												Just started a new game on a fresh install of the ""re-release"" version of Batman: Arkham Knight. I thought everything was going pretty good, 60 fps with slight dips, couple of cutscenes ran at 30 fps but I had v-sync on. Turned off v-sync, pretty stable 60 fps while I'm gliding around and fighting baddies. You can only play Batman the way you want for so long though. The inevitable Batmobile introduction is the first mission of the game. The moment it appears on screen, as if the game mechanic itself is sucking up enough processing power to run an entire second instance of any of the other Arkham games, my fps drops to 30-40. Now the game wants me to follow some high speed police chase around tight corners and turns in the ♥♥♥♥♥iest controlled vehicle of all time while throwing you constant ""slow motion"" esque stuttering. Luckily the chase lasts only a minute before you can get out of the damn thing. I go knock out another baddie, interrogate a soldier, knock his♥♥♥♥♥out too and then go back to being Bats. But then I see it. The Batmobile in all it's performance draining glory. Just looking at the ♥♥♥♥ing thing drops my fps to a stutering 36-42 fps range. Walking to the left or right until the Batmobile is just off screen renews my 60 fps lock. Walking up to it again to appreciate it's muddy texture and weird blurring effect again drops my frame rate to stuttering mess. It's really quite something. Not since the first release of this game have I so quickly reached for Alt+F4.On the plus side, I have successfully launched the game a handful of times to re-configure settings and run the benchmark tool and it has not yet crashed on me which is a great improvement from the original release, which would only launch about 50% of the time.1920 x 1200 @ 60 Hz LockAll High Settings w/ Motion Blur and Chromatic Abberation OffNVIDIA Gameworks Interactive Paper and Debris and Enhanced Rain EnabledWindows 10 Pro 64-biti7 3930K @ 4.2 GHzGTX 970 @ 1475 MHz16 GB DDR3 RAM @ 1600 MHzCrucial BX100 500 GB SSD			"

Not sure about shoehorning the Joker in, although I guess this is in lieu of an interesting baddie. Wondered why I kept being forced to use the Boringmobile when it's been so much fun to fly since 2009. Once the campaign was over my game suddenly broke. Every few minutes my FPS would drop to literally 0.5. This would last for about three minutes at a time. Stop kidding yourself and just play Asylum again, we all know it's the best one.			"

												First and foremost the publisher of this game did a terrible job communicating updates to SEVERE problems with the launch version of this game. I pre-ordered this game's digital deluxe version which included the season pass and some pre-order exclusive features. The game initially ran ok for me but then all of that changed with the 1st ""UPDATE"" WB released. This update fixed the same for some people and broke the game for many others. At this point in time they took the game off the store, disabled all DLC and pre-order content and released a statement every 30 days until finally releasing the DLC and a full ""PATCH"" last week. This patch didn't actually fix anything and the game is extremely broken. The now 4 month DLC was released finally but took less than 2 hours to complete it all. Hardly what I was expecting from a $30 season pass. WB has now finally admitted the game is broken and there are certain things they will never be able to fix. They are offering full refunds to anyone that has purchased the game. I just submitted for a full refund. Maybe in the future after this game has had a few more updates and it drops in price I'll give it another shot. Until then I'd avoid this game like the plague.			"

BUT the game offers something that the previous games lack ..beaty and details in all of the games content and the DLC's too offer all the suits from the movies and the batmobiles too ..all of them suits and cars have the same details from the movies so if you are a batman funboy this is a must..overall the game plays the same as the previous games aside with the batmobile where it offers its own gameplay!

												""Your computer is pretty old as it is, it's unlikey you'll play this with any kind of graphical prettiness,"" I said to myself as I bought this game. ""but hey, at least you'll be able to play it with low settings!""Wrong. With everything set to minimum (not something I recommend doing), you'll see that Batman still stutters and jiggles his way across Gotham without a care in the world.Minimum requirements mean nothing to this game. Clearly optimisation were as much a part of Rocksteady's plans as AMD was in Nvidia's.I know it's a damn fine game, but until it's (heavily) patched, keep your money. Your wallet will thank you for it.			"

												At the time of release, I can't really recommend this game.The game is fps locked to 30 fps (can be unlocked from ini configuration file), but the bigotry towards pc gaming doesn't stop there. Graphics options are very limited including anti-aliasing only having the option to turn it on or off.No option to turn off motion blur (which I ♥♥♥♥ing hate in games in general) or depth of field. You can turn these off from the ini configuration file but that just causes my game to crash instantly when the game enters main menu on startup.And performance is a total mess at the moment (i7-4770k @ 4,3ghz + Titan X SLi @ 4k resolution gets me performance of 15-70fps depending on the sli usage). Also the most atrocious offender is Batmobile, I rarely get over 25fps when driving around in the city (usually around 15-25fps).Otherwise the game has felt great, but the performance issues are currently ruining the game for many players.

												If you thought Assassin's Creed Unity was broken and Ubisoft had a PR disaster on their hands, then you haven't touched Batman Arkham Knight... Behold the greatest AAA PC game release disaster of all time! Pulled from the market at release for being a bigger mess than Lindsey Lohan after a 3 week bender, then released again months later with claims of being fixed... By fixed, they meant they made it worse! Then they made promises about this and that, and now they're saying ""I'm Sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that!""Moral of the story is, in the future, never buy anything from Warner Bros.

												It pains me to add to the wave of negative reviews to this game.I have played every single one of these Batman games since they've been released. This looks and feels like a next-gen Batman game but it's just a shame that's it's SO jumpy in it's game play.It is definitely playable if you can get past the jumpyness, the freeze for 2-10 secs then unfreeze and the feeling that your PC may blue screen at any given moment.I hear there was supposed to be a 3.5GB patch at release to address most of the issues, see below...http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/22/batman-arkham-knight-day-one-patch-confirmed-is-3-5gb/Can't see anywhere that it's been released, if it fixes majority of the problems this will become a positive review very quickly.

												Ugly, broken, inconsistent, and unreliable. These are not the words I expected to use when describing Arkham Knight ""the epic conclusion to the Arkham series"". Never have I seen such a bad port of a game with so much potential. Rocksteady have royally screwed over their PC players and I've officially lost all faith in the developer. I can only hope that they fix Arkham Knight in the days to come, but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't.At least we have Arkham Origins (definitely not something I ever thought I'd say).AFTER SEPTEMBER 3rd UPDATE:This patch has fixed technical issues for me, and I've managed to get a stable frame rate of 45-60fps on my 770. However the game is still poorly optimised. I shouldn't need 3GB of Vram to play with normal textures. Technical issues aside, this is an amazing game. Rocksteady have gone above and beyond to create a worthy sequel to their last Batman game, Arkham City. The scale of Gotham is now huge, with proper skycrapers and convenient ""enhaneced"" mobility across the city. Which basically means your grappel will throw you 100 metres into the air instead of 20 metres. That mobility also has the added feature of the Batmobile, which I regard as one of the coolest gameplay features in recent years. The Batmobile extends gameplay options beyond my expectations for the series. I've never had so much fun driving something. It's fast and easy to control with a seriously enjoyable tank mode for combat against new enemies.The story is spot on, as usual with the Arkham series. Full of plenty of Villains from previous games, and even some new ones. The twists and turns of Arkham Knight left me gripped and always wanting to know more. I found myself glued to the game for 3 hours straight (a serious amount of time for a single gaming session for me). Safe to say that the ending was shocking, and the best in the series yet.I also need to mention the incredible graphics. Although I've already stated the poor optimization, the game looks amazing. I've never seen more realistic rain effects, or even lighting for that matter. It captures a very specific atmosphere that only belongs in a Batman game. The sound design is also worth mentioning. Unlike the previous Arkham games, Arkham Knight has more robust sounds, and this really helps to bring the game to life. Which is great.Overall, I've really enjoyed this post patch Arkham Knight. It still has some minor optimisation issues, but is perfectly playable on a 2GB card. Now to conclude, the positives of this game are very strong, BUT I can't bring myself to forgive Rocksteady for the awful launch. We've received no form of compensation for playing the game 2 months after the official release. For that reason, my review will stay negative unless Rocksteady decide to have a change of heart.			"

												Seriously this is another FPS locked nightmare, if you can handle games locked at 30fps then this game is perfectly fine, If not then just don't even bother buying it.I can run this flawlessly on a gtx 980 i7-4790 @ 4.00GHz 16mb but if i try to overide game setting doing a .ini tweak it just flops like a soggy pancake.Shame because it was so promising, All pre orders from now on have gone the way of the Dodo for me.

I rarely play pc games, But this one turned out terrible so far, yes i unlocked the 30fps cap and set it to 60, and saved the file as 60fps. the game still stutters. Pros: did not get to paly enough to list them if they even existCons: I have an Asus Intel -i7, late 2014 model. and it at worst case scenario meets the recommended levels of requirements.  and exceeds the minimum levels. yet somehow the farthest i got in the game, was up to the part where you are in a diner in first person mode, at which point the game dropped to 5fps, and when i walk around it varies between 1-3, and all graphics settings are set to low.

												I loved this game sooo much. The combat is the same as the last games (combos actually seem easier to pull off), the story is intriguing, the side missions add a lot of exploration to the game, and the graphics are somewhat nice. However, as everyone has said by now, there are too many bugs and issues with the PC version of the game. Driving in the Batmobile just ruins the frame rate, and when you get the game, it's locked at 30fps. With a little changing of the coding, the frame rate can run however high you desire, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to hit however high you set it. Absolutely awful optimization on Rocksteady's part. Also, don't even try running the game on an AMD card, it won't end well at all.Intel Core i7-4790kGeForce GTX 97016 GB RAM^That won't keep it at a constant frame rate...yeah. :(			"

												Even ignoring the tech problems the game still isn't that good.  Someone at Rocksteady was banking on the audience loving the Batmobile because it shows up everywhere even when completely unnecessary.  For me it ruins the whole game.

Posted: April 16, 2016
												I finally got around to playing through this game after picking it up on sale with all the DLC for around thirty bucks. I've been a big fan of the Arkham games since the first one. I was both excited and hesitant to try out this title, given the...issues that existed with the PC release when it first came out. Kind of scary that a game was so bad they stopped selling it for a while, right?So let's talk about mechanics.Well, fortunately it seems that they have fixed their technical issues. I didn't have a single crash during my thirty-seven hour playthrough of this title, and the biggest glitch I had was an enemy clipping into the ground when I interrogated them for Riddler's secrets. That's it. Everything else ran smoothly the entire time.The mechanics have remained more or less the same since the first game, with simple additions and simplifications. Strike, counter, gadget. The enemies are essentially the same, normal thugs, brutes, shields, guns, stun sticks. Now the normal guys can do a charge attack that can't be countered with a right click, which makes them slightly more interesting. You can still counter the charge with a quick batarang, but if they're coming from off-screen, they can get too close and mess up a good combo pretty easily. The main addition to this game, enemy-wise, is the medic. They can wander around the battlefield and pick up enemies you've already knocked out, which can make predator encounters a lot more irritating. They can also give enemies a shock-buff that zaps you if you try to hit an enemy with it. A neat enough addition to the enemy roster.The big thing in this game, obviously, is the addition of the Batmobile. And yes, it is awesome. You feel powerful driving around in a tank, blasting holes in everything, and taking down enemies. Dudes on foot can be dealt with by running into them (which shocks them instead of smooshing them, which can be entertaining to watch) or blasting with your gun, which becomes nonlethal when an enemy enters the crosshairs. The tank battles are also a lot of fun, with you zipping around the battlefield lining up shots on enemy drones, which come in a few different flavours. Missile launchers, helicopters, and enemy tanks that range from small and weak to big scary robots that can only be approached from behind. The Batmobile handles well, feels fun, and has its own gadgets and boss battles.The riddler trophies and mechanics are also generally the same. Stand on switch, throw batarangs at targets, but of course there are new challenges based on your new gadgets, and trophies which require the car to handle. There were a few times I was briefly stumped while trying to solve a trophy, including one embarassing time where I spent around fifteen minutes flying remote batarangs around looking for an electrical current before remembering that I had a gun that literally shoots electricity. Not my finest moment.So that's mechanics talk, let's delve briefly into the story now. I'll start out spoiler-free and jump into spoilery stuff at the very end.The big bads this time around are Scarecrow, who has gotten creepier since we last saw him in the first game, and the mysterious Arkham Knight. I say mysterious, but his identity is honestly pretty obvious. If you read the comics, or watch any of the animated films, you know who it is. Regardless, even knowing his identity he makes a decent enough villain and counter to you as Batman. The story itself was decent enough, with you traversing the city, fighting dudes, and trying to put a stop to a number of nefarious plans. Won't go into detail for now, to keep it spoiler-free.A number of other big enemies crop up now and then, either part of the main story or having their own crime spree in Gotham. Even more are added in DLC, which works very well. If you have the DLC, you just need to be a certain percentage of the way through the main story, and the extra villains will appear with their own self-contained stories. Ra's al Ghul, Killer Croc, Mad Hatter, Mr. Freeze, they all pop up briefly to be beaten up and/or helped. Plus the villains in the base game, including Penguin, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn. Some big names were missing, like Bane and Deadshot, but ah well.The DLC's didn't really add all that much, just a few extra villain stories, and a few completely self-contained stories that are accessed directly through the starting menu. Not much content, mostly just extra-sized challenge maps with a small amount of story. They range from having only a few fights and/or predator encounters to having a solid half a dozen in Batgirl's story. Nothing big here, but I did enjoy playing as the various characters. Nightwing is as adorable and hilarious as always. No surprise there.Aight, spoiler time. Anything below is SPOILERS.So first off, the Arkham Knight is obviously Jason Todd, second and potentially most obnoxious of the Robins, though Damian Wayne puts up solid competition. It's hinted a few times throughout the story, but it's no big surprise. Most fans called it before the game came out, there was even a whole animated film about him coming back and fighting crime in a violent and murderous way. He was a good anti-Batman, though, as most of the villains are kind of old hat at this point.I think the big twist this time was the Joker stuff. Following the events of Arkham City, with Joker's death (no he apparently did not evade death, despite what many fan theories claimed after AC) and Batman being injected with the joker toxin. Turns out, even the vaunted Lazarus Pit was not enough to stop the disease, which infected Batman and a handful of others who managed to get the Joker's blood before or despite the warning and recall in AC when it was discovered. And this was my favourite part of the entire game. After getting blasted with Joker's fear gas in an early attempt to stop him, the virus manifests as your own personal Joker hallucination that sticks with you for the rest of the game. It is -awesome-. Having Mark Hamill in your head as your own personal Joker that only you can see and hear, to sass you for the rest of the story? I wasn't expecting any Joker at all in this game, and instead he's everywhere I look, full of one-liners and hilarious commentary. Absolutely fantastic.The other big story thing was Barbara Gordon's death. Psyyyych, in a twist that surprises nobody, she's not dead, it was just a fear gas hallucination. All in all, I think Barbara Gordon was my biggest issue with this game. Not her ersatz death or anything, no. My issue was that in this game she was romantically paired up with Tim Drake, even marrying him after the story events took place, referenced in the DLC. Tim Drake, Babs? Really? WAY TO BREAK NIGHTWING'S HEART.Aside from that, good game.			"

												I'm really glad I waited for a sale to buy this one. I played a lot of both Arkham Asylum and City on PS3 and was quite sad with the PC release of Arkham Knight. The game is playable now, getting a solid experience with a i5 4440/GTX 970, only with minor stuttering here and there when driving the batmobile, nothing as atrocious as the release state. So far I feel like the story is as good as previous Arkham games, but i feels like it's a lot darker, the storytelling so far is amazing and extremely immersive. The batmobile is a great new addition, although it might feel repetitive for some. The characters/enemies are better introduced and really feel like a real threat to Batman.It's not as innovative as the previous, the combat is basically the same, but the new gadgets and moves are incredible, the animations are top notch, which doesn't let it feel repetitive for those who played the previous games. Can't wait to see how the story will develop, Rocksteady really put they heart into it.TL:DR: Performance is extremely improved, not 30fps locked, great graphics costumization. incredible story and gameplay, really worth the sale price.

												I have had to delete 2, let me say that again, 2 F***ING 100% completed saves because the game decided I deserved a game-breaking bug.The first time: After completing the game 100% on Normal, I decided to play again on Story +. After reaching a certain point in the game, the camera bugged and reset Batman to GCPD. What made it worse: the area I needed to reach was blocked off by an invisible wall, making it impossible to get back in. Thus, I deleted my save.The second time: After getting to 76% game completion on Normal(by this, I mean 220-230 of all the riddles done, and practically 90% of sidequests finished with some more Story bits to go), I went to an area to finsih the riddles there so I wouldn't have to go back. As I entered the room, the game skipped to a mission way ahead of where I should have been in the story. I got to collect an upgrade and the game freezes. I restart, and it goes back to where I had to start that particular instance of the game. Having no other option, deleted my game AGAIN.			"

												Don't understand the hate this game gets, an excellent finale to the series. Same great gameplay mixed with the iconic Gotham city, an incredible storyline with equally as incredible side content. The Batmobile is a great addition but does feel forced upon you at times, this can be annoying but it isn't a big issue. I much prefer to take it to the challenge maps as I feel it fits more there. This game had a horrific start on steam but it is nowhere near how it used to be and should no longer be judged as such, this is now a mighty fine game with hardly any faults if not any.			"

												Don't let the horrendous PC release ruin this game for you. Now as of June 2016 the game is largely fixed and runs and looks beautiful. There are still occasional popins on objects in the distance even with maximum draw distance, but this is not a problem only this game suffers from. The story is fantastic, Scarecrow is a fantastic main villain and the theming of how his fear toxin affect Batman and the psychological effects of it are thrilling. For those of you worried about the fact that the Joker isn't in this game, you won't miss him, trust me. The only hitch in the story is the main twist is pretty heavy handed if you haven't read the comics and completely non-existant if you have. Without spoiling anything I will just say, there are no original characters in the Arkham games, the Arkham Knight is no exception. However the implimentation of the story of the Arkham Knight in relation to the rest of the canon is still beautifully handled and still has plenty of excellent drama. We all just know who he is already. The gameplay is over-all even better than Arkham City with more gadgets to play with, better and faster traversal on foot and flying as the Batman. Gliding around all of Gotham is fantastic and the city is beautiful from all angles with plenty of visual and audio cues for you to clearly know where missions are without map markers cluttering everything, a massive bonus for immersion. The batmobile is a welcome adiition in all ways but one. . . the Riddler has taken an interesting new profession since the last two games. Instead of building puzzles that challenge the player mentally now he just builds horrible race tracks for the batmobile. This is the most inexcusable shoe-horning of a new mechanic I think I have ever seen and since Rocksteady did such an amazing job of implementing the Riddler in past games that makes it even more inexcusable. You will hate these missions, especially if you want to 100% this game. A positive thing they added was that the motivation for beating the Riddler is more apparent than just the player's own boredom or the gamey goal of 100%. But this excellent motivation does not take away from how bad the missions are so no free pass Rocksteady. These two problems are the only thing holding this game back from being the best in the whole series. It is an excellent conclusion to the trilogy and if you enjoyed Asylum and City, I highly urge you to pick up Knight especially at its new reduced price.			"

												I am currently in the very large group of players that had bought this game 'after' release.   I didn't pre-order, but as i'd really enjoyed every other game in the series figured this one would be a sure bet winner in my game collection.   I was wrong.   The FPS cap, whilst the ini file tip was useful, did not improve the game enough to cure the stuttering and pauses, and what looked to me as though the game was not making use of the AMD gpu that i have installed which has 4gb of memory on board too.  No other game in my collection behaves like this, and i have many, so this game stands out by a mile as though it has been badly made.. its how it seems, just can't give it a thumbs up with so many negatives dragging it down.  I'll wait for a patch sure i will, but this does not change one simple fact.. that on average you can EXPECT a big proportion of gamers to have an AMD card, so to blindly ignore the manufacturer and just seemingly optimise for nvidia was a huge gamble that has brought this debacle to market.   I sincerly hope that the work by the software engineers turns this around because if it doesn't.. then this will be a customer lost.			"

												After an outcry of bad reviews, media and refunds. They realised they had to do something and couldn't get away with it, why? because they were losing money, not because they care. Firstly, before the game was out they said that people that bought a select GPU, GTX 970/980 etc, would get this game for free thanks to a promotional deal with Nvidia, as they often do for big upcoming titles, and that you would also get the pre-order bonus. Which they decided to change their minds on last second before the game was released ""Oh you don't get this pre-order bonus now, you have to pay for it"" not to mention that DLC, pre-order bonuses or anything of the like being announced/there before the main game is even released is ridiculous and is just content that could have been in the main game itself, but they realise it is something they can cut out and make money on. WB knew that the game was in a terrible state for PC months and months before the game was released, but once again, didn't care, it's the PC market. The PC PORT of the game was outsourced to Iron Galaxy Studios, a smaller game developer rather than the one that everyone thought was doing it, and was promoted as being the developer, Rocksteady. So the PC market got the worse end of the stick with a lack of attention.When the game first released, it was a huge mess, there were freezes, stuttering and all sorts of performance issues all over the place, I remember my game actually reaching up to 14GB of ram usage which is pretty ridiculous considering what the game is, and that was with an i7 4930k at 4.5Ghz and two Gtx 970's at 1.35Ghz, it was not about the computer not being able to handle the game, because it can handle a lot better than this, at some points it would be fine and I would be around or over 100 frames at 2560x1440p, even in fighting situations or running around, but then randomly it would decide it wants to run like crap, stutter, freeze and crash, or just play at below 30fps for no reason at all. Since the updates it has been a bit better, it doesn't use as much ram, around 6-8GB now most of the time, and the FPS drops seem to be mostly gone, and there is no more stuttering, freezing or crashing, but I am not getting as high as I use to. They made promises over and over that they would fix the game and admitted to what a mess it was after they started getting such bad reviews and losing money, they said they would fix SLI and continue to optimize the game, but after a while they said they ""can't"" fix everything and decided that they are not going to fix SLI because, well they don't care and it's not in their biggest interest money wise. Generally WB have behaved♥♥♥♥♥♥poor with this game, maybe if they didn't outsource to a smaller developer to handle the PC version of the game, most of these issues would not be a problem, but alas they are. On another note, I would say if you've played one WB game, then you can probably expect the others to be very similar. Batman, Mad Max, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor all feel pretty much the same to me, just different skins. The controls are nearly identical, the enemies are pretty much the same with different skins, and it has the same mindless ""side missions"" 'collect this' 'collect that' 'do this' 'do that' over and over. Even the maps seems pretty darn similar.I might finish this game eventually just because I own it and got it for free, but would I recommend it to anyone for them to buy it? no. Not unless it was on a 60-75%+ sale, even then I would feel somewhat bitter about supporting WB.			"

												it baffles me that after the first 2 great games rocksteady and warner bros manage to screw up the last 2 so badly. Don't get me wrong i love the series, i have been hyped for this game for ages but seriously? You spend 3 years on a game with the potential to be as awesome as city was the first time i played it, and you just waste it for the pc players. thank God this is the last game in the series, so you can't mess it up any more.

												The main story is very heavy on the grinding, and you need 100% completion to see the ""true"" ending.  Shut it off around the 45th riddler trophy, then found the true ending on Youtube.  I didn't think it was as good as the first two games, and you absolutely miss Paul Dini's writing.  The most touching parts are few and far between.  Much like Matrix Revolutions, the writers seemed completely lost as to how they were going to end the story, and it ended up a big mess.			"

Posted: November 3, 2016
												Batman: Arkham Knight... Oh boy.I held back on the game for over a year because of the problems it had on PC. I really despise the fact that we get more and more butchered ports since the PC, although being more difficult and more expensive to program a game for, offers many possibilities that consoles don't and vice versa. A game should therefore be ported in a way that it utilizes these by porting it properly. Arkham Knight was not ported propery to PC, that can be said without a doubt. I don't think I have to go over what happened, let's just recap the state of the game since Rocksteady stopped patching it a long time ago.Yes, it is playable now, so that's a plus. Yes, it doesn't crash often (2-3 times a playthrough for me) but on the other hand the other two Arkham games NEVER crashed for me. No, the problems with the FPS drops and the texture loading were never fully resolved. The game looks amazing but especially in the Batmobile and even on the best PCs it is possible that you get FPS drops and textures sometimes pop into sharpness only as you're standing right next to them. This is on a modern gaming rig that can run the Witcher 3 on Ultra without issues, I don't want to imagine how the game acts when you don't have the surplus of processing power.So there I was, prepared to never buy this game simply to make a point that I will not pay 29,99€ for a game which Rocksteady already stopped patching a long time ago. I will especially not pay 49,99€ for the game plus its season pass as some of the DLCs are very short and don't offer much.Then another provider offered a Steam Key Sale and I got the Premium Edition of Arkham Knight for 19,99€The game concludes the story from the previous games in a brilliant and epic fashion. You again get the feeling that you are the Batman, but this time things are different. Gotham City was evacuated and it is basically civil war in the streets. The police can barely keep themselves alive as the streets are filled with thugs and Militia since this time one of your adversaries brings his own paramilitary with him. New enemies, new attacks and all in all almost no encounter puts you against less than ten people. So again your new gadgets are welcome as they give you new ways to deal with the overwhelming enemies. Batman gets a new suit, for example, which gives him the ability to take out three (five if upgraded) enemies in quick succession at the beginning of a fight, but because there are so many of them that never feels overpowered.Probably the biggest addition, however, is the Batmobile. You can now fly over the rooftops or drive on the ground in your very own tank. There are parts where you will have to use it to fight against other tanks or solve puzzles as well. Personally, I didn't think that that got repetitive but I can see how others might feel that way since these parts can go on for a while.It's open world again and some of the sidequests, especially the ones against the Militia are a bit too much. You will take out A LOT of militia roadblocks, towers and mines in this game. All in all, however, it provides a good mix and most of the sidequests offer something interesting. And I'm not even talking about the hundreds of Riddler trophies!Arkham Knight is more grim than the other Arkham games because of the story and the setting. This is the night the Batman died after all. Unlikely alliances, lost friends, very disturbing screw-ups with the main character's mind and the general feeling that for the first time you might not be able to stop the bad guys is what makes this game so unique. It just has a certain epicness that keeps you longing for more.So, again a great game for everyone on console and a must-have for Batman fans. On PC however, you better make sure you have some spare processing power. Even then it is really difficult to recommend it for 49,99€ (the Premium Edition, because let's be honest, although the DLCs are weak we still want to play them) since Rocksteady basically decided to abandon the patching of this game while still bringing out new DLC. When on a sale this game is worth every penny, though.			"

												Game ran like utter poop on launch, averaging at around 30 fps and frequent drops to 15 fps. I could live with the 30 fps as I once was a console peasant, but the drops killed the game for me and remained untouched until just recently (16. March 2016). And I am happy to inform everybody who happens to read this review that the game is actually performing very, very well on my setup now. I went from the 30 fps to now lay at around 60 fps (Locked to 60 fps max in settings) stable with a occational drop to 48-52 fps when♥♥♥♥♥♥is just going bat crazy. Also no crashes.The game on it own when not taking the technical issues into the mix, is really good. The story is engaging, the banter from the villans is geniounly funny and Joker is totally killing it,♥♥♥♥♥♥if I could have had my own personal joker inside my mind I would have loved it. The graphics and the presentation overall is very nice, soundmix is top notch too. I personally loved the Batmobile missions but the camera can be a little wonky on it. So yeah I recommend the game but be cautious as some people are still experiencing crashes and god awful performance.Oh and ♥♥♥♥ the Riddler and his stupid trophies.My setup (for those interested):AMD FX-8350Nvidia GeForce 98016 GB rametc etc			"

												This game, while probably very good, is a slap in the face to every PC gamer out there.This came out as one of the worst, if not THE worst optimized-for-PC game ever 4 months ago. So bad, even, that they recalled the PC version until today, just so they could do what they should have done before releasing this travesty.Now, 4 months later, they re-release the game, promising sunshine and daisies, and this disaster of a port runs even WORSE than it did before the recall.Before the recall, I could actually play the game somewhat decently, after tweaking some config files. I was one of the few who could, miraculously. It still stuttered like a madman, textures would pop in and out randomly, and all that, but it was (borderline) playable.Now, however, the game refuses to start half the time. The other half, I have to tweak every graphical setting separately and reboot the game, praying it'll start up again. Otherwise, the game can and will crash. After setting up all the settings, the game looks absolutely horrendous, with practically every texture refusing to load in properly, and all I get instead, are blotted messes that have to pass for whatever it's supposed to be. Even on the highest settings, the textures simply refuse to load in properly. The game looks like a late PS2 title now. I'm not even kidding.Avoid this turd of a port AT ALL COSTS. Get the console version and enjoy the actual game.			"

												Batman Arkham Knight is the 4th and final title in the Batman Arkham franchise action-adventure series that follows Batman through Gotham. I had a lot of skepticism playing this game because all I read were bad reviews from every PC user bashing the game because of the horrible launch that had a plethora of glitches and technical issues with unoptimized performance problems. Locking FPS at 30, crashes, lack of rain shader/ambient occlusion/AA/antisotropic filtering etc etc. I've never myself experienced any of these issues albeit I did play this game a year and a half after it came to PC via port (Release date 6-23-15 vs my gameplay 3-13-17). I sport a pair of Nvidia 970 GTX Sli'd and I don't have a single issue playing the game.Graphics:The plus side of the high-spec card is that the graphics are amazing. It has a certain cinematic authenticity to it, a movie level gloss and immersion that takes you directly into the game and makes you feel like you're truly in Gotham. From the smallest dust particle to the sweeping bridges and skyscrapers, Gotham City truly feels alive. Every crack in the sidewalk, every fierce tattoo, each choppy wave, an craggy wrinkle tells a story that makes you want to know more. The people may not be as attractive as in previous installments, but they are more realistic, and they truly have character. The devs have introduced a photo mode, where you can pause the game and do a nearly 360-degree rotation to get just the perfect shot. Just use the Steam shortcut you set up (F12 default) to take screens, and it removes the ugly interface when you take the shot.Gameplay:They added the Batmobile! What a great addition to the series! Not only can you zoom around Gotham City like a boss, you can destroy half the city as you go! I had great fun running down criminals, blowing up cars, knocking down trees, fences, support pillars, you get the idea. It's basically a fast tank, and it acts like one. In addition to a new form of transportation, we have a great many quests, riddles, and fights to win using the Batmobile, which is not only a car, but a BATTLEmoblie! At the touch of a button we can transform it to a highly-maneuverable tank in order to destroy. We can even do Batmobile-assisted takedowns with Wayne's patented non-lethal rounds. ""It's like being punched in the chest by an angry gorilla!""As far as manuverability the game itself feels so much more fluid, totally engaging and immersing you into the gameplay from being able to fly and grapple across the world. It feels so big yet so small at the same time, it's a huge map but everything is accessable easily and quickly.Combat:As usual for the series, combat starts off deceptively easy, then amps up in difficulty as you progress. We have the new Fear Multi-takedown ability, which enables you to take out up to six enemies within seconds, provided that you can come upon the group by surprise. There are also points in the story where you can play two characters at once, and during this time you can do multi-character takedowns, one of the more fun parts of the combat system.Story:When the game started, I felt that the side missions were much more engrossing than the main storyline. I went through the game knowing not only exactly who our mystery assailant was, but why we were being attacked. Absolutely positive right up to the moment of the unmasking, and then, everything changed. That which had been mildly interesting was suddenly fascinating. My mental shift was profound, as far as such things go, and it pulled me into the story in ways I had never considered. Although one aspect of the story I had totally nailed, there were several real surprises throughout, something which I really cherish. A good story is something that I truly appreciate, but you have a good story with great gameplay. They also do a great job of including the rest of the villianous roster to the game that they previously left out.Pros:+ Amazing level of detail, environmentally and graphically on characters+ Each character is unique with the exception of the occasional thug+ Fluid gameplay+ Hours of exploration and more riddler quests to keep you engaged to 100%, doesn't feel too tedious though you may want to use a guide or youtube+ Introduced Batmobile and all the glory that comes with it+ Interesting and engaging plotCons:- A little repetitive to get the 100% ending- A little frustrating to get certain challenges done, but then again, it is a CHALLENGETL;DR9/10Great graphics, good plot, good combat. I had 0 issues with graphics. Tedious to get 100% ending but definitely doable. I'd say it was the best of the 4 in the Arkham series imo.			"

												I'll preface this review by saying I never had any performance issues. I know this game released with severe optimization problems for a lot of people. My review comes from just playing the game with minimal bugs and glitches.I loved the Arkham series. Arkham Asylum was so cool that it is literally the only game I completed 100%. Arkham City my first play through was lackluster, but probably because I just invested so much time into Asylum and was burnt out. My second play of City was amazing and it is an amazing game.Arkham Knight is boring. I bought it on the PC and could barely put any time into it. I saw it go on sale for the PS4 and decided to pick it up again. I was once again faced with the same issues. A game that had no interesting concepts. The developers really focused on the bat mobile. It is not fun to use, interesting or that different. It's basically drive around in a city that's way too small for a giant vehicle or enter combat mode and shoot AI tanks over and over again until you're done. There's no strategy to it. You don't feel like you're accomplishing anything other than it being over.The story lacks as well. It's hard to find any motivation for Batman except he's Batman and he has to stop the criminals. I felt like I just didn't care. I was just punching some dudes, then the robot Arkham Knight shows up and then I have to track him down too. That's really the entire story. There's no tension. The game looks great and ran well for me. I'm sure at this point, the game is running fine for most people. The only thing this game accomplished is that it made me want to go back and play the last two games. This game has no soul.			"

												NOTE: Running game on Interim patchStill a lot of hitching in game. Might be due to me running the game on an HDD, but the newest patch was supposed to fix that. Using Enhanced fog greatly decreases my frame rate as well as overall performance. I have all other settings on Max though. First Penguin mission is locked at 30 FPS for some reason (~10 hours into the game.) I would definitely wait until the final patch comes out before playing, unless you can deal with some hitching and a decent amount of frame rate fluxuations.

												What an absolute shame! This should be an incredible game with a story mechanic as mind blowing as the ""game reset"" in the first Arkham game that gives a rare glimpse into the relationship between The Joker and Batman.Unfortunately the numerous technical issues mean that it is virtually unplayable. The key signature thing that needs to be done right is fluid combat, if however the game freezes and judders evey few seconds it makes every epic scene a messy flip book of missed opportunity.Hopefully this will be fixed soon because this should have been Game of the Year material, but in it's current state I can't recommend this game.

												The gameplay is fun (even though I suck at it - that takes some doing), the visuals are gorgeous, the story is good.But the program itself remains unstable.  As I've progressed through the main story, I have more and more frequently encountered random crashes to my desktop - even though my frames-per-second remain steady, and no graphical anomalies occur.And if it's this bad on PC still, in December ... I shudder and weep to think how horrible it must have been at launch.Add to that the lackluster DLC - seriously, the much-lauded one with Harley Quinn is like, two areas to fight through.  No character development, no sandbox area to roam about in, just ... two areas, some goons to fight, then a boss fight.  ::yawn::  Red Hood's DLC was the same deal....I will not be quick to buy another WB-published PC game in the future.  I honestly regret having spent more than $20 or $30 USD on the game (Premium Edition, no less!).  I'm not even at 60%, and I'm already giving up on it due to all the crashes ...  ::sigh::			"

There is one simple question to WB: Why are you doing this? Didn't we support you enough in the previous games? Even when the PC release was month later than the console releases? Seriously: Why are you doing this? Your compensation is  an insult to every PC gamer out there: A free copy of the previous games? Are you serious? I refuse to believe that you didn't consider, that nearly everyone who bought Arkham Knight also bought the previous games? And now you say that we can return the game till the end of the year? C'mon that is an insult. To every PC gamer out there who is still considering buying these games after reading about the disaster:Please don't!			"

I get to the startup menus, I go to my save. I go to start the game and in the loading screen it crashes CRASHES! Crash after CrashI turn down the settings to minimum. Still crashes.I have a 4g GTX 970 // i7 4790k CPU  .... My rig is not weak to say the least, could be bettter.

												Even ignoring the major PC flaws, this was an underwhelming Batman experience. Boss battles were non existent and replaced by garbage tank sequences, even the battle with Deathstroke. Yes, that Deathstroke, the one with incredible martial arts skills and superhuman strength, is instead replaced with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batmobile fight, a copypaste of the atrocious Arkham Knight battle. The lack of challenge maps is extremely disappointing, but don't worry, soon a feature of the game that has been in every other game in the series will be paid DLC! Even then, the 2 character DLC's are 20 minutes at best, and even though they are advertised as ""Campaigns"", what they mean is that they are a bunch of sequenced challenge maps (that you cannot pick and choose). The story is mediocre at best, most likely due to the absence of Paul Dini, who has been a staple of the series (and Batman for that matter). The side missions are maybe the worst I have ever seen in a video game. Besides the cool Professor Pyg quest, and the Man-Bat jumpscare, they can be summed up in 5 words. Go here, trigger event, repeat, with seemingly no difference between each stage. Hush is relegated to a quicktime event, and firefly's is so laughably copy pasted on each stage of the mission you'll swear you are doing the same thing over again which-hint-YOU ARE. Another mission, featuring Deacon Blackfire, doesn't even try to hide it's low quality. You literally fight a group of enemies, and a cutscene triggers. I'm not joking. That's the end of the quest. The easter eggs Rocksteady has lovingly put into the game is a nice touch, but I find myself playing Origins more than this, not just because of the horrible framerate drops. It saddens me to see such a fantastic franchise end with a fizzle, rather than a well deserved bang.UPDATED AS OF APRIL 23RD:I returned to this game after many months of it sitting uninstalled in my library, and decided to give it another shot. Nothing could fix the poor story, but Rocksteady has added character select and fixed many of the performance issues. The riddler challenges were fun and sometimes difficult, but more riddles would have been appreciated. As for the DLC, I also bought the season pass for cheap. The character story packs are nothing more than strung together challenge maps, but A Matter of Family was surprisingly good and about 2 hours long. The skins and batmobiles are always welcome and fun to use. I am keeping the review to a not recommend, but  if you can get it for cheap, its a good game.			"

												First let me say that I have played every single arkham game and this one blows the rest of them out of the water! Sure it had a little bit of a rocky start but Rocksteady have been working vigorously to fix the multiple problems and have rewarded all of it's customers who didn't get a refund with ALL the prior titles for free. I mean how many of the Assassin's Creeds have had some graphical issues? And I don't see any of their customers receiving free games. Before Rocksteady came along all we had were Batman The Animated Series and various movie title games. This company revolutionised the super hero game and still no other company have been able to replicate the experience with any number of other characters at their disposal.You're in a sandbox world. Multiple missions, gadgets, and costumes. You have a weaponised car which can turn into a tank. You can glide so well it's almost like you're flying. The story is beautiful, the graphics are beautiful, and Rocksteady are still releasing new story dlc with different villians not included in the base game six months down the line!Don't believe what others tell you if you're a fan of comic books, sand box games, in depth story lines, racing round streets in a jet powered car, excellent combat and stealth. You'll love this game!			"

												When Batman: Arkham Knight first released, I was hesitant after hearing so many problems being shared with the game that I didn't install the game for a long period of time. Come time to play, I only experienced minor lagging and after a few updates there were no more issues in the performance department. Nevertheless, the wait was worth it! Batman: Arkham Knight has everything you could have asked for with the colossal and dark Gotham City. The Batmobile is integral to the majority of the game but I'd say it struck the balance between gliding and driving just right (besides, those combat sequences in Battle Mode are a lot of fun and break up travel, and never unnecessarily). The Gotham City Police Department is the Batman's rock in this game where Commissioner James Gordon's character steps into the spotlight the most out of the rest of his appearances in the series. Nods to the previous titles involving certain villains are made and some new faces will come as a surprise. The beginning is eerie and the graphics throughout the game are the best I've seen in a superhero game. Batman: Arkham Knight dwells on the the theme of fear and shows us that fear in many ways isn't a weakness at all. It's the only thing that keeps us wary, not weary. In being aware, we're not really afraid at all, not even of who we are and what we've come to be. Batman: Arkham Knight may not be the best superhero game but there's no reason not to settle for being one of the greatest in a series of great superhero games.			"

												The problems with this game go far beyond the technical BUT since thats alread a dead horse...OBVIOUSLY SPOILERS!So yes this is review #2, something was bothering me after the game ended.  As a batman fan of old it was a deja’vu if you will, and no it wasn’t Under the hood or death in the family.  I had seen this story before, where mere mention of this person’s name makes bat-fans shiver in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥chills as bat-nipples and bat-credit cards with bat butt-clenches in a neon black light lit Gotham city flood one’s mind.  AK has the same story to the sequel to Schumacher Batman and Robin. Batman Triumphant. THAT’S how uncreative the plot in this game is…well adding to the uncreatively of this game. Think I’m ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting? Google it.  The review will still be here.No? Ok FINE... its plot was going to be how batman is poisoned by scarecrow which causes him to see dead joker and a Harley who was looking revenge for the joker…sound familiar?  On top of the other issues both techinical and design pushed me from yes to no. The game is fun, well at first.  Hamill as the joker and Conroy as Batman is great and those two things I would say when the eventual “GOTY” edition comes out with all the DLCs and it’s a steam seasonal sale or franchise sale OR a 3rd party site is having it CHEAP then go for it but…leave your expectations low.See the problem is it’s “front-loaded”. What I mean by that is this, the combat is a bit more fluid as is grappling around the city, but then it becomes to get too much SSDD.  All the side missions are fun at first but they just end up being repeating the same things over and over be it rescuing fire fighters, chasing firefly, stopping two face, stopping weapon shipments, clearing militia stuff untill you hit 100%..every single one of them, IF they even bothered to put that much effort into it.It’s so bad that when the Arkham Knight is taken out of the equation he was barely in and Death Stroke is put in, it’s the same tank boss battle after the same “save Gotham from the militia that doesn’t even care or notice their boss ditched them”.  Two different characters with the same tank ""boss battle"".And those are the “deep” ones by comparison.  You then get hush and Deacon Blackfire.  Hush is “oh no something happened to Lucius fox. Push button. Watch small cut scene. ENTIRE most wanted finished.  Blackfire is so out of place it’s not even funny, it opens for me when batman was going to “confront” the scarecrow.  It made no sense and all it was, was, beat up these thugs you’ve spent the last 30+ hours beating up, push button entire most wanted line finished.  The AR challenges are more of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥you JUST did but for some leader board carrot on a stick.I was beginning to think that this was some meta game where the game was trying to drive you insane by repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result, while the joker tries to break batman.   The only relief from monotony are the Riddler challenges, yet putting a real ending behind 100% and needing 243 was a cheap way to add “depth” and pad the length of this very shallow game.  Remember 2015 games have to be epic in length and have an “open” world.I wouldn’t think much of the side quests If the main quest was at least original or even interesting or didn’t end in the dumbest most annoyingly anti-climactic convoluted “wat?” ending.  For one it’s Batman Triumphant with the “Under the hood” red herring tossed in.  Secondly that climax..or lack of. So bad. So stupid and out of place.  I’d say it’s ME3 worthy.Let’s take the Arkham Knight, title antagonist, he’s an interesting one.  See if you’re a batman fan and who wouldn’t be playing a batman game?  You know who he is, it’s as much as a spoiler as rewatching ESB in 2015 and being shocked Vader is Luke’s daddy.  So he must be a shocker for people who aren’t familiar with the DCU or DCAU but just the Arkham Universe or DCMU..but wait.  Jason Todd is never mentioned or seen in the Arkham-verse till now so there’s no history with the player. Not that it matters, again the title antagonist is nothing more than the strong man from 80’s movies.  He’s Sven-Ole Thorsen of Ahnold movies, he’s odd job to Goldfinger, he’s the strong guy in indy movies, they even hit the trope of “Revenge ruins the bosses plans”.....ick…  So just more “These are batman things!!” fan serviceThen after about the 80% mark THE TITLE ANTAGONIST…disappears…out right is gone from the game no rhyme or reason only to pop back up in a “steroids made me deaf” moment.  Why? So they can shoe horn in another batvillian.  DeathStroke.  Ahh boss battles…I’ll get to that if I have room…if not what others said.Ok so yes the Scarecrow is the main villain, and you eventually have the final showdown.  Now this ending shows that who ever wrote this has zero understanding who batman is outside of swiping a failed sequel.Batman, aside from lacking any sort of detective skills or common sense in this game, the man so paranoid he has a contingency to take out his friends, it’s said he has a contingency plans for his contingency plans.  The Scarecrow has Robin and Gordon and the world’s most paranoid detective has…NOTHING.  NOT A DAMN THING! He literally just gives up to the scarecrow, then the game gets stupid.  The climax of the game is in batman’s head as you play as the joker to free batman from the jokers influence…for some reason.Guess killing the Joker wasn’t such a good idea huh?  Then batman is the biggest fan service quote it was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥chill inducing locks up the joker in his own head. So he’s still in there? I don’t know?  ME3 made more sense.   So crane who outted Bruce as bats injects Bruce with toxin 3 times but it has zero effect because…I don’t know? He did grunt a lot so I'll assume he farted it out? He's just suddenly immune to the toxin thats been plaguing him the ENTIRE game. He poisons scarecrow and punches him.  Now you know how Deathstroke, manbat, firefly, hush and penguin you at least got to push a button..NOPE the MAN ANATGONIST at the END OF THE GAME is defeated in a cut scene.  Then, it’s batman’s life work to make sure the city can survive without him, that Gotham doesn’t need a batman..it’s a central ♥♥♥♥ing theme to the character like the detective skills and contingency plans.  SO on his last night, the night he gives up he must think Gotham doesn’t need him anymore, so the 100% ending.  Gotham is no better than it was on that fateful night at crime alley and yes Gotham still needs a batman.  Batman’s sacrifice of just laying down and dying..for nothing.What ties this into a well tightly coiled cat turd, this is batman’s last night, the end of the arkham series.  “how the batman died” you would THINK they’re pull out all the stops which at this point is obvious they didn’t.  So you’d figure AT LEAST they’re pull from his the A-LIST rogues gallery..you know Bane, Grundy, Croc, Ra’s, Freeze, Black Mask, Clayface, Calendar Man, Dead Shot, Zsasz, Falcone family, Rupert Thorne♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥get obscure with Etrigan.Nope you get the most wanted to be seen and highly dangerous rogues with such a grand history with the dark knight such as…firefly, pyg, blackfire.  The 60’s TV show had a better line up of villians. They even got lazy with the fan service..that right there should say volumes about this game.I was bordering on yes and no with my first review leaning towards yes then in retrospect the laziness just snapped like the end of ususal suspects and right over to the no.  I’d say this game is a solid 5/10..not a bat fan and could give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about batman 7/10.Actually 3/10 just because WB:I’s further response to the PC port is deafening silence.			"

												ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?!?!?! D:<WTF!?!?!?!?!?! Are you kidding me? One of the most anticipated games of the year for and I get broken with a broken game. It is the BATMAN franchise Rocksteady!!!! The game that milks you so much is the game you put in the most cheap outsources for PC Port!? This is how you repay loyal fans. I can't even get my game to start sometimes with the majority of the time I'm just being greeted by bunch of flashes and no game! I appreciate for doing the right thing to pull it out. Great job Rocksteady and WB, you're officially the worst game release ever. In Spanish we have a saying, ""Lo barato sale caro!"" Meaning that the cheap things always cost more!! And I bet you're feeling that right now! When you put love into a game, on all aspects and all consoles, you are greeted with a tenfold amount of love and success back. Finally, at least have the DECENCY to give an estimated time window of when a fix or a patch or something for the game already, just as you had the INDECENCY and rush to screw everybody with an awful game version.

												Would not recommend the PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight at all in it's current state. The PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight is essentially very much like a Steam Early Access game than a finalized product.I've experienced bugs, crashes, graphical issues, very low FPS rates and my computer is pretty high end:Intel Core i7 930 Bloomfield (quad core) CPU14 GB of RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 970The game also uses an insane amount of memory on my computer. I have everything closed except Steam and BAK has used around 10 GB of RAM.I'm waiting for Warner Brothers to fix the PC version and suspending sales for the main game is a step in the right direction.

												The big one to end the Arkham trilogy, and boy, is it a cluttered mess of a PC port, it sufferes a lot ever since release as so much as to actually remove digital and physical copies of the PC version. I don't blame the PC port team, they were only a team of 17 with four weeks deadline. That's incredibly small for a game of this size, especially a AAA game that has a big budget as this. Poorly optimized with bad choices from left to right, this is a game almost comparable to the PC port of Mortal Kombat X, yep, still hate you, Mortal Kombat X. PROS- When playable,  a VERY good game, with a more weavey kind of combat, its a little enjoyable to see Batman zip across left and right like an annoying fly beating people up in the blink of an eye. Especially with the introduction of FEAR take downs, allowing you to surprise the enemy and render them unconcious while they are too busy PANICKING THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT. - Starts with more gadgets than before at the start of the game, a little sad some of the old gadgets didn't make it back, but I guess you gotta weed some of the fun toys out. - Lays out a very interesting plot hook at the very start, it wants you reel you in and invest you in the game. And boy, is the story good so far.- All of the voice actors are consistent through the entire trilogy, save for two characters. But that's pretty good still, considering this trilogy has been six years in the making.- The Batmobile is finally drivable! While I would like less focus on the Batmobile, its nice to finally be able to drive it after being teased in the 2009 Arkham Asylum. Its a speedster car that has a tank mode built in, and the upgrade route for it is interesting, although unfortunately all tied down to one type of resource bar.- Has loads of backup saves! Loads! More games need to have this, and I'm not talking about just the cloud save system.- Puzzles are well designed, the detective mode is expanded even more, putting the replay footage of Arkham Origins to good use for Batman to solve the mystery of the missing turnip.- The best looking version of the game, however...CONS- Poorly optimized for the PC release, you can only really play this on high end machines. The framerate cap is set to 30, and it takes noticable dips down to even the single digit range when using such things like the Batmobile, or even grappling to high places. Only high end PCs can handle it at this point, and that's only because its forcing it through with the power of money. - If you have good ears, you'll notice a certain character sounds familiar, but has a different face...causing me to find out the identity of the major antagonist quite early on. Its even spoiled in the character bio section! If you really want to preserve the surprise factor when the game reveals it to you, try to remain ignorant as best as you can.- Season pass is poorly done, parts of it is already being handed off to be done by a different development team, and that is a bad thing. The main game itself is good enough as it is, so unless you're REALLY into Batman and are okay with not the same level of polish, then by all means, go for it.- Whoever made all these Riddler trophies to collect to watch the true ending is a horrible person. They're sadistic.Long story short, this game is fantastic, its well polished, looks beautiful...but definitely not worth picking up until they fix it the PC port. It is definitely the best version of the three availible, its just needs to be fixed to be playable. And with a game this big of a budget? Boy, I hope you didn't pre-order this, because you got♥♥♥♥♥♥heaped at you for $60, WB Games is notorious for pushing out poorly optimized PC games time and time again.			"

												Ok so i played this game for about 20 hours before writing this review. While the story of the game is great, and really well written the actually game play is barely stomachable. The screen freezes at some points are awful, and will freeze during cut scenes that are important to the story. I got this for free when I ordered my new graphics card, i wish i could return the game and get bad rats instead. 10/10 would rather blow up a cat with a microwave than play this game.			"

Disappointed	Frankly, I am disappointed with Arkham Knight, in comparison to City and Asylum, it does not reach expectations. Considering I AM a HUGE Batman fan, I'd expect Arkham Knight to exceed or be on par with City or Asylum, the story was decent and could still have been improved with some tweaks (Not spoiling anything). I'm going to delve into the pros and cons of the game. Pros:	-Decent Story-The BEST Batman/Joker Voice cast-The new fighting system (though I preffered AC's one)-The Open World is huge, leaving much room for exploration-Beautiful Graphics and a destructible environment (not recommended for those with a 2GB VRAM GPU as you    will face frame drops quite abit)-Ability to further upgrade the grapnel gun (WOO HOO)-Predator stuff is great as usual-New hacking mechanics Cons	-Overusage of the Batmobile, it gets boring most of the time-Tank battles (Heavy reliance on the Batmobile/Tank)-The Arkham Knight  Jason Todd... How original Rocksteady	-Deathstroke boss battle  A badass and he is A TANK BATTLE?!!?	-The writing is decent, but does not reach City or Asylum quality-The PC ♥♥♥♥♥torm that went down when it came out on PC-My GTX 760 2GB cannot run it without drops :( VERDICT:	How much would I rate it? 7.5/10Would I recommend this game? Yes I would, when it's on sale and if you have a good enough PCDo I like it? As a Batman Fan, I prefer City to this, but I think it would be a great game for the general consumer. It could have been improved in many ways thoughWhat are your thoughts? A great way to end the Arkham Trilogy, but it definitely did not blow my mind or anything like that JASON ♥♥♥♥ING TODD	 Thanks for reading!	 "

""This, is how it happened. This is how the Batman died.""Genre: Action Adventure, Open WorldYear of Release: 2015Developer: Rocksteady StudiosPresentationIt's no secret that Arkham Knight was nothing short of dumpster fire when it first launched on the PC. Months later after subsequent patching and fixes, does the game run any better? Well, yes, but not by much. The game still suffers from stuttering under certain settings and unless you have high-end hardware, this isn't going to be very playable for you. It's a shame considering the game looks exceptionally great, with detailed character models, lighting, and rain effects that surpass what was capable of its predecessors. Similarly, the sound in Arkham Knight is excellent, especially given the roar of the Batmobile, the sound of gunfire, the patter of Batman's cape as you glide through the wind, and the voice acting as well is superb, with Mark Hamill delivering one hell of a final performance as The Joker. The music is intense, brooding, and atmospheric (as it should be), as Nick Arundel and David Buckley return to compose for the Arkham series. Overall, in every department except for system performance, Arkham Knight delivers.StoryYou're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman. After years of plotting, the supervillain Scarecrow unleashes a widespread attack on all of Gotham City. Millions of Gotham citizens are deported as the police and Batman prepare to do battle with an army of supervillains. However, they must also confront a mysterious new villain-- the Arkham Knight, a militia commander with a connection to Batman's past, if they are to take back Gotham once and for all. The much hyped concluding story to the Arkham Trilogy is the one that ultimately falls the flatest in the whole series. It's definitely got it's moments, and some very clever plot points (such as Batman having visions of Joker) make for some really out of the box encounters, but none of it makes up for the remainder of the story. It goes from one meaningless conversation with Alfred to one meaningless encounter with drones again and again until some kind of plot twist occurs that doesn't have the impact it should. At the very end, I found myself describing the story for Arkham Knight wtih two words I thought I'd never say about an Arkham game: boring and forgettable.WorldArkham Knight finally gives you a fully-realized Gotham City, littered with detail and complexity unlike any city you've explored in any video game. Much of the city is fully destructable, which may make for fun Batmobile rampages, but doesn't help the fact that the city feels lifeless and empty. Having civillians on the streets and people walking about would have certainly made this less so. Arkham Knight features the most side content in any Arkham game yet, but sadly its arrangment of side content has devolved into an Ubisoft open world style of activities. Each activity repeats itself a certain number of times before you've completed all of that activity. Rarely do these activities feature the type of meaningful engagements found in the side content of previous Arkham games, and as a result, end up feeling repetitive and pointless. Thankfully there is some fun stuff to do, such as milita checkpoints and riddler trophies, but the rest feels like a wasted opportunity.GameplayArkham Origins, a spinoff of the Arkham series that was fairly successful, proved how well-realized and fun the gameplay forumla for the Arkham series can be after multiple games. In Arkham Knight, nearly every aspect of the pre-exisiting gameplay has been improved; the free-flow combat is faster and features more moves and abilities to take down an even wider range of enemy types; stealth encounters feature more challenging enemy types and more ways to take down enemies; gliding is faster and more maneuverable than before; there are several new and different gadgets than previously featured; and the level design is just about as great as it was before, albeit lacking ample puzzle variety that would require you to use all of your gadgets more often. For the most part, all of these gameplay elements feel pretty solid.However, there is one new feature in Arkham Knight that hurts the focus on these great gameplay elements and ultimately brings down the game: the Batmobile. While the induction of Batman's greatest gadget seems like a brilliant idea on paper, the execution in-game is kinda iffy. It's very fun to drive around in and tear through the streets of Gotham, though gliding remains to be a more effective method of traversal (and its more fun). The Batmobile weapon systems seem cool at first, but are fairly limited and make drone combat encounters frustratingly simple and boring. What makes it even worse is that the game forces you to use the Batmobile so much throughout the campaign that it overshadows the more refined gameplay aspects of Arkham Knight. The only aspect of the Batmobile I genuinely enjoyed was it's use for puzzles, though some might find these somewhat forced as well. In the end, your miliage with the Batmobile will vary, though I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as the game probably wanted me to.  Conclusion Batman: Arkham Knight is the biggest and most badass entry into the Arkham saga to date. As highly antipcated as this game was for concluding the Batman story, it ends on a dissapointing note, despite some very clever moments throughout the story. Gotham City is packed with detail and filled with things to do, but neither of these eclipse the lifeless feeling of the city nor the meaningless nature of the side content. Combat, stealth, gliding, puzzles, and level design have all been excellently-refined, but lose the focus they deserve to the Batmobile, which unnecessarily forces more mediocre gameplay upon you. While Arkham Knight may be the Batman game we neither deserved nor needed, it's still filled with many moments of greatness and stands as a fairly decent open-world game.. assuming you're PC can run it. Final Rating: 7/10 PC Version: 6/10Worth it if bought at 50% or cheaper.			"

												I was one of the few people that could run this game (still locked to 30 fps of course) at launch. I don't have a beast of a pc, so how I managed to get to over half the game without issuses is a mystery to me. But I decided to wait on THE patch, the patch that has been promised and teased for long time now. Well THE patch hasn't arrived yet, but the 3rd september patch managed to make the game freeze on launch for me! For crying out loud! What a disaster of a port. Uninstalling and not looking back until the inevitable GOTY (lol) version comes around. Just like with the last two batman games... "

												Much as I was looking forward to this game, got a new card to be able to run this on even, I can't find a reason to play at the moment.  The combat and environments are beautiful, at a distance, up close it all falls apart.  Eight graphical options does not a competent option list make, frame drops at high speeds and a 30FPS lock?  Sorry, I'll be playing Witcher 3 until this is fixed.  This is Unity level BS.I will state I am on the good edge of this, I haven't crashed yet but the frame drops and performance problems make it hard for me to enjoy the story Rocksteady crafted.  Glad I held off buying the Season Pass but maybe Rocksteady should include that for people who pre-ordered the game as a way of saying sorry.  Maybe I'm just being greedy but this shouldn't be happening in 2015.  Especially not with a AAA title costing $60 with a $40 Season Pass.			"

												Game mechanics seem to be okay, however I haven't been able to actually play since I cannot get my frame rate over 30FPS. This is due to the game not being optimized properly.

												If you think of this game as a Kickstarter/Early Access Simulator, then all of a sudden it's not so bad. Yeah, they over promised; yeah they under delivered; yeah they took our money - but isn't that part of the modern gaming experience?Downloading updates and paying for things that don't exist - that is all there is to gaming now.Perhaps they'll release the Arkham Knight Patch as DLC... that you have to preorder... via a subscription plan.

												It works smoothly, in between many immersion breaking crashes. I'm currenly BEYOND♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because I got about 50% of the way into the game before a bug prevented me from progressing. I tried restarting the game, I tried reverting a save, I seem to be the only one WITH the issue and now my save is ♥♥♥♥ed. I don't even want to play any more. If I was still elligible for a refund on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'd take it, but now I'm just $70 down the hole with a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I don't even want to bother replaying to get my save back.If you're still looking at getting this, a lot of the puzzle situations bank on you noticing something minute or somehow already knowing a game mechanic they haven't told you about. A lot of the reason I even made it through is that it starts giving you hints when you take awhile, and even then that's mostly for the game mechanic related stuff. My problem with this is that a lot of the time the game never asked me to do some of the things I needed to to solve the puzzle until right at that moment, and you pretty much have to wait around and feel stupid unless you know what the mechanics it has never had/let you use are. And even then, some of them dont have any helpful hints at all. In one instance I didn't see a small hole in the wall where a fan was in a heavily damaged hallway for a long time. I got lucky and noticed it just as I was getting almost annoyed enough to quit. It was not obvious, and the point of the puzzle wasn't really supposed to be to find that hole. If you're looking forward to the Batmobile, sometimes it's really fun and feels bad♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes it controls like♥♥♥♥♥out of nowhere with no real explanation and it loves to wrestle the camera away from you while you drive.The combat is the games strongest point, and it puts a much heavier emphasis on use of your gadgets than the previous games. On the downside, you have to pause the game to switch gadgets through some UI that felt clunky IMO.Some of the writing annoys me as well, like (spoiler alert) having to esentially kill Ra's Al Ghul, or get his daughter who asked for your help killed. Killing him doesn't seem like the Batman thing to do, and not killing him seems to punish you anyway, narrative-wise. THAT BEING SAID, the story is generally really good, although I don't want to play through half the ♥♥♥♥ing game again to fix my save.Some of the game is a little TOO clunky to be excusable. There are too many sections where it's not entirely obvious what you're even supposed to do. I would wonder if I needed gadgets, or I had to go do something else, but it was generally just ""even though you've followed the assassin's blood trail all the way here and it's entirely obvious whose it is, you need to go back and follow it again with your evidene scanner on"" or, just as annoying, ""you're not seeing how to progress because it's a grapple point at a weird angle above you that you have to be standing in an overlerly specific spot for before we'll let you use it, even WHEN you see it."" And I'll just point this out again: the game still crashes pretty commonly. Not enough to totally impede gameplay, but it ruined my immersion and will to play this more than once. Twice the crashes were even bad enough that I had to restart my computer just to get it usable again. They aren't why I'm fed up, but they're also there and VERY annoying. Here's to hoping that, by some miracle, more of this gets fixed. I love Batman and generally, the Arkham series. I know I don't want to bother trying to start from scratch now, though.			"

												I was one of the few people that could run this game (still locked to 30 fps of course) at launch. I don't have a beast of a pc, so how I managed to get to over half the game without issuses is a mystery to me. But I decided to wait on THE patch, the patch that has been promised and teased for long time now. Well THE patch hasn't arrived yet, but the 3rd september patch managed to make the game freeze on launch for me! For crying out loud! What a disaster of a port. Uninstalling and not looking back until the inevitable GOTY (lol) version comes around. Just like with the last two batman games... "

""This, is how it happened. This is how the Batman died.""Genre: Action Adventure, Open WorldYear of Release: 2015Developer: Rocksteady StudiosPresentationIt's no secret that Arkham Knight was nothing short of dumpster fire when it first launched on the PC. Months later after subsequent patching and fixes, does the game run any better? Well, yes, but not by much. The game still suffers from stuttering under certain settings and unless you have high-end hardware, this isn't going to be very playable for you. It's a shame considering the game looks exceptionally great, with detailed character models, lighting, and rain effects that surpass what was capable of its predecessors. Similarly, the sound in Arkham Knight is excellent, especially given the roar of the Batmobile, the sound of gunfire, the patter of Batman's cape as you glide through the wind, and the voice acting as well is superb, with Mark Hamill delivering one hell of a final performance as The Joker. The music is intense, brooding, and atmospheric (as it should be), as Nick Arundel and David Buckley return to compose for the Arkham series. Overall, in every department except for system performance, Arkham Knight delivers.StoryYou're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman. After years of plotting, the supervillain Scarecrow unleashes a widespread attack on all of Gotham City. Millions of Gotham citizens are deported as the police and Batman prepare to do battle with an army of supervillains. However, they must also confront a mysterious new villain-- the Arkham Knight, a militia commander with a connection to Batman's past, if they are to take back Gotham once and for all. The much hyped concluding story to the Arkham Trilogy is the one that ultimately falls the flatest in the whole series. It's definitely got it's moments, and some very clever plot points (such as Batman having visions of Joker) make for some really out of the box encounters, but none of it makes up for the remainder of the story. It goes from one meaningless conversation with Alfred to one meaningless encounter with drones again and again until some kind of plot twist occurs that doesn't have the impact it should. At the very end, I found myself describing the story for Arkham Knight wtih two words I thought I'd never say about an Arkham game: boring and forgettable.WorldArkham Knight finally gives you a fully-realized Gotham City, littered with detail and complexity unlike any city you've explored in any video game. Much of the city is fully destructable, which may make for fun Batmobile rampages, but doesn't help the fact that the city feels lifeless and empty. Having civillians on the streets and people walking about would have certainly made this less so. Arkham Knight features the most side content in any Arkham game yet, but sadly its arrangment of side content has devolved into an Ubisoft open world style of activities. Each activity repeats itself a certain number of times before you've completed all of that activity. Rarely do these activities feature the type of meaningful engagements found in the side content of previous Arkham games, and as a result, end up feeling repetitive and pointless. Thankfully there is some fun stuff to do, such as milita checkpoints and riddler trophies, but the rest feels like a wasted opportunity.GameplayArkham Origins, a spinoff of the Arkham series that was fairly successful, proved how well-realized and fun the gameplay forumla for the Arkham series can be after multiple games. In Arkham Knight, nearly every aspect of the pre-exisiting gameplay has been improved; the free-flow combat is faster and features more moves and abilities to take down an even wider range of enemy types; stealth encounters feature more challenging enemy types and more ways to take down enemies; gliding is faster and more maneuverable than before; there are several new and different gadgets than previously featured; and the level design is just about as great as it was before, albeit lacking ample puzzle variety that would require you to use all of your gadgets more often. For the most part, all of these gameplay elements feel pretty solid.However, there is one new feature in Arkham Knight that hurts the focus on these great gameplay elements and ultimately brings down the game: the Batmobile. While the induction of Batman's greatest gadget seems like a brilliant idea on paper, the execution in-game is kinda iffy. It's very fun to drive around in and tear through the streets of Gotham, though gliding remains to be a more effective method of traversal (and its more fun). The Batmobile weapon systems seem cool at first, but are fairly limited and make drone combat encounters frustratingly simple and boring. What makes it even worse is that the game forces you to use the Batmobile so much throughout the campaign that it overshadows the more refined gameplay aspects of Arkham Knight. The only aspect of the Batmobile I genuinely enjoyed was it's use for puzzles, though some might find these somewhat forced as well. In the end, your miliage with the Batmobile will vary, though I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as the game probably wanted me to.  Conclusion Batman: Arkham Knight is the biggest and most badass entry into the Arkham saga to date. As highly antipcated as this game was for concluding the Batman story, it ends on a dissapointing note, despite some very clever moments throughout the story. Gotham City is packed with detail and filled with things to do, but neither of these eclipse the lifeless feeling of the city nor the meaningless nature of the side content. Combat, stealth, gliding, puzzles, and level design have all been excellently-refined, but lose the focus they deserve to the Batmobile, which unnecessarily forces more mediocre gameplay upon you. While Arkham Knight may be the Batman game we neither deserved nor needed, it's still filled with many moments of greatness and stands as a fairly decent open-world game.. assuming you're PC can run it. Final Rating: 7/10 PC Version: 6/10Worth it if bought at 50% or cheaper.			"

NOTICE: This review will be updated in the future, pending updates and improvements to the game by the developer.I’ll keep this short and sweet.If you enjoyed the storylines in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, you’ll probably enjoy this game.  It concludes the basic storyline of the first two games, and ties Rocksteady’s trilogy back to WB Montreal’s Arkham Origins in some interesting ways. In all, you get a story that—on a speed run—will provide about 6-8 hours of entertainment, more like 18 if you take your time to enjoy all the side quests and see the sights. If, however, what you got enjoyment from was in playing the challenge mode. Spending hours perfecting combat challenges and mastering speedy predator take downs, or (in Arkham City) getting to play as your other favorite Batman characters?  Save your money. This game fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors in all but story mode. If you’re going to get this game I **strongly** urge you to wait for a game of the year edition, and wait for it to be on sale, perhaps during next year’s steam summer sale.- - - FURTHER DETAILS - - -Challenge mode has become a watered down, streamlined after thought that is injected into story-mode itself. So far as I can tell, Batman is the only playable character. Gone are the joys of spending hours replaying again and again for top scores with your favorite characters.  The Harley Quinn DLC “challenge maps” (and presumably the future DLCs for Redhood and Batgirl) are just a mix of two combat and two predator maps that must be played Campaign style; they are not individually selectable like in the traditional challenge mode of the previous games.The game’s launch has been fraught with bugs, graphical failures, and design choices that have left many of the dedicated Arkham playerbase baffled. It’s gorgeous, it sounds wonderful, and the voice acting is still topnotch, but Arkham Knight is little more than a glorified, interactive episode of Batman: The Animated Series, and the story isn’t even as strong as the tales delivered by that wonderful show.My Recommendation: Go to youtube and watch someone’s Let’s Play Arkham Knight, don’t waste your money on what is, unfortunately, another Third Installment Failure in the world of gaming. Graphics: 8/10The game is flawless in its appearance, however, the optimization is poor and certain design choices (like the inability to turn off motion blur) have caused players frequent and frustrating frame rate drops.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack is as atmospheric and engaging as ever, and the voice acting cast continue to deliver phenomenal performances bringing your favorite Gotham characters to life.Entertainment Value: 7/10The combat has been revamped and revised, smoother, more elaborate, and more detailed than ever. It’s a joy to get into a riotous brawl with 30 or 40 goons; however, the use of in-combat gadgets has become more complicated than ever before, and the game puts far too much emphasis on the Tankmobile, forcing you to wonder whether this is actually batman or a hopeful rebirth for 3DO’s classic BattleTanks game. Replayability: 2/10 If you like the story you might feel compelled to play through it again to pick up on anything you missed the first time, but challenge mode that made Arkham City worthy of 100+ hours of dedicated time has been gutted and replaced with something pathetically pale in comparison.

												DO NOT BUY AT THIS TIME.I bought the game on release expecting it to be as good as their previous titles. I ran in to a few issues withing the first few minutes of playing. I have an Nvidia Surround setup with 3 monitors spanning a resolution of 3800x1024Cons:- Bad aspect ration during cut scenes- inconsistent  cut scene vs pre-rendered intro- Dialog lag during rendered cut scenes- Lag / low framerate during fight scenes- Horrible handling of Batmobile- ALMOST NO SETTINGS FOR GRAPHICS. Everything needs to be changed in the config file from what I have been reading.I will play again tonight and update this list. So far I am very dissapointed. Feels like this is a port instead of an optimized game for the PC Platform. This game may be worth buying at a later time once these issues are fixed. But right now my gameplay looks nothing like the screenshots.			"

												Rockesteady's Batman Arkham Series is one of my favorite video game franchises of all time, and Arkham Knight being my favorite overall.I intially bought Batman Arkham Knight back in December of 2015, along with the Season Pass. I paid $90, which is crazy compared to the price now. Although it had its ups and downs, I loved the game. From the open Gotham City, to the unliked, but loved by me Batmobile Fights, and the connections to all the games before it. I have better graphics card now, but when I first played it, I could barely run it at normal settings due to my crappy graphics card, but somehow, I fell in love with the game, and even with the crappy hardware, I got 240% completion.Now due to the bad history, some people reading would say they would turn down this game, but its 2 years later! Rocksteady did adresses most of the bugs, and now it is running much smoother and in my opinion looks better than console graphics.I would recommend the game to you if you loved the series much as I do. If you wanna be the batman as the advertised, jump right in to this epic finale to Rocksteady's masterpiece of a series. #GivLov2BAKPC			"

												If you think of this game as a Kickstarter/Early Access Simulator, then all of a sudden it's not so bad. Yeah, they over promised; yeah they under delivered; yeah they took our money - but isn't that part of the modern gaming experience?Downloading updates and paying for things that don't exist - that is all there is to gaming now.Perhaps they'll release the Arkham Knight Patch as DLC... that you have to preorder... via a subscription plan.

												Rocksteady outsourced the port of this game to the lowest bidder. It runs like absolute garbage. I have a 980 and the game can barely maintain 30 fps. It's actually locked at 30 fps. The graphics options are Textures, Shadows and Resolution. That's it. It also has NVIDIA gameworks options but those gimmicky effects are so poorly optimized, you'll need a Titan or better to run them at 60FPS. What a piece of garbage for a port. I would request a refund if I hadn't of recieved this for free with my video card. Do not buy.			"

Story, Events, Characters, DLCs, Exapnsions, Arkham Episodes, Gameplay, Performance, Graphics, etc..Cons: Literally nothing! Maybe just the fact that it needs ~5GB of VRAM to play it smoothly, which is not a problem in my case since I have the GTX 1080.			"

Batman™: Arkham Knight Game ReviewBatman™: Arkham Knight brings the award-winning Arkham trilogy from Rocksteady Studios to its epic conclusion. Developed exclusively for New-Gen platforms, Batman: Arkham Knight introduces Rocksteady's uniquely designed version of the Batmobile. The highly anticipated addition of this legendary vehicle, combined with the acclaimed gameplay of the Arkham series, offers gamers the ultimate and complete Batman experience as they tear through the streets and soar across the skyline of the entirety of Gotham City. In this explosive finale, Batman faces the ultimate threat against the city that he is sworn to protect, as Scarecrow returns to unite the super criminals of Gotham and destroy the Batman forever. - Steam Store Page DescriptionThe game description describes this game perfectly. Since this is a review, i'm not inclined to say anything about more about the story than what the Steam Store Page description says, as that'd be a spoiler and you can find that out for yourself. In my personal opinion, the story is great although there are some flaws that you'll notice at least 1-2 hours into the story. This game is an 'Open World' game, which means you're placed into a large map with lots of different things to do and without a completely linear path for the storyline. While you're actually playing as Batman, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, with the FreeFlow combat system even further improved for a simple but very satisfying combat gameplay. Roaming around Gotham City too is very fun as you glide across the entire city with the help of your grappling hook, or even drive around the city in the Batmobile to reach your destination. However, I must say that while the Batmobile is absolutely amazing to use, as others say - it is overused, unfortunately. If you're into billion dollar cars that can convert into a tank and destroy almost anything in its path - this game is definitely for you!In terms of the graphics, there's very little choice for the main graphical options, although the game looks great even on the lowest settings, and looks brilliant on maximum settings. There isn't any options for 'Ultra' or 'Very High / Extra High' on any graphics option, however with this game I personally feel like there doesn't need to be.Graphics Options (Standard)- Display Mode (Windowed / Fullscreen / Borderless Window)- Resolution (e.g. 1920 x 1080)- V-Sync (On / Off / Adaptive)- Max FPS (30 / 60 / 90 / .ini tweak if you know how)- Texture Resolution (Low / Normal / High)- Shadow Quality (Low / Normal / High)- Level of Detail (Low / Normal / High)- Motion Blur (On / Off)- Anti-Aliasing (On / Off)- Chromatic Aberration (On / Off)- Film Grain (On / Off)- Texture Filtering (Trilinear / 2x / 4x / 8x / 16x)Graphics Options (NVIDIA GameWorks Settings)- Interactive Smoke / Fog (On / Off)- Interactive Paper Debris (On / Off)- Enhanced Rain (On / Off)- Enhanced Light Shafts (On / Off)Alongside these options, on the right to the settings list there is a 'Video Memory Usage' meter that will show how much VRAM your graphics card is using. So long as the bar is in the green, you'll be able to use those settings and know that VRAM stutter isn't going to occur. Although this doesn't mean that you'll reach your FPS target and doesn't mean that you definitely won't stutter, it's just one of many measures that you can use to factor out issues.All in all, give this game ago as it doesn't cost all that much for the base game anymore and most of the DLC doesn't add 'worth your money' additional story content. One DLC that I would recommend buying if you have the money spare is the 'Season of Infamy: Most Wanted Expansion' DLC. Below is a link that'll direct you to the Steam Store Page for that DLC:

Most games allow you to remove motion blur and DoF in the graphics menu but for this game I had to change the ini. The games is a DOWNGRADE from PS4 which is pethetic.

												A broken mess. Probably an outstanding video game hidden in there somewhere judging by the PS4 reviews but cannot get to it on the PC. Running an MSI GTX 960 GE and AMD FX8320 with 16gb Ram and the level of stuttering during gameplay is ridiculous. Run Witcher 3 here at pretty much full on with no issues. I actually expected better from Rocksteady but I guess that the pressure to meet their release deadline superseded any need for proper testing and engine refinement on the PC. Oh and add to that the missing Harley Quinn content. Utter joke.			"

												Great game when it's not crashing.  Seems like there's a new bug every time I play.  Performance isn't the worst on my rig surprisingly, but it's a newer x99 build with a gtx 970.  Unfortunately once I hit the mission where you try out a ""new"" bat-suit the game crashes every time I summon the batmobile.  Every.  Stinking.  Time.Happy to see that the game was pulled from the store until this thing gets fixed, but seriously how does a game this broken get released?Other thoughts --Had to manually edit the BmSystemSetttings.ini file just get 60fps ... hogwash-2560x1080 doesn't seem to be actually supported.  The resolution is recognized in the in-game settings but the image is stretched to fill the screen instead of including more content on the sides ... hogwash-Nvidia specfic effects absolutely destroy my framerate, what's the point of having them then ... hogwash-Ironically enough this is one of two games that came free with my 970 (the other being witcher 3)  It's a shame that both of these games are plagued with performance issues, though at least W3 is playable ... hogwash My SystemWindows 10 Pro Insider PreviewAsus x99-A/USB 3.1Intel Core i7-5820k 3.3ghz (stock clocks)32gb corsair vengeance DDR2400 (stock clocks)Asus Strix gtx970 (stock clocks)256 GB Samsung 850 Prostill not enough to run this damn game			"

												So after 6 hours of gameplay, I can say one thing.I just got lucky.Probably my configuration was the only configuration they tested this game on.Intel Core i7 4770KGeForce GTX 780 INNO3D16 GB RAMI capped those poorly written graphics options to max, except textures, just because game doesn`t allow it.A this moment it show stable 30 fps with minor glitches and freezes here and there, but nothing critical.As I understand if it wasn`t capped on 30 fps I would get even more.But what actually frustrates me is that graphics on PS4 is still looking much better.What`s up with that? To summarize, I want to repeat, I got lucky.It would be better to wait for a month or so.If they won`t fix it, pass along.At current state I will probably not recomend it.P.S. If you still didn`t play Witcher Wild Hunt, that would be a great game to spend some time in. "

												This is the worst port I've played in a long time.It is on Cryostasis levels of brokeness and I think most of you will know exactly what I mean by that.I can't bring myself to refund this just yet, but I will if this isn't patched within the time limit I have available. Unless I get a confirmation that it is in working order, I will be seeking a refund.The details:FX-8350 (recommended CPU) and 290X GPU (Sapphire vapour-x; best one on the market) and I'm getting sub-20FPS and it's like a comic book when I'm using the batmobile dragging it's feet like something from a pre-alpha. The benchmarking tool works better than the actual game itself does, which says much about this game.Gliding and grappling? Out of the question, frame rate dips below sea level. If you want to stay still and look at the pretty game, then putting on low setting just about allows you to do that, but that is it. It's a £35 screen saver, save your money.			"

												Within the Batman Arkham franchise this is the new lowest piont. The first tutorial mission is bugged. That should be enough to prove how less important the PC port is for the publisher. The Batmobile is funny, but is forced onto the player at nearly every point. Even Riddler quest, which used to be actual riddles in Arkham Asylum are now car races. Even within the main story line many levels can only be solved using the car, even so in Origin Batman already had the necessary tools to overcome most of the hurdles with his normal tools. It is quite apparent that the developers were out of ideas and just created some arbitrary obstacles for the player. The problem here is, that the car is terrible to control. Beside the car, the normal mouse+keyboard controls are extremly bad as well. The fights are ok, just like the other Batman games, but the detective mode and some mini games demand you move your mouse several meters to the right in order to proceed. YES, METERS, In order to fast-forward an security footage I had to move the lenght of my gamepad 12 times.Additionaly, the gameplay is simplified to the extrem. It is no longer possible to play Batman Arkham Knight, you are mostly watching it. Difficulties only origin by the terrible controls and the extrem infantilizing of the core gameplay aspects.Btw, I so far I didn't had any performance problems, but the graphic isn't better than the other Arkham games and way worse then Witcher3*Edit* I have to change something, this game isn't easy at all, in fact it is the hardest game I ever played. Not the beeing batman part of it, in fact that is terribly easy. defeat one guy silenty, than you can instant defeat 5 others. This means the sneaking part basicly doesnot exist. In the fighting parts they changed the quite smart autotargeting system in Batman 1-3 to a non working one, don't know why they just did. Realy hard are the Riddler races, the control of the care is so ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, if you make a mistake you have to finish the whole 2 minute course and can't restart, this leads to terrible frustration on my side and ultimativly to just deinstalling it.

												I've loved the arkham series for the longest time.I've played the first 2 on my 360,i'm not picky!I loved the mood,the amount of polish and ''gothic' design to it!I simply loved the mood,simple but fun story.So i bought arkham origins a while back to prepare for arkham knight!I freakin pre-ordered it and even got the ''premium'' edition.I couldn't wait,stayed up till 2 am for the game to unlock and play it.dropped it after 30 seconds and went angrily back to sleep.The benchmarks aren't locked yet,in-game you are capped at 30fps.I'm not picky but i've built a pc for this game and w3,W3 was kind of a dissapointment because of console parity.(believe it or not,i still love my xbox but i didn't waste money on my pc for nothing!I wanted a fantastic experience.THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER INCIDENT OF CONSOLE PARITY!I'm getting sick of this bull.why even make cross platform games if you're gonna chop the arm and leg of another contestant to make it as fast/great as the other.No logic whatsoever!I swear im switching to a ps4.WHAT IS THE POINT!PS4 not only has everything running perfectly and awesome effects,no texture pop-ins or slug people.Note im running a 4790k with a 980,on a SSD!The game looks like complete crap!And yes i know tweaking the .ini files will remove the cap but it's an obvious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move of rocksteady.WHY is there a benchmark if there's a 30 fps cap?obviously for console parity.They will probably remove the cap,resolved all the issues but they just screwed us over so that console users will feel like they got a sub-par product.AFTER they sold a ton of console copies they'll fix them yes.GREAT!i LOVED the arkham series and rocksteady!HELL even a huge batman fan but rocksteady is scum!I'm not even blaming iron galaxy,poor guys were trying to make a living.Port it in 2 months no less..THATS ridiculous and i can't believe it those guys actually got the game running in 2 months!THEY DESERVE A MEDAL.TL;DR:don't blame iron galaxy,burn rocksteady/WB for console parity.

I advise you not to enable the fps uncapper by editing the ini files, since the game can't actually handle going over 30 frames because it gets really buggy.I hope there is a patch up until then, but I'd advise to steer clear for now.

Oh, wait till it hits you...""Until now, I'd hoped it was a ruse, the desperate dying words of a madman grasping to retain any kind of hold. I'd hoped the words had been hollow, that the joke was over.How could I have let myself hope?The rain is falling, it looks the way I dreamed rain would look. Falling gracefully, dancing playfully as it glances off my cape. And as it pours, so do the shafts of light, breaking through from the heavens and cascading with promise of illumination, but what's the use if it doesn't help you see?The rain, the light, all it does is muddy the sky, impair my vision. There's no clarity here, just a dying city and the echoes of a madman's laughter.""You won't be able to see it coming, Bats.""He was right. I can't see. Everything is doused in a blur that smothers all detail. I wonder if I've occidentally ingested some of the Scarcrow's toxin. I run a blood analysis and it comes back clean.But this isn't clean. This isn't clear. This city is fractured, everything moves in slow motion, and that laugh wraps itself around my bones.""You shouldn't have hoped, Bats. You should know better than that.""I knew, damn his eyes I knew.He always did have the last laugh.			"

												A broken mess. Probably an outstanding video game hidden in there somewhere judging by the PS4 reviews but cannot get to it on the PC. Running an MSI GTX 960 GE and AMD FX8320 with 16gb Ram and the level of stuttering during gameplay is ridiculous. Run Witcher 3 here at pretty much full on with no issues. I actually expected better from Rocksteady but I guess that the pressure to meet their release deadline superseded any need for proper testing and engine refinement on the PC. Oh and add to that the missing Harley Quinn content. Utter joke.			"

												TLDR: Fun game, terrible optimization, hidden DRM, no AMD allowed, and AAA treating PC users as second-class citizens has gotten really old.Arkham Knight's gameplay itself is largely unchanged from Arkham City's. The new additions are fun more often than not (fear takedowns are cool, traversal's better than before, but the Batmobile's controls are sluggish and its ""tank mode"" just feels goofy), and the game thus far seems to be lacking the magical grapnel-proof surfaces of Arkham Origins. On any platform but the PC, it would probably be a solid buy if you were looking for more of what the Arkham series has provided.The game's design accomplishments, however, are overshadowed by some terrible technical failures. The framerate is locked at 30FPS, yet somehow manages to keep dipping below that even on newer Nvidia cards. Several small graphical effects are simply disabled on the PC version. Arkham Knight uses Nvidia's Gameworks, which means that AMD users can expect absolutely horrible performance until a few months' worth of patches are released. And WB apparently attached Denuvo DRM to the game without bothering to let anyone know. There's a reason why Steam has a mention on its store pages for third-party DRM, and bundling it without disclosure has utterly destroyed my consumer confidence with WB.			"

												In its current state, the game is all but unplayable. Despite meeting (exceeding) the recommended requirements, the performance is abysmal. Framerate slowdowns, stuttering, locking up on a single frame for 5-10 seconds are all very common and frequent. The Nvidia Gameready drivers do nothing to alleviate the issue.The graphical options are absurdly limited. Excluding the Nvidia Gameworks options (mostly useless), there are about a half dozen settings.Furthermore, the game purportedly has Denuvo ""anti-tampering"" software, essentially protection for DRM. This software (besides already being cracked) caused performance issues in numerous previous releases, including Dragon Age: Inquisition and Lords of the Fallen. Why Warner Brothers thought it was a good idea to cripple their biggest release of the year is beyond me.Yo dawg, we heard you like DRM so we put DRM on your DRM so you can screw over legitimate customers while you screw over legitimate customers.Other than that, the gameplay additions and plot are (as far as I could tell through the occasional slideshow) excellent. But it means nothing if the game is unplayable.Also, as a preorder customer, I did not receive the Harley Quinn DLC which is extremely disappointing as I will not be dropping forty bucks for a ""season pass"" that will likely largely consist of challenge levels, especially not if the performance issues aren't fixed post-haste.

Posted: June 25, 2015
												So, I'm going to write this review, hoping to give some honest thoughts. This review WILL be edited and changed as the game gets patched, but I'll keep some of my initial thoughts up too.Let me get this out of the way now. This game is unplayable for a large percentage of people. The graphics in it cause too many problems for too many people, from completely dropping to a frame a second at times. This game was NOT well optimized at all.I'm running a pretty good machine, though it's not the highest end by any means, it's certainly nothing to scoff at. 8 Core AMD processor, 8 GB ram, GTX680 Ti card, running from a HDD not SSD. I'd say 70% of the time, the game runs playable for me, 25% it's irritating, and 5% it's completely unacceptable. TO GET TO THIS POINT: All graphics settings are at the lowest, all effects, v sync, anti-aliasing, and more are all turned off, and I'm running it at 1280x800 resolution. That's all pretty unacceptable, considering every other game I run, I just set everything to maximum...That all being said, this game, even with everything turned off, looks stellar (when it's not dropping frames).As for the actual game itself! The story is really engaging and fun, I'm having a blast with it. New game mechanics are all working great for me, new gadgets are fun, and the Batmobile is such a delight to use. I'm really eager to see everything in this game, and I'll post a (spoiler free) in depth comment on the story and side missions when I've completed them.Current thoughts: Frustrated but enjoying it. 7/10.If they can fix the framedrops so it's more playable? likely a 9.5/10 (so far)TLDR: If you have a good machine AND don't mind playing this with graphics settings on bare minimum, I'd suggest giving it a go. If you can't get around those two issues, don't bother.Do I recommend this game? I'm not saying yes or no right now, but Steam is making me pick. For the majority of people? No, I can't recommend it. Yet.			"

												Being able to edit the .ini files helps .... but even when you do there are a slew of issues. Most troubling to me is that when I turn of motion blur, DOF etc. Detective mode no longer works correctly and becomes essentially useless. You get no ghost images of people (blue orange outlines etc). People just disappear. The reason this is such a big deal is that right now the DOF and motion blur are absolutely terrible. In addition many graphics things like batmans video on his glove dissapears. The city map can go completely black.So Terrible DOF and Motion Blur, Turn them off and you either crash or game no longer works correctly.No option for FoV.Textures look pretty bad.Game looks Nothing like the screenshots or demos.Theres other stuff but I'm feeling pretty bad about the 60$ dropped on this game. Maybe some patches will help but I really thought that RS would have release an awsome game on PC. It turns out that farmed out the task to some other company who apperantly have NO IDEA about the PC. I dont blame the other company .... I blame RS .... they either knew and did nothing, or didnt care enough to check.Do not buy this game now. Wait for the stupid thing to get fixed. etc etc.My sysyem in brief:GTX 980Win 7.1 64 (on SSD)16 GB Rami7-4790 3.6 Ghz			"

												As for now, it's pretty much unplayable if you're an amd user. If you're nvidia, it's either hit or miss. I wish you luck.I get my framerate drop to 10 as soon as the camera moves and the motion blur kicks in, otherwise i get 40+ fps (which still it's bad, considering i run it with amd 290x, a i5 4960 and 8 gb or ram and an ssd 850 pro). So yeah, if you have AMD AVOID THE GAME, atleast for now. Luckly they promised they are working to fix it, atleast that. Still if i were you i'd ask for a refund, so they will learn their lesson the hard way. I'm sick and tired of being bullied around by publishers and devs that don't give a single f@ck about us pc gamers.Ok a little update:After updating to the 15.6 beta drivers for my amd card, the fps drop due to the motion blur camera movement it's completely gone. Atleast that. There are still micro stutters all around but atleast now it's pretty much playable.I still don't recommend this game, and i suggest if you have problems like i had before the driver update, ask the refund. It's the only real way to let our voices be heard.			"

												I love this game. I really do. It's almost on par with Asylum and City - Rocksteady does that, but the game is an eyesore at the moment.I had to set all the settings to Low in order to make the constant stuttering somewhat bareble, but even then it'll randomly go from 30FPS, which is already an appalling frame rate, to 20, or 10, or worse.  I've never seen the like in any major release - this game's performance is anything but Rocksteady.Why do these issues exist, you ask? Well, because Warner Bros. outsourced development of this port to some no-name no-skill hack-fraud developer. Just... don't buy it. Not yet. Wait for release. And don't buy the DLC; make these corperate prats fix the game this time. I swear, if they say 'making DLC, so can't fix it' again, I'm going to... well, write a strongly worded objection letter to WB Games.It's not much, I know, but it's all I got.*sigh*			"

												Let me just say this, ♥♥♥♥ing horrible game. I build a new computer to play all the new upcoming games and this game was one of them. I got it for ""free"" with my GTX 970 but now am stuck with a useless game that I can't even run or return the code or even exchange it as there is no option what so ever. Would love to switch to the witcher rather than this garbage. After 3 crashes game finally runs and motion blur is just so much that when I move my mouse lightly most of the screen blurs and the camera moves 60 degrees. I am even running on lowest sens and got 400 DPI.			"

UPDATE: notice somthing , you see those sceenshots and videos on this page the game looks nothing like that even on the highest settings. the game is flat out missing effect like rain effest even with the nivdia rain effects turned on. pros:  ps4 controller support  some what cool con: everything else  the frame rate is all over the plance  my system is the nivdia ULTRA System Requirements    OS: Win 8.1 64-bit     Processor: Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz |    Memory: 8 GB RAM    Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980    Graphics Memory: 4 GB I HAVE THAT SYSTEM THE GAME STILL RUNS LIKE CRAP,			"

												I can't recommend this, I've played maybe 5 hours, first hour was config, reconfig, crash etc.It's fun, when it works, should it have been released in the state its in? NO. I'm running £1200 worth of graphics cards (2 x 980 ti), I can thrash any current game. This however, is a choppy mess.I booted it up, about 12:15am this morning, and It was locked at 30fps.. that was the first insult.I then spent the best part of an hour messing with it, thought whatever, I'll deal with it tomorrow. Following some helpful guides on steam, I dedicated one of my ti's to Physx, and now the game runs in a playable fashion, though I feel like its not reaching its potential. Maybe a few updates and some actual consideration into this blatant console port, will change my overall opinion of the game.TLDRBuy it in a month (I know, you shouldn't have to, but they dropped the ball on this release, they dropped it so hard its not even funny)			"

 In this episode Batman faces his greatest villain yet, incompetent game developers! Rocksteady has already begun finger pointing that although Arkham Knight is their game and they are willing to slap their label on it, they shouldn't be blamed for the torturous PC experience.  Instead PC gamers should target their scorn towards their ambiguous PC development partner, which Rocksteady has so bravely withheld official disclosure of, although some have speculated the culprits to be Iron Galaxy Studios.  Speculation [www.eurogamer.net]Originally posted by CODA, Rocksteady Community Manager: ""We are working closely with our external PC development partner to make sure these issues get resolved as quickly as possible.""   Source [community.wbgames.com]Does this stink of the same mistakes made by Gearbox when they outsourced the majority of their Aliens Colonial Marines; whose to say?At the moment it is unclear where the blame for this travesty of gaming software lies.  However Rocksteady has made it clear that they should not feel the hate for their latest title.  After all, they didn't even make it.			"

												Can I get a Refund even though I got this game free with a new Graphics card? >.> Yep I went there. I cannot recommend this game till it's fix as most of the people have been saying on an Nvidia 970 I can get 60fps most of the time but it will randomly just drop to 10-20 fps for no reason even when not moving, also I have crashed 7 times already at random times. I'm running Windows 10 10130 build but I doubt that is the issue because so many are having it on 8.1 and 7. I found for Nvidia any way turning off the Smoke will help with random fps drops but won't fix them just helps a lot.Update: 6/27/2015 They just came out with a tiny update to ""Fix"" issues with the game but all I have seen is they made it worse but it could just be me, I was able to play without too many random fps drops but now with this update it feels like they come way too often now, they said they fixed other things but these now more easy to notice spikes are just getting in the way to notice what they ""fixed""			"

												Ah, Batman, where to start?  I saw the beautiful little diner and the astonishing sight of people in a computer game just beginning their climb out of the Uncanny Valley, I looked upon the little details and the way the rain fell and I smiled at just how smoothly it was running.  Then it crashed.I started it again and, not having reached a checkpoint yet, went back in to that diner.  There was that waitress with the impressive facial animations, I read some some newspaper headlines and then it crashed.I started it again and went back to the diner and watched the television for a minute.  The detail was pretty amazing.  Then it crashed.I started it again and went back to that damned diner with that damned waitress and the damned newspaper headlines and all the rest of it and then it crashed.Then I tried to verify the integrity of the game cache using the tool Steam provides for doing that, it found more than four thousand corrupted files and deleted itself.In short; don't buy it unless you're really, really, weirdly in to games locking up and then deleting themselves with no warning and for no earthly reason.*Edited to fix spelling errors.

												After almost 5 months, has this game improved? Yes, but not by much. We finally have the graphics settings that we should've had in the first place, but the engine is still an unpolished mess. Stuttering is frequent and I can rarely get above 60 FPS even with shadows turned down at 1080p on a GTX 970, and despite all of Rocksteady's patches, the game has crashed multiple times on me for no reason on the latest version. Which doesn't make sense, considering the load on my GPU never goes above 70%, yet the game still drops frames for no reason. And what do we get for our troubles Rocksteady? Some TF2 items, a challenge pack, and the previous games that most of us already own? Come on, I expected better. Also, no multi-GPU support on a modern PC game is ridiculous.As for the game itself? The gameplay is good, the Batmobile is fun to use (although the number of drone sequence gets a bit repetetive towards the end), and story is also pretty good. Granted, it's not an original story and the Arkham Knight is exactly who you think it is if you're familiar with the Batman mythos, but it's still told in an enjoyable way with excellent voice acting.

												So,  After playing the game long enough to void my refund right i'm going to go ahead and just sum up my review into just a few words.As far as the game goes,  If you have the means, get it for PS4, or Xbox1.  The game is a brilliant end to the batman games and is extreamly well done.  That being said my enjoyment of the game was severly handycapped by the numerous problems with the PC version of the game, after editing the INI file preformance improved however the game suffers from massive pauses and deteriorating frame rate decreasing which causes the game's preformance to get worse over time which is fixed by restarting the game.So, is the game worth the money right now for pc users?   No, not untill these issues are fixed,			"

												Great game when it's not crashing.  Seems like there's a new bug every time I play.  Performance isn't the worst on my rig surprisingly, but it's a newer x99 build with a gtx 970.  Unfortunately once I hit the mission where you try out a ""new"" bat-suit the game crashes every time I summon the batmobile.  Every.  Stinking.  Time.Happy to see that the game was pulled from the store until this thing gets fixed, but seriously how does a game this broken get released?Other thoughts --Had to manually edit the BmSystemSetttings.ini file just get 60fps ... hogwash-2560x1080 doesn't seem to be actually supported.  The resolution is recognized in the in-game settings but the image is stretched to fill the screen instead of including more content on the sides ... hogwash-Nvidia specfic effects absolutely destroy my framerate, what's the point of having them then ... hogwash-Ironically enough this is one of two games that came free with my 970 (the other being witcher 3)  It's a shame that both of these games are plagued with performance issues, though at least W3 is playable ... hogwash My SystemWindows 10 Pro Insider PreviewAsus x99-A/USB 3.1Intel Core i7-5820k 3.3ghz (stock clocks)32gb corsair vengeance DDR2400 (stock clocks)Asus Strix gtx970 (stock clocks)256 GB Samsung 850 Prostill not enough to run this damn game			"

												So after 6 hours of gameplay, I can say one thing.I just got lucky.Probably my configuration was the only configuration they tested this game on.Intel Core i7 4770KGeForce GTX 780 INNO3D16 GB RAMI capped those poorly written graphics options to max, except textures, just because game doesn`t allow it.A this moment it show stable 30 fps with minor glitches and freezes here and there, but nothing critical.As I understand if it wasn`t capped on 30 fps I would get even more.But what actually frustrates me is that graphics on PS4 is still looking much better.What`s up with that? To summarize, I want to repeat, I got lucky.It would be better to wait for a month or so.If they won`t fix it, pass along.At current state I will probably not recomend it.P.S. If you still didn`t play Witcher Wild Hunt, that would be a great game to spend some time in. "

Unless I get a confirmation that it is in working order, I will be seeking a refund.The details:FX-8350 (recommended CPU) and 290X GPU (Sapphire vapour-x; best one on the market) and I'm getting sub-20FPS and it's like a comic book when I'm using the batmobile dragging it's feet like something from a pre-alpha. The benchmarking tool works better than the actual game itself does, which says much about this game.Gliding and grappling? Out of the question, frame rate dips below sea level. If you want to stay still and look at the pretty game, then putting on low setting just about allows you to do that, but that is it. It's a £35 screen saver, save your money.			"

												I've loved the arkham series for the longest time.I've played the first 2 on my 360,i'm not picky!I loved the mood,the amount of polish and ''gothic' design to it!I simply loved the mood,simple but fun story.So i bought arkham origins a while back to prepare for arkham knight!I freakin pre-ordered it and even got the ''premium'' edition.I couldn't wait,stayed up till 2 am for the game to unlock and play it.dropped it after 30 seconds and went angrily back to sleep.The benchmarks aren't locked yet,in-game you are capped at 30fps.I'm not picky but i've built a pc for this game and w3,W3 was kind of a dissapointment because of console parity.(believe it or not,i still love my xbox but i didn't waste money on my pc for nothing!I wanted a fantastic experience.THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER INCIDENT OF CONSOLE PARITY!I'm getting sick of this bull.why even make cross platform games if you're gonna chop the arm and leg of another contestant to make it as fast/great as the other.No logic whatsoever!I swear im switching to a ps4.WHAT IS THE POINT!PS4 not only has everything running perfectly and awesome effects,no texture pop-ins or slug people.Note im running a 4790k with a 980,on a SSD!The game looks like complete crap!And yes i know tweaking the .ini files will remove the cap but it's an obvious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move of rocksteady.WHY is there a benchmark if there's a 30 fps cap?obviously for console parity.They will probably remove the cap,resolved all the issues but they just screwed us over so that console users will feel like they got a sub-par product.AFTER they sold a ton of console copies they'll fix them yes.GREAT!i LOVED the arkham series and rocksteady!HELL even a huge batman fan but rocksteady is scum!I'm not even blaming iron galaxy,poor guys were trying to make a living.Port it in 2 months no less..THATS ridiculous and i can't believe it those guys actually got the game running in 2 months!THEY DESERVE A MEDAL.TL;DR:don't blame iron galaxy,burn rocksteady/WB for console parity.

That being said, if you're using an AMD 2xx family card, the 15.6 beta drivers actually make this game playable. There's still a fair amoumt of stuttering especially during cutscenes, but actual gameplay is far smoother.

												I like the story so far, about 2-3 hours in, it is really fun but the fps drops and low resolution will make the game not so fun. I advise you not to enable the fps uncapper by editing the ini files, since the game can't actually handle going over 30 frames because it gets really buggy.I hope there is a patch up until then, but I'd advise to steer clear for now.

												-- EDIT 29 June 2015--After having played the game for a while, I can say this, it is a very good game. The developers have put a lot of thought and effort into the game. It is really well made and lots of fun.But it is still a tumbs down from me. It will stay they way until the PC port is fixed.-- End EDIT --The game somehow manages to look worse and run worse than Arkham Origins.I have a  GTX970 and I get about 40 FPS. My machine can run Far Cry 4 and AC unity at ultra with ~ 60 fps.The best you can get is Medium Textures and 2xMSAA. Are you kidding me? And it still plays like crap!			"

												This is a godawful port. Optimization is practically nil and it's graphics menu is kind of a joke. That being said, if you're using an AMD 2xx family card, the 15.6 beta drivers actually make this game playable. There's still a fair amoumt of stuttering especially during cutscenes, but actual gameplay is far smoother. And honestly once you can actually play it's a great game, However, until they patch it and actually fix all the performance issues, I'd say give it a pass.			"

Posted: June 25, 2015
												Before I write my review, here's a summary of my current PC build, constructed only a month agoIntel i7 4790kNvidia GTX 980 (palit)8GB DDR 3 RamSSD hard driveWindows 8.1 (64-bit)I cannot currently recommend the game IF you're expecting a enhanced visual experience of the game based on your PC hardware. In preparation for Arkham Knight, I saved and scrimped and actually built my PC after the first official statement for minimum\recommended hardware requirements was released by Nvidia and Rocksteady. Like many PC gamers I wanted this version instead of PS4\XBox One as PC games usually have the benefit of enhanced graphics that can sometimes make for a more immersive experience, based on the game.Feeling rather confident, when I first ran the game, I turned the settings to 1920 x 1080 and put every setting available to the highest setting possible. Initially the excitement of a new Batman game, and the graphical update in the first few minutes actually allowed me to almost ignore the 30fps frame lock. But like several other consumers I had issues such as my screen freezing (but audio still going), and Batman moving so slow to hop into the Batmobile it looked like a scene from The Matrix, being paused, and then skipped! When I closed the game the first time, I also encountered errors, but fortunately my game files didn't delete themselves, unlike some other very unfortunate consumers. I'm using a wireless X Box 360 Chrome Series pad and i've had no issues with controls.Last night, I turned my settings down to 1680 x 1050, put other settings on Normal and turned every Gameworks setting off. And playing for another hour the experience was stable. This included multiple trips in the Batmobile. So in regards to continuing playing the game I could as of now, and probably will, but only because I don't want the story to be spoiled, by gamers online.Being an Rocksteady\Arkham series fan if you're able to play the game without any problems (the lucky few) it's shaping up to be a great conclusion to the Arkham series. The graphics are improved over Arkham City, there's new fighting animations and there's new gameplay mechanics that make you feel even more bada$$ as Batman. The reason why I can't recommend this is because the company has released information to consumers for the type of PC they need for a gaming experience that is good, and current problems with the game make the game very unplayable for some. If a higher end PC is having to downgrade graphical settings then it's truly unfortunate for consumers with mid-range PCs that should have no problems running the game. If this was in the 90's there'd be mobs of annoyed gamers outside of Electronics Botique demanding refunds, but alas the state of gaming means publishers\developers can release seemingly unfinished products and just send consumer patches down the line at a time that suits them.Personally, i'm very disappointed, and as this being my first AAA PC game downloaded on launch day I hope this isn't a trend. I received the base game for free via Nvidia, and therefore I won't neg it for the 30fps frame lock, the last minute change to recommended settings, or the removal of Harley Quinn DLC for Nvidia 9xx customers, however that is VERY BAD FORM. The company Rocksteady has given us some great gaming moments in the past and it's a shame this has happened. I don't believe they're entirely to blame for this however because based on their first Batman games they've put alot of effort into giving us a great interactive Batman experience.  My heart goes out to the people though with the recommended PC set ups who have put good money down for this game, and have received a somewhat broken product in return.In case you haven't recently read, the sales of Arkham Knight on Steam are being suspended, which hopefully means they'll be updating the game. More than likely as a Steam user you've got plenty of games to tide you over until this update happens, but if you're going to wait I suggest you avoid certain gaming sites and resist the temptation to watch on YouTube so the story isn't ruined for you.  I don't know if this review helps anyone make a decision, but it's just my opinion.Update: 64 hours in, i've now completed the game. I had some frame skip when using some weapons but apart from that, the game ran ok. The update will no only benefit me when using season pass stuff, or playing AR mission which I doubt i'll do. If your PC can play it, it is a great story to the Arkham series.			"

												So yeah the game play is awesome, I will not deny it that. But it is poorly optimized beyond a joke only five graphic option limited to what card you have. 970 btw only gets you normal textures and standard 30 fps unless you play around with the .ini files, its not a power house but it should hold 1080/60 on high easily, using 6-7 gigs of ram and all 3.5 gigs of the vram is just proof of how bad it was ported, not even witcher 3 cracked the 2 gigs of vram and that was all ultra 1080/60 never droping a single frame. The question about two types of drm steam being one and denuvo being the other, which I heard denuvo is a resoruce hog and could be the root cause of preformance issue. Wait until they fix it before you buy it unless poor performance does not make you mad, for shame warner brothers FOR SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												NVIDIA 980GTX,  Sandy Bridge i7,   16 gigs ram.The game wont load.... at all.... nothing.It did load twice. The 1st time I had the 30fps issue... fixed that and went back.   The game was awesome and looked great, I was getting between 80-130fps with everything maxed and using the NVIDIA control panel to max everything and force as much AA as I could (which I do with every game, even Witcher 3)  It was great for about 30 minutes. I exited the program and went back into it about 10 minutes later. As soon as it loaded it crashed to the desktop. It gave me some error about missing dlls, and I read that others had this issue and  one guy said go to Nvidia website and run the java app. I tried to do that, but had to reset again.  When I tried to load the game, it just sat there. Now ive reset several times, and whenever I load the game, I get nothing.   If i try to load it again,it says its already running, but windows doesnt recognise it as running and I have nothing on screen.  Until these major issues are fixed... wait to buy.			"

												Absolutely horrendous things happen when I try to launch this game. The screen cuts to black, and then begins cutting in and out, the picture alternating between pitch black and the Batman Arkham Knight opening credits - I see these in flashes (they look to be what they're supposed to be, based on all the shots I've seen in the press) - but I am unable to select anything, and even Task Manager becomes mired in this mess - if I try to end task, nothing happens, and I can only let the horror show resume. Subsequent tests reveal there's nothing wrong with my system (i7-4720, GTX 970 card) - so I'm pretty disappointed. Not that you can, now that it's been pulled - but DON'T buy this game for PC.			"

												Being able to edit the .ini files helps .... but even when you do there are a slew of issues. Most troubling to me is that when I turn of motion blur, DOF etc. Detective mode no longer works correctly and becomes essentially useless. You get no ghost images of people (blue orange outlines etc). People just disappear. The reason this is such a big deal is that right now the DOF and motion blur are absolutely terrible. In addition many graphics things like batmans video on his glove dissapears. The city map can go completely black.So Terrible DOF and Motion Blur, Turn them off and you either crash or game no longer works correctly.No option for FoV.Textures look pretty bad.Game looks Nothing like the screenshots or demos.Theres other stuff but I'm feeling pretty bad about the 60$ dropped on this game. Maybe some patches will help but I really thought that RS would have release an awsome game on PC. It turns out that farmed out the task to some other company who apperantly have NO IDEA about the PC. I dont blame the other company .... I blame RS .... they either knew and did nothing, or didnt care enough to check.Do not buy this game now. Wait for the stupid thing to get fixed. etc etc.My sysyem in brief:GTX 980Win 7.1 64 (on SSD)16 GB Rami7-4790 3.6 Ghz			"

Posted: June 25, 2015
												So, I'm going to write this review, hoping to give some honest thoughts. This review WILL be edited and changed as the game gets patched, but I'll keep some of my initial thoughts up too.Let me get this out of the way now. This game is unplayable for a large percentage of people. The graphics in it cause too many problems for too many people, from completely dropping to a frame a second at times. This game was NOT well optimized at all.I'm running a pretty good machine, though it's not the highest end by any means, it's certainly nothing to scoff at. 8 Core AMD processor, 8 GB ram, GTX680 Ti card, running from a HDD not SSD. I'd say 70% of the time, the game runs playable for me, 25% it's irritating, and 5% it's completely unacceptable. TO GET TO THIS POINT: All graphics settings are at the lowest, all effects, v sync, anti-aliasing, and more are all turned off, and I'm running it at 1280x800 resolution. That's all pretty unacceptable, considering every other game I run, I just set everything to maximum...That all being said, this game, even with everything turned off, looks stellar (when it's not dropping frames).As for the actual game itself! The story is really engaging and fun, I'm having a blast with it. New game mechanics are all working great for me, new gadgets are fun, and the Batmobile is such a delight to use. I'm really eager to see everything in this game, and I'll post a (spoiler free) in depth comment on the story and side missions when I've completed them.Current thoughts: Frustrated but enjoying it. 7/10.If they can fix the framedrops so it's more playable? likely a 9.5/10 (so far)TLDR: If you have a good machine AND don't mind playing this with graphics settings on bare minimum, I'd suggest giving it a go. If you can't get around those two issues, don't bother.Do I recommend this game? I'm not saying yes or no right now, but Steam is making me pick. For the majority of people? No, I can't recommend it. Yet.			"

Batman™: Arkham Knight Game ReviewBatman™: Arkham Knight brings the award-winning Arkham trilogy from Rocksteady Studios to its epic conclusion. Developed exclusively for New-Gen platforms, Batman: Arkham Knight introduces Rocksteady's uniquely designed version of the Batmobile. The highly anticipated addition of this legendary vehicle, combined with the acclaimed gameplay of the Arkham series, offers gamers the ultimate and complete Batman experience as they tear through the streets and soar across the skyline of the entirety of Gotham City. In this explosive finale, Batman faces the ultimate threat against the city that he is sworn to protect, as Scarecrow returns to unite the super criminals of Gotham and destroy the Batman forever. - Steam Store Page DescriptionThe game description describes this game perfectly. Since this is a review, i'm not inclined to say anything about more about the story than what the Steam Store Page description says, as that'd be a spoiler and you can find that out for yourself. In my personal opinion, the story is great although there are some flaws that you'll notice at least 1-2 hours into the story. This game is an 'Open World' game, which means you're placed into a large map with lots of different things to do and without a completely linear path for the storyline. While you're actually playing as Batman, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, with the FreeFlow combat system even further improved for a simple but very satisfying combat gameplay. Roaming around Gotham City too is very fun as you glide across the entire city with the help of your grappling hook, or even drive around the city in the Batmobile to reach your destination. However, I must say that while the Batmobile is absolutely amazing to use, as others say - it is overused, unfortunately. If you're into billion dollar cars that can convert into a tank and destroy almost anything in its path - this game is definitely for you!In terms of the graphics, there's very little choice for the main graphical options, although the game looks great even on the lowest settings, and looks brilliant on maximum settings. There isn't any options for 'Ultra' or 'Very High / Extra High' on any graphics option, however with this game I personally feel like there doesn't need to be.Graphics Options (Standard)- Display Mode (Windowed / Fullscreen / Borderless Window)- Resolution (e.g. 1920 x 1080)- V-Sync (On / Off / Adaptive)- Max FPS (30 / 60 / 90 / .ini tweak if you know how)- Texture Resolution (Low / Normal / High)- Shadow Quality (Low / Normal / High)- Level of Detail (Low / Normal / High)- Motion Blur (On / Off)- Anti-Aliasing (On / Off)- Chromatic Aberration (On / Off)- Film Grain (On / Off)- Texture Filtering (Trilinear / 2x / 4x / 8x / 16x)Graphics Options (NVIDIA GameWorks Settings)- Interactive Smoke / Fog (On / Off)- Interactive Paper Debris (On / Off)- Enhanced Rain (On / Off)- Enhanced Light Shafts (On / Off)Alongside these options, on the right to the settings list there is a 'Video Memory Usage' meter that will show how much VRAM your graphics card is using. So long as the bar is in the green, you'll be able to use those settings and know that VRAM stutter isn't going to occur. Although this doesn't mean that you'll reach your FPS target and doesn't mean that you definitely won't stutter, it's just one of many measures that you can use to factor out issues.All in all, give this game ago as it doesn't cost all that much for the base game anymore and most of the DLC doesn't add 'worth your money' additional story content. One DLC that I would recommend buying if you have the money spare is the 'Season of Infamy: Most Wanted Expansion' DLC. Below is a link that'll direct you to the Steam Store Page for that DLC:

												Let me just say this, ♥♥♥♥ing horrible game. I build a new computer to play all the new upcoming games and this game was one of them. I got it for ""free"" with my GTX 970 but now am stuck with a useless game that I can't even run or return the code or even exchange it as there is no option what so ever. Would love to switch to the witcher rather than this garbage. After 3 crashes game finally runs and motion blur is just so much that when I move my mouse lightly most of the screen blurs and the camera moves 60 degrees. I am even running on lowest sens and got 400 DPI.			"

UPDATE: notice somthing , you see those sceenshots and videos on this page the game looks nothing like that even on the highest settings. the game is flat out missing effect like rain effest even with the nivdia rain effects turned on. pros:  ps4 controller support  some what cool con: everything else  the frame rate is all over the plance  my system is the nivdia ULTRA System Requirements    OS: Win 8.1 64-bit     Processor: Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz |    Memory: 8 GB RAM    Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980    Graphics Memory: 4 GB I HAVE THAT SYSTEM THE GAME STILL RUNS LIKE CRAP,			"

												My PC specs: AMD FX6300 CPU - AMD r9 270x GPU - and the rest is just standard 8gb ram 1600mhz corsair and 1tb hdd and a ssd drive for windows. I do realise my PC compared to other people having these problems ain't quite as good but, let's compare my GPU with a PS4 GPU, PS4 (not 100% on this but I think I'm right...) it's equivalent is meant to be a 7850, my card excels that maybe not by miles but it's definely better since I'm able to run alot of games up to this games release such as witcher 3 crysis etc, on quite high settings. Now let's compare my CPU, if you check online im 100% sure it says the PS4 CPU was intended for laptop technology and only has 2.4ghz, mine although it doesn't make it amazing just because of the amount has 6! Let me just say that one more time 6 cores and a whole 1ghz more speed than that CPU. I was running far cry 3 when it was popular at the time at ULTRA max settings and it still holds it's own to this day, apart from multi tasking which it lacks on slightly my CPU craps on a PS4 CPU in every way. I'm still genna say this one more time before trolls start saying things like oh but your PC isn't even high end blah blah, I'M FULLY AWARE believe me. My purpose of this review is just the fact that a PS4 can run games like batman at higher res than me and probably the standard high setting on a pc maybe medium not quite sure, but my PC can't do that. I've even downscaled my res and turned all settings lowest I could without NVIDIA enhancements and still get terrible frames while driving the batmobile and even flying in the air. I've waited over a whole year for this game since it was announced and this is what they give to me? I mean I know consoles probably do out sell PC and it's more popular but ROCKSTEADY, yes, you ROCKSTEADY you designed and developed this game and can't port it to the PC properly for us. All the mainstream companies are doing it to us, apart from CDprojekt whatever they're called (witcher 3 developers). I just have no words.All that being said my actual opinion on the game is that the combat is the most satisfying experience I've ever had when you first get the suit sent to you and take out the room like batman should be able to and I really feel like I am batman in the game while doing this. I'm just majorly disappointed by this game and they can't say they don't care because we get sales from console anyways, this will hurt them because gaming nowadays its mostly about recommendations and trust and I dont recommend this game to people for PC right now. So as I'm writing this review now and not in a future time I'm genna have to say NO and thumbs down. Wait for a price drop and maybe think about trying out another game as ROCKSTEADY don't deserve full payment for this game and support with this kinda treatment to their fans!			"

												The game they launched treated my R9 280 like it was built-in graphics. Horrendous performance (including single digit framerates in the Batmobile), even when dialing back settings and resolution. Thankfully when the game was pulled from Steam, the store I had bought it from (GreenMan Gaming) started offering refunds. So hopefully my refund will go through in the next few hours, and I can spend the £36.71 I had spent on the ""Premium Version"" on a game like GTA5, which got the care it deserved.			"

												The annoying part about video games is that we cannot just focus on the content of the game itself. Instead we also have to concern ourselves with the technical aspects as well. If we were reviewing Arkham Knight purely on the content of the game it'd be rated rather highly -- in fact it is on consoles where there are fewer technical problems. However in video games we cannot ignore the technical aspects of the game -- the performance, responsiveness and port quality are all extremely relevant to the enjoyment of a game. To put it frankly and succinctly it's just not very good. I am running on a R9 280x with an old but still trustworthy Intel core i7 950 with 24gb of RAM on Windows 10. On foot I achieve around 60fps which on ""normal"" settings which is fine. However when it comes to driving around in the batmobile (which the game expects you to do several times) I can get dips as low as 35fps without any destruction or much happening. It's not just limited to me either which makes it all the more sad. When they announced that the September patch was just an interim I expected that a later patch would further address the performance issues. The interim patch was a good start to making this a good PC port. Instead with just that it's 4 months late and barely better than a crap port. Sure it has borderless options but that's pretty much it. Their SMAA implementation also has some weird things about it. http://i.imgur.com/2PAn0aR.jpg It's just not worth recommending in my opinion based on my performance. The ""gift"" they bestowed of the backlog of Batman Arkham games is worth very little to me as I was a fan of Batman Arkham series because of those games so I own them already (except blackgate which is crap). TF2 items don't interest me either bar selling them for Steambux. Sigh I just want to play games.			"

												OK, this is bad......at least for me, and apparently many others too. 3.4, GTX 970 4, 16 gigs, Win 7 64. I'm having stuttering that makes this literally unplayable. 2 seconds of single digit framerates, it'll then pause (and I'm not exaggerating--for 4-5 seconds), then resume. Then 3 seconds later, another 2 second freeze. The graphics are not even near the trailer, in fact I don't think this really looks all that far removed from City at its best. There's barely any graphical customization options. Aside from rain, gameworks is greyed out. Texture highest setting is ""normal"". Framerate capped at 30 that only an .ini tweak will fix.W.T.F.??This is either a) the laziest or b) most incompetent PC effort that I've ever seen. The Witcher 3 (which I thought was bad in its technical issues) is a dream in comparison. I'm requesting a refund and getting the PS4 game. Rocksteady will get none of my money for the PC version until it's actualy, y'know.....functional. That said, I've no problem with the game itself. I LOVE the 'mobile in all respects, even the combat, but I seem to be alone on this. From what I've played it was pure Batman Rocksteady bliss, but after I left the a certain area (about 30 minutes in) the game became nigh unplayable. I have to say I'm quite disappointed Rocksteady would allow it to be released like this. I used to think of them as one to take pride in polish, now I don't know how to feel.Developers need to held accountable for believing they can release games like this and get away with it. You cannot release software in this state. Inexcusable.			"

												It is so broken! I couldn't play it at all!!!! Okay now I will be serious.The game itself is great. Amazing even and a game of the year contender. Even against the likes of Fallout 4 and Witcher 3. If this game ran smooth as butter? Well you would have one of the best games of all time on your hands.So yes the game is The Dark Knight of video games.However the port? Plays like Batman and Robin. I have a Titan X and it plays like I am on Grandma's laptop she bought at Wal-mart on Black Friday five years ago.It is horrible, especially when driving the Batmobile. The fact I have put 38.4 hours in (as of today) and can still play through this sewer of a port should tell you how great the game under this turd is, I also couldn't get a refund I bought it on Amazon. If Rocksteady fixes the game (and it seems like they will) PC gamers are in for an amazing treat. Then I would reccomend it and should be considered for game of the year. Remember the Witcher 3 launched with some preformance issues as well. Nothing as bad as this poop stain from taco truck day but there was some issues.Fallout 4 we all know who makes that game, and can count on some bugs/problems too.So don't discount this amazing game, when it is fixed you owe it to yourself to play it.But until then?Shame *ding*Shame *ding*Shame *ding*Shame *ding*Shame *ding*			"

												Well you know what? This game has some beauty, in combat, in story. Side quest are kindaaaa to much grindy compared to Arkham City but okay! The worst problem though are the glitches... holy shiiit this game is glitched.  At least few times I experienced enemies walking in mid air and Batman getting behind textures after using grappling device. Like come on...If they could repair that and break constant repetitiveness from side quests. We would've gotten an spirit ancestor of Arkham City. Final impression after ending the main story is that its a very good game... Only a very good game. No ofense but some main characters seems to be half baked. Nevertheless I recommend it since Arkham Knight gets better with each hour spent, and you will likely remember it because of the Batmobile and story scenes, sweet memories :)			"

												I pre-ordered this game months before the release, but could not play it due to the optimization issues. But, recently with an updated syatem i can now play this game pretty smoothly at 30fps.Gameplay - One of the best so far in Arkhma games. None comes close.The use of batmobile is amazing. Including the chasing sequences. Riddler challenges with the batmobile are a bit annoying, but they are not much. Side stories take a lot of time and effort which helps the gameplay. Graphics - I am playing at the lowest settings for now even then everything loooks so stunning. I can only imaginr the graohics at ultra.story - As always, the story is the headline of the game,  It keeps you binding even though you might already predict the next sequence.replayability - You can play this game for hours without getting bored or noticing the clock. Completing the stoy and the side missions is time consuming enough. To top that, the DLC content will keep you engaged for hours more and even after that you have challenge maps. There is just so much to do. This is an amazing game and i would recommend it to anyone anytime. The best of the series so far,			"

												I can honestly say I have little to no problems playing this game. However, that is only because my graphics card is a 970 (as many others have). I experience little to no lag overall, but when it comes to the bat-mobile's boost speed and gliding for long periods of time, lag spikes are not a stranger. While I do recommend this game for those who have a monster of a PC, I give this a thumbs-down mainly due to bad port. Most PC games nowadays, regardless of being graphic-heavy, are playable, even on the highest graphics settings(if possible). Even if you set it to the lowest, you can at least expect a lag-free gameplay. With this game, you can expect lag regardless of settings. So to end the ranting, only buy this game if you do not care about these slight lag spikes and would rather focus on the overall gameplay. Otherwise, give WB the finger and steer away from this product.OH. The story is actually great.. ;)			"

												Broken game, nothing else to say really.EDIT: Honestly let me just say this; the game looks exactly like Batman: Arkham City if you turn the graphics down to medium-low which is what I have it set as because my GTX 770 can’t run this any higher without having my FPS drop to negatives. So there this game looks/plays like Arkham City which is not bad at all because Arkham City was fantastic. All this is, is same map just re-skinned to add to the story atmosphere and a new story everything else is the same. My review is negative because of what fans had to go through to get this game to a playable state thankfully I got this full game and by that I mean season pass included for under $30 so I'm not too upset.

												theres alot to like about this game but in its current state, theres alot more things to loathe. its really unfortunate that such a broken mess was knowingly♥♥♥♥♥♥out to customers as I was one of the many fans, eagerly anticipating this game ever since it was announced. ready to place it atop my favorite games of all time, only to have to endure numerous issues incessantly impeding my enjoyment of the game. luckily for me, ive been able to find a few ways to work around the worst bugs and BS, and my computer confirguration has allowed me to skirt some of the sheer unplayability issues being reported by others, but I cant say that Im truly able to enjoy the game the way that it SHOULD be played. i definitely appreciate the design elements of gotham city and I certainly cant overlook the attention to detail that was put into the countless easter eggs and references to the batman lore and the wider dc universe. I can have some fun here & there, but I still cant help but feel slighted, almost bamboozled, by the way everyone involved: the developer, the publisher, hell, even nvidia tried to pull the wool over everyone's eyes with videos just prior to release showing gameplay footage with gameworks, claiming solid 60fps. Then WB trying to cover its♥♥♥♥♥at release quietly changing required specs & saying that 720p at 30fps was really all that the pc users could hope to achieve when they had actually known all along that the performance on pc was just atrocious. spent $75 on the game alone just to make SURE that I had it on release day only to be severely disappointed and theres no amount of their PR lies or BS apologies that will change the fact that they just didnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥enough to not set consumers up for a huge slap in the face.  bottom lines, quarterly reports & profits; thats all that mattered and its totally marred an otherwise good game, turning it into a terrible experience. Ill never preorder again, never buy another Rocksteady or WB game and if I even see that Iron Galaxy worked on it, then Ill just chuck it in the fire. itll play better there. Almost two months later, theres still no fix. Im starting to think that there'll never be one. It sucks that I cant seperate that experience from the quality of the game, but I just cant. If not for my willingness to make some tweaks, getting totally lucky & discovering some work-arounds just to get it to play, having to adjust my core speeds and go as far as to overclock my graphics card, I wouldnt even have gotten the chance to play this thing. (for reference, I dont have to do any of those things to get GTA V to play at 1080p, 60fps) I didnt want to return it when everyone was getting refunds, because I wanted to PLAY this game! But now and possibly forever, regardless of how good it may be in the future, this game will be like baseball players during the ""Steroids Era;"" itll get an asterisk in my mind. It wont go in my personal gaming ""Hall of Fame"" and Ill always look back and think, ""maybe that was a good game, but DAMNIT, it was SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥!"" And what do we have to look forward to? Being charged for challange maps that they took out of the game when ALL three previous titles had them included? A batmobile & skin that cant even be used IN the game? or maybe ""story"" missions that have no story and last all of 10mins like the redhood, or 15 mins like the harley one, or maybe around 30-40mins like the batgirl one? WOAH. yeah, i see where that $40 season pass really comes in handy! no. its not the game itself as much as the PEOPLE helping others to the expand the games enjoyability, the people that the developers and publisher forgot to think about or truthfully just didnt give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about, thatll end up making this game into something better. And then its not the ""game"" as they made it. So the game you buy, is not worth it, but the game you make it into, well thats up to you.			"

												I can honestly say I have little to no problems playing this game. However, that is only because my graphics card is a 970 (as many others have). I experience little to no lag overall, but when it comes to the bat-mobile's boost speed and gliding for long periods of time, lag spikes are not a stranger. While I do recommend this game for those who have a monster of a PC, I give this a thumbs-down mainly due to bad port. Most PC games nowadays, regardless of being graphic-heavy, are playable, even on the highest graphics settings(if possible). Even if you set it to the lowest, you can at least expect a lag-free gameplay. With this game, you can expect lag regardless of settings. So to end the ranting, only buy this game if you do not care about these slight lag spikes and would rather focus on the overall gameplay. Otherwise, give WB the finger and steer away from this product.OH. The story is actually great.. ;)			"

But the question is: (!)Is it fixed yet!?You can play the game without crashing...(You may crash 1-2 times in a period of 3-4 hours depending on your RAM and GPU). You can choose between 30-60-90FPS limit. High graphics is available. You may have some frame drops.I have tested this game with 2 CPUs on the same PC (8GB Ram, AMD Radeon R9 280 3GB)1) Intel Pentium G3258 (Stock Speed) - If you own this CPU...DO NOT BUY IT! IT'S AN AWFULL EXPERIENCE.Low graphics - 28-30FPS on foot - 20-24 in the batmobile.2) Intel core i7 4790K (Stock Speed) - If you own this CPU...BUY IT.

												Edit 2: So now the game is back up for sale, still not a great port. Still has issues when gliding or driving, still crashes sometimes. RS/WB are also making zero effort to remedy people who already bought the game before they fixed. Even Ubisoft had the sense to give out free content with the ACU fiasco. WB doesn't care about their fans, just their fan's money. Wait until this goes on sale to get it. Such a sad end to what was for a while one of my favorite game series. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: And now the PC patch ""in august"" is actually just an update on what to expect on that patch. Patch wont be here until september at the easliest. ♥♥♥♥ WB and ♥♥♥♥ Rocksteady. The fact that this game needs so much work done that they haven't even gotten a patch out in over 2 months just makes it that much more unforgiveable that they released it in the first place. ________________________________________________________________Terrible port, my GTX 980 often dips into slideshow fps, thankfully I've yet to crashWB and Rocksteady have, so far, done nothing to fix any of the performance issues. They've made two updates, one to apologize and say they take these issues that ""some"" users are experiencing very seriously, and another to apologize again and to ""inform"" us that they wont be releasing DLC for a game currently suspended from steam sales...And they also announced that they will be changing their internal review process because of this launch.So the horrible PC launches they had in the past weren't enough to make them do this? MK9, MKX, Arkham Origins? Even Arkham city launched with a bug that would delete your save file. Thank GabeN for steam refunds, now they can't get away with this♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore			"

												There are a lot of negative reviews for this game so let me explain a few things.Firstly, let me say I preordered this game because I know Rocksteady puts out a quality product. This game itself is quality. The port is not. RS outsourced the PC port to what is believed to be a team of 12 programmers who have a terrible track record, and I will not defend this.The optimization issues are sad really. Sure, past Arkham games have had issues at launch, but nowhere near this bad. On a 760 and 3770 I have everything on low and at 720p to get a somewhat consistent 60fps, and while the game still looks good it's hard knowing I should be able to do 60 on at least medium at 1080p. Others have severe stuttering. This needs fixing. If you're near the min specs, avoid this game like the plague until patches have been issues.Besides the aformentoned issues, this is a batman Arkham game through and through. I love that this game somehow feels more fluid than the past 2 games, and the flight is just as amazing as ever. The world is massive and beautiful. People seem to think there was some watch_dogs style graphical downgrade, however if there was I really don't care. On higher settings, this game is truly a next gen title (Right now you won't be able to play on these settings unless you have a card from the future but). One questionable thing I may add is that Commisioner Gordon sounds like Batman. Idk what happened there.And now the Batmobile. I shook my head when I heard they were adding this, but I'm pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment. The combat leaves something to be desired, but the actual driving itself feels really good, as the weighty feel to it makes it fun to drive. However. my major gripe thus far has to do with the Riddler intro mission and how it uses the Batmobile and sets up its use in later Riddler missions. I feel the Riddler wouldn't make use of the Batmobile but whatever.In summation, great game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launch. If you're a fan of the Arkham games like me and need to finish the trilogy, get it as long as you don't mind lowering the graphical settings and getting some performance issues. Otherwise avoid this like the plague until Rocksteady does somethingEDIT: Editing to say I requested a refund and I say stay away from this game until major patching and a discountEDIT 2: I got a refund and bought through a key site for a heavy discount. It disheartems me that I want to play so bad but I will refrain from playing any more until a patch drops. Also MARK IS BACK!			"

												As a game, this seems fine; more of the same, but fine. But Warner Bros. (And or Rocksteady's) treatment of the community has been depressing at best and shameful at worst. I love the Arkham series, and i'm sure I would have gotten into this game a lot more if it didn't run pretty poorly on my tasty rig, and horribly on rigs even tastier than mine. It's a real shame that even with a three month window to resolve at least some of the complaints people voiced, seemingly very little has changed and performance seems arguably even worse. I never normally write Steam reviews, but I honestly feel that the more people call out publishers/developers on this increasingly common problem the less it will happen.			"

												Best Rocksteady made Arkham game made in terms of graphics and effects, second best in terms of gameplay and action. But that ""best"" accolade comes with quite high system requirements. Also, I really recommend playing this game installed on a SSD, or you will suffer long loading times and stuttering caused by in-game loading. Otherwise, if you have a system to provide 60 FPS, you will love the way this game looks.Everything, including DLC's are very worthwhile to play, never feels like wasting time (except Riddler riddles, but that's me).I should thank Rocksteady for making these games, they are all (including Origins, which is not Rocksteady made but still good, imo) masterpieces in my book.

												Game is much improved sense the dumpster fire of a launch. Aside from the pre-renderd cut scenes being locked to 30fps its pretty damn nice. A downside (kinda) is the max you can output is 90fps which is good, but would be cool if no cap was in place.  That said on ground I average 75fps with everything max aside from Gameworks dynamic fog and paper debris. In the bat mobile its more variable with heavy combat going to low 40s, and just cruising being in the upper 50’s to low 60’s.

												oh man where do I start.I'm late I'd say, I got an xbox with a copy of Arkham City and I couldn't stop playing. I then got a new rig and installed both Arkham Asylum and City and I enjoyed the hell out ouf both. Then Arkham Knight was announced and I got hyped so much. Suffice to say I wasn't even dissapointed. I was sad however that it was ported badly to pc yet I didn't give up. I waited for so long with patches coming less often and more money to head into my wallet for a new graphics card. I play it now and I can't stop, it is so amazing with all the new features, playable characters and Batman being himself just better.I enjoy this game better than the rest because of the following:- Story is gripping- Open world is more open, especially now there is faster travel- Predator and Combat (I will elaborate soon)- And the outstanding amount of beautiful DLCThe reason I love predator here is because it has even more ways of getting rid of thugs quickly and efficiently and it's even easier to get around the area.Combat is better because you're not only punching thugs, usinbg gadgets and performing combo takedowns, you're dropping ceiling lights on their heads, using their weapons against them and utilizing the batmobile takedown. Also don't forget the tag team superhero stuff that's also pretty sick.Anyway if you want to get this, get it, seriously it is amazing!			"

Is it the thoughtless and lazy porting to PC?No HBAO+ or any form of ambient occlusion (2015 and this feature is almost a pre-requisite especially for a game so heavily pushed by Nvidia)Cap at 30 fps - cheers for that but I have a PC with a 6 core 12 thread cpu and a GTX 980TiPoor textures and rain effects which are alleged to be missing in comparison to PS4 versionExtremely stuttery performance whilst driving the Batmobile, to the extent that I would not be unhappy if Batman sold the damn thing on Ebay.Dumbed down fight mechanics - just come on now, I like a challenge...and the game looks AWFUL!!!Play Asylum/City or Origins and then this and you  will be shocked at how abysmal this looks...The list goes on but the thing that hurts is the total lack of effort put into this game for the PC.

												Dissapointed with the game its like playing the last one but with a batmobile and smoke. I liked the last ones and shall continue with the game as a batman fan but i will be waiting next time before jumping to buy a game staight away or pre ordering etc before  ive seen reviews demos etc not just made up promro vids that the game dont even look like.After now playing the game longer i am enjoying the story and the batmobile is very enjoyable you use it more than i thought in diffrent ways. I dont change my recommendation but its growing on me. If i was you i would watch a few player vids or broadcasts and decide for yourself.:)			"

												UPDATE: After the September 3rd patch, there has been a noticeable improvement in performance. The game has added many graphics options that were not previously available, as well as a bar indicating how much VRAM will be used based on your settings. However... there are still some unexplainable problems. While the game tells me that it will run better with motion blur disabled, I get a 5-10 dip in FPS with motion blur disabled. Thats right, the game runs better WITH motion blur. Why? I dont understand. /Update.There is a masterpiece of a game hidden within all the frame rate issues and bugs. I can't recommend the game to ANYONE in this state. It's pathetic, honestly. Patches better roll out SOON.We're almost 48 hours post launch and there hasn't even been word of when a patch will be deployed. I can run the game shakily at around 30 fps right now. I am recieving the ""console experience"" (Their words, not mine.) My rig is FAR more powerful then the current generation of consoles. Here are my specs.Processor: i7-4770kVideo Card: R9 280x (3 GB VRAM)RAM: 16 gbAlso, Running off of an SSD.DONT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥HAS BEEN FIXED. As to Rockstady/Iron Galaxy/ whoever is responsible for this mess, please dont my most hyped game of 2015 (yes, even moreso then Fallout 4) end on such a tragically pathetic note. I may not be able to refund the game, but I can still refund the season pass.			"

												Let's say you are a huge fan of Batman, previous games of Batman (Arkham City and Arkham City) would give you the full and right Batman experience. I bought this game since it's release day back in summer, i was hoping for a great PC port as Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did. But well Akrham Knight... is like the ugly brother of the family in terms of optimization. If you are interested in playing a Batman game, play the previous ones or wait for reviews on how the updates on Arkham Knight go on. "

												WB, Rocksteady and the 3rd part port studio involved should be embarassed by this travesty of a port. Framerate locked to 30FPS but can't even keep that stable on a i5 4760K and GTX 970 which runs another recent high profile game at 60FPS with mostly everything turned up full. Texture load problems, missing AO, missing rain effects, lower textures than the console versions and numerous other issues. There's no way this was missed before launch unless the QA department didn't bother loading it up. I couldn't advise anyone to buy this game in it's current state and if I hadn't bought through a 3rd party I would be requesting a refund. AVOID.UPDATE - 28/10 patch is basically just DLC, the game still needs more VRAM than anything else out there and still doesn't run as well as the PS4 version. Well done WB you had one job and you couldn't even get that right.			"

												To fix the FPS drops you have to go to \steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Knight\BMGame\Config and open up BmSystemsettings.ini using notepad and do the following things Change bAllowD3D9MSAA=False to bAllowD3D9MSAA=True Change AllowD3D10=False to AllowD3D10=True Change TextureResolution=1 to TextureResolution=2 Disable Bloom by setting Bloom=False Disable Reflections by setting Reflections=False Set AllowOpenGL=True Save and exitIt's a great game, they have fixed most of the crashes/bugs/glitches and fps drops, but people might still get some fps drops while in certain areas or while you are driving the batmobile. Don't buy the season pass because it is useless, the DLC story missions are only about 30 minutes long each and its a waste of money, however the rest of the DLC are kind of nice, you have different skins which might look better than the original game one.The best DLC is the batmobile skin from the Batman v Superman movie, which looks so much better.*UPDATE*the story is only about 10 hours long, maybe even shorter since it took me a lot of time to finish some of the missions, but if you don't do the side missions or side story, then the game will probably be too short for you.

												Definitely a mixed bag. When it works (as it mostly has on my machine), it's the apex of Rocksteady's design. Smart, fun, and varied throughout with a satisfying story, top-tier visuals, and refined gameplay.When it doesn't, it's a mess. Even after the post-release patch I actually suffer more problems now than I ever did at launch, with bugged achievements, frame-rate issues, and horrible audio-skipping on pre-rendered cutscenes.The season pass content should be avoided. Unless you're a sucker for challenge maps, all it really adds are a handful of 10-15 minute ""story"" missions and a ton of skins. A very high price for what is essentially filler/bonus content.			"

												This game clearly wasn't ready for a re-release. I can't even start it in fullscreen mode on my laptop due to a rendering bug that still needs to be fixed. On my desktop machine I have a GTX 970 and intel core i7 950 with 16GB of memory but even these specs aren't good enough to play comfortably. Strangely I've noticed more stuttering than usual after applying the October patch, especially when Batman is roaming around Gotham City. Switching to the lowest graphic settings available doesn't make too much of a difference either. Hopefully there are more patches on the way.			"

Posted: June 24, 2015
												Where to begin? Batman: Arkham Knight is a game I have mixed feelings about as a PC gamer. The game itself is pretty cool but on the other side it lacks compared to the previous installments.Gameplay: I have spend three hours so far and got a decent grip on the game. It's similar to the previous Arkham games and the controls are more or less the same, they switched a couple of buttons which will confuse any player who played the past 3 games and it will require a bit of getting used to. Biggest change is the Batmobile entering the scene. It's awesome but at the same time it feels cheap to just race around wrecking chaos. The Arkhams series were always about being stealthy and that got tuned down a notch by introducing the Batmobile. All the old tricks are still there and new ones are added like the ''Multi Fear-Take down'' and ''environmental take downs''. It adds some diversity to the combat and it looks great. The Wayne Tech upgrades are back as usual and there is a wide variety to choose from. Batsuit, combat, predator, gadgets etc. There is a quite a bit of farming involved to max it out. Batmans favourite gadgets like the batarang, explosive gel, the line launcher and more are back as well. This time there is also the Batmobile remote which lets you remotely control the Batmobile! Challenges: For me, this is the #1 reason to buy any of the Arkham games. It's what I spend most time on and find the most fun. However, there doesn't seem to be anything else but AR (Augmented Reality) challenges at this point and no playable characters outside the mini-campaigns similar to the Robin mini-campaign in Arkham City. This is an ENORMOUS let down. I'm praying that it's coming with the season pass content but I find it ridiculous that this is not part of the game from the start. Seeing how 3 games had challenges I never thought they would pull a stunt like this. This is the major reason I'm going to give this game a negative review.Graphics & Performance: Batman: Arkham Knight is a good looking game. Unfortunately it's not optimized for PC's. This differs for person to person but in my experience it's a let down. The game is capped at 30 fps at default settings.... What? Why? How? It's 2015 and especially on PC this is outright embarassing. Luckily it can be changed in the INI file but still... It's weird that it isn't uncapped by default. I meet the minimum requirements and still the game has  erratic behaviour when it comes to performance. One moment I'm gliding over Gotham with 60 fps and 10 seconds later it drops massively to 0 fps making the game come to a complete stop before it goes up to 30-60 fps. The amount of settings in the video settings tab is low. There are a couple of settings you can turn on or off which include: Resolution, V-Sync, AA, Shadows, Level of Detail and Textures. Then there are 4 options for Nvidia Gameworks which even on a Nvidia card doesn't seem to work all that well.Because of this I went to the INI file to see if I could adjust things like Depth of Field or Motion Blur, settings which are present in every game to date which you can turn on or off in the video settings. After turning these settings off I had a staggering 100+ fps and I was happy, however, seconds later the game crashed and it wouldn't boot anymore without a CTD. In other words, a very low amount of settings can be adjusted in the INI file which is a total let down for any PC game(r). It seems I have to suck this up and play with the erratic behaviour as a statement from Rocksteady kind of leans towards not polishing this game except for texture pop-ins and other minor issues.Final Verdict: This is the most awesome and at the same time the worst batman arkham game. Besides the performance issues, which are completely unnecessary imo, the lack of challenges is what makes me give this game a negative verdict. The game plays like it should, and the story seems decent but for me it already lacks. Should you buy it? If you have a rig that at least meet the recommended or ultra settings; go for it. Otherwise, be prepared to deal with stuttering and erratic performance. It's playable but that depends entirely on what is acceptable to you. This game is solid in gameplay but simply lacks compared to its predecessors.			"

												A quick heads up on what could be a beatifully made game.The port is extremley poor on release with no in menu support to change fps to 60 as it is set to 30fps and intermitant drop below.The fmv sequences are riddled with stutter and frame drop with no sync on the dialogue.The in game optimixation is hideous at the moment and a patch/update is definately required.On the plus side there are some really hopeful signs that this could be a fantastic game so be patient and hopefully Rocksteady/Iron Galaxy studios will release fixes.P.S: Do not attempt a verify cache on this game unless you want to download the entire game again.If you have a poor download speed as I have another 12-13hours will drive you to chew your own arm off.

												Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play this game for much longer than 10 minutes at a time.  Like many others, I've been experiencing extreme stutter and FPS drops, even on the lowest settings.  Diving while gliding and summoning the batmobile causes the whole game to lock up for ~5 seconds.  Hopefully a patch is released soon - I'm hesitant to do much more testing as I don't want to exceed the 2 hour return limit.  I definitely do not recommend purchasing at this time.			"

												The game looks mostly fine, though the textures are poor. However I found that I was forced to play in borderless window mode, as fullscreen makes the game flip-out. Furthermore, the game crashes each time I try to exit. The controls are certainly not great, which has been an issue since the first game in the series. If anything they've gotten more convoluted in this installment.Additionally, the publisher pulled the Harley DLC from my account because I used a Nvidia promo code rather than a proper pre-order. This was the part of the game for which I was most excited, and I was given no warning that I would not have it, nor any option to acquire it. I guess that will teach me for taking part of a WB promotion, but I certainly won't be buying anymore of their games either.			"

												This is one of the worst ports I have played.  30 fps cap which can be changed in the ini, but even if you remove it most people aren't able to get over 30. Nvidia and AMD cards both suffer from performance problems. Even newer cards like a 980ti are having problems on certain setups.Every setting I adjust seems to do absolutely nothing. Putting shadows to low removes a decent amount of stuttering, but it's still sitting at the same fps as before. The game seems to be using too much vram. If you set it to use 2GB of vram, it will still go above 2GB. It will try to do the same if you have 3 or 4GB, etc. Some users with 8GB of vram said it was attempting to use all of it as well.This port was also outsourced, just like the previous WB published title to be released on pc, Mortal Kombat X. This follows suit in having a horrible launch. This doesn't even count the non performance related bugs, like completed objective markers sometimes not disappearing and being stuck on your screen. And since the game autosaves, you either suck it up or start over.I didn't think anything could top AC Unity's launch. Refund if you bought it and are able. Stay away until many patches are released, if they ever actually fix these issues.			"

Just some information for the community is all :)Firstly I ran the game on SLI both cards (NVIDIA RECOMMENDED) in the Control Panel at native 1080p with all settings on MAX buit with NO GameWorks settings on.My benchmark performance was:Average 76fpsMinimum 48fpsI then disabled SLI and ran the same bench on a single card...Average 104fpsMinimum 56fps. SLI is broken. there's no question.After doing this, I ran the single card bench at 1440p native...Average 70fps.I then proceeded to run some GameWorks options, so I turned on Rain - Lights - Paper and ran the benchmark at 1440p with my second GPU set as a dedicated PhysX driver. My average was 76fps. My second GPU got to 27% Usage (for the paper PhysX).I finally ran 2 more benchmarks. The first was all setting maxed out with Rain - Lights - Smoke ON and Paper OFF at 1440p with 1 Card rendering the game and 1 card rendering Smoke (PhysX). My results were:Average 64fpsMinimum 39fpsSecond benchmark was the same but at 1080p.My results were:Average 83fpsMinimum 60fpsResolution plays a huge part in FPS in games as I'd expect. SLI doesn't seem to work at all (Lose Performance when both cards active).NOTE: When I started the game and actually got to the free roam, every 20 feet or so I would stutter. More of a micro stutter. This may just be my system but the more information the better I guess :D.I do rate this as a 'NO' for now due to the lack in performance optimization. But as time goes on and the game gets more updates, this isn't my final decision.- Spongie			"

												The Arkham series finishes on a rather sour note. Where to start? I've played each game in the Arkham series and Arkham city is by far the definitive one to play. Some things in City have been removed from Knight, notably challenge maps have been replaced with AR challenges, all of which are found in the single player story, as such, you can't play as any of the semi-playable characters for whichever challenge you choose, that includes the pre-order incentive characters. The game also doesn't seem to add much aside from the Batmobile addition, which in my opinion is absolutely abysmal. It controls very badly, and most challenges rely on the new Batmobile. When freeroaming in the story, you have trouble simply getting from A to B, because in between them are many vehicle based enemies. While this is fine in the way that it gets you something to do, it's cumbersome with all the back and forth running across Gotham you will do.Next, there's the map itself, ""Gotham"" seems like very little more map space than the previous games. Now quality over quantity should apply here, however all of the little things you have to do aren't very entertaining. All of the side quests based on various characters are fairly good, but some are still some pretty weak combat-fests, instead of anything interesting with the characters. Coming to characters, the story in itself is okay, some things are very reused, and some characters are really lacking in developement.The melee combat you know and love is still present, with very few things added to change it, which was probably a good move on Rocksteady's part considering everything else in the game. It's still satisfying, simple, and smooth. I do enjoy the melee combat, however it's too few and far between when playing through the story. Rocksteady REALLY wants you to play and love their new batmobile.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game, maybe for a much  lower pricetag in the far future. If you want the definitive Batman experience, pick up Arkham City, and if you've beaten it and need a new Batman game, wait.			"

												Do not buy this game right now. It is a disgrace to the PC platform and it spits in the face of fans of this series. This was supposed to be a PC showpiece title with all this special Nvidia gameworks bells and whistles added on top. Instead we got a totally shoddy port that constantly stutters, has negative SLI scaling (the game actually performs worse at times if you have two GPUs), and is actually missing certain graphical effects from the console version!!Maybe they release a patch and the game will suddenly run nicely but I highly doubt it. No communication from the developers and I bet that this will take a long time to get in an acceptable condition, assuming they will provide post-laucnh support. If they want to sell any of their horribly overpriced DLCs I would think it would be in their best interest to fix this game.			"

												I love the Batman Arkham series, I have always been a huge fan of them.  I was waiting for this game to come out on the edge of my seat. I want everyone to know that my poor review is has nothing to do with game play, as I really haven't played the game. It took me all day just to get it to work, in a window with poor quality. My laptop is more then able to handle this game, and it's run the others so beautifully. I got to the opening scene, the movie and because everything is so poor (and though I have to launch it through NVIDA, I can't use any of NVIDA's settings) the game play parts are so jumpy, and turning the camera view with the mouse makes me motion sick. I only have this problem with flight simulators, and never with any of the other games. To get it to work I had to go into the config files of the game, other people have giving step by step instructions on how to do it far better then I could even explain it and change the frame rate per second to 120, and set something else ot 0.0.  I then had to use NVIDA to launch it in a window, turn off all the NVIDA special stuff, set the graphics qualities to normal or lower... and reset the window size to the largest so I could even see what was going on. I think I am going to have to wait until they fix all this to even try to play it because it really does make me sick to my stomach after just a couple minutes of it jerking around.*UPDATE* I was able to get the camera to stop jerking around so much in the walking around, and the first hand to hand fight were you save a cop. Right after that it goes right into the car chase with the Batmobile... and I had to stop playing all together because I got car sick.			"

												Disappointing.  That's the only word I can describe Batman Arkham Knight.  Being a fan of the Arkham series I was pretty much excited when Arkham Knight was announced that I pre ordered it in advance.  I even chose to buy this first over Grand Theft Auto V thinking that Rocksteady studios and Warner bros interactive would bring us the best Batman Arkham game ever considering their track record in the Arkham series and the fact that this is the final game of the trilogy.  But no, they have forsaken the PC gamers for the sake of the console version.  They hired a small 12 man game studio, Iron Galaxy, to make the pc port version who in turn made a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job and Warner Brothers still released it as is. They could have postponed the PC version a few months late to fix and optimize the PC version but it looks like corporate greed got the best of them.  It goes to show they aren't sincere and doesn't care at all.  At the moment the game runs at 30 fps out of the box.  Sure you can tweak the .ini settings but it only shows how lazy Iron Galaxy was doing their job.  There's not much graphic setting options as well.  Hell, I've even seen texture comparisons between the PC and PS4 version over the internet and the PS4 version was much better hands down.  Unbelievable.Stuttering and fps drops are rampant in-game.  Although it's not that much noticeable in my system (I'm using a GTX 970 and I7 4790k) it does break immersion when it happens.  Even the cutscenes have stuttering from time to time. I shudder to think the experience of other gamers who has an older PC rig than I do.       Warner Bros interactive has lost me as a customer.  They are now up there together with EA and Ubisoft that I will try avoid as much as possible and will never pre order or buy from unless the game they made are optimized properly and has a lot of positive reviews. I will wait for a week to see if they will patch up and fix the optimization issues of Arkham Knight.  If not then it's time for a refund and buy Grand Theft Auto V instead.  At least Rockstar cares for their PC fans.			"

The game also has some weird crashes and massive fps drops take it from someone running SLI GTX 980 G1.

												A quick heads up on what could be a beatifully made game.The port is extremley poor on release with no in menu support to change fps to 60 as it is set to 30fps and intermitant drop below.The fmv sequences are riddled with stutter and frame drop with no sync on the dialogue.The in game optimixation is hideous at the moment and a patch/update is definately required.On the plus side there are some really hopeful signs that this could be a fantastic game so be patient and hopefully Rocksteady/Iron Galaxy studios will release fixes.P.S: Do not attempt a verify cache on this game unless you want to download the entire game again.If you have a poor download speed as I have another 12-13hours will drive you to chew your own arm off.

												Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play this game for much longer than 10 minutes at a time.  Like many others, I've been experiencing extreme stutter and FPS drops, even on the lowest settings.  Diving while gliding and summoning the batmobile causes the whole game to lock up for ~5 seconds.  Hopefully a patch is released soon - I'm hesitant to do much more testing as I don't want to exceed the 2 hour return limit.  I definitely do not recommend purchasing at this time.			"

												This is one of the worst ports I have played.  30 fps cap which can be changed in the ini, but even if you remove it most people aren't able to get over 30. Nvidia and AMD cards both suffer from performance problems. Even newer cards like a 980ti are having problems on certain setups.Every setting I adjust seems to do absolutely nothing. Putting shadows to low removes a decent amount of stuttering, but it's still sitting at the same fps as before. The game seems to be using too much vram. If you set it to use 2GB of vram, it will still go above 2GB. It will try to do the same if you have 3 or 4GB, etc. Some users with 8GB of vram said it was attempting to use all of it as well.This port was also outsourced, just like the previous WB published title to be released on pc, Mortal Kombat X. This follows suit in having a horrible launch. This doesn't even count the non performance related bugs, like completed objective markers sometimes not disappearing and being stuck on your screen. And since the game autosaves, you either suck it up or start over.I didn't think anything could top AC Unity's launch. Refund if you bought it and are able. Stay away until many patches are released, if they ever actually fix these issues.			"

Just some information for the community is all :)Firstly I ran the game on SLI both cards (NVIDIA RECOMMENDED) in the Control Panel at native 1080p with all settings on MAX buit with NO GameWorks settings on.My benchmark performance was:Average 76fpsMinimum 48fpsI then disabled SLI and ran the same bench on a single card...Average 104fpsMinimum 56fps. SLI is broken. there's no question.After doing this, I ran the single card bench at 1440p native...Average 70fps.I then proceeded to run some GameWorks options, so I turned on Rain - Lights - Paper and ran the benchmark at 1440p with my second GPU set as a dedicated PhysX driver. My average was 76fps. My second GPU got to 27% Usage (for the paper PhysX).I finally ran 2 more benchmarks. The first was all setting maxed out with Rain - Lights - Smoke ON and Paper OFF at 1440p with 1 Card rendering the game and 1 card rendering Smoke (PhysX). My results were:Average 64fpsMinimum 39fpsSecond benchmark was the same but at 1080p.My results were:Average 83fpsMinimum 60fpsResolution plays a huge part in FPS in games as I'd expect. SLI doesn't seem to work at all (Lose Performance when both cards active).NOTE: When I started the game and actually got to the free roam, every 20 feet or so I would stutter. More of a micro stutter. This may just be my system but the more information the better I guess :D.I do rate this as a 'NO' for now due to the lack in performance optimization. But as time goes on and the game gets more updates, this isn't my final decision.- Spongie			"

												The Arkham series finishes on a rather sour note. Where to start? I've played each game in the Arkham series and Arkham city is by far the definitive one to play. Some things in City have been removed from Knight, notably challenge maps have been replaced with AR challenges, all of which are found in the single player story, as such, you can't play as any of the semi-playable characters for whichever challenge you choose, that includes the pre-order incentive characters. The game also doesn't seem to add much aside from the Batmobile addition, which in my opinion is absolutely abysmal. It controls very badly, and most challenges rely on the new Batmobile. When freeroaming in the story, you have trouble simply getting from A to B, because in between them are many vehicle based enemies. While this is fine in the way that it gets you something to do, it's cumbersome with all the back and forth running across Gotham you will do.Next, there's the map itself, ""Gotham"" seems like very little more map space than the previous games. Now quality over quantity should apply here, however all of the little things you have to do aren't very entertaining.

It's still satisfying, simple, and smooth. I do enjoy the melee combat, however it's too few and far between when playing through the story. Rocksteady REALLY wants you to play and love their new batmobile.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game, maybe for a much  lower pricetag in the far future. If you want the definitive Batman experience, pick up Arkham City, and if you've beaten it and need a new Batman game, wait.			"

												While the actual gameplay is fun, the PC port is HORRIBLE. It is missing visual effects such as ambient occlusions and rain/water effects that are present in the PS4 version. It lacks SLI support and performs much worse with SLI enabled, you are better off using the 2nd card as a PhysX card with SLI disabled.  The frame rate is not very stable, especially poor performance when driving the batmobile. There are almost no options in the graphics settings, the ability to select high/ultra level textures is missing, you can't change anistropic filtering to 16x (it appears to only be 4x), there is no way to turn off annoying effects like the film grain or the especially horrible chromatic abberation that developers love nowadays, and the motion blur is overboard yet there is no way to disable it or tone it down.As for gameplay, I enjoy the fine tuning they did to the hand to hand combat but there is little guidance regarding all the changes and new abilities.  The batmobile is fun to drive around town, but the less than precise controls are annoying to use in the Riddler batmobile races/challenges. I did enjoy battling other vehicles at first, but it starts to feel repetitive as you progress in the game. Still,  I am having a good time playing the game in spite of these limitations and the horrible port job.  I'd recommend playing the PS4 version instead as the game is worth the time to play.			"

												A quick heads up on what could be a beatifully made game.The port is extremley poor on release with no in menu support to change fps to 60 as it is set to 30fps and intermitant drop below.The fmv sequences are riddled with stutter and frame drop with no sync on the dialogue.The in game optimixation is hideous at the moment and a patch/update is definately required.On the plus side there are some really hopeful signs that this could be a fantastic game so be patient and hopefully Rocksteady/Iron Galaxy studios will release fixes.P.S: Do not attempt a verify cache on this game unless you want to download the entire game again.If you have a poor download speed as I have another 12-13hours will drive you to chew your own arm off.

												Srsly, wtf.  This game is locked at 30fps by default, and then on top of that HAS TEXTURE QUALITY INCONSISTENCY, where some parts of a building appear beautiful and other parts very muddy, with no detail.  Same with the baddies, some are high quality rendered with nice detailed clothing, others are just shiny blobs.  It's getting ridiculous. This is 2015 guys!			"

												Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play this game for much longer than 10 minutes at a time.  Like many others, I've been experiencing extreme stutter and FPS drops, even on the lowest settings.  Diving while gliding and summoning the batmobile causes the whole game to lock up for ~5 seconds.  Hopefully a patch is released soon - I'm hesitant to do much more testing as I don't want to exceed the 2 hour return limit.  I definitely do not recommend purchasing at this time.			"

												Despite me loving every other core Arkham game even Origins I cannot bring myself to recomend this one.The performance is obviously the most well publicised issue. Even after months of patching this game runs very poorly on some machines. I was one of the few lucky ones who had tolerable performance from the start but it was barely tolerable. The patches have improved things a lot for me and the game now runs at fairly steady 50fps, not perfect but a good improvement however there are plenty of people reporting little to no improvement on their systems.The story in Arkham Knight is quite possibly my favourite to date, going to some very interesting and surprising places even if the Arkham Knight's identity quickly becomes obvious to anyone even partially familiar with the batman mythos. It is a shame therefore that the surrounding game leaves so much to be desired. Combat is still the same great arkham formular with enough variation to keep things interesting but don't expect any great innovations. The batmobile on the other hand is brand new and quickly outstays its welcome. From its obtuse control scheme to the way it is hamfistedly inserted into every aspect of gameplay you quickly begin to loathe the frequent sections that require its use. I would often find myself examining at a puzzle or situation for several minutes before realising that, no I don't need to use any of batman's gadgets I just need to call the batmobile and make it shoot things. The game becomes less be the Batman and more be the remote controlled tank. This thing should have been left as a means of transport and nothing more.Playable characters have also been stripped back in the game. While previous games allowed for full control of catwoman (and Robin during a DLC) these characters are relegated to partners, allowed only allowed to be switched to during specific combat situations. Their movesets also seem to have been reduced from Arkham city. I found former combo moves and some gadgets missing from catwoman, nightwing and robin.Speaking of missing things the game has lost challenge mode, replacing it with the vastly inferior AR challenges many of which are character locked. While the brawl challenges feel pretty similar the predator challenges are hugely stripped down and are entirely character specific. Side missions are also fairly neglected with many villaneous favourites relegated to short, unsatisfying missions often ending in lackluster boss fights one of which is directly cloned from a main story mission as if to highlight the lack of effort in the sidequest design.Actually lack of effort seems to sum up a lot of this game, from the poor PC optimisation to the lackluster side missions. Only the main storyline feels like it had effort put in. That and their bizzare quest to shoehorn the batmobile into every gameplay mechanic.A huge disapointment.			"

												Some people would say that the game is unplayable even now. I'm sad to hear that, but it works like a charm on my machine.Let's see why you should buy this game, shall we? PROS The combat is as good as it gets. If you like the combat from previous games, you are going to LOVE it in this one. The animations are really good and you can get more use of your gadgets.The story is fine so far. I haven't finished the game yet (waiting for new episodes of Gotham TV series because I like to play Arkham games after watching the show, I know I'm weird). It is nothing special, but it's OK.Graphics are great. I run it on the highest settings, and it looks gorgeous. The Batmobile is a (kinda) fun new addition to the game. CONS The infamous Batmobile is overused.I don't like the Riddler Trophies. I can understand why some people might like it, but I just don't . There are way too many of them, and you need to get them all in order to get the ""real ending"".Spoiler: The Joker does appear in this game, and I think he shouldn't.

												I've put together a new PC system after nearly a decade, just so I can play this game in all it's glory. Boy, I was wrong!Based on my experience with the previous titles (I even enjoyed the maligned ""Origins""), this was my first pre-order. I know that many games have day-1 issues, but, come on, this is Rocksteady! My system specs areIntel Core i5 3.4 GHzGTX 970 4GB2x4GB 1600mhz Crucial Ballistix RAMInstalled on a Samsung SSD 840 EVO 250GBWell, from the intro, the video/game engine was a bit stuttery, but as soon as you confronted the ""smoking guy"" at the diner, the game crashed due to ""low memory"". OK, it can happen.As soon as the camera zoomed on Batman surveying the city, the camera movements were losing frames. The very impressive seamless change from cut-scene to game, as seen in trailers and promo, was erratic. I tried to deactivate various Gameworks features but the issues persisted. I changed the .ini file in order to have 60fps and it seems to work but there are small and big bugs, causing this to be far from the thrilling experience I expected it to be. It takes away all the joy I had about my new PC and the game. While I KNOW there will be fixes and updates (the uproar is too big to ignore), I am seriously considering a refund and buying the game later on a s sale.			"

												the game ran rather well on my rig (16gb ram, i7 core, nvidia 670 gpu) but I found the game to predictable, and in some repsects labored... you were forced to use the vehicle far more than was necessary. it was kind of cool at first but then when most every boss battle you were stuck using that instead of actual hand to hand combat (like they did in origins) it really bummed out the whole experience for me. dont even get me started on the riddler races or trophies... in previous games they were challenging and somewhat annoying sure, but you felt like you actually achieved something when you were done collecting them. on knight however I hated finding and getting each one. I seriously loathed finding them.  the game has a few sweet spots on their delivery and it has some decent challenges, however with this one... it almost feels like they took to many cool things that batman can do and tried to shove as much of it into the game as they possibly could to the point where things felt a little over done... the ""keep it simple stupid"" montra in my opinion should have been leaned on a bit more in the areas it wasnt and used less in the areas it was heavily incorporated.  anyways thats my opinion. do with it as you will.

												Terrible Port, do NOT buy this game! Stutters galore, locked 30 FPS, Textures only go to normal, no Anti-Aliasing options other than ""OFF/ON"", no mouse sensitivity option...NO MOUSE SENSITIVITY OPTION? Are you kidding me?!Do not support this kind of junk from a so-called ""AAA"" developer who out-sources the PC Port to a 12 man team... This is not OK!EDITThere have been several patches now and most of what I said above is no longer relevant. I have now played the game for over 20 hours, and I must say it is pretty OK. Performance is much better now on my high-end system (i7 4790K and GTX 980), the game itself is pretty good if you enjoyed the other Arkham games, and the batmobile I did not hate as much as many people did, I suggest throwing some upgrades into it early on to make the long ""tank"" sections less frustrating and more enjoyable. The story in this game I thought was pretty bad honestly, there were a couple major surprises and themes which I did enjoy, but overall it was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to be honest. I'm not changing my negative recommendation due to bitterness over the game's release, but at this stage it is probably worth a buy especially if you can get it for $20 or less.			"

												After spending the day reading the forums about people having problems, I dreaded coming home to see if it would work for me. Uncapped my FPS, which is lame that I had to, and set all settings to the highest possible and 2560x1080 resolution. Launched and luckily for me the experience hasn't been so bad. FPS does drop to the teens while in the batmobile. around 30-60 FPS most of the time otherwise, with a couple skips here and there. Playable but at your own risk. May or may not work. CANNOT recommend the game even though it was free to me. Simply because PC gamers are just getting walked all over. Clearly an untested game. If it weren't free to me, I wouldn't have given them $5 for it. Shame on the devs rocksteady and whoever they sent it to be ported. Unaccetable to launch a game in 2015 without testing what you are sending out. So far, the entire day, the Devs have sent out the canned response, ""We are aware and working on the issues."" Screw you, you should have known about the problems before you launched the game. RANT OVER-Edit- my system specs for people who are interested.

Posted: June 23, 2015
												Let’s start with the issue everyone is talking about. The performance of the game is absolutely atrocious and unacceptable. I have a GTX 980 and I’m getting a very wide range of FPS depending on the situation I'm in. I played the game with the highest settings with Game Works disabled and the 30 FPS cap put up to 60. While fighting the game usually has a steady 60 FPS dropping to 50 FPS once in a while. Using a Batmobile or gliding over Gotham I would usually get around 20-40 FPS. During my play through (which I still haven't fully finished due to multiple game breaking bugs that have set me back) I would get frequent frame drops to about 10 FPS. Now another issue with the game that has come to light is that the game looks worse than the PS4. Texture quality and the lack of AO on PC shows how badly this port was and is unacceptable. Overall on the performance side this is one of the worst in recent history. Warner Brothers decided to use the same company they outsourced the PC port for Batman Origins which was also a mess to some degree and it shows they didn’t learn anything when working on Batman: AK.Performance aside the game is fantastic. Gotham is massive and full of things to do. Side missions are no longer something you have to stumble on and are available on an easy mission select wheel. The amount gadgets available to you are about the same as Arkham City but seem to have more uses. For example the disruptor is a very useful item which in previous iterations of the game could simply disable enemy’s weapons. In AK you can do other things such as electrifying weapon caches or electrifying medics when using their ability to revive downed enemies.Combat in AK has been perfected, the fast paced fist to face beatings are even more fluid than before. The combat makes you feel invincible and a lot of times makes fights way to easy. Like the previous Arkham games as you continue down the story you acquire more gadgets and fight new enemies. This time round there is an even bigger selection of enemy’s to fight. The medic is one in particular that is more of a support for the enemy’s. The medic can revive downed enemies and also electrify them so that you can't touch them for a while. Stealth sections in the game make a return and give you a few more ways to handle the situation with new takedown moves and new types of vents. That and the new uses for a lot of the gadgets make the stealth section a bit more interesting and less frustrating.In Arkham Knight Batman can now use his Batmobile which wasn’t useable in the previous games. The look of the Batmobile is awesome and there are plenty of times during the game were you are reminded of that. The batmobile isn’t just used to get you from point A to B but can also be used to combat the many drone tanks that have taken over the streets of Gotham. The batmobile can change into a tank which controls very well and feels like it can pack a punch. The Batmobile feels very intricate and feels alive. Sadly the Batmobile gets very old very quickly and starts to feel more of a chore than something you want to do. This wouldn’t be an issue if the Batmobile wasn’t used frequently during the Main Story line. There are many sections of the story where the batmobile has to be used in combat and it really becomes a chore. One of the type of drones you have to fight is a drone tank that can only be destroyed from behind, this means you have to basically sneak up behind it in the Batmobile and wait for your weapon to lock on.  Overall the Batmobile is an awesome vehicle and definitely has a place in the game but you start to get the feeling quite quickly that they based too much of the game around it.The story for the Arkham Knight is fantastic and really helps drive the game forward. Many villains return from the previous games and those that don't are usually acknowledged and mentioned a few times during the game. Batman is once again tested to his limits against unimaginable odds. The voice acting is fantastic with a few changes to previous cast such as Jonathan Banks voicing James Gordan and John Nobile voicing Scarecrow.Overall Gameplay and Story are incredible but the performance hinders that to an unforgivable degree. I don't recommend you buy this game till Rocksteady and Iron Galexy (Made the PC port) fix a lot of the bugs and performance issues. "

												Like most people are saying this is a terrible port, I got the game free with my 2nd GTX980 but apparently 2 GTX980s and an i7 4790k arent enough to run this game at 1440p smoothly. If I turn off all the gameworks fancy bits then its mostly smooth until I move between areas, really judders a lot when driving between different parts of the city. Crazy thing is Arkham Origins looks better and runs prefectly smooth, it has few bugs still but recommended over this game.			"

												I normally dont write reviews for anything on steam but this is such an overwhelmingly poor release that I have to warn others. I recently bought a brand new gtx 960 and this game came free with it. After getting the new card installed and working properly I go to play this game, and I am imediatly encountered with such uncontrollable flickering and screen tearing that it renders the game imposible even to navigate the main menu. I tested my graphics card then on crysis 3, elite dangerous, and Dragon age inquisition. They all worked perfect on max settings. If it werent for the fact that I got this free. there is no way I would have purchased this. I hope theyll fix these problems so I can change this review.			"

												-No Spoilers here-Batman: Arkham Knight is a hard game to recommend to anyone but a Batman fan. The Game itself in its current state is awful in terms of performance but locking the framerate to 30fps and setting everything to either off or Medium seems to fix any issues (Or follow what Rocksteady have said via the forums). The storyline is hit and miss aswell. I can't go into to much detail without spoiling a few things so I wont but don't expect the story to be all that good aswell as giving you a satisfying ending to what was a great series.The Batmobile is fun to drive around in and it feels like a tank which is good conisdering the enemies have many ways to combat you while driving around Gotham. Which brings me to the size, Gotham isn't as open as I'd of liked but its still pretty huge (Around double the size of Arkham City). Its filled with things to do and see, Criminals to apprehend as well as the usual trophies/riddles to complete.If I had to give this game a numbered score:Performance: 4/10Story: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10			"

I can't go into to much detail without spoiling a few things so I wont but don't expect the story to be all that good aswell as giving you a satisfying ending to what was a great series.The Batmobile is fun to drive around in and it feels like a tank which is good conisdering the enemies have many ways to combat you while driving around Gotham. Which brings me to the size, Gotham isn't as open as I'd of liked but its still pretty huge (Around double the size of Arkham City). Its filled with things to do and see, Criminals to apprehend as well as the usual trophies/riddles to complete.If I had to give this game a numbered score:Performance: 4/10Story: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10			"

												NOT FROM ROCKSTEADY, get a refund!Rocksteady farmed out the PC version to Iron Galaxy, the studio that brought us that bug-riddled Arkham Origins cash grab.  Explains a lot.  If this actually were from Rocksteady, I would expect the quality of the first 2 titles.And of course there's thousands of reviews commenting on the bad performance, having to edit ini files, etc. and that's also in play.  I edited the ini file, my settings are at medium and 1080 on my 750Ti and the game runs ok, all the special nvidia stuff is turned off, but I have run into some glitches here and there.It's just a real shame this isn't a REAL Rocksteady game.  Hopefully WB/Iron Galaxy will get this patched up soon, and I will not be buying any more Rocksteady games after this bait-and-switch.			"

												It's absolutely astonishing that any developer would release a game in this condition. Prior to installing and playing the game I had convinced myself that the bulk of poor reviews were some sort of a smear campaign, or just a result of wildly high expectations. That just isn't the case. This game really is damn near unplayable in its current form. I could go over every issue I have experienced thus far, but then I would just end up parroting what everyone else has written, as the technical issues of this game appear to be affecting virtually everyone, with no hardware bias whatsoever. So I'll just say this.If you picked this up on Steam, request a refund. If you picked it up via a 3'rd party key site, request a refund. If you got your copy with the purchase of a graphics card and can't get a refund just uninstall the game. You'd be better of using that 38 gigs of space for storing multiple copies of the critically panned 1997 movie Batman and Robin, because unlike Batman: Arkham Knight, at least Batman and Robin runs at a solid 24 FPS no matter the hardware.

												Very annoyed. This game looks beautiful but runs laughably bad. I'd wait for this one to get fixed folks. I know thats what I'm gonna do. I was really hoping to play this and for about 50% it is. But as soon as the Batmobile comes into play the game just ♥♥♥♥♥ it's pants and becomes a slide show. I'm running a 780ti here and it's not keeping up. Thought maybe it was the card but even people 980s are having trouble. I've no doubt this will eventually be fixed don't get me wrong but the fact that this got to release in this condition is everything wrong with games in 2015. Wait for it to get the thumbs up before attempting this one folks. It'll break your heart otherwise.			"

												It's not as memorable as Arkham City and it doesn't have the same atmosphere as Arkham Asylum, but in terms of graphics and gameplay, Arkham Knight is incredible.The PC version of this game will go down in history as one of the worst ports ever from a western publisher. Although it still has a few issues like the ridiculous VRAM usage, which ends up causing some pretty significant stuttering and slowdown, for 90% of the time the game performs absolutely fine and on top of that, it might be the best looking third person action game I've ever played. The textures, shadows and lighting in this game are all absolutely stunning. Now here's the thing with Arkham Knight on PC: You NEED at least 3GB of VRAM to be able to run  it at 1080p or higher. If not, the PS4 version is the way to go (Assuming you own a PS4 to begin with).I honestly think this is a fantastic game (100+ Hours on my PS4), and assuming you have the hardware to run it, the PC version, as of today, blows the PS4 version out the water.

												If you liked Arkham City, you'll like this game too. It still has loads of irritating Riddler content popping up everywhere but you don't have to do that stuff if you don't want to, just like in City. The combat and stealth are as fluid and fun as ever.Quick performance note as of March 17th, 2016: I'm running on an i5-3470 at 3.9 Ghz, GTX 970 @ 1350 Mhz, 16 GB of DDR3-1600 RAM, and I have the game installed on a Samsung 840 EVO SSD, running Windows 10.I'm running with a 60 fps cap and all of the regular settings turned on, but the Gameworks settings turned off. I get 60fps while walking or driving slowly, mostly 60 fps while flying with occasional dips to 57-58 fps, and about 50 fps while driving fast. I went ahead and turned motion blur on, and with that on I've found the drops to about 50 fps generally don't bother me and there's no micro-stuttering. The issues with motion blur that the game had on launch seem to have been resolved.As a test, I went ahead and removed half my RAM and ran it with just 8 GB. It immediately started stuttering. Over 8 seems to be a requirement for this game.That said, for me at least, performance is squarely in the ""playable"" category and so I can recommend trying the game as of now.			"

Batmobile sections tiresome.Performance issues: with new patch overally improvement, but for many, issues have not been fixed. Choppy frame rate, pauses, crashes to desktop.Not impressed.			"

I'm not just refering to the version on pc but the story as well. Now, it did have some awesome moments but they were only moments. The rest of the time i was annoyed by constant tank battles and very disapointing boss fights. So as a final verdict, don't buy this game.			"

												Batman Arkham Knight Review:CEO: We are going to release a 2.5gb patch to our gameEmployee: And what will we improveCEO: Well we'll make it run worse than before and add literally nothing elseEmployee: I said improveCEO: Oh, sorry. I misheard. I thought you said ""how are we gonna get MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON STEAM"".Performance:This game runs horribly. I used to run at low settings, 1080p, with AA and 8x Anisotropic filtering, and run at a solid 60fps. Now I run 900p with AA off and 2x Anisotropic, and the game runs at 40fps. Rocksteady need to sort out their PC port. They had to relaunch there game because of the port, and it went from bad at launch, better after an update, to worse than ever after a 2.5gb patch. Gameplay:The batmobile in the game seems a bit overused. It is used for a lot of puzzles, and gets a bit boring. The combat is as fun as ever, utilizing counters a lot. Rocksteady have added some new moves as well. The new gadgets such as the remote hacking device are fun and well utilized, and are actually very useful in many situations. For example, you can knockout a goon by turning on the escalator, or setting off an explosion. I do find it quite funny that once a goon is knocked out, you can shoot them as much as you like with your lethal cannons and guns on the batmobile. Of course they are not dead though, because that would make it too dark.Missions:There is a good variety of story missions in the game, and a lot of side missions as well. An example of variety in the story is  Scarecrow fills the city streets with fear toxin and you must travel around the city on the rooftops. The final mission of the game involves running around as joker destroying weeping angel like statues of batman.  At this point, I have finished the story, and it is a good length. It did not drag on like Saints row (my opinion as Saints row IV got very boring as I played the story), and is not too short like Mirrors Edge (an enjoyable game, but I was finished with the story within 3 hours). The side missions contain a lot of the regular batman villians, like Two Face and Penguin, and involve stopping their crime gangs for good. These are fun, and give you a lot of upgrade points, which like the other batman games, let you upgrade gadgets, and unlock new moves.Conclusion:Batman: Arkham Knight is a very fun game. The story is enjoyable, and even 29 hours in I am enjoying slowy completing all the quest lines. I just wish that Rocksteady would fix their PC port. It makes the game in some cases unplayable, and I will most likely be refunding the game when I get the oppurtunity.Performance score: 3 (at least it boots up)Gameplay score: 8 (excessive use of the batmobile)Missions score: Side missions: 9 (a lot of batmobile use, but feels satisfying to take down crime gangs and villians)                          Story missions: 9 (great ending, and lots of variety. Again, a lot of batmobile use)OVERALL SCORE: 6 (not reccomended on PC because of performance, but if you own a console, buy it on that peasant machine)			"

Product received for free
												They fixed it!  Thank heavens they fixed the PC port!  I had kinda lost interest in the Arkham series, due mostly to them moving to xbox one and ps4 (I had played the first 3 on the 360, but I don't feel like getting another console).  So when I heard that the game was fixed and a cousin bought me this game on my birthday, I fired it up and...  It was a bit laggy, but I updated my video card drivers, it ran...almost perfectly.  (GTX 770 4 GB for those wondering).All I can say is, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry Arkham series, I'm sorry I doubted you, I'm sorry I thought you were just a pretty trailer with no substance.  But the game is excellent, it's not perfect, but it is fantastic.  If you're a Batman fan and have played the others in the series, get this game now.  My only complaint (more nitpicks really) is that the Batmobile feels a bit forced in, I mean it makes sense, but it still feels a bit out of place in terms of controls anyway, in terms of the story it makes some sense, but it's controls are a bit odd.  Partially due to the fact that you use it as a tank as well as the vehicle you get around the city with (which I think you can still glide and grapple around the city faster than the batmobile still, but anyway).  The controls are not horrible or unbearable, it's just...different but kudos for trying.All in all, Arkham fans, get this game.			"

												I have been waiting a couple of months after i purchased the game, hoping that the developers would have fixed the stack of bugs. They fixed some, but not nearly alot.The game runs better after the optimizations they have made, i can actually play normally now but i keep crashing frequently. It's frustrating that you crash out of hard parts and need to start over from your last checkpoint.The game crashed for more than a total of 50 times and i am not being funny there, that's the minimum amount, it can't possibly be less. There are also small bugs during flights, you suddenly freezing or standing still for example. Or falling through an interior or world texture.The game is great, the game is awesome. I love the game, i am a big fan of the batman series.Never made a game me so angry while playing it, it is too damn bugged. I literally broke a key from my keyboard. Gotta buy a new keyboard now and that costs me more money than i had paid for the game which i Pre-order'd.The game is a huge improvement from the previous Batman games. It's awesome that you get to use the batmobile now, you still solve riddles, crimes and keep doing the things you did in the previous batman games.The story is great, the graphics are great and so it the atmosphere. There are alot of easter eggs and funny things that you will find along the way while playing.I would recommend the game for Playstation or Xbox but NOT on PC. The game is great, but the experience had been ruined for me.			"

												The game looks great. It plays on the comlpete polar opposite and that is terrible. Yes i know i don't have the best gaming rig ever but if rocksteady says i can at least play on the minimum requirements then i only get fps drops mid game for no reason!!!! This is terrible all i wanted to do was play the game not try and play the most graphicaly enhanced ""game of the year"" and i cant even do that. Not to mantion the capped 30 fps which can be changed but its freaking 2015 why should we have to make the game work isnt that their job? So in conclusion this game is a broken peice of garbage at its current state and until a patch is given i wont be playing the game i neither should you. Now with more information on the game i have discovered that the so called legendary batmobile is not legendary at all it should be called the LooseAllOfYourAlreadyLowFpsMobile this takes away from the overall theme of being the batman it just freezes randomly and slows the overall pace of the game. So like i said earlier untill a ppatch is presented no one should play the game.			"

												Obviously I played the PC version, but from what I hear the PS4 version runs fine, I dont know of the Xbone. As for PC it doesn't funtion properly on anything, sopposedly even worce on AMD.I managed to play just over an hour, after quitting the game to take a break, and disable motionblur from the ini files, the game no longer starts.First off, there is a 30FPS cap that can only be chaged my editing the ini files. While this is incredibly easy to do, it is in my opinnion unacceptable. Even after raising the cap to 60, I can barely maintain 32 FPS while driving the batmobile around. However I CAN get 60 FPS when I not in the batmobile, while not moving, on a rather tall roof. Apparently moving in the enviroment is incredibly tasking, makes doing challenges involving the batmobile a  fun challenge. With the low FPS I can't even seem to detect the target vehicles easily, I simply cant distinguish a moving target instantly, I cant even respond to everything the game shows me.I can't say for other issues, other than the game being broken it seems like something I could enjoy, animations, graphics, UI (save the map), controls. All that is arguably good, it is apparent even with the performance issues.I wanted to play some more, but the game has decided to chrash on startup without fail.Additional notes: Ran for a while with a i5 3570K @4.2Ghz, paired with a GTX 970 Gigabyte G1 (in a 4x PCI-e 3.0 slot if that matters, didn't seem to hurt other games) 16GB of RAM. Game installed on a 2x 500GB HDD RAID 0, read speeds ~300MBps according to crystal diskmark.From what I have observed trying to validate the games files deletes the game, and then proceeds to redownloading all ~33GB of it.EDIT: I would request a refund, but I got this game with my GPU, so steam cant help there as I never game them money for it. Maybe Nvidia will offer compensation, maybe not, they better, there is a ♥♥♥♥♥torm in the brewing for not only the game, but Nvidia and AMD alike.If you want a batman game get one of the predecessors of this game, they haven't had such issues.

												Update after it was put back on Steam:So the ""re-release"" still has serious performance problems, especially if you're on Windows 10, where Rocksteady's solution is ""just have 12 gigs of memory"". To add insult to injury, by way of half-arsed apology they're handing out copies of the other Batman games, which you probably already own if you're playing the final episode. Poor show. Very poor show.Oh, and a bunch of reviews are now marked ""early access"" or ""pre-release"", which is just a damn lie. The game was released when those reviews were made, and it was a MESS. Update: I tried the DLC that they spent so much time pushing with pre-order begging. You'd have to try hard to make the Harley episode last longer than 10 minutes. I saw the Red Hood DLC on a friend's console, and that's the same. They're just the Campaign Challenges from previous Arkham games, but shorter and less satisfying. Very disappointing and quite insulting after the ridiculous advertising they put behind them.Original review:There's a decent game in there (The first half of the story is genuinely amazing, and while it peters out after that, the mechanics are solid enough to enjoy*), but the performance issues are terrible; I had textures that looked like they might be at home on a Playstation 2 game and still couldn't it to run smoothly, while Witcher 3 will quite happily run on the same setup with most of the options on high or better. I should be getting at least the same kind of quality as you see on, say, the XBox version, but it just isn't happening.I couldn't recommend this game until it has been properly optimised to run at a respectable frame rate. Even then, I'd hesitate; Performance is terrible across all hardware configurations, and that isn't some random bug that could be easily missed. Rocksteady and Warner Bros *knew* that performance was terrible, but they went ahead and released it at €50 anyway, or damn near €100 for the ""premium"" edition. That's a very deliberate action that shows they just don't care about PC releases.*Except the Batmobile. Now, maybe it genuinely handles like a drunken shopping trolley, or maybe it was down to the abysmal performance issues, but it just wasn't satisfying to drive anywhere. I stuck to flying about unless I was forced to use the car.			"

												I´m really glad i got this game as a gift for buying a gtx970 and didn´t pay any money for it!I´m reading a lot about the 30fps lock but that´s fixable within the .ini file as you might have seen already... another thing that really bothers me is the extreme mouse sensitivity which you also have to fix manually...All in all the whole world is just a little too much of everything. Starting with the car that kind of like destroys the whole ""jump&run"" fun that i had with the previous games, then the overloaded hud, gadgets that seem like their only purpose is to boost up the whole character development and so on.I´m really sad that games like assasins creed unity and pretty much all the other new stuff from ubisoft and now WB are going in this direction.My advice: Support the Witcher 3 instead of flaming about Batman AK (which you shouldn´t buy at all). The only Power we gamers have is to ignor♥♥♥♥♥♥games like this and just pay our money for things that are worth it!			"

												I'll ammend the review when the game is more playable.  I made it a few hours in, with only a few crashes here and there - and now my game crashes when I attempt to load my save.  Thusly - unplayable.Now, to look at the game as if it were bug free - yes the graphics are pretty (but yannow, Arkham City and Arkham Asylum still look really good)  but honestly the game has yet to pull me in the way the others have.  The Batmobile and the free driving around the city makes sense, but it completely changes the feel of the genre, especially whenever you have to play the tank game.  Being a passenger in that car must suck - no view, and very near the afterburner.Once the story got going it got interesting, but it takes longer than the others do to pull you in.  And of course, as soon as I became interested, the game breaks.   Again, I'll repost when the game works, but for now --- I think I'm going to go play Arkham City again.			"

												After playing video game since the early 80's I can honestly say, this is the worst game release I have ever experienced HANDS DOWN!!! And I can say this with all honesty and little drama. In short, I can not reccommend this game at all. The quality and lack of concern mean it may never be resolved to a satisfactory standard. Nothing I have seen from WB is encouraging at all.WB knew this game was not ready for release and did it anyway. Along with Rocksteady's collusion, I may add. As a cold buisness decision. And sadly this was not the first time they have done something of this like before and certainly not since, as those of us who bought the game are aware.After a dysmal start, the reports are the patches 4 months after release are still not allowing the game to work properly, and the loyal customers who bought thus game along with season pass, have got nothing in goodwill but cold and frankly out of touch responses and gestures from Warner Brothers.Nothing from the pre release, to the re-release so far, has much in the way of accountability. Such to the extent that by mid summer nothing surpised me about how poor the next course of action (or lack of it) would be. I just knew something was awful was going to happen next, it was just hard to predict what. That longer this saga has gone on, the worse it has gotten. This is way past turd polishing now.WB have shown little interest resolving this, and making amends. Four months on and the game still does not work very well, and a token ""Gift"" to owners of the game of a copy of each of the Batman Arkham games most of us already have. And WB surely know it.Edit: Worth noting that many reviews have been listed as pre release, that have marked it down. They are in fact not pre release, but those who have bought the game at release in June 23 2015. So please be aware of this misconception.			"

And of course, as soon as I became interested, the game breaks.   Again, I'll repost when the game works, but for now --- I think I'm going to go play Arkham City again.			"

												Boring game. Ironically, my issues have nothing to do with the lousy PC port. After a couple minor settings changes, I can play the game at a reasonable clip. Part of what made the Arkham series so special, though, was the visceral hand-to-hand close quartered combat. With  well implemented mechanics, each battle was exciting and satisfying. Wether you liked the more stealthy challenges or taking out a mob with 'batarangs blazing', the previous Arkham titles drew you in to the action in ways few other games could. So I had to wonder what the hell they were thinking making the Batmobile the centerpiece of their latest effort? Maybe they thought they had taken the fighting mechanics about as far as they could? Who knows? But I have never been more frustrated by such awful driving mechanics. Tedious and  annoying I found my self gritting my teeth and clenching my fists as I plowed through the inane Batmobile 'missions', which you have to do to advance the story through nearly (what feels like) 60% of the game.Not even the interesting Batman/Joker schizophrenic illness or some cool new characters could save this mess. After 16 hours, I stopped caring. Congratulations Rocksteady, you've ruined a great series.Maybe your Batmobile can take its place among the other 'greats' like the 1971 Pinto, the 1957 Edsel Corsair or the 1987 Yugo. I'd ask for my money back, but I've played too long ... and 16 hours is way way too long.Lesson learned.			"

												It works fine on my computer, but to be honest, this game is just not as good as its predecessors.  The Batmobile is used to the point of overkill.  The city design feels convoluted and doesn't really make much sense.  The enemies are largely boring compared to Arkham City, espeically the ""street thugs,"" who just run around on the street like ants for no apparent reason.  The aspects of the previous games that I loved so much, like predator mode or solving Riddler puzzels, just aren't as much fun this time around.  I'm 28% through the game and I'm really just bored with it.			"

												The game is a lot of fun, and pretty good, if you can manage to play it. That being said- you probably can't play it right now. Just runs like trash, looks worse than console versions, and has a lot of bugs/memory leaks/crashing issues. 980 GTX can't keep this thing going at 30 fps, and I don't even have all the settings maxed. Save your money, and maybe come back in 3-4 months to see if they bother fixing it. They probably won't though. Not as well as they need to, anyway.			"

												Everyone should know that this game doesn't run well.  That's just a fact.  I waited until the promised final patch of the game to leave a review, because I thought that was fair.  I honestly don't see any difference.  At all.As to the game itself, it's easily the worst Batman game of the series.  That includes Origins. The story, which is what drove me to want to play this game more than any other aspect, was lackluster to say the least.  The batmobile was used in ways that didn't make sense for 80% of the game.  The fact that you had to fight drones as final fights for a large series of fights is sad.Lastly, having to find a billion collectibles to finish the game (currently at 97%) is stupid.  Gotham once more feels like an empty city that is conveniently empty.  I would say only play if your a die hard Batman fan, but any die hard Batman fan would be disappointed by the story.  I don't know who this game is for, or where it merited an M rating.			"

												Runs terribly, even after all the patches.I finished the game and thought it was okay, but after seeing it run on a friend's PS4 I think it's unplayable now. Take from that what you will.In terms of style and content, there were dramatic ups and downs. Repeated bosses, Tedious with a capital T Riddler trophies, disengenious statements about the identity of the antagonist, a weird, unsatisfying ending, out of character actions by Batman that feel more like the late 90's toy playsets brought to life rather than actual things Batman might do.That one character was brilliantly woven through the game though. And I maybe would have enjoyed a full game of the TankMobile arena minigame.			"

												Game itself is incredible. Rocksteady have put their heart and soul into every detail of this game, and it shows. Playing as Batman is as fun as ever, and the addition of the Batmobile feels like an extension of Batman himself (as it should). Even the tank sections (which have received criticism elsewhere) are enjoyable in my opinion.But the PC port.......is TERRIBLE. Arkham City was also near-broken at launch on PC, but nowhere near to this level. NONE of the NVIDIA features are usable, despite the advertising. And the biggest crime of all is that ITS BEEN DOWNGRADED FOR PC. This is a joke. No hi-res textures have been released for this version (but I hope they do in future) and the performance is borderline unplayable. The Arkham games are my favourite games of all time, so this has shaken my faith severely and negatively affected my playing experience.			"

												I've been wanting to review this game since it was first released in June, but I held back because of the game being pulled from the Steam store and the fact that it was still messy after it was released again. But I decided to review the game anyway, but I'm going to start off with one important thing.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC.Yes, although I'm giving this game a positive review, this review is based on the game just in general, not solely the PC version. Since I only played it on PC, there will be some bias here. However, I'm going to try and keep this review as generalized towards all console versions as possible. GraphicsThe heaviest blow compared to the other versions, Arkham Knight's graphics were indeed just ""meh"" compared to the other versions of the game. That being said, however, it's still a fairly pretty game. The rain looks pretty for me, and is used nicely. However, the overall feel I had with the game wasn't all that ""dark"" or ""evil,"" but rather just bland. The atmosphere wasn't all that thrilling for the most part. But then again, PC bias could just be kicking in here.GameplayThe combat is the smoothest out of all of the Arkham games. It's fast-paced, intense, and very fluid. I had a blast beating up thugs and is one of the strongest points Arkham Knight has to offer. The Batmobile is the main part I would like to discuss about the gameplay. I wasn't AGAINST the Batmobile being in the game. Seeing how large Gotham City is, I wouldn't mind having some quick transportation to get from one place to another. It didn't disappoint for the most part in game. However, my main qualm with it all is the fact that the Batmobile was crammed into the game as much as possible. If you want to show off a new feature to a game, that's fine, but abusing it just ruins the experience. The tank form is especially annoying to me. You'll soon realize that 90% of the time, you're just destroying wave after wave of drone vehicles when you could just face the militia soldiers head-on. This leads to the ""boss fights"" to be incredibly disappointing. The side missions were also fairly interesting, but I wasn't entirely hooked to them. They were satisfactory, but nothing to write home about. In the end, the gameplay is definitely a mixed bag that's still above average.StoryThe story is definitely the best part to Arkham Knight. It was actually very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The scenes with the Joker were especially interesting. Sometimes, they might be really annoying, but I could still manage them. When the game reached the climax, I was actually genuinely WORRIED whether or not Batman would be able to survive the wrath of Scarecrow or not. The final mission was amazing and also mind-bending. Plus, the twists were very well played and added onto the very enjoyable main story. The one glaring flaw with the storyline in my eyes was the fact that the Arkham Knight's identity is fairly predictable if you're a Batman fan like myself. But, there wasn't many other people cut for the Arkham Knight role, so it was a reasonable choice. The side mission stories were somewhat decent, but it depends on which one you're doing. But, in the end, the main storyline is awesome and was an excellent way to end the Arkham series.AudioNot much to say here when it comes to music. When it comes to voice acting, it's a mixed bag. On one hand, you have people like Joker and Scarecrow, who were interesting and enjoyable to listen to. Batman, however, wasn't the best when it came to voice acting. He seemed very cheesy, and although that's what he's often known for, it didn't feel right in a game like this.ReplayabilityDespite Arkham Knight's large world full of different things to do, you more than likely won't get too much replayability out of the game. Aside from 100%ing it, you won't stick around for long unless you worship the game. There isn't really much else to say, as it depends on how much you enjoy the game.VerdictArkham Knight is definitely not the best Arkham game in the series. However, it isn't a horrible game. There was so much potential with the game that it isn't deserving of a GotY award in my eyes, but it's still a fairly enjoyable experience that you should be able to have some fun with the game.Graphics - 7.5/10Gameplay - 7.0/10Story - 9.0/10Audio - 7.5/10Replayability - 6.5/10.:7.9/10:.+Excellent way to finish off the series+Villain voice acting was very well done+Smooth and fluid combat+Main story was interesting from start to finish-Side missions were usually fairly boring-Batmobile was overused-Very disappointing boss battles-Graphics seemed bland			"

Well, their solution to fixing these performance issues is by just turning off all GameWorks features and running the game on Med-Low no matter how beefy your rig is.Do not buy this game.

Me thinks there was a reason for the 30FPS lock and lack of anything higher than Normal textures.Luckily I paid £15.99 but was it worth it.. Nope! These developers moan about people pirating their games.. Well it’s because of crap like this people do not want to give you money.  PS: Dont let the benchmarking tool fool you..

This game is beautiful!But after the first patch I'm not able to start the game with high quality textures. I had to use BMT every time before starting the game. Which sucks because it loads the game with normal or low textures. My system is damn good enough to run at pretty high end side but the game doesn't responds to that settings and crashes on start!

There was so much potential with the game that it isn't deserving of a GotY award in my eyes, but it's still a fairly enjoyable experience that you should be able to have some fun with the game.Graphics - 7.5/10Gameplay - 7.0/10Story - 9.0/10Audio - 7.5/10Replayability - 6.5/10.:7.9/10:.+Excellent way to finish off the series+Villain voice acting was very well done+Smooth and fluid combat+Main story was interesting from start to finish-Side missions were usually fairly boring-Batmobile was overused-Very disappointing boss battles-Graphics seemed bland			"

												Holy Port Problems, Batman!  Another poorly optimized Console to PC port.  I thought I'd learned my lesson with AC:U.  Nope.  Most of my two hour play-time has been spent trying to optimize my performance.  I've been lucky so far, Watch Dogs and GTAV ran fine...great at max detail.Something obviously slipped through the cracks here.I'm still digging around for fixes and tweaks, but only a Patch from the Developer can fix...maybe.Advice?  Hold onto your Bat-Cash till it gets a Bat-Patch.  There's a great game under there....somewhere, but not many people have found it. "

												Patch has not fixed the problems that make this game unplayable. Cannot recommend. I have one more Arkham game to replay before I reach this next part of the series. If I cannot play it by then I will not play it until I can buy it for ten dollars on a steam sale. So very disappointed, this games series has been cutting a lot of corners it shouldn't have had to.			"

												Its what happens when you out source your AAA game to another studio to do a port for PC, specially when the studio isn't big. I can play it but just barely, no crashes but the FPS drops makes it annoying in combat and lagg happens a lot. The game won't be ready for many for a long time. Even early access games runs better than Arkham Knight. Expect this fixed when DayZ is in full retail release or when Star Citizen comes out.EDIT; Completed and had no intentions of a second playthrough, anyway nice campaign/story and mechanics but I have. Basically completed>uninstall>not going through the game getting constant lag spikes and fps drops.. specially during combat that♥♥♥♥♥♥is a pain.			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥ it runs at 30fps. This game looks worse than ♥♥♥♥ing arkham origins and runs so much worse, crashes and stutters. The batmobile is fun when you get above 50fps (from the .ini file fix), but you don't on open ground which sucks, the combat is really fun, but I'd recommend  just playing custom maps from city.			"

												There it is: Arkham Knight sucks! Somehow this game has some nice moments. But you´ll find them in Asylum and in City before. There´s been enough said and written about the crappy status at launch, now the game should run somehow. But the total game killer for me is the Batmobile. At first I liked it and the moment you first enter it feels great. - But a couple of hours later when you start to realize how strong this game is built around the Batmobile it´s just a big immersive killer for me. This overpowered tank (imho) has nothing to do with the Batman universe I know. - And please where the **** should The Riddler know the complete drive-and action abilities of the Batmobile so he can build his riddles around it... Please...So if you liked the first two so much as I do leave this game out of your libary. It is a huge disappointment in relation to it´s predecessors.			"

												With the overwhelming amount of negative reviews that address nothing about the game itself but rather its poor launch (which has since been patched and its performance vastly improved), I feel compelled to cast my vote in the “recommended” column as this is a tremendous finish to one of the best action/adventure videogame series ever. Arkham Knight is a Batman game for the new generation - everything fans love about the series returns amplified & refined in ways not possible on older platforms. The environment is denser, much of it interactive and teeming with detail, the already great beat 'em up combat system is added to & improved upon, enemy AI is noticeably better, the movement is more fluid & dynamic and enhances the ways in which you navigate the landscape, the weather & atmosphere change dramatically throughout the course of the game, the set pieces are remarkably grand in scale, sound design is stellar (including one of the best videogame soundtracks in recent memory), and Gotham - while slightly smaller overall - is more vibrant and fully conceived than ever.Arkham Knight doesn't have much going for it in terms of innovation; rather, it builds off the brilliant foundation the series began with in Arkham Asylum. As with its predecessors, you're tasked with main storyline missions and a dozen-odd side quests to undertake. This being the final chapter in the saga, it goes out with all cylinders firing. The dark surrealism from the previous games is still present, as is the sense of mystery & tension, the action-packed, free roaming-based variety of missions, and the extremely colorful cast of characters (I'd argue that Batman has the best villains of any superhero franchise). What Arkham Knight lacks in innovation it makes up for in refinement, excellent writing & execution, and the addition of the Batmobile, which gives players an incredible amount of new things to do. While grappling and gliding from building to building remains the fastest way to reach your destination (and is faster and more responsive than ever), I often found myself taking the Batmobile instead because driving it is amazingly fun. It defies physics in the best possible ways - you rarely drive into things and need to reverse because so much of the environment is interactive and the Batmobile just plows through almost anything in your way. It switches to combat mode at the touch of a button, instantly turning it into a tank that handles more like a levitating quadruped than a four-wheel vehicle. You'll find yourself catching details you may miss when gliding over them and wind up taking on an arbitrary task or ten before finally reaching your intended destination. The Batmobile is also creatively incorporated into environmental puzzles that are solved by remotely controlling it from a separate location.It's truly a shame that the initial PC release was so poorly optimized that it's tainted the game's reputation forever, as the subsequent fixes have solved many of those issues and left us with a very playable game. Naturally, performance varies from system to system - on my i7-5930k / GTX 1070 build, this runs at maximum graphics settings with the highest framerate (sadly, there is a framerate lock, but at least it goes up to 90FPS), and at worst, the framerate will dip on occasion, though never to the point where it's detrimental to the overall experience - but even on older or mid-range PCs, this has made vast strides from where it began. Arkham Knight lives up to the epic scope of of the Batman Arkham series and concludes it with honors. Apart from the main story missions, you have a lot side quests to cover (Riddler trophies & challenges, AR training & challenge missions that test your skills and wits in various gameplay scenarios, capture- and defend-the-base type missions, character-based subplots that offer insight into a handful of Gotham's supervillains), and while it may not quite live up to the near-perfect grandeur of Arkham City, Arkham Knight sits right alongside it in terms of quality and surpasses it in some areas. I had my doubts after Arkham Origins' many missteps and blunders, but this is a fitting end to the series that no fan should miss out on.(My nomination for ""Villain Most In Need Of A Hug"" in the 2016 Steam Awards) "
