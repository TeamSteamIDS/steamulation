												I recommend it but with some significant caveats.The puzzles are very easy, so it is best thought of as a diversion than than a challenge. The game needs to be played a minimum of five times through to see every ending for every character, and long, slow ladder-climbing animations sometimes slow sections down to a tedious crawl. There’s a noticeable systematic use of padding to artificially increase playtime, a very obnoxious practice.The stories for the individual characters are serviceable but kind of shallow so it’s not really a strong story-telling game. In particular the ""good"" endings for the characters make little sense and feel like an afterthought, as if they were too skittish to make a game full of nothing but lurid black comedy.The reason I still recommend it is that the atmosphere and humor are quite good, so I enjoyed the game despite how sloppy it is in a few places. I wouldn’t advise paying full price for it, though.			"

												I'm not a fan of puzzle games but I must say I enjoyed The Cave so much. The game is charming, funny and clever. Animations, musics and voice acting is awesome. Premise of the game is, there are 7 characters and you pick 3 of them at the begining of the game and try to get them out of the cave. Each character has a different story, a unique skill and their own levels. In order to get everyone out of the cave you need to play it at least 3 times. If you want to see everything the game has to offer (there are two endings for each character) you need at least 5 playthroughs. This may sound boring, but puzzle solving in this game is really fun. Also depending on your characters and the items you picked along the way, you can find some shortcuts in some levels.Long story short, even if you're not a fan of the genre, I say give this game a chance. You will not regret it.			"

												The Cave is an ambitious adventure game that has quite a lot going for it: Beautiful cartoonish art design. A twisted yet charming sense of humor. Quality voice work. Fun puzzles and scenarios that are interesting and just the right difficulty. Several playable characters, each one with their own unique themed level. And despite being limited to 30 FPS, the game still feels quite smooth (much less of a problem than I anticipated).Unfortunately, it's not without flaws. The controls are very floaty which makes platforming imprecise. The story-telling has its moments but feels a bit shallow at times. Worst of all, because you're tasked with controlling three characters at once, you'll find yourself constantly switching between them and moving them one by one. This gets repetitive very quickly and becomes more of a hassle than anything. Why there was no option to control all three at once is beyond me, but it could've gone a long way towards eliminating the annoying backtracking that hampers the game's pacing.While the game's significant backtracking/pacing issues keep it from being truly great, The Cave still excels at being a fun and humorous adventure game. One that warrants multiple playthroughs if you hope to experience everything it has to offer.			"

												I only review games I think are good, and I think this is Good.  9/10.This is a platform puzzle adventure game that takes about 5 hours to complete, but you should play through several times to get all the charactors to the end. and its on the second+ playthrough you start to notice little changes to the maps, story ect.Pros...Story ( if you pay attention ).Graphics.Sound + Music.Animation.Voice Acting is excellent.Cons...Lack of a Hint system ( you may want to use the Steam Guides ).May seem repetitive trying to get all Charactors to the end.I am glad I bought it and would buy again, Hoping they make The Cave 2.

												The Cave is set up like an old-school 2D side-scroller.  Seven adventurers, each with a dark past, go down into a magical cave in a journey of self discovery.  At the beginning of the game (which is narrated throughout by The Cave itself), you choose three of the seven advernturers and descend.  Each section of The Cave is a puzzle that requires your three characters to work together.  Three of the sections are uniquely designed (by the sentient Cave) for the characters you've chosen.  In this way, The Cave encourages you to play though multiple times.The drawback is that there's also three generic puzzle sections which you cannot skip.  I'm on my second playthrough, and while it's nice that the game shuffles the order of the puzzles, it can be a drag to re-solve old puzzles to get to new content.  And the achievements require you to play through the game... I don't know how many times, but I imagine The Cave's jokes (while clever) will start to wear thin on the fifth playthrough.  If you really want to get 100% achievements, you might consider reviewing the achievement list online before you play, despite the mild spoilers.I'd still recommend this game - the humor, art and story make this puzzle game very enjoyable and encourage multiple playthroughs.  May get monotonous if you're looking for all the achievements.A definite buy if it's on sale.			"

												Don't be fooled by that co-op tag, this game is NOT co-op in any enjoyable way. Unless you enjoy watching your friend do complicated, drawn-out puzzles for 20 minutes then do not play this game with others. There is no split-screen or way to view your character while your friend plays theirs, you can only view one at a time. During certain parts of the game it forces you to play a single character for an entire level, leaving any friends you might be playing with to sit and be forced to watch you try and figure it out for the entire duration.The levels are also unnecessarily big for what they need to be, leaving you to run around up and down ladders and ropes just to extend the play time. This game might be enjoyable by yourself if you like running/climbing simulators, but I didn't find anything enjoyable about it at all. I'm glad I bought it on sale and it's definitely not worth the standard price.			"

												The Cave was a big disappointment for me. I used to consider myself a Double Fine fan, considering practically every DF title to be an instant purchase. However, I consider their more recent releases to be of much lower quality than I would expect from a developer I admired so. The Cave was the first of these.First off, as a puzzle platformer, most of the puzzles in the game aren't particularly challenging or interesting, often consisting of a simple ""find key, open door."" Some puzzle mechanics are fun, such as the Time Traveller's ability to alter events in the past to change a level's layout in the future. Mechanics such as these aren't very common, as many of the puzzles are generic so that any character can complete them, likely to avoid conflicts in your party composition.Every character has their own backstory which covers how or why they arrived at the titular Cave, but after going through the first couple of characters' levels, you'll notice the common theme pretty quickly and the story exploration becomes uninteresting. It almost feels like an attempt to make ""another Psychonauts"" by the nature of its writing, with The Cave's backstory exploration echoing similarly to the repressed memories in Psychonauts. However, many may find The Cave's characterization extremely lacking in comparison. Its humor is there but it lacks the quality writing underneath which made other DF titles work so well.The Cave tops off its first (very short, no more than 4-5 hour) playthrough with a picture montage (yet again reminiscent of the repressed memories in Psychonauts) and a text notification informing you that you have beaten The Cave, rather than any sort of proper ending. The Cave encourages the player to go through the game at least three times to unveil every character's backstory, with the game not ""actually"" being beaten until then. Due to the repetition of solving many of the same puzzles across each playthrough, I was not interested in finishing the game a second time. The writing wasn't even interesting enough to convince me to power through the repetition of doing them again.All in all, despite its many weak points, The Cave has a few interesting puzzle mechanics that make it worth playing, especially if it can be grabbed for 75% off or more. Unless it's a title you are very interested in, however, I'd avoid it altogether.			"

												I am quite the fan of Double Fines work, and I’m glad to say this game wasn't a let-down for me. I've heard it didn't get the best reviews, but in all honesty, i think they couldn't be more wrong. You start your adventure choosing your selection of characters, there is about 7 completely different characters, with different personalities, story lines and lives. All looking to venture through the cave to find something they desire. You pick three at a time, so it takes about 3 play throughs to see each story. I found the way you navigate the cave quite clever, your characters can only get into the section that’s for one of the three, so you aren’t dragging yourself through stories for people that aren’t even there. Then you have the same in-between puzzles that are the same on each play through. so you do a general puzzle, a characters story, general, story and go on like that until you have reached the end. Where even at the end you have a choice, to change the path of your characters. A sort of, ""choose your ending"", kind of thing. I didn't notice it at first. So completing it 3 times to see all the characters, then realising you could change the end, i completed it 3 more times. Even though the second 3 times were repetitive, i still enjoyed it a whole lot and didn't get bored. The game has a wonderful kind of humour i love seeing in Double Fines games. ""The Cave"" as you know from the trailer, talks. He’s quite quirky and makes the journey that little more engaging. You can also collect fun little paintings along the way that opens up a little more about the past of your characters; you learn why they are there and what it is they are searching for.The puzzles aren’t too difficult, and are somewhat easy to figure out, which personally, i liked. I hate getting stuck on a game, it “throws off my grove”. I only got stuck once, but after a break and a think, i had it. It flowed well for me and i even went as far as to collect all the achievements for the game, which one in particular proves this game has replay ability for me. All in all, I loved this game. And I think it’s worth a try, despite what some reviews have said about it. It has great gameplay, nice music/ambient sounds, interesting characters and story lines, fun puzzles and a quirky sense of humour.Double Fine, you've done it again.TL;DR : Fun, several playthroughs worth of replayability, great sense of humour, fun/quite simple puzzles and is worth every penny.

												The Cave is a Double Fine adventure game looking like it's trying to be one of the old Lucas Arts titles back in the 90's with promise of witty writing and a unique gaming experience with each play through. The game allows you to pick three of the seven characters available and use your team to explore the deepest part of the cave each with their own story but the characters you pick have no personality, do not speak,  do not interact with the other players and are only used as ways to access a specific dungeon that tells a small story to said characters. The Cave works on a linear level like progression where each part has one main puzzle and each puzzle plays out the same, collect certain items that each character can hold only one of . Use Item A on mechanism B to open the next area. This would not be so bad if you did not have to control three separate characters at one time to pick up only one item and having to traverse a platform -esque dungeon to get to the other side, trying to micromanage where each player must be using some poor platforming and slow movements.One of the biggest turn offs to the game is once your first run through is completed you get to go through the game again with another three players but the dungeons and puzzles all stay the same apart from the characters cave segment but with seven characters this means you will have to play the game three times with the last run through having players you have already played before! These short slideshow endings are most definitely not worth it.The dialogue is mildly entertaining, limited and delivered mostly by the narration which  does repeat itself on each replay.The game has a lot of charm and character but these alone will not hold up next to poorly implemented game design, mechanics and for a title that is trying to encourage replayabillity it comes off incredibly shallow.

												The Cave is an unusual but fun puzzle game. Unlike other puzzle games, The Cave ultilizes much dark humor and sarcasm in puzzle solving process to keep the player interested in. At the beginning The player have to choose 3 out of 7 characters to start the adventure into a cave. But the journey would differ according to the characters you select since each character have his/her unique story and challenge. That means the player must play at least 3 times to complete the whole story. And each character has two entirely different endings: bad and happy ending. Hence more tries might be required if the player want to see all the endings. The story exclusive to each specific character is absolutely the essence of this puzzle game. Apart from unexpected solution and idea everywhere, most importantly, the storyteller seems to intentionally hide his/her life philosphy in the puzzle solving process. Unfortunately I have to keep secret about this to avoid spoiling other players' fun.			"

												Every gamer has a Videogame Guru, Idol, an iconic, inspiring figure. For me, since I consider myself ad adventure gamer, it was a no brainer, mine is Ron Gilbert. I don't think I have to explain why. So, The Cave.Good things first. The Cave is funny (and the Cave's voice is HILARIOUS). It's Ron Gilbert funny, there are so many references, jokes, even the torches on the walls are funny in this game. The gamepad control system works fine, making the game highly enjoyable even on consoles, which is something new for an adventure. Having to choose three characters to descend in the Cave from a pool of seven guarantees a good replayability, since you have to beat the game at least 3 times to explore all the personal sections. Now the things I didn't like much. The game is easy. I understand that to take adventure games in the next century we NEED to include new players and not only the hardcore old times fans, but still, I really wanted to get stuck, for old times sake :D and, on a different matter, the Cave as a character IS great, but this gameplay choice (platforming based puzzle solving) completely eliminates dialogue, which was Ron Gilbert's old point and click adventures real added value. Don't misunderstand me, I LOVED The Cave, but maybe my expectations were too high, I liked to dream about a gamechanging title, while this one is probably a first step, hopefully in the right direction, to really innovate the genre. If there's one person who can do it, that person is Ron Gilbert.			"

												A puzzle platformer in which you chose 3/7 characters and go on an adventure in a talking cave, finding out that each character is not so secretly evil (or maybe not). For a puzzle platformer, the puzzles are insanely easy. This comes from the ability to only pick up one item per character at a time. So there is no puzzle that requires multiple inventory actions on a single puzzle. The puzzles are also fairly obvious, either way:   *You need to cheat a ""guess your weight"" game. You have a barbell and a magician that can turn items invisible to help you.   *You need to use an elevator, but the fuse is missing, luckily there's a fusebox with a fuse on the other side of the map that doesn't do anything.  Not to mention that the puzzles are padded to increase the length of the game. There's a part where you need your companions to stand on different colored pressure plates while the third navigates a maze. Rather than just doing it once or twice to demonstrate that you understand the mechanics, you have to do it half a dozen times. The worse is a mansion themed level which is 4 stories tall and you constantly have to run up and down the halls to complethete it. Additionally, the puzzles have similar solutions. This one is especially heinous. There are a total of 13 levels in the game and 7 of them are character specific while the others are generalized. Of those 6 general levels 2 of them have no puzzles. On top of that, the last 2 generalized levels have the exact same solution which involves tricking an NPC with a tape recorder. This is inexcusable and really shows they were running out of ideas. Speaking of levels, when you enter character specific levels, your other two members become dead weight except for occassionally weighing down other objects. In the mansion themed level, your other two party members can't even be used. To make matters worse, there's a mine themed level where you need to navigate 3 levles of labyrinth like mazes, which is fairly time consuming. The catch is that every time you complete the puzzle on one of these levels, you need to individually walk each of the 3 members up to the next level and insert them in the puzzle. Its frustrating, time consuming, and only serves to pad the game. Luckily, the environment and style are pretty good and 2 of the NPCs are even charming. Finally, the game has no replay value, despite requiring a minimum of 5 replays to get all 14 endings. The puzzles are even easier once you know the solution, there's no reason to speed run, so you play the entire game again just to find out the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending for a character, which becomes pretty obvious before you even get it. *No replay value, but many replays.  To make matters worse, with a group of 3 comprised from 7 characters, you're 3rd play, you'll only be expericing 1 new level.For all of these reasons, I cannot recommend The Cave, even though there were parts that I liked.

												The cave is a wonderful fantstic amazing game with one crippling flaw. In an attempt to make it replayable, you can pick three characters, each of whom have a good and bad ending. And the number of characters doesn't divide by three. There's seven, so you have to play the game three times to see all the basic content, but there's extensive sections that remain the same each time. If you want every ending, that's five playthroughs! (you can get the alternate endings for the first two characters as you're taking number 7 through for the first time.)If only it weren't for that, it would be an incredible puzzling charming and genuinely funny game. Even with that it kept me playing five times. And yet, my abiding memory is one of boredom. It's unfortunate that's the lasting experience of what should have been a great game.			"

												Adventure?Puzzle?Platform?Point and click?How about all of the above?It is a combination of all of these so that certainly makes it ""different"" sort of game ---- but there is some fun to be had here, if you can tolerate the rather slow pace (due mostly to a ton of backtracking).Kind of slow getting started, but you pick your three characters from the seven offered (each with a different story), and off you go to various parts of the cave itself. And the cave is beautiful, and fun to explore. Some of the puzzles are super easy, others not so much. But even though the pacing is slow, the game itself looks like it will be short. The replay value is good though ---- just choose different characters for each playthrough. And with all the slow walking and backtracking, that kind of pads out the game length. I guess I just expected more, because I kept waiting for the pace to pick up, but it didn't.So I'm glad I got it on sale, and that's how I'll recommend the game with some reservation ---- 75% off only, I would think.

												I loved this game--this is everything I think a platformer should be. It's quirky, with unusual puzzles that are the right blend of tricky, but not unduly difficult. If you pay close attention to your environment you can solve all the puzzles with ease, but they do take some observation.There are seven characters to choose from and you play three (why oh why game developers didn't you make 6 or 9 for two or three distinct playthroughs?) and you'll work through each of their individual stories. This game took me roughly four hours to complete a single playthrough and it looked something like this:  Opening puzzles, character story, puzzle A, character story, puzzle B, character story, puzzle C, ending. My assumption is that puzzles A,B,C will remain the same for each playthrough, and only the character stories will change depending on which character you choose. I also don't get the impression that you can CHANGE how the character stories end--I think you're firmly on the rails here but that okay with me because that's how this particular game was built. This game is the cotton candy at a state fair. Are you proud that you've finished it? Eh, not really. But damn it was good while it lasted.			"

												The Cave is such a mixed bag I'm honestly not sure if I can give it a recommendation or not. I was equally frustrated by the game for as much as it charmed me. The Cave is a hybrid point-and-click adventure paired with the mechanics of a platformer. You're given a choice of seven characters to choose from (An Adventurer, Knight, Scientist, Time-Traveler, Hillbilly, pair of Twins, and Monk), each of which can change the journey of your playthrough. The art design of the game is lovely and the voice work is doubly so. It has that Monkey Island charm that Ron Gilbert is so well-known for and it shows through the many humorous spouts of dialogue from the narrator and various people you meet in the cave. There are lots of little touches that will please even the most picky of gamers and it's in my opinion that the charm of this game is easily one of its strongest components. The objective of the game is to discover the backstories of each character through a series of illustrations unlocked by finding symbols on the walls of the cave. At the start of each game you select 3 characters to journey through the cave with, each with a unique level attributed to them. Some are fun, such as the Knight's level in-which you steal an amulet from a dragon and end up destroying the kingdom in the process, but some are just tedious, such as the Adventurer's level, filled with puzzles that give you no indication of how to solve them. Along the way you play through each character's origin story which involves puzzle solving, block pushing, item-using, and so on. It's just such a shame that the endings of each character (of which there are two for each), only involve still pictures and no sort of interactive elements. If you want to get the opposite ending, you have to play through the entire game again with no real changes to the levels. The gameplay of The Cave can best be described as ""tedious"", and for a game that depends on multiple playthroughs this is a big problem. Sorry Ron, but this adventure just wasn't up to par.			"

												The Cave is a 2D side-scroller, puzzle platformer game. You choose a combination of 3 out of the 7 characters and descend to the Cave. The Cave features great humor and comedy especially the narration itself. The puzzles are not that challenging. Only two character stories gave me a hard a time. (The Monk and The Time Traveler) Each character story has their own key puzzle part. (meaning a ""hard"" part of the story) The combination of characters you choose affects your path through the cave but not entirely since there will be parts of your journey where you'll be doing the same puzzle over and over again especially when you tend to miss quite a lot of the collectible Cave paintings. For the whole part, the Cave is a bit short since I'm more indulged in heavy puzzle games making The Cave puzzles not much of a challenge but it's a game worth playing. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience a humor and comedy like no other with the addition of great stories and a puzzle platformer gameplay. This price is a bit too high for the game itself so I also highly encourage anyone to buy it when it's on sale, more preferably when it's on a 66% discount or higher.Pros:+ Good graphics+ Great narration (has a lot of humor)+ Has great storylines with their own unique twists (One story per character)Cons:+ The puzzles are very repetitive when you want to clear the game with a new set of characters.+ The Price is too much for the gameplay itself.Overall, it's a great game and I totally enjoyed the game and story despite the easy puzzles.

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: 2d Puzzle PlatformerThe Good+ The main premise is that there are 7 unique characters, you choose 3 to control as you make your way through the cave. Each character has their own unique level associated with them. This provides some level of replayability. + The levels themselves are fun to play and each one provides its own unique puzzles to solve which makes the game interesting. +Nice graphical art style+ Game controls nicely with gamepadThe AverageLike most games that focus on humor, the dialogue can be very hit or miss. It can be a short game if you don't bother to replay it with the other characters. The Bad- Because you have to switch between 3 characters to solve the puzzles in the game, this creates a lot of needless backtracking. A lot of the puzzles themselves revolve around you going to one side of the map picking up an item and having to go back to the other side. Over time this starts become very tedious.  ConclusionThis is a very charming game, something you would normally expect from Ron Gilbert and Double Fine. If you get this game, you are playing it to experience the different scenarios each character has to offer along with the puzzles that come along with them.   "

												""The Cave"" is made by that guy at Double Fine that everybody loves, and has you traverse The Cave attraction, an interactive Cave which has you explore the inner desires of the adventurers (3) that you take control of.The Cave is brimming with personality and humour, and for the first playthrough (4 hours) if an absolute treat. However, afterwards is where it falls flat. The game provides you with 7 heroes, each with a different story. Your first playthrough, you can complete 3. Your second you can do another 3, and then you have 1 left over.Now, a second playthrough has you play 3 more heroes in several identical zones, with no change of Act 1 or 3, just Act 2, meaning the majority of the game is the same as the first run. The last run is even worse, as you need to perform only 1 scenario different with 1 new hero.This math problem, and poor level/game design, leads you to completing it once with absolutely no desire to do it again, which is a huge shame!The game is fun and bright and whimsical, and I'd love to complete it again, but I refuse to force myself through recycled content for the sake of completion. I look forward to patches/new DLC (hopefully?) which might improve/resolve this.Is it worth it for 4 hours? I thought so, but you might disagree.Nilesy			"

												Yet another action-puzzle-adventure game by Double-Fine, taking place in a world called The Cave, where you'll lead 7 different characters (6 playthroughs for all endings) on a journey of redemption. You'll see the world from different point of views as each character will encounter different obstacles during the journey. As with other Schafer's games, this one is filled with humour, there're many funny situations every now and then.Although game is fun, there're some locations which are same for every character, so you'll need to pass them 6 times if you want to see all endings, which can be tedious (they're not very long though). Ofcourse, you can choose to see only 1 ending for each character and play this game 3 times, but point of this game is to see all endings and lectures to be learned :)Fun little game from Double Fine. Recommended.			"

												This game is pretty bold in its mix of traditional point and click adventure aspects and jump and run mechanics. You choose 3 out of 7 characters, who all come with their unique abilities, background story and areas. You move around by climbing ladders and ropes. There are common areas where you need all three characters to solve the puzzles and specific character areas that need the respective character's ability to be solved.The puzzles are stupidly hard, I played this game with my partner, and we couldn't of finished it without the aid of the walkthrough. You would need some very critical thinking in order to get past the second level without some sort of guide.As this was my partners first proper PC game she had played, apart from Sims and WoW, I think it did a very good job of introducing different game mechanics for people who haven't even played this sort of game before.This title is not very linear, which will catch many modern gamers by surprise, who are used to heavy handed scripted playing. The humor is dark and entertaining, so are the individual stories behind the characters. The art and mood is amazing in here too.The annoying part of the game is that you often at times have to walk back and forth to solve puzzles, which is compounded by the fact that you sometimes need to move three characters to a specific location. A character summon function would have been handy here. But that doesn't ruin an excellent gaming experience for a low price. I hope the younger gamers will appreciate it despite the lack of heavy scripting from newer games. We both thoroughly enjoyed the game, but like I said, without the aid of a walkthrough, I fear there may of been an argument at times at deciding which way to do the puzzle!Check out more reviews on http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												This is a beautifull puzzle game from a graphic/sound/music perspective. The gnu/linux(steamos) port is really bad regarding the smoothness of the animation, but it works (radeon open source driver on a powerfull R9 280X).It's really a good time. The puzzles were ""just right"" for me. But be warned of one thing which could *really* get on the nerves of some gamers: if you want to fully complete the game, you will have to start over many times and redo several times the same puzzles.

												Pretty good puzzle platformer with use-this-on-that adventure game mechanics. Pretty funny, if not hokey at times.The main mechanic is that you choose three of seven characters, each with different ""powers,"" to run through these puzzle scenarios catered to them. Unfortunately, because there are seven characters and you only play three at a time, that means you have to do three runs, the last of which you have to play with two dudes you've already played. Kind of goofy.			"

												The Cave is a game for those with a great sense of humor.Choose 3 among 7 characters, each one has a story, level and special power of their own. Solve each of the puzzles and find out the truth in their hearts, as the Cave would say. Yes, the Cave narrates the entire game (D-d-don't laugh! It makes dating hell.).While you get surprised (or not) with each part of the rich story revealed in each level, laugh at the commentaries made by The Cave and the way out of the dangers to you and your fellow companions.Certainly not a AAA title but the price really pays out the fun. Definitely worth it.			"

												This is an A+ Game, mix the best parts of a platform with the best from a graphic adventure and add an excellent portion of the finest humor you could find inside a videogame. Longevity is not so great, you can terminate the game in just one day, but you can replay it with different characters, each of them unlock different scenarios and puzzles, specially if you're into Steam achievements, you'll need to replay it using different combinations  to complete all of them.Highly recommended to anyone who love a videogame as a form of art and not just as an entertainment.My Final Score is 96 /100  "

												GNU/Linux compatibilty:Good, but apparently I had some graphics issue, which caused some hints to be missing in the game. (Wall paintings giving you the necessary patterns to solve a puzzle and an achievement. The puzzle and achievement can still be solved/obtained through brute force or by following a walkthrough, so it does not prevent finishing the game completely.)I'm guessing it's related to graphics drivers and maybe some unsupported shading systems. Perhaps solvable, but I didn't feel the need to spend time fixing it. Overall the game ran fine by default.The game itself:It's ok, fun the first time you try each level, but then quickly gets repetitive and frustrating when you try to get all endings and achievements...Bugs:It's possible to get the characters stuck in random places, in which case you need to exit the game with alt+F4.Luckily, there are a lot of checkpoints, so it's not a big issue.Tested on Kubuntu 16.04 with Plasma 5.Video Card:    Driver:  Intel Open Source Technology Center Mesa DRI Intel(R) Ivybridge Mobile x86/MMX/SSE2    Driver Version:  3.0 Mesa 11.2.0    OpenGL Version: 3.0			"

												The Cave is a very nice example of how to make an adventure game. It doesn't require you to rub every item in your vast inventory against every other item in the hopes of finding a solution only to realise you have to travel all the way back to that other area to get something or other. No, The Cave has fairly modest and self contained areas, and it doesn't even give you an inventory so you don't have to worry about vast item combinations. You just hold one thing per character, and once you move onto the next area you can pretty much just drop anything you're holding and not worry about having to go back to a previous zone (because you can't). It's just light-hearted and humorous adventure gaming with some platforming thrown in to keep you engaged. I did find one of the puzzles to be poorly designed, and the Knight seems to have a few clipping issues where he gets stuck in the ground (albeit a rare occurrence), but overall it's a very enjoyable game to play. 7 out of 10, would spelunk.

												The Cave is a fun, enjoyable adventure, but it has a few flaws.Let us begin with the good things it has to offer. It has a good sense of humor, even though some of it is hit-and-miss. It also does a decent job at managing the multiple stories. You'll be playing with 3 (out of 7) characters at the same time, all with their own story. As a result there's also a bit of replay value there for those who absolutely enjoyed it all the way through. And while I liked it there were still a few things that bothered me. The first and most obvious are the blurry graphics. Yes, it uses a certain style, but it was still below my expectations. It's nothing groundbreaking, not as a game or an engine, so I expected better here. The characters are well animated though. It reminded me of something... I can't quite put my finger on it. But I do know is that I've seen this animation style before. The puzzles are actually pretty decent and require some thinking. I had to use a walkthrough more than once. You see, I'm not that bright ;) And except for The Walking Dead (which isn't really a traditional adventure anyway), (point-and-click) adventures usually aren't my cup of tea.So forgive me if I say that I won't be playing it again with any of the other characters. One playthrough was more than enough for me. Like I said, it's a good game, but nothing extraordinary. But, you might have an other opinion if you're a die hard adventure player, of course. I myself expected better from a studio that brought us the brilliant Brutal Legend, Psychonauts, Stacking and Costume Quest. You're better off playing any one of those.[Rating: 71/100]			"

												While the game looks and sounds nice, and has charm, the amount of backtracking was too much for me. Each character can only carry one item at a time, and there are a lot of possible places to take them. This becomes an issue, especially because of the 30 FPS cap, which makes the platforming pretty annoying to look at in the long run.			"

												A unique twist on the adventure genre, Double fine manages to bring yet another well crafted game to the table.Presented with a choice of 7 characters at the start, you get to pick 3 at one time and control them individually. Alternatively you can play in co-op as well, but singleplayer works just fine.Don't get fooled by it's appearence though, this is not a platformer nor does it want to be. It is an adventure game combined with a lot of puzzle solving, so if that's your cup of tea, then this is the game for you.It doesn't come without it's flaws though. Things such as framerate locked at 30 fps, the big ammount of backtracking (you play 3 characters instead of one), and being forced to replay some parts of the game just to finish the entire story can be very annoying at times, but if you can get past these issues, then this is a great purchase. The game lenght is about 4 hours per 3 characters (and there are 7 in total)			"

												I was on the fence for this review, but in the end the experience per time played wasn't sufficient. There are a lot of things this game does well, yet in the end I wouldn't recommend this game for solo adult gamers. It's probably more fun for kids, and it might be more fun on co-op. However, when I asked my friends (who had the game) if they wanted to try out the co-op, they weren't jumping at the chance. So, I played solo.This game lets you choose three characters from a pool of seven for your tour through The Cave. The Cave has three main-story map areas and each character has their own map area. Each map area requires you to coordinate your characters to solve different puzzles. To ""explore"" the whole map, you have to replay the game. Mathematically, you can already see that if you want to play all seven characters, you will have to replay two of the characters' map areas, in addition to the main-story map areas for a third time. The artwork, voice acting and separate areas are interesting and all, but the puzzles and backtracking proved too tedious to be warranted as ""fun"" and in the end. I didn't want to play the seventh character, and I can't give a positive recommendation for a game that after six hours, I don't want to play anymore. "

												The art style is really nice, but I think the strongest aspects are the stories. The narration is so sarcastic, but the ending(s) really moved me. Downside is, you have to replay a ton of times to experience all of the stories (and there are alternate endings). Some areas of the game change based on which characters you choose, but others remain the same. Even if you choose different characters, you WILL have to replay a few multiple times (even more if you want to see the alternate endings), so it gets extremely repetitive.			"

												Yes, this is a good game. I'm only halfway through but I'll add more stuff when I complete the game. There are multitutde of characters to choose from ranging from Hillbilly, Time Traveller, Scientist, Twins, Monk, Knight and Explorer. Each character has an unique power that you activate by pressing Q. Reminescent of the 3 Vikings.If you're lucky, you'll figure out the fate of the 3 ""missing"" characters, the Clown, the Robot and the Pirate. There will also be the Rocker and the Actress. If you choose the Bad Ending, you might even find some of the characters that didn't make the right decision.PROS1. Multiple EndingsThere is a Good Ending and Bad Ending for every character and you can develop it however you choose. The Good Ending seems to be harder though.2. PuzzlesFantastically concocted. Try them to believe them.3. StoriesI love the background stories of the characters.CONS1. No TutorialNo one explains to you what each character does. You don't know their abilities until you trial and error. The only way to find out if to press Q and see what it interacts with. E.g. Monk, picks up objects with telekinesis. I thought it was holy powers.2. No MultiplayerIt is extremely cumbersome to control 3 heroes 1 at a time. A little online co-op would have been fantastic. Think of BattleBlock Theater. A local co-op isn't going to work for a tiny screen.3. Tediousness1-player is extremely tedious. You want multiplayer, not alternate single-player.4. RepetitiveYou have to complete the Miner's quest, 3 trinkets quest and hermit quest every game.NEUTRALS1. Tricky ThingsIn the Miner stage, I didn't know you had to switch characters in the middle of the mine cart so it took a Youtube visit. Most of the others were solvable.			"

												Pros:+ Nice enviroment, music, atmosphere and characters.+ Interesting underlying idea (the cave is a symbol for the most deepest and darkest descent into one's true self).+ 7 different gruesome stories each with its specific level and a moral lesson.+ 60% of the puzzles are cleverly crafted.Cons:- The narrator's attempted jokes and story spoilers deflate the atmosphere, and only 30% of them made me go silently ""mhe"".- The abundant backtracking and ladder climbing is tiring.- In particular, the monk's level actually tests your patience and stillness and other zen-oriented traits, which I don't really think it's a very good design decision when it comes to video games. Life itself tests me enough, I play video games to escape life.- The same replay of the previous visited levels after finishing the game once and picking other 3 characters. A cause-effect-slightly-different-levels idea for the common ones would have been nice instead.7/10, passed my test, so I'd recommend it.			"

												This game is both beautifull, hillarious and thought provoking. Ron Gillbert and everyone else at Double Fine: Thank you for yet another spectacular game.I am rewriting the latter half of the recomendation, as I have now played through The Cave 3 times, using each character at least once. I've gotten the good endings for all the characters and the bad ones for the Knight and the Adventurer (as I used them both a second time for the last playthrough), and I can gladly say every single level of this game was completely awesome. Now that I've finished all the individual parts, however, I doubt that I will come back to get the rest of the bad endings for the other characters, unless I do it at a later time.Still highly recommend this game, it was really enjoyable and incredibly funny most of the time. :) And wonderfully dark at others. :D			"

												Action platform funny adventure... with some pretty clever puzzles!...and some portion of morality too!...and with several pretty funny characters, which can assure that You'll try this game for more time; because every hero have his own original story....and... well... try this game and prove that You can defeat... the ""cave"".

												A fun, aesthetically pleasing game but not without its flaws.The main thing is the fact that you pick 3/7 characters at the beginning, and play through their personal stories along with 3 generic ones. I assumed that once you had finished your three characters' stories you could just switch and do the other ones...but no, you have to play the game all over again with three different characters. There are 7 characters in total so this means repeating the game three times....I feel like they missed a trick there.Also, so much back tracking. So much.			"

												Far more linear than it implies this is in essence a straightforward puzzle oriented plaformer where you get to skip the bits you're not equipped for. Then later you can grab some other characters and play the whole thing through again skipping slightly different bits. This does mean a whole bunch of replaying in order to see the full game and a lot of that will be areas you have already covered but the characters are charming in a slightly evil way as they search for their hearts desire and it is fun finding different solutions depending on who you bring.

												I'm more of a point-and-click adventure fan myself, but The Cave's platformer-adventure system works well. There are no tasking platforming elements, which is great since there is quite a bit of backtracking involved. The puzzles are simple and amount to little more than scouring the area for items whose purpose is usually easy to sort out, or arranging your characters so that they 'work together' to solve a puzzle. This generally means that most of the game's content is in travelling and taking in the sights rather than elaborate puzzles and dialogue trees, which is good only if you're expecting this.There are two main highlights for me: the narration by the Cave itself, and the surprisingly dark storylines of each of the 7 characters. The characters themselves have subtle personality, even though they don't have any dialogue. Each character's area is well designed and wonderful to experience, and made me want to play through each person's story.I'd recommend this game for people who enjoy a slower paced game, who like to soak in atmosphere and interesting stories, and who aren't looking for a particularly difficult challenge.

												2d puzzle platformer adventure game. Graphics, Voice Acting, Story and Writing are all good. No real dialogue apart from the narration. Gamepad recommended.The different player characters you can use is an interesting concept that I wish was actually fleshed out in the way puzzles were solvable. Basically for each playthrough you choose 3 of the 7 available characters each with their own short chapter (the other two characters just tag along as deadweight when they are not in their chapter). Puzzles are relatively straightforward and require a lot of back and forth across the maps (probably why we don't see more 2d adventure game platformers). Trine 1 & 2 do everything The Cave does better (and Trine has combat too). But if you want more Trine, or just a simple puzzle platformer, then The Cave is a good adventure.Get it only on sale.			"

Posted: November 30, 2013
												I have an opinion on the The Cave, but I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what it is.  It isn't a bad game, but it's quite a long ways from perfect.  If I were a teacher and The Cave was an assignment somebody had handed in, I would give it a passing grade, but it certainly wouldn't get a very high mark.  Having said that, I seem to have put a fair amount of time into it, and I do plan on finishing off the rest of the acheivements.  So there is something to be said about it.  At its heart The Cave is a puzzle based adventure game.  The controls are simple enough, and it's rare that you need to do anything particularly precise with them.  You control three characters, each with their own story and one special ability that generally acts as a key to their area that other characters can't access.  So every time you play you pass by the spots where a given character's story is to be told, and if that character is in your group you can go in, if not you carry on past.Each area is a collection of puzzles.  Some you can solve with one of the characters, some require you to position multiple characters and perform actions nearly simultaneously from across the map.  You never need to aim at anything, and there isn't any combat as such.  There is one logic / math sort of puzzle, but they have a way of getting the solution if you can't figure it out.  In all honesty, I found that puzzle a lot more clear than many of the puzzles in this game.  There is a lot of your typical adventure-game-logic where you need to think outside the box to come to the solution.  The ""box"" in the last sentence would refer to normal human experiences and behaviour.  So, to use a hypothetical example, you might be required to use a slice of bread to open a door to keep your finger-prints off of it.  Something you probably wouldn't think of otherwise.So what does The Cave have going for it?  Well, the puzzles are generally fun, the narration is pretty much top notch, and it was nice to see the adventure game format return.  The story was pretty good, and while I have criticisms of it, they tend to be nit-picky sort of things.  A slight inconsistency of tone here, a lack of sympathetic character there.The fun part of this though is what The Cave does wrong.  The number one thing, and this is a glaring issue from my perspective, is the repetition.  This game repeats its repititions.  It has loops inside loops.  I can't believe anybody would develop a game with this much repitition in it.  Have I said repitition too many times yet?  If you think so, you're going to get very annoyed at The Cave very quickly.  Right off the bat there are seven characters, seven stories, and you can only have three characters in your group at a time.  If you can follow along with my advanced calculus, that means that in order to see every character's story, you will need to play the game to completion a minimum of three times and repeat two characters.  In addition, each play through has you puzzle your way through six areas.  Three that are character story dependent, and three that are there every time.  The puzzles never change anywhere, so if you play through the game the minimum number of times to see each character's story, you will still have those three sections mastered.But that's not all.  Each character has two possible endings.  So if you want to see the entire story for any given character, you need to play through twice, and the only difference is one decision right at the end.  Moving away from the repitition, this is one of the buggiest games I have played in a long time.  It's not that uncommon, especially for a PC gamer, to see a game that crashes from time to time, or that has one specific graphics glitch.  The Cave is constantly tripping up, failing in some weird way or just acting funny.  It's like they didn't play test it all that much.  For instance, there are many places where you need to stand beside an object, like a crate or something, and push it around.  Well, frequently when you try and do so the character will start jittering around instead of pushing.  On one occasion I jumped a character onto the bottom step of a porch only to have her ghost through the step so she was standing inside it.  It took some doing to find the right set of moves to get her unstuck.  I've had the game just decide to stop listening to the keyboard (except for the escape key interestingly).  After my first time playing I quit the game and when I started it back up again, it had lost my saves and any connection to steam.  No acheivements rang in, I couldn't access the steam overlay, nothing.  But every other game worked fine with steam.  The next time I started the game, steam was back again, and any progress I had made in the intervening session was lost.All in all I do recommend this game, but I do so with a lot of hesitation.  There's fun to be had here, and I do enjoy playing it, but at the same time it really isn't very polished.  If you have no other games that you want to play, and some money burning a hole in your pocket, then this might be a decent way to spend some time.  However, if you have other titles that you are interested in, pick them up first.			"

												Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ entertaining game. As an adventure-platformer, it has more in common with Trine than classic adventure games but—as with any doublefine game—it's simple mechanics are swathed in layer upon layer of charm and humour. Its biggest flaw is that the puzzles can feel quite tedius once you know the solutions, making the multiple playthroughs necessary to get all the endings a bit of a bore.			"

												I loved this game. I have played it through six times now to get all the achievements and loved it each time. You pick three characters for each play through, each character has its unique level and there are some common levels. The puzzles and fun and satisfying, humour is great and the style is nice. There are a few little complaints you could make. Since each play through has the same common levels you end up doing those repeatedly but I didn't mind as they are fun. It is a little odd playing it with two people as you have to control three characters and end up stealing control from each other accidentally but that is not too bad once you get used to it. The only thing that did bother me is that each character has two endings and the way to get the good ending is completely not obvious, I would not have even known there was a good ending if I hadn't seen the Zero Punctuation review beforehand. This game is still very much worth a play.			"

												An adventure! In a cave! This game is a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a side-scrolling platform game, with the focus on the former. You pick your three adventurers from a choice of seven and then into the cave you go to solve puzzles and have some laughs along the way.The Cave is a talking cave and is voiced well, but doesn't talk as much as I'd like, and I found the solutions to some of the puzzles to be rather obtuse. Occasionally I got stuck and had to read a walk-through guide to figure out how to continue. At times it was annoying having to control three characters because I had to move them all separately which was pretty boring.But the graphics and animation are good, and the audio is also good. And there were a few genuine LOL moments in the game. It's just a shame the puzzle solving and game-play were a little weak, but I hope the game was successful and that a bigger, better and bolder sequel will come out.There's a little replay value as the different characters you choose give you a slightly different path through the cave, but most sections remain the same regardless of your choice of characters.Overall, 7 out of 10.

												What seems to start out as a simple puzzle game with influences from old classics like Maniac Mansion and the Lost Vikings actually ends up being something very unique and intriguing.You pick three characters from a cast of seven to enter a bizarre talking cave in search of something the characters desire. You solve puzzles to progress through each area, which are closest in style to a point 'n' click. They range from very simple to relatively puzzling, but generally you can figure each one out with a few minutes of lateral thinking. If you're stuck, there's plenty of guides out there too.The heart of this game isn't about the puzzles, however. The quirky, dark humour and the metaphor that emerges as you delve deeper drive you forward. The Cave is more than just a puzzle game, it holds a message that moves the game closer to being a piece of art.			"

												It's  a fun adventure game but not really to the same level that I expect from Double Fine for a few reasons.First off, it may seem like a small thing but I think it's annoying that there's 7 main characters but you can only do 3 per playthrough. This means that you can have 2 completely unique playthroughs, but then if you want to see the 7th character's storyline you'll have to do a third playthrough with mostly repeated content.Second, I feel like this game would have benefitted from more voice acting, although I understand this might have been due to budget restrictions, but if it was a stylistic choice then I just don't get it.The characters you play as are supposed to have these big dark backstories that you uncover, but there's never any opportunities to show their personalities, even when I was playing as particular characters I felt like the story that was being revealed was for NPCs not the characters I was controlling. I think this could have been showed off more through voice acting.However, the game is still very charming. You're led through the game by The Cave itself, an omniscient narrator who has a dry sense of humor as he details all of your experiences. It's actually pretty fun. In addition, there's quite a lot to like about many of the levels, especially the ones that are specific to certain characters. The hillbilly's carnival level in particular was  a lot of fun.The games not very challenging. If you're paying attention most puzzles are pretty easy. However, there are certain parts that seem to drag on.It's definitely not perfect, but overall I think it's a decent game, although the writing isn't quite up to what I expect from Double Fine.			"

												From an idea that builded up for almost 20 years, ""The Cave"" has finally been released. IMO, this isn't a good game...OR a bad game either. Sure, it burrows its concepts from ""Maniac Mansion"" (another Ron Gilbert game) and the humor is not that bad BUT the puzzles are sometimes too simple, there's a lot of unessecary backtracking (especially if you're playing by yourself) and with 3 characters to control, it bogs down the game's length and the gameplay. The only time when all 3 characters come together is if you come across a new area in the cave. If only I have 3 other people...What I DO like about this game is that the level design changes depending on what character you choose (somehow reminiscent of ""LIMBO"" in how the background changes because of the protaganist's state of mind), and I do love the creativity behind the main idea of choosing a character to enter the cave to explore their darkest traits. For example, on my first playthrough, I picked the Adventurer, the Knight and the Time Traveler and in each area you encounter is suitable for a particular character in a party you decided to choose (for the Knight, a ""Princess in a Castle"" scenario), which gives you room for replay value to try different characters and venture through the entire game again. Also, the time traveller is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to control. There were a couple of glitches and bugs that I discovered while playing the game. One of them was...THIS: 


YouTube™ Video: ::Zangorwarrior:: How to make a dinosaur happy... [The Cave] 

			Views: 79		

			With a game like ""The Cave"" where you choose your characters to venture into a place in order to explore their darkest personality traits, this dinosaur is by far the DARKEST of them all.		

This game does have secrets and unlockables though but they're very easy to find. You find cave paintings in particular areas of  the cave and you get to unlock artwork. That's just it on what I can say on the unlockables. Not really interesting unlockables either, IMO.So, to sum up this game in a nutshell, it has a creative idea and story behind it, good replay value and interesting level design based on character support but the game is very easy to traverse through as there is no rule of dying (which deducts the challenge) and its main gameplay bogs the game down as you have to multitask by choosing a character one-by-one and moving them along...like chess pieces. Give this game a try if you want to but I was expecting a bit more.6/10			"

												It's like a bunch of really short adventure games strung together that you have to play over and over again to complete everything. Each one is pretty good, but the repetition gets old fast. Having to drag the three characters around as the extra two play minor roles in each main character's story is annoying, too. Few levels actually use the extra characters for more than lugging items around and pulling levers. Something like a button that summons all characters to your location (when pathing permits) would be really nice. There is a lot of climbing, running, jumping, and falling (to your death) over and over and over. I want to like this a lot more than I do.			"

												All around this is just a really enjoyable game.   To me, it is definently worth playing through with every character and even playing through twich with each one to see both the good and the bad endings.  Every character has their own masterfully crafted level.  The only level I would complain even a little about is one of the ""in-between"" levels about the miner.  Other than that, every level is packed with personality and very clever puzzles. (My personal favorite level was the Hillbilly's, but they are all fantastic)  The writing in this game is some of the best dark humor I have come across.  The narration done by the cave itself is extremely well written and the voice acting is just as great.  I have read some reveiws where the game was lambasted for ""excessive back-tracking"".  I really have to disagree with that as (with the exception of the miner level) back tracking is usually not more that 10-15 seconds as you travel between puzzle hotspots.  The complaints I read about this seemed really exageratted to me and shouldn't be a turn off to anyone wanting to play this game.  Again, this game was just a lot of fun to play through with its witty writing, dark humor, clever puzzles, and beatifully designed levels.			"

												The Cave on one level is a really enjoyable game, I really  like the graphic style, general game play, puzzles, the variety of different characters & their stories, and that each character has a unique ability, meaning different areas can be solved in different ways depending on who is in your team, and their own area of the cave to solve/explore, which adds to re-playability.  On the down side the controls can be iffy and annoying. For example the characters jump several seconds AFTER you hit the jump button, and they will often run on after you release the arrow key (so if you want/need them to stand in an exact location, forget the keyboard and just use the mouse). This can make certain puzzles a struggle too, since even after you've worked out what to do, actually completing the puzzle is made even more difficult due to the above control issue, and on several areas where you have to do a lot of difficult jumping and climbing make one mistake and you have to do the entire puzzle all over again, the under reactive controls can be adjusted to, but still make some areas a lot harder than they should be.That said this game has plenty of charm, character, a good re playability value, and the narration can be genuinely funny. The controls may work better with a controller rather than the keyboard (I haven't got one to test it out). . Flawed but  I would still recommend this game			"

												At the end of this sentient, narmy cave, the game boils down to 8 horrible people who, in their madness and dementia, end up finding each other and working together as a team, but also live each others' sins and nightmares, and at the very end have to make a serious decision about whether or not they should persue their dark dreams or take the lessons of their grim adventure to heart.The game is one big slapstick comedy, where you deal out horrible fates to various persons (regardless of whether they deserve it or not). At the end though, you'll be given chances to make up for your past misdeeds and prevent your characters from committing these crimes outside of the cave. Heck, you can even steal a postcard at the very beginning and give it back at the very end!The one major thing I'm disappointed about is the characters. None of the characters' powers feel truly important; most of the game is just platforming. And the characters themselves have basic dark backstories that may or may not be occuring during the events of the cave. But the game manages to patch this by making these bland characters mix their powers and backstories, thereby giving the semblence of a greater overreaching adventure that influences each character individually (well, except for the twins who may or may not be a hive mind).The cave is not judging you. The victims are not judging you. You and your team are judging you. And it's up to you to decide what to do about it.			"

It is quite replayable, but since there are 7 characters and you can play only with 3 at a time, and you will end up repeating the non-character-specific puzzles on the 2nd run, you may end up skipping one character and also one the endings for each character (every character has 2 endings).

												In Summary: Don't buy this, even if you are a Double Fine or LucasArts adventure game fan.I love me some adventure games. The Ron Gilbert name--man behind legendary games Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion-- followed by the Double Fine logo and promotional material (mainly the character trailers) got me to invest in this hybrid game of platforming and item collecting and witty antics that are a staple of adventure games. The Cave fails to capitalize on any strengths of its genres.Platforming is not fun. The game never tries to make jumping fun or innovative. Most envoirments are just elaborate corridors with road blocks disguised as puzzles at best and ""match with the best character's 'get out of jail free power'"" at its worst. It never comes close to mimick a traditional platformer. Platforming here is padding to get to the next vender for keys and their doors. The game never challenges your relfex skills, but that's okay because movement is terrible; floaty physics and hit detection, followed by falling death, and it's too simple to die from fall damage. It doesn't take much distance to make vertical space deadly, and you will die because you want to go through areas as fast a possible. Dying makes you respawn, but that can either net closer t your destination or back to redo your mistake again. Many puzzles revolve around fetching things and making Player Characters (PCs) stand around. You must move each inividual character by controling him or her; there is no way to make the other two characters follow your selected spelunker. The games tries to mediate by having them warp to your controled person on selected events, but it's annoying when a certain puzzle requires two PCs and your nearest comrade is meters away. Multiplyer makes you share the screen. That's bad.The biggest problem is the characters, or lack thereof. The game already hints at a ""dark, terrible secret"" in each persona. While it's not a requirement for characters in a story to be likable, they have to be interesting. They are not interesting. None of the PCs talk, only the Cave and minor charactors do. PCs do not attempt to express themselves in other ways. They do not react in in-fame cut-scenes or express any emotion besides waiting, pushing things, and dying. Wall paintings barely flesh out their backstories, but not enough to characterize. The humor is good. The Cave's monologues are the highlight, and one-liners from other characters are clever, but it's not enough to trench through the along mediocre gameplay and level design.			"

												The Cave lures you in with the promise of a whimsical platformer and then hits you over the head with a grim, satirical theme - presented to you more as an observer of the characters involved; not unlike a modern day Dante, exploring the narratives depths. Ron Gilbert's fantastic sense of humor is tangible at all times, even though the controls feel a bit clunky. Luckily, this only delays your progress with the absense of character deaths. Be warned that this does handle mature themes and may not be suitable for every age. A solid recommendation, especially if your game time available only comes in little chunks.			"

												The game's charming artstyle and simple smooth gameplay mechanics make tackling the weird puzzles very enjoyable. The humour is very twisted because The talking cave is the magical version of Glados while the different playable characters all have some twisted past. This lends a subtle seriousness to a game which would have otherwise come off as a happy-go-lucky puzzle platformer.			"

												I don't know, I just liked it. Actually, I didn't really know what was this game about, but you can choose three characters at the beginning of the game (three of seven playable characters) and you'll learn their unique histories. Each of them has their own special ability too.I struggled a lot at the beginning, going back and forth, compleeeeeeetely lost. But I learned and it became faster to play (finished 2 times already, but I'll try until I get all achievements!). Really, it's not that complicated, you only need to get used to it.Well, I liked the graphics, the gameplay, the characters, references and, obviously, the narrator. That's how you use sarcasm.Some cons is that the game is relatively short, but you'll need to play a lot of times if you want all the *""SPOILER"" ALERT* endings *END OF ""SPOILER""* and the achievements. Sometimes you can be tired of going up, down, getting lost or stuck, but you'll get used to it too. I think.Sorry about my Engrish aaaaaaannnnnddddd, remember, sometimes, the faster and only apparently way is really the best, only and rewarding way~ ♪			"

												I really liked the cave.On the plus side, you have 7 different stories with one big puzzle each. You have nice aesthetics, with funny animations, beautifuly designed locations, and great voice acting.On the bad side: You have to walk around a lot. The caves are sometimes labyrinth-like, and you often have to travel them completly several times. The riddles are sometimes to hard. I had to look help up, at least 2 times. And after I found out, what I had to do, I thought, that I would never have found that out in a million years.But All in All this is a great game, if you like slow paced, adventure / puzzle plattformers.

												A Scientist, Hillbilly, Timetraveler, Knight, Monk, Adventurer, and Twins walk in to a cave.....  No this is not a joke set up seriously these 8 people walk in to a cave in groups of 3 to launch a nuclear weapon, travel back in time to kill the caveman ancestor of their co-worker, burn a carnival down and have other adventures. A fun puzzle-platformer that requires at least 6 play throughs to get the entire story so you get your money's worth. Each character has their own level and powers that you can play in any order. They do drag after serveral replays considering no matter what set of characters you choose you need to play the same 4 levels but the puzzles are challenging and real thinkers if you are in to platformers and headscratchers this is a game for you. Puzzle solutions are very creative such as using a parrot to record a dog barking, making yourself stink like a dinosaur to attract a live dinosaur to crush with an ancient wheel to make oil to run an ancient engine and other crazy puzzles. Ther are 2 endings for each character fun visuals, sorta silly jokes and a quirky narration by The Cave itself. Pretty much The Cave is the American cousin of the the Narrator from The Stanely Parable who is not as funny but would get a one shot Comedy Central 30 min special that is mildly amusing and watchable 2 more times before  becoming less humorous each and everytime afterwards and you end up flipping the channel to some reruns of Bob Ross to get his voice out of your head.TL;DRFun, challenging puzzles, cool cartoony visuals, amusing narration, lots of replay to see entire game, kinda boring and repitive after several replays but still fun. 8/10 would play again. Also some hoopty-dooptey stuff about morals and true desires are corrupted by simple wants yada yada yada... something about being above your wants so you can attain true happiness.			"

												The Cave is a light-hearted platformer with a lot of dark humor and isn’t nearly as deep as my title suggests. You start off with a choice of seven characters and you have to choose 3 to go spelunking the depths of The Cave. By the way it’s a talking cave. The only other voice being the salesman of The Cave’s gift shop.You start off mildly enough, just a small quest for the gift shop. Grab three trinkets and return. Here you get a small taste of the quests The Cave has to offer. There aren’t any enemies in the cave but everything can kill you. Fall from too high you die, stay underwater too long you die, get blown up, etc. However, the game is very forgiving in that it automatically respawns your character close to where you were before you died.When you finally descend the depths the experience is tailored to the characters you chose upon starting. The Cave says that it explores the depths of each of the character’s hearts to find out what they desire most. What that entails is minor explorations of a major event of each chosen character’s lives. There are also paintings highlighting all the character stories you will encounter during your playthrough.It will take a number of plays to get through every character’s story and since each character has a different ability how you approach a puzzle will differ slightly according to your party. For example, the Time Traveler’s ability to phase through walls is incredibly helpful in skipping a couple of puzzles but if you don’t have her in your party you might have to think of another way to get the item you need. Each ability will have some use during your journey so you’ll never feel like you’re relying on one character or the others aren’t pulling their weight.As for graphics and settings the Cave’s environments are quite diverse. One section you can be on a deserted island or a carnival to a top secret Bond like nuclear missile facility. Every time you reach a new depth you get a different setting. The puzzles are terribly difficult and the narrator and other inhabitants provide small hints in speeches.  The game took me about 4 hours to get through the first time. And since there are 3 standard quests that occur regardless of your party you can use the same approach for the non-character specific parts. You can even carry certain objects into other areas allowing for you to completely skip one section.There are 2 endings per character so it will take about 5 plays to get the complete story but it was fun each time although changing up the characters didn’t affect how I approached the puzzles drastically different. Overall it was a cool, quirky enjoyable experience. It wasn’t as deep as I thought it’d be but also not so shallow that I felt unfulfilled.			"

												This was an excellent puzzle platformer that will keep you entertained for hours with its witty humor and memorable characters.  Gameplay was very good though I occasionally found a place where an action would get a character stuck.  This was easily remedied by saving the game and reloading (which repositions the characters in a non-stuck postion).  I played through all characters and unlocked all the endings for each, which will lengthen the gameplay for you.  I enjoyed my delve into the depths of ""The Cave"" and I think if you enjoy a good puzzle and a little dark humor you will too.   Overall 10/10.			"

												Great platforming adventure game from Double Fine by the great Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame. It's cumbersome to see all there is to see in this game — you basically have to play through it three times, and there's no double-clicking like in Monkey Island to quickly get past a screen. I also encountered quite a few bugs in my time with the game. Still, it's worth the time you invest in it. The good sticks with you a lot more than the bad. The art and environments are fantastic!

												This is a good game, but it seems too short and suffers from a disappointing end. It may have ""caved"" under the weight of expectaions.A 2.5D puzzle-platformer with a remarkable pedigree. You take on the roles of 3 of a collection of 7 stereotyped spelunkers and use their unique abilities to navigate puzzles and the darkness in their hearts. The mechanics are solid overall, following the vein of point-and-click adventures, but the platforming can be touchy at times. The puzzles are thoughtful and well-designed. The stories are all funny, but the ending falls flat at a decision of ""good ending"" or ""bad ending"" which is a discreet and moralizing choice of greedily keeping something you went to murderous extremes to obtain or simply leaving empty-handed. The music is great and the replayability of going through the different characters and combinations of abilities is appreciated.			"

												Oozing Doublefine/Lucas Arts charm, you can feel Ron Gilbert's influence very deeply in this game. I was hooked on it from the very first trailer I saw, since The Cave as a narrator is quite a fun gimmick, and his dialogue is quite amusing. The gameplay is a cross between old school adventure games Ron Gilbert is famous for and a sidescrolling platformer. It can get a little frustrating at times thanks to the adventure game tropes (back tracking, obscure puzzle solutions, etc.) but the pay off is worth it to see the histories of these dispicable characters.

Reviews complained about ropes/ladders but I had zero problem in two playthroughs.

												Not very long, but there's incentive to play through two or three times - just expect some repetition those extra times.  Was expecting puzzles to exploit the game's gimmick - that you bring three characters along, and each has their own ability.  Unfortunately, while the puzzles are clever, they're more to do with using items in clever ways than using the character abilities (except for each character-specific area, where their tale unfolds).Still, for what it is, and the price, it's a fun game and worth the money.  Great sense of humor and interesting story for each character.  And like I said, the puzzles can be clever - just don't expect to spend more than a few hours on your first playthrough.			"

												I recommend it. The game is fun. It reminds me of a blend of Limbo and Trine. The puzzles aren't too hard, but there are some really good ones in there that had me stumped for a while. There are seven characters to choose from, but only three can be chosen for each run thru the game. To see the whole game, it will need to be finished at least twice. I did complete all the character-specific levels. The Scientist and the Time Traveler levels were my favorites. They were all good, though, except for possibly the level for The Monk. It was too short and too easy. It was still ok tho. There are several sections that are a part of every run-through regardless of the characters chosen. The writing is funny and the voice acting is really well done. It took about 12 or so hours to see all of the game. The art style is cartoony and pleasant. The graphics are serviceable, but nothing special. The first time dynamite blew up, the explosion crashed the game. Other than that, it ran flawlessly at a smooth 60fps throughout. My biggest gripe with the game is the amount of back tracking. There is so much back-and-worth when trying to figure out the puzzles for the first time and climbing ropes takes forever. It's not a huge deal, but its something that's ever present. Overall, The Cave was a really enjoyable experience.			"

												The Cave is a really cute platformer from the creator of mythical past adventure games like Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. There is some humour and funny characters indeed, but the game is a bit short and simple (10 hours and I already did three complete playthoughs with all characters), even though I can assure graphics and level design are really good for this kind of product.

												Manic Mansion for the 'Modern' era (Cliché I know)Items required to perform tasks actually makes sense, unlike the majority of 80's and 90's Adventure games and the platform element is a nice twist.Be warned, lots of going back and forth until you know what items aren't / are needed, etc.. so patience required to begin with.You'll also only get 15hrs+ of gameplay if you're going for all the achievements, reckon on at least half of that if you only go for 'Good' endings or 'Bad' endings.Overall another enjoyable Ron Gilbert game.. now get on with a NEW Monkey Island! =)			"

												Not very long, but there's incentive to play through two or three times - just expect some repetition those extra times.  Was expecting puzzles to exploit the game's gimmick - that you bring three characters along, and each has their own ability.  Unfortunately, while the puzzles are clever, they're more to do with using items in clever ways than using the character abilities (except for each character-specific area, where their tale unfolds).Still, for what it is, and the price, it's a fun game and worth the money.  Great sense of humor and interesting story for each character.  And like I said, the puzzles can be clever - just don't expect to spend more than a few hours on your first playthrough.			"

												Great platforming adventure game from Double Fine by the great Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame. It's cumbersome to see all there is to see in this game — you basically have to play through it three times, and there's no double-clicking like in Monkey Island to quickly get past a screen. I also encountered quite a few bugs in my time with the game. Still, it's worth the time you invest in it. The good sticks with you a lot more than the bad. The art and environments are fantastic!

Puzzles are wide ranged and the game is short, but this can be forgiven for replayability. The writing for the announcer is gold and the events which you partake in are silly and twisted.

												This is really good, especially the PC version. I don't know why the reviews were so harsh, I think they had ridiculous expectations. It's a fun puzzle-platformer and has some good puzzles (and no bad ones). It managed to make me laugh out loud several times, which is rare for a game. Reviews complained about ropes/ladders but I had zero problem in two playthroughs. It's true you have to do multiple playthroughs to see everything, and have to repeat parts in doing so, but the repetition is actually pretty quick once you know what to do so it's not a big deal. It's well worth a tenner.			"

												Definitively a poor platformer (it punishes more than it rewards) crossed with an average adventure game (most of the puzzles are easy or deja-vu). It has a repetitive gameplay that ruins its replayability (you have to play twice the same game with the same choices minus one, in order to see both sides of the stories and some intermediary parts are always the same to play), but has a very strong storyline crafted by the as talented as ever Ron Gilbert and good graphics and musics that perfectly fit and underline very well the stories.More an average game than a good game, but a real piece of digital art that questions the player himself about his own choices in game (I'm still wondering if the punishing / repetitive part of the gameplay is not more or less intended to strengthen this feeling). IMHO, worths owning it only for that (perhaps not at full price... but art has no price). "

												When I saw that it was created by the same people who made Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island, there was no way I wasn't going to buy it.   It wasn't everything I hoped for (it wasn't that genre of game brought back to life) but it is a solid game.The game focuses primarily on using more than one character to solve a puzzle, and how you solve a puzzle may depend on what three characters you select at the beginning.  There is a story to each character and every character comes with an extra level of their own to find a solution to.   I've played through once and I'll definitey be playing through again with the other characters.  So it's got a few tricks that were in Maniac Mansion, a similarly grim sense of humour and the obligatory references (keep an eye open for Chuck the Plant!), but it's a lot more linear than Maniac Mansion (definite level progression, not so much exploring one large setting) and characters can only hold one item at a time (no amassing large quantities of stuff and trying to work out things to do with them).   As said, it's not Maniac Masnion reincarnated but it is fun in it's own right. :)			"

They cleverly show the effect of desire by telling each stories with narration and offer the chance to think. Though there are some repeated puzzles which make the game boring when you play it second time (Eventually you're gonna play at least third time if you want to clear the whole stories), I must say it's a well made adventure game which is meaningful.

												I don't know, I just liked it. Actually, I didn't really know what was this game about, but you can choose three characters at the beginning of the game (three of seven playable characters) and you'll learn their unique histories. Each of them has their own special ability too.I struggled a lot at the beginning, going back and forth, compleeeeeeetely lost. But I learned and it became faster to play (finished 2 times already, but I'll try until I get all achievements!). Really, it's not that complicated, you only need to get used to it.Well, I liked the graphics, the gameplay, the characters, references and, obviously, the narrator. That's how you use sarcasm.Some cons is that the game is relatively short, but you'll need to play a lot of times if you want all the *""SPOILER"" ALERT* endings *END OF ""SPOILER""* and the achievements. Sometimes you can be tired of going up, down, getting lost or stuck, but you'll get used to it too. I think.Sorry about my Engrish aaaaaaannnnnddddd, remember, sometimes, the faster and only apparently way is really the best, only and rewarding way~ ♪			"

												This was an excellent puzzle platformer that will keep you entertained for hours with its witty humor and memorable characters.  Gameplay was very good though I occasionally found a place where an action would get a character stuck.  This was easily remedied by saving the game and reloading (which repositions the characters in a non-stuck postion).  I played through all characters and unlocked all the endings for each, which will lengthen the gameplay for you.  I enjoyed my delve into the depths of ""The Cave"" and I think if you enjoy a good puzzle and a little dark humor you will too.   Overall 10/10.			"

												A Scientist, Hillbilly, Timetraveler, Knight, Monk, Adventurer, and Twins walk in to a cave.....  No this is not a joke set up seriously these 8 people walk in to a cave in groups of 3 to launch a nuclear weapon, travel back in time to kill the caveman ancestor of their co-worker, burn a carnival down and have other adventures. A fun puzzle-platformer that requires at least 6 play throughs to get the entire story so you get your money's worth. Each character has their own level and powers that you can play in any order. They do drag after serveral replays considering no matter what set of characters you choose you need to play the same 4 levels but the puzzles are challenging and real thinkers if you are in to platformers and headscratchers this is a game for you. Puzzle solutions are very creative such as using a parrot to record a dog barking, making yourself stink like a dinosaur to attract a live dinosaur to crush with an ancient wheel to make oil to run an ancient engine and other crazy puzzles. Ther are 2 endings for each character fun visuals, sorta silly jokes and a quirky narration by The Cave itself. Pretty much The Cave is the American cousin of the the Narrator from The Stanely Parable who is not as funny but would get a one shot Comedy Central 30 min special that is mildly amusing and watchable 2 more times before  becoming less humorous each and everytime afterwards and you end up flipping the channel to some reruns of Bob Ross to get his voice out of your head.TL;DRFun, challenging puzzles, cool cartoony visuals, amusing narration, lots of replay to see entire game, kinda boring and repitive after several replays but still fun. 8/10 would play again. Also some hoopty-dooptey stuff about morals and true desires are corrupted by simple wants yada yada yada... something about being above your wants so you can attain true happiness.			"

												I don't think I have ever disliked a DoubleFine game. There are 3 puzzle areas that are the same for the whole game, no matter how many times you play it. There are 7 characters that all have some goal that will, probably, result in murder, theivery, etc. Each character has their own puzzle area that you are required to solve. (You can only take 3 characters through the cave at a time, so you do have to do multiple play-throughs to see them all.) The puzzles can be challenging, the humor is dark, the characters are flawed. It all goes together to make a great game. The best part but you can unlock both an evil and a good ending. The evil ending is the basic ending built into the game, but I haven't figured out how to unlock a happy ending yet. (evil and good meaning...not murdering your entire family)			"

												This is a mildly entertaining platform puzzle game that supposedly utilises three units with unique abilities to complete puzzles.  However if like me you were hoping for a game similar to ‘Lost Vikings’ you may want to give this game a miss.  The unit’s unique abilities are so mild they’re rarely used, making the units effectively interchangeable.  The puzzle element also mostly involves just sticking objects into sockets, making the whole game just a tedious matter of trial and error until you find the right socket.			"

The Cave is a cute little game made by DoubleFine. It is a side scroller point&click, the controls are legacy of both genres and you will have no problem getting into it whether you are more comfortable with one or the other genre.I personally like Point&Clicks and the idea of The Cave in general, everything is fine, descent ambiance, good story-telling (Stunning narrator voice).The game is built around several characters, you will choose three characters for each of your run, and go through The Cave that will lead to different path depending on which characters you choose.The problem is that half of a The Cave run is the same, regardless of which character you choose. The number of character available isn't a multiple of three (That means that you will have to go through the path of two characters two times). That completely breaks apart the idea of a replayable game, because you basically have to go through the same content several time to get the new content (Which is annoying and pointless in a point & click game, it's a repetitive mindboggling grind).If you have the time and patience (I am usually really patient, and I have a lot of time for games, though I hadn't enough) You will probably enjoy all the content of the game, and be really happy with it. If you don't, the game will only offer the third of what you paid for. "

												TIght production value; craftsmanship in detail straight down to the teeter-animations. It's also got great backstories and runs an efficient level design comparable to an amusement park ride.  Astute writing and polished mechanics in a 2D platformer?  A no-brainer pickup.			"

												The puzzles in this game are not all that bad - they are in fact the game's one *and only* strength.On the other hand, the puzzles could have been a lot better - they could have been designed with multiple solutions using various character specific abilities that would make you feel really clever to figure out the different ways to solve them. They could have, but they didn't. What a waste.When there were multiple solutions, they too were just lame. There's one point where the scientist can use her 1337 hacking skillz to open a door... or, you could just pull the lever right next to it. Another where the Adventurer can grapple over a pit of spikes... that she could have just jumped over. When you can do something profoundly different (like using the Monk's telekinesis to obtain a guarded item early, or carry an extra hotdog with you for 3/4 of the game to shortcut a later puzzle), it felt more like an exploit of a poorly thought out level design rather than something sneaky you could do as a deliberate design decision by the writer.The writing in this game is just bad - it's clearly trying to be funny, but I don't think I even smiled once while playing, and I certainly didn't laugh. The Cave is sentient and provides a narrative voice, but the voice actor simply reads the jokes off the script in an almost monotonic voice with no emotion whatsoever. The other voice actors aren't much better, but really the problem is that the script is just lame and didn't really give them any room to shine.The story reminds me of the type of work I'd have submitted for high school English (if not worse) - in my mind I could create really interesting characters, with a dark unsettling past that I'd put together in an unusual and interesting setting and have some event spiral out of control of the characters, bringing their best and worst traits out as they had to reluctantly work together to overcome... yeah, what I wrote on the paper was little more than a Star Trek rip off.I can tell that in the writers mind he had developed seven really interesting characters with a dark past that are going to commit some terrible atrocity in the cave - unfortunately the game fails to develop any kind of connection to the characters and we feel absolutely nothing for the characters and no remorse for the evil deed that they do.I'm not nuking the Earth as the Scientist because the game has developed a connection with her and I can see that she believes that it is really her last option to eliminate an oppressive government that only pretends to listen to it's intellectuals as a facade so they can continue pretending that planting a few trees will solve climate change and that dumping three million cubic metres of mining dredge spoil on the Great Barrier Reef won't have any adverse affects (spoiler: it's not actually that interesting, she just wants money).No, I'm simply turning the three launch keys because it's the only way the game will let me progress.The game has good & bad endings for each of the characters, but they boil down to a single choice at the end of the game to take a souvenir (bad ending), or return it to the gift shop (good ending) - that's just lame (as are the chalkboard endings), and it doesn't even let you save before the decision to see the other ending without playing through the entire game AGAIN (MINIMUM FIVE PLAYTHROUGHS TO SEE ALL THE ENDINGS - what a waste of time). They could have had the bad ending be the easy solution to the character specific puzzles (e.g. launch the nuke) and the good ending be a much harder alternate solution to the same puzzle (perhaps the Scientist could have found a way to trick the bad guy with the money into giving the warhead a push because it was ""stuck"", then swap the warhead with him and launch it into the ocean - the world is saved and she still gets rich), but no, it's just more wasted potential.And speaking of time wasting, can Ron Gilbert please get off his pretentious butt and stop padding his games (which he has done since the Monkey Island games - but at least they had good writing to carry them through) and wasting players time with unskippable cutscenes and forcing multiple playthroughs (THREE MINIMUM) just to play all the puzzles, and even more playthroughs (FIVE MINIMUM) to see all the different endings. And each of those playthroughs requires you to sit through those same unskippable cutscenes again (they aren't very long, but once I've seen them once I really don't care to watch them again, what with the terrible writing and wasting time and all), as well as play a bunch of common puzzles again - not difficult, just a complete and utter waste of time. There is absolutely no reason why the game couldn't have let you take all seven characters on the one playthrough and play all the puzzles (perhaps selecting three for each puzzle or section).If you want an interesting platformer with multiple characters and a good story, go play Trine. It's puzzles aren't as good as The Cave, but it is a much better game overall.If you want a point and click puzzle/adventure game with multiple characters and some really good wit and humour, go play The Book of Unwritten Tales. There are tonnes of really good adventure games coming out these days, just not from the industry ""veterans"".And, for the love of God can we please stop throwing money at Double Fine on kickstarter? We're as bad as the big name publishers, thinking that they will make good games because just because they had a couple of hits in the past!			"

												Caves are awesome. They can contain just about anything. Sadly, this one contains a lesson about what happens when you bring a great narrative, and forget about fundamental design. A great idea is wasted with terrible platforming, klutzy level design and tedious puzzle solving. The Cave probably would've worked as an adventure game, but instead it becomes another chapter in Double Fine's struggle to create some worthwhile gameplay.			"

												Ok, I've just finished The Cave, which took me around 4 hours in total. It's... alright. Not great, not bad, just alright.You have a choice of three from seven characters to choose from for your adventure. I took the Knight, the Hillbilly, and the Adventurer. Each playthrough starts the same way and ends the same way, but you have three small ""story"" sections bespoke to each character, which makes specific use of that character's special ability (the Knight has a shield ability, for example). The story sections are amusing enough and some of the puzzles got me stuck for a while, but overall it just feels a bit... undercooked. It's like it could've been just something a bit more.The style is cool, it's reasonably funny in places, it's just not as good as I wanted it to be. Maybe I've misjudged it and I'm not their target audience, it does have a certain charm to it, I just felt like I was playing through it to complete it rather than to see what the story did.Unless you're absolutely dying to play it - in which case you've probably already bought it - I'd really wait for a 50-75% off sale (probably the latter).TL: DR; there's better Double Fine games available. It's not bad, just not as good as it could've been.			"

The characters are fun and unique and play well with any of the challenges.  The enviroment is very well done and makes for an enjoyable experience to run through.  Each enviroment is very well crafted and presents puzzles that fit those areas and make sense for the characters as well.The game is an enjoyable expierence to run through and the puzzles present enough challenge to be both frustrating and enjoying.

												Beside Gilbert's well known humor and his gusto for art-designs, he did accomplish a truly new step in adventure-game evolution by mixing the its best features with a classic platformer. He also abandoned, what can make both boring. Too much dying in a plattformer and musing without any action about puzzles in adventure-games. He just kept the minimalistic elements and did so create a realy addicting pastime event. I couldn't stop until I was finished and had never the urge to take a look in a walkthrough, I did so often when time took to long to solve a puzzle without nothing other happens meanwhile. This time it was pure fun to jump and climb throughout the levels again and again. Expire it, it's another masterpiece!			"

												Overall I've been disappointed by this game. While the athmosphere and narration are fun, the game just feels a little shallow for what I would expect from a great puzzle platformer. The controls are clunky, and the puzzles are thin (meaning: easy and unoriginal). The designers seem to have tried to make up for this by making the distances in the levels really............... unnecessarily large. You have to walk great distances to pick up an item because there's no inventory system and it's non-obvious which item you should have in hand, which just seems to extend the levels unnecessarily for what are otherwise pretty straight forward puzzles. If you're new to puzzle adventure games this could be a nice gentle introduction, but it's certainly not got the depth that you would want if you've been playing these games for years.			"

The tag is a lie.---- The ladder climbing is tedious and together with revisiting and running around it makes up most of your gametime. This part was just a pure waste of time and makes this game not enjoyable to me.-- The ""riddles"" are way to easy, and if this game is more about the story than those riddles, then why did the game design make us get and return objects and/or climb ladders for ages?+ Nice graphicsTaking away the time spent on ladder/rope climbing and tedious run-and-get tasks, the play time for a playthrough would end up being 15% of the time. This game is stretched like the backdoor of a pornstar specialised on backdoor porn.  For this reason alone I would give this game a big fat thumbs down. I would not recommend this to anyone except maybe a 10- year old because the riddles are just dumb.			"

												The Cave speaks, so it introduces it self and presents seven characters that are about to enter it, but you can only choose three of them. They are: The Knight; The Cientist; The Adventurer; The Twins; The Monk; The Time Traveler; and The Hillbilly. You'll be taken on a journey to find what they desire most and what they would do to get it. The cave is divided into seven character themed stages and three unchangable stages that are interconnected. So whenever you play you'll go through three stages based on each of the characters you choose at the start and three that will aways be the same. The Cave is filled with puzzles, interesting stories and a funny narrator. The only problem I have with the game is the fact that to play with three new characters I had to go through the other three unchangable levels and there was still one character left to play with, but this one I watched on Youtube. Overall the puzzles are really good, but some are better than others. I would recommend you to play with the Cientist, the Time Traveler and the Hillbilly, because they have the best stages. Then play with the Adventurer, the Twins and the Monk, which are ok. The Knight has the worst stage, but it is on the start of the cave so you can easily play it as the last character and then watch his endings on Youtube.			"

												-- This is not a real co-op game, basically only one player will control a character at a time and the other has to wait. The tag is a lie.---- The ladder climbing is tedious and together with revisiting and running around it makes up most of your gametime. This part was just a pure waste of time and makes this game not enjoyable to me.-- The ""riddles"" are way to easy, and if this game is more about the story than those riddles, then why did the game design make us get and return objects and/or climb ladders for ages?+ Nice graphicsTaking away the time spent on ladder/rope climbing and tedious run-and-get tasks, the play time for a playthrough would end up being 15% of the time. This game is stretched like the backdoor of a pornstar specialised on backdoor porn.  For this reason alone I would give this game a big fat thumbs down. I would not recommend this to anyone except maybe a 10- year old because the riddles are just dumb.			"

												at first i doubt this game, but i give a try, since double fine who make it.then... i enter the cave and never return XDthe storytelling is charming and humorous, simple but smart. the replayability is good, since you only can pick 3 from 7 char. so if you want to complete all you need play at least 3 times. in summary this game like perfect blend from Limbo + Trine + Bastion + Double FIne. You cannot expect more and less. You only can enjoy it.			"

												Oh, wow, do I love this game. It reminds me of the kinds of games I grew up with as a child and played over and over again until I could do them perfectly. . . The problem with not having all that much money but having way too much time on my hands as a child. That's first world problems for you.I'm not going to say it's for everyone, though. The humor is rather dry and often at least a little bit macabre (the twins, for instance) but if you like dark humor (which I love) this game will at least be fun for that.There are a few problems. There are some odd glitches every now and again, though they are not all that frequent (unless you're doing the no deaths runthrough, when every deadly glitch rears its ugly head). The biggest problem is that you can't skip any of the cutscenes or dialogue. Don't get me wrong, both are superb in this game (I'm pretty sure Grey DeLisle voices at least one of them, too) but since this is a game that relies on multiple playthroughs, the skip feature really should have been included. I mean, trying to do the no deaths playthrough alone will probably have you just leaving the room on occasion to do other things while you wait.Saying all that, this game is just too much fun to pass up. It's worth the price and if it's on sale, doubly so. Oh, and get the soundtrack because it is fantastic!(Also, I just checked, and Grey actually voices three characters.)			"

												This game was fun once, but its' replayability is limited. It offers multiple characters who each come with their own levels, but those levels are interspersed with stock levels that you have to run through every time. There isn't enough variation in the characters to make those stock levels interesting on subsequent replays. THe play-through time with one set of characters is also quite short so, while the dialogue and story is fun, the game just isn't that worth it.			"

												Many, if not all, cultural phenomena can be traced back successfully to a point of origin, something that Hunter S. Thompson would call a “long fine flash“ condensing the energy of an entire generation, ushering forward the new and unexpected. For adventure games that point was late 80s and the reason was Ron Gilbert with his crew at LucasArts. When the team was busy laying the foundations of an entire genre with Maniac Mansion, my parents were still enjoying a carefree and childless life so, unfortunately, I have missed what some consider the golden era of point-and-click adventure games. Even later on, my path has rarely crossed with the classics, being a primarily console gamer and all, but finally the genre has caught up to me and sparked my interest like not many do (maybe it was the top hat). Finally, upon seeing the trailer for The Cave, the title that Ron Gilbert was returning to adventure games, I knew that fate was giving me a chance to confront the past of the genre and maybe even the future. After finishing the game I’m pretty sure I saw neither.The game starts with the player being greeted by the titular Cave, who will also be the narrator further on, and being given a choice of 3 out of 7 distinct characters with vague names such as The Scientist, The Adventurer, The Monk and so on. Each of the characters not only has a unique ability to them but also an exclusive storyline. Quite soon you will realize that the narration is something different from what we are accustomed to – none of the characters, except the Cave, have any dialogue and their past is discovered by the player in comic book-like pages that are plastered on the walls with an occasional nod or hint from the omniscient narrator. The Cave offers a rather rarely seen exposition by gameplay where you unravel the mysteries by your own actions – and most of them are not what would be generally considered “nice”. You accidentally murder people on your quest to get the treasure, push the switch or any other achievement-trope you can think off which generates an unique feeling of dread of what will the next area and next puzzle bring. The pinnacle of suspense is by far the campaign for The Twins, which presents us with two children determined to break away from their over-loving parents – at all costs (think of Tim Burton when his creative juices were still running). It is easy to spoil what happens in The Cave so I will not go into further details as the stories presented are not exactly complex, yet they somehow latch on to you, as every parable should.The gameplay is broken into 6 areas – 3 unique to their characters interwoven with 3 more general with everybody in your team taking part in the action. As you go further down, the spelunking will take you from an old mine through a monster-infested route up to an isolated island whose only residents are an old hermit, his parrot and his dog (hilarity ensues). The puzzles contained within the sectors, while not very creative or fresh, flow naturally from one to another and very rarely do you feel like your path is being artificially blocked. When you leave the island you have seen the worst side of your back-stabbing, money-grubbing, fame-craving team and you are ready for a catharsis, a moment where you can make all wrongs into rights and somehow redeem your ensemble. Unfortunately, you are thrown to the entrance of the Cave where you uncover the last page of the comic book. The game ends.With 4 hours on the clock you feel cheated, not only by the game time (you still have other characters to play after all) but by the lack of resolution. After all you have went through, it feels like the game-creators have thrown the towel in mid-sentence and called it quits, leaving the player yearning for a proper ending to a story they have witnessed. With each next playthrough the feeling only intensifies. Once again you are forced to complete the same general areas which offer nothing new – not in terms of cooperation which boils down to “have three people pull three levers” and not in terms of using unique abilities to solve puzzles. The platforming, with which the game is abounded, is stiff and rather annoying, not surprising given Gilbert's detest of it. You begin to long for a normal inventory instead of going to-and-fro carrying items one at a time. The character-specific areas feel wonderful and refreshing but once again the crew’s struggles feel futile in the wake of the ending. Even the addition of a “good” ending that can be achieved is meaningless, as it feels tacked on and irritatingly un-final. When you look back on The Cave you see an unpolished gem that, with a bit more work and thought put into it, might be seen as an example of proper gameplay-driven narrative dealing with common, but not trivial, themes. It is a journey that does as much well as it does bad leaving the player with a thirst for more. As for my dilemma – unfortunately it is neither the past nor the future but the present, in all it’s wobbly, uncertain and disappointing glory. http://www.gatheryourparty.com/articles/2013/03/29/the-cave-review/(Do not buy this at full price.)

												This game is a platformer puzzle, but fails in both styles. There is nothing challenging in the platformer part, no dexterity is required. The puzzle part is like those point-and-click games. But you are faced with only one challange at a time and there are only a couple of items available so the solutions are quite straightforward.For me the real issue was how multiplayer works. Yes, the game supports couch multiplayer, but actually it does not work well. It is part of the puzzles to do something with one character while you leave the others do something else. This means characters can, and often do get off-screen. The result is that your buddy is just watching you as you walk, and walk, and walk, and walk... My daughter was totally bored and quickly abandoned me.All together this is not a bad game but not a good one, either. I, at least, had no joy when the characters reached to bottom of the Cave and had no inspiration to try a different set of characters which would present me some different parts of the Cave.			"

												The Cave is an old school graphic adventure masquerading as a platformer, built with a stylized 3-D environment but lacking meaningful challenge or story.I was a big fan of the Monkey Island series, as well as other point-and-click games under the LucasArts and Sierra labels, so I had high hopes that The Cave would follow in the footsteps of this fledgling genre. Needless to say, The Cave failed to deliver any of the features that made these games fun.The puzzles are nearly all straightforward and lead to few of the ""ah-ha!"" moments that should have been prominent in such a game. Most of the time required to solve the puzzles involves walking back and forth across each level, and few of the puzzles relate in a meaningful way to any story. The idea of including unique levels for each character chosen is a nice idea, but these character stories aren't particularly motivating or fulfilling. The narrator admittedly has its own charm that can be fun at times. However, the simple premise of ""three adventurers wander around in a cave"" leaves little for the development of sophisticated humor that intertwines with a farcical yet compelling plot. I miss games like that, and unfortunately The Cave doesn't quite fit the bill. "

												I bought this game because it had local co-op.  It turns out the game plays where you alternate characters, so local co-op isn't really people playing at the same time, instead it's taking turns playing (like swapping controllers).  The game is extremely buggy and some of the puzzle solution very unforgiving (e.g. you had to HOLD a button while switching characters to solve one of the puzzles).Furthermore, the endings are all very depressing forcing you to play through the game yet again, with the same puzzles in order to obtain better ones.  I love Double Fine but this is NOT a good game.			"

												Gameplay is tedious and boring: The puzzles involve a LOT of back-tracking, which makes the game feel like busy-work instead of an adventure. Local co-op is not implemented well: When another player goes off-screen, their character can't do anything (including, for example, moving to get back on-screen!). This makes playing with someone with less gaming skill feel like babysitting (because they have to keep up, or else).Platforming and character movement generally feels sloppy and sluggish.			"

												As enticing as another double fine game made by the same person who brought you Maniac mansion sounds, I would only recomend this to people who are completly starved for another adventure game. You can take control of a group of three quite unique and well desighned characters from a pool of seven as you lead them to face their dark secrets and gain the one thing they truely desire.The problem with this game come in three factors. One, while the characters look interesting at first glance. you quickly realize that the only view into what make them up is literaly a seven page comic that you find pieces of alonge the way. None of them will say anything about the things and events around them which is a heavy staple in any adventure game. Having differnt people observe the same places that you have to go through every playthough in seperat ways would drastically cut down on the monotonus parts of this game which leads to...Factor number two which is that several of the puzzles while clever are hanpered by long hallway and slow ladders seperating each puzzle piece. This is also compounded by the fact that each member of your group can only carry one item at a time neccesitating constant back and forth even well you do find out what to do. One play through was hard enough which leads to.....Factor number three which is that if you want to get all of the ending comic panels you HAVE to play the game from start to end SIX TIMES. you have seven people to play as each with a good and bad ending which is decided by one final choice and a hidden one at that. Also you would think that playing as new people would change the game drastically but eachs person's dark deed moment is sectioned off into a different stage. I could see which ones I was missing as I passed the themed enterance down the cave.It pains me to pick this game to pieces because I really wanted this to be good. It had a good consept from under used genre. I was even reminded of a lighthearted silent hill as wierd as that sounds because both are about people with dark pasts venturing into a location that changes itself to force that dark secret into the person's face, But it's held back by bad use of the three person mechanic, shallow characters, and tedious puzzles.

												The Cave, made by Ron Gilbert, best known for Maniac Mansion and the first two Monkey Island games, along with many other fun, creative, enjoyable games.I wanted to like this game. That's how it's supposed to work, right? A creator who pioneers an era of video-gaming gets shoved aside for a few years, and he comes back, proving he just needed monetary backing to let his creative energies flow and creates a solid game that showcases his unique vision and proves himself worthy of great respect and consideration.I wanted to experience that... but I did not.The puzzles are fun the first playthrough, and the concept of ""different characters can solve the puzzles different ways,"" filled me with nostalgic glee for the original Maniac Mansion, but it's not to be. The majority of puzzles are the same no matter who you choose. The characters' individual powers only really matter for their individual maps and some token moments. Moreover, most of the characters just aren't that interesting. The Scientist's story was probably the best. The Twins' was at least amusing. But, the rest...The game has multiple endings. The ending you get depends entirely on a choice you make at the very end of the game. You must play through the game a second time to see the other ending. No saving and reloading. This is not how you do multiple endings in a satisfying way. This is just wasting our time.You probably would be better off watching a Let's Play than actually playing the game.			"

												A quirky puzzle-platformer by Double Fine. The Cave was for me, thorougly enjoyable (I played it with a controller). The game has a lovely art style and a good control-scheme. Gameplay-wise each character has their own little story, with them being combined depending on who you choose, it is well worth replaying to see each characters story!And I know some will want to know about the 30FPS lock. So I'll be honest, I couldn't notice it that much, and I've been someone who is heavily towards the ""60FPS or GTFO"" camp. I suppose I was ill when I played this game, which may have affected things, but either way I don't feel the 30FPS lock on this should put you off.Well worth the purchase, even at full price!			"

												Absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥game. More like a story-book that reads♥♥♥♥♥♥to you.  Huge waste of time and money.  It's flashy graphics, bad story, innapropriate, and not funny.  I watched the trailers and thought maybe it was some type of interesting dungeon crawler, with an open twist.  But basically it takes your hero's and makes them look like criminals, rapists, murderers.  Then you proceed to turn of this game out of disgust, boredom, and being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that you wasted money and time.  DO NOT GET THIS GAME.			"

												I personally did not enjoy this game. The clunky gameplay, weird storyline (didn't make sense), and almost pieced together is seconds gameplay struck me as a game I should not like. If you are a fan of Sega, get this. If you have a powerful PC, get this. If not, avoid at all costs.			"

												The dark tone, humor, and art of this game caused me to do two things I'd never done: want to play more puzzle platformers, and replay it completely two more times after finishing, even through the same puzzles.  If it weren't for the backtracking due to limited puzzle solutions, it would be a 10/10.			"

												This game will captivate you. I purchased it on sale with no knowledge of what it was. Five hours later I was finishing 3 of the 14 potential endings. I can't wait to play through the other 11! This game is a beautiful work of art, reminiscent of games like The Lost Vikings. It has a certain atmosphere that pulled me in and kept me wanting to see the end. I was drawn into the suspense and mystery of the individual character stories, and found the various puzzles to be challenging. I'm looking forward to playing the other 4 characters.			"

												Here is how you play the game: you walk with character A along path 1. At the end of path 1 you realize that you need character B here to advance. So you walk along path 1 with character B. Next you walk along path 2 with character C. Now, here you need character A. You walk path 1 backwards to reach the end of path 2. You walk back the paths with all three characters consecutively to follow path 3 to the exit... did this description bore you? Well, if so you know what it is like to play this game. Besides this painfully boring repetitive walking around there is not much to say about this game. The story is OKish but nothing special (no great sense of humor or such). The puzzles are mostly fair, but (again) nothing special. The only positive thing about this game is that the artwork is really nice.			"

												The Cave is a fun yet flawed adventure game. One that challenges the mind though does not make it explode. With an underlying story about morality you'd expect the worst, but it's a fairly enjoyable journey. With a party of three out of seven possible characters, you descent down the Cave. Each character has their own dark secret, their own unique ability and one exclusive section inside the Cave.That basically means you have to play through the whole game three times to max it out. That would have been okay, if not for the recurring puzzles which can't be skipped, resulting in slow and repetitive gameplay, really hurting replay value. While giving a worthy challenge and raising a few laughs - its one of the more original and creative games in a while. Yet its falling short on so many aspects, you can't help but feeling this game could have, and perhaps should have, been so much better. +Original and creative+Funny+Challenging and lots of 'But of course'-moments+One playthrough won't leave you satisfied (but a third for one new puzzle might not be worth it)-Clunky controls-Slow, mandatory puzzles on replays-Bugs (I've encountered a LOT)-Some graphic issues -A bit too short6+/10			"

												8/10Amazing game, I'd consider it a must-play for any fans of puzzle games. Puzzles are creative, the stories for the different characters are interesting and there's a lot of good humor in the game, thanks to the narrator.7 characters, 2 endings for each and the cave paintings makes sure this game lasts for quite a while, but that's also the one flaw in the game: lack of replay value. A single playthrough is pretty short and since the puzzles are always the same and there aren't many optional activities in the game, there isn't much reason to go back to this game once it's fully completed.

												I enjoy a bad pun.  After the third time hearing it with the exact same inflection I enjoy that bad pun significantly less.If you're going to make me go through the same series of bad puns at least twice because three of the six levels in each playthrough are the same, at least give me six or nine characters to do it with so I'm not replaying FIVE levels of EVEN MORE BAD PUNS just to finish out the game with the last character.  I just end up thinking the whole talking cave thing isn't nearly as clever as the game thinks it is, and the unskippable opening monologue in no way helps this impression.			"

												Well I had high expectations for this one. Its meets many of those expectations without any doubts. Wonderful visuals without having to drift backwards in graphics quality.  Seems many old school adventure game developers feel that in order to get that old school feel the graphics need to suffer. In this case it proves you can have both classic gaming wrapped in charming graphics.  Very interesting twist having 7 characters to choose from, each with their own unique skills or special abilities. This goes along with a lot of the more recent adventure style games requiring multiple characters. One needs to be sent to hold a certain lever, another to pull on something else while the 3rd is there to accomplish the task. Each of 7 characters has a special gift or ability. The adventurer had her lasso in order to swing from over head features while the ""Twins"" can leave phantoms of themselves in place. Overall a great title, certainly does not disappoint. Puzzles are hard to enough to keep me interested. Very little if NO hand holding with this one. One thing the screenshots dont do justice to just how charming and nice the graphics are. Very well done title.			"

												I can recommend this game to Adventure players, however only barely, 6/10. It has some nice puzzles, good voice acting (mostly narrative), and some dark humor. The game centers around 7 different characters, from who you can take 3 with you per playthrough. There are ca. 7 puzzle sets per playthrough, that means 4 common ones which are identical in every playhtrough, and 3 which are character specific. And there lies the big problem of the game... you need at least 3 playthroughs to see most of the game (although in the 3rd playthrough, only 1 of the 7 puzzlesets is still new and unique!) an there is a lot of backtracking. You even need 5 complete playthroughs to get all achievements/see the whole story, although only 1% is still novel, and that is quite boring. It was already a chore for me to do 3 playthroughs, thats all I will do.			"

												I have a soft spot for monkey paw storylines, but there is little to like about The Cave beyond that. The gameplay is clunky, tedious, and requires a full three playthroughs of slogging through the same puzzles in order to experience the entirety of its underwhelming storyline. I enjoyed my time exploring The Cave, but I won't go back and I certainly wouldn't recommend others to start spelunking it.			"

												I typically love Double Fine's games, but this was a great disappointment.  The dialog and art style are the two good qualities this game offers.  The frequent backtracking regarding puzzles, need to repeat the game multiple times for completion, and obtuseness of some puzzles (or ease for some) are only some of the negatives.The worst part of my experience (having played this one and one half years after release) was the game-breaking bug of one of my characters falling into nothingness and being deleted from my three available slots.  This left me unable to continue in the game.  The only thing left for me to do is to restart from the beginning which I will not be doing any time soon as replaying these puzzles is tedious at best.As an aside, while the game allows for multiplayer, this may as well be reduced to pass and play with a controller.  This is only a single player game despite what it may be advertised as.I would have a difficult time even recommending this game if it were free, and I wish this weren't the case.  There is too much wrong to ignore.			"

												Cool design and funny story telling, but the game play is very unintuitive in areas. The puzzles seem to be all over the board with not a lot of hints on what you should be doing, tho overall its a find key open door concept for most things.The game has different areas, some seem based on the characters and others are inaccessible, perhaps trying to promote replayability by picking the other available heroes a second time. No real tool tips on why you should pick certain characters to start off.The game overall has a nice design and I will probably finish it eventually, but at times it seems forced to be multiple games in one, too all over the board, hard to get imersed in to the world or the game play with 3 characters if you compare it to something like Trine.Edit:Just got the the end, and there is no ending, you are basically encouraged to start over with other characters, which in turn will make you replay about half of the same game play to once again, get to no ending. While I am a fan of the publisher, I just think this one was poorly executed.			"

												It's a puzzle-adventure-platformer, but the platforming is boring and the puzzles involve a lot of backtracking with all three of your characters. Compounded with the fact that there is no map means that this game is a chore to play. It is aesthetically very pleasing but the game would have been better as a traditional point-and-click instead of a platformer.			"

Maybe it's better if you have friends with you to do local multiplayer with, but it really didn't work for me solo.  Too much character switching and moving around to progress.  Trine was a good example of how that mechanic should be done solo.Honestly, I'd suggest watching a high quality LP instead of buying it.			"

												While the idea of transitioning between 3/7 characters through a magical cave that creates worlds base on each their psyche was interesting, the execution was very disapointing. After my first playthrough I got to admit it was pretty fun, but the next two runs got boring and repetitive since your force to play through the same puzzle areas just to get the new part of the cave thats base on a different character you choose. The worse part in playing this is on the 3rd run you not only force to do the same puzzle areas but the same two character special areas with nothing new to challange you whatsoever just to get to the last area you have not explore.  Each characters in the game have a special trait in which to solve different puzzles. unfortunately they can only use them productively in their own special world thus making them unreliable when it comes to the  regular repetitive puzzle areas we all love so much. honestly the creaters could have made a better game if they allow us  to choose any of the seven characters on the fly and explore the whole cave in one run with added puzzles that requires more than one of their special abilities. I did enjoy the visuals, story, and voice acting since it reminds me of nightmare before christmas, Overall I say it's better to pass since it's a reptitive grind just to experiance the whole game. It would have been fine if they made it a one time playthrough with extra levels that extands the use of their abilities. Your better off watching a walkthrough online if your only interested in the story.			"

												Were it not for the destinctive art-style; the poor controls, weak writing and dull gameplay would never suggest that this was a Double-Fine game. While co-operative gameplay may be different, playing alone will require you to make the same journey to the next puzzle for each of the three characters you control, meaning a minimum of 3-times for one-way, 6-times if you need to double-back (and you likely will), and any number more if you get stuck. This game offers little more than repetition and traversing the more-or-less linier path, which is rendered a chore by the clunky and innacurate controls. If you're looking for a fun, beautiful, side-scrolling action-puzzler, you're far better off with Trine (which also offers 3-player co-op).If you're a die-hard fan of Double-Fine, as I am, give it a go. There are nods to your favourite games and glimmers of that humor we all love (not to mention the beautiful drawn-art and character design), yet within an hour I was bored and frustrated, and by two I'm writing this, not expecting the experiance to improve. Do yourself a favour and get a copy of Brutal Legend: a visually stunning and rich world full of action, humor and emotion that this game seems devoid of.			"

												The Cave does not value your time. It's a short game, yet still manages to feel tedious. Most of The Cave's puzzles have pretty obvious answers, but due to its awkward platforming and one-item-per-character carrying system, you'll spend more time meandering around than anything.There are 7 characters with unique stories, and you can take 3 with you. Meaning you will have to play the game 3 times to experience everything, with at least one repeat character during your second/third playthrough. You will replay content. Regardless, it's not particularly fun the first time through, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a second or third time.			"

												I bought this game hoping for an experience like Monkey Island (a reasonable expectation considering the store page advertising) with fantastic humor and funny puzzles. It was slightly funny at times but mostly it ended up being boring. There was nearly no music most of the time and the dialogue was uninteresting. You have to spend lots of time going back and forth through large areas and the characters do not move quickly. I played through to the end so as to feel like I at least gave it a try but I am sorry to say that this game did not live up to my expectations.To summarize my feelings I'd say that while this game has a few fun puzzles and a couple of funny lines it's not enough to make up for the rest of the time you'll put into it.

												I'm just going to be blunt here because this game speaks for itself. To describe it in one sentence would be ""One big glorious shared masturbation between Tim Schafer and the other Double Fine guys and every single one of their fans"".The way I see it, this is like Psychonauts but with the focus entirely on dialog and character development. It's also what Psychonauts would have been like if it were not for EA and LucasArts being moral watchdog pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It explores pretty dark motivations and is not afraid of showing fairly brutal murder that the cartoony aesthetic makes more grim for some reason. Especially because of how The Cave reacts to it so non-chalantly. He's seen this cycle repeat for thousands of years.This is where the spoilers start. From what I can tell The Cave is a purgatory of sorts. Characters are stuck in a loop of reincarnation and retreading their paths until they can not be total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and be redeemed. It really makes the playthroughs seamless from both a story and technical standpoint.Speaking of technical standpoint, from the perspective of a programmer I am absolutely in love with this game for a few reasons. Firstly, it uses Buddha (appropriate name hm?) which as far as I can tell is an engine that Double Fine wrote for their stuff in house and uses Lua as an extension language. They used it for Costume Quest and probably Stacking and others. I deeply admire and respect when people write engines that are reusable and aren't just marketing throw-aways. Damn shame that Double Fine is keeping it proprietary though.Besides that, the story justifies the reuse of game assets marvelously. It uses mostly the same map but with minor changes for each character that opens pathways and other branches. It gets a little bit repetitive when you're doing the generic transition levels but still. I rarely see such a robust way of extending a game in a non-intrusive manner.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine The Cave is a game developed by Double Fine Productions and published by SEGA. Now I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games unless done right but I must say I enjoyed The Cave. The game is charming, funny and cleverThe animations of the each individual characters, music and voice acting is awesome and well produced. The premise of the game is that there are seven characters and you pick three of them at the begining of the game and try to get them out of the caveEach character has a different story, a unique skill and their own levels. In order to get everyone out of the cave you need to play it at least three times. If you want to see everything the game has to offer (there are two endings for each character) you need at least five playthroughsThis may sound boring, but puzzle solving in this game is really fun. Also depending on your characters and the items you picked along the way, you can find some shortcuts in some certain levelsLong story short, even if you're not a fan of the genre, I say give The Cave a chance, it is a wonderful little indie game! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is great, not beacause of its gameplay, but beacause of the plot. If u are a fan of brainless jumpin' simulators, like the earliest marios than this game will probably frustrate you, bore you, etc. ,however if u appreciate well written plot and seek deeper meaning within everything, than this is a game for you. It may seem like a game simiular to ""Sam & Max"" if it comes to humor and plot but in reality its much darker and gory. Overall this game is good if it comes to plot, but not too revolutionary if it comes to puzzles, and another thing, the twins are the cuttest thing that has ever been created for video games(by my opinion).

												Just don't. Shoddy 30 fps framrate cap. Plays like a console port from unexperienced developers, definitely not something I would expect from Double Fine. Also, the game mechanics are horrible, in order to get all seven stories you have to replay two of them and the whole system of charachter switching feels bulky and unbecoming of any puzzle game. Speaking of puzzles, this game has two types of puzzles, the ridiculously hard ones that take 20 minutes to figure out that you have to use the games clunky mechanics to throw a sausage on a spike, and the ones that are so easy that you feel like, why am I even wasting my time? In my opinion, till they fix the bugs, fps cap and shoddy mechanics, this is NOT worth 15 dollars.			"

												A puzzle game that has random solutions to puzzles that are not intuitive, areas are too large in many places to find the solution without using the internet to find the one odd spot say to place dynamite to get excalibur.  Also many things are scripted meaning a door wont open unless you walk with a certain character to a certain place.  Like most platformer games this game excels at having bad controls, also its odd for a platformer but if you fall from certain heights you die.  Games like this should have ""GOOGLE"" listed under requirements because without it, good luck!!!!  Broken controls and lack of built in google app to the game means on its own its unplayable.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												A fun adventure puzzle game. The overall atmosphere of the game is fantastic and straddles the line between whimsical and dark. Most of the puzzles are good, although a few are frustrating and based on some petty details that didn't seem at all relevant. The voice acting and jokes were overall well performed, although some of the jokes don't land as well as they were intended. If you enjoyed other Double Fine games, this one is a welcome addition to your library.			"

												A fantastic puzzle-platformer!  Just as good as The trine games (if not better)!  Very smooth cartoon graphics, a cast of 7 diverse, playable characters.  Each character has a unique abilty as well.  My favorite aspect of the game is how each character has their own ""level"" can only be played when you have them in your party (only 3 in your party  per playthrough), so you can't experience the full game in one playthrough.  Now you're probably thinking ""I don't want to have to play the game more than once"". The beauty of this though is that it each playthrough feels different, because you're not replaying it in the same sequence and learning new things ech time you have a new character.  Another great feature is that you can only solve certain puzzles with specific characters because their abilities are rquired.  Don't worry though, you can always progress!  Anyway, my first playthrough took me about 5+ hours, and I'm currently on my second.  I hope to see some more amazing and challenging puzzlers like this in the future!P.S.  The narrator is the actual cave that you are traversing.  The story is cheesy, but also very funny at times.  Just get it PERIOD  ^_^			"

												A fun and interesting game, that I have played a lot.It has problems sure, but I really do enjoy it.The dialogue is great, the level design is fun and creative, and I really love that you actually avoid entire sections of the game if you bring certain characters or items along. (Hint bringing an item from earlier in the game will allow you to completely avoid the zoo section)For instance my first time playing, I brought along the Monk, Scientist, and Knight. I ended up using the Monk's Ability to get through the Knight's section, which was nice but the next time I had the Knight with out the Monk, I had to actually figure out how you were supposed to actually do it. The music is also fantastic, and I will definitely get the soundtrack one of these days. It is slightly annoying that you have to play through the entire game to get a new ""ending"", but I really like what happens when one of your characters get the bad ending, because it was really affective in making me feel bad for getting their bad ending.

												There are six different characters you can play with, but only 3 are available at one time. You pick those characters at the beginning and you keep those 3 for the duration of the game. These characters allow you to go into certain areas, but the other areas will be closed to you until you beat the game and play with other characters. You really have to play the game 2-3 times to beat all the areas. It's a really neat puzzle story in a cave. But the cave is reaaaaaaaaaally big.			"

												I... like it.It's a simple, short puzzle platformer that's basically mediocre all around.But! The concept is pretty neat.Basically: you assemble a team of 3 adventurers who are seeking what they desire most inside ""The Cave"".To get it, they have to reach the bottom. Along the way, they must relive and overcome the most horrible deed they committed throughout their lives. You get bits and pieces of their past as you go along, all coming together for everyone in the end. You can play through it multiple times for everyones endings (there's a good and bad one for everyone) but the most annoying part of the whole game is that there's seven playable characters total. You can only take three at a time with you.The playthroughs get pretty short once you know what to do in every level, but doing the same damn thing again and again gets pretty boring.Basically, you'll only really enjoy this game for the story bits, (but if you want to see everything, be prepared to do the same things over and over) everything else is very bland. It also looks pretty sometimes, I guess.			"

												The Cave is a great point-and-click adventure, well drawn and excellently scripted.  You select three ""heroes"" to make your way to the bottom of a cave, each of them searching for something along the way.  The puzzles are tricky, the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, and the characters give the game a perfect touch of dark humor.  There're several amusing easter eggs from other games for the keen eye.  My biggest problem with The Cave is when I compare it to a similar game.Choosing three of seven available characters took me back to thoughts of Maniac Mansion.  If you are a fan of that game, you will be a little disappointed in the fact that different combinations do not mean different ways to defeat the game.  Each character has a unique stage to be played through, with common areas between them.  While the character's unique skill will be used in their own stage, the other characters are simply warm bodies used to solve a plethera of puzzles.  This lack of diversity also hurts replay value, since I haven't played since I beat the game with all seven characters.Aside from this one setback, I thoroughly enjoyed The Cave, and recommend this light-hearted yet sinister tale to all.

												Hello once again. Alright I think it's time to shed some light on this game that's gone unnoticed by many gamers.     The Cave is one of those funny, indie puzzle/platformer types of games. It immerses you into it's story with different characters you can pick. You find pictures, or you can go scavenging for them. These pictures will tell you about the character. It is quite grim in the sense that the stories are all of hatred and darkness, and just sins. Yet still it is a fun game that is narrated by a quite talented narrator. The comedy is nice and I love it for that. So what are you waiting for? Get your asses over here and buy this damn game! "

Some of the puzzles were a bit nerve racking, as they lacked good enough hints or explanation. I did kind of like the challenge because it felt more rewarding to complete them. I thought that it would have good replay value with the handful of characters available, but the game doesn't change enough with different characters and it became stale on the second go. I would recomend it at a discounted price.			"

												The start of this game creates an immersion unlike any game I've played.  There are no loading screens.  It features a tutorial that teaches you how to play while allowing you to progress.  Unfortunately, this game has very little replay value.  Each character gets their own unique level, however all of the transitions are identical to one another.  After your first play through, the mandatory tutorial becomes tedious.  Until you reach a new character's dedicated level, the transitions become a grind.I very much hoped for a Spelunky-like procedural level generation at least in the transitions between each character's static rooms, but I was let down.  Much of this game is static and repetitive, though it is certainly very good looking.  I wish the developers would have put more resources into making the game playable more than once rather than making it shiny.Wait for a sale, I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for this game.

												Very fun platformer and with the exception of the dark humor, is a great game for the family.  It has a very good atmosphere and rich graphics.  One minor gripe is that we got stuck on 2 spots because of the very specific button combinations needed even though we were doing the right thing (mine car switch and prehistoric boulder).			"

												What is The Cave? Choose your 3 hapless adventurers (from a group of 7) and you will find out soon enough. Easily playable in one sitting, The Cave is more a short story than a novel. It is whimsical, colorful, at times laugh-out-loud funny. The puzzles are challenging, but never tear-your-hair-out difficult. Think outside the box and you will go far. If you enjoyed Maniac Mansion (and who didn't??) or Psychonauts, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. There are more than a few nods to players of both of those games.			"

												The Cave - I find it hard to place this game in a genre...As a platformer it is clunky and devoid or difficulty or depth.As an adventure game it is too disjointed, with each short episodic section entirely unrelated to the last.I guess you could call it a puzzle game, but although the puzzles make sense they're a far cry from the likes of monkey island.There was one redeeming chapter in this game *** SPOILERS *** that used a time-travel mechanic, but (to cut a long story short) the player has just a 3 in 7 chance of seeing this in their first playthrough!And you're not coming back for a second try... This game is full to the brim of artificial gameplay lengthening!The only saving grace is the Stanley-Parable-esque narrator, but the jokes aren't *that* funny. The macabre mood helps, but they pulled their punches too much to keep things kid-friendly.I'd suggest it only as a gateway game for kids... but our kids are worth more than this. [3.8]			"

												Before I get into my complaints about this game, I just want to make it clear that I did, overall, really enjoy playing this game and would happily buy the sequel if they ever get around to making one.  The game play reminded me a lot of the old Vikings games, minus the perma-deaths, where you had to rely on the abilities of more than one person to get a job done.  The character levels and the “transition” levels (those stages usually between the character specific ones) were pretty fun and the puzzles, while not that hard, did give my brain a little exercise.     I won’t even bother gush over the art style or script for this game because you’d have to be made of stone not to like them.      This all being said, I did have a few problems with it.  First off, seven was not the lucky number here, it should have been nine.  The reason for this is that, by the time you get to the third round of the game, you have now exhausted playing all but a single character.  This means you have to repeat at least two people’s levels.  Knowing exactly what to do makes for a less fun experience the second or third time around.  I say “third time around” because of my second complaint.  I would have loved to see this game provide more than three “transition” stages.  Again, the ideal number would have been nine.  If the game designers had given each character their own transitional stage, then you would have never felt like you were playing the same game twice.  Tedium is the worst enemy of the “one solution only” adventure game.  If you have already solved the puzzle once, what value is there in solving it exactly the same way again?Of course, even after saying that, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants an excuse to laugh and enjoy a few hours running around a sentient cave.  Just remember, sometimes your greatest desires can be your own worst enemy.			"

												The game is very repetitive. The first time is awesome, there are 7 characters, you play with 3 each time, half the caverns in The Cave are common in all playthroughs, the rest are character specific. The common parts start feeling repetitive in the second run (6 of 7 characters). At the third run you are repeating most of the game, but at least you have seen the whole story. But not, each character has a second ending, that only matters for one simple thing you can do before the end. Conclusion, good game but very repetitive, I would have preferred a shorter and compact game.			"

It makes it more mysterious and it will make you want to see the endding to their story. There are multipy levels to play through plus you're want to finish all the achievements.

Before you say I didn't get the message or the parable of the story, I did, I get it, I understand the subliminial messaging, but it still doesn't change the fact it was a crap game, uninspired, underwhelming, and there's absolutely nothing you'll lose in life from skipping this.Bottom line: Pass up this game.

												It's a puzzle game. You need to use 3 of 7 characters with one different power each one to resolve the problem in a set of levels, some related to the characters chosen, some generic.Although at first looks interesting, soon lost all this magic when most of the time you are moving a character for one side to the opossite of the level, to carry an object or use his power.I played and finished the game with one set of characters and I don't wanna try again. At least, the sense of humor are good, and the end of story of the characters are interesting enough.I expect more from Ron, but, who doesn't? ;)			"

												Much of what I have to say about the Cave has been said in previous reviews, but I think it bears repeating in addition to some other things I've noticed.The story is an amusing one of dark humor, the graphics visually appealing, the music subtle and fitting, the controls easy and relatively smooth. The puzzles are simple and fun, but can get frustrating at times because of the lack of direction/clues/whatever you want to call it, which sometimes makes it hard to figure out where to start without referencing a guide. As people have said, there is a lot of repetitiveness, and there is a lot of running back and forth in many of the puzzles which at times can be frustrating if you don't have a lot of patience like myself. I never found myself having a problem working with the three characters per se, but at times it is annoying to only be able to carry one item at a time (which relates back to the running back and forth part). Having seven characters to play through with is certainly annoying by the time you reach the last one, because as people have noted, this means you have to redo all the puzzles for two of the characters you've already finished with. I definitely agree that for the most part the replay value is not very high, however, after playing it today for the first time in about six months, I found myself plesantly surprised at my renewed interest. The game has great potential and it's a bummer that nothing really gets switched up from runthrough to runthrough. I really enjoy the games that Double Fine puts out because they are simple but entertaining, with a colorful cast of characters and a little bit of snark and wit in the stories. I think despite it's flaws, the Cave still holds true to all of that. (And the scientist, time traveler, and adventurer are all women, which was a fun bonus perk for me because you don't often see women in those roles in games. None of that affects gameplay, but I still thought it was rad.)Overall, I would recommend the Cave. Maybe a 7 out of 10.			"

												I'm on my first playthrough with my first three characters, and all the reviews I've read have been on point: it's a beautiful game and the puzzles are easy enough to keep the pace going (there's nothing like that ""aha!"" moment), but the environments are too big. I didn't think that would be a problem (because I like exploring), but when you need to navigate the same series of sprawling passages over and over again to solve a puzzle -- especially when it's a trial-and-error puzzle that involves a prop you need to re-collect every time you fail -- you start to wonder what the developers were thinking. All the running around gets frustrating, which leads me to the walkthrough page faster than I'd like: if I've got to do so much ditch-digging just to try something that I don't know will work, I'd rather spoil it for myself.But I still recommend the game if you know what you're in for. It's a light puzzler with a dark sense of humour, and the visual design is breathtaking.			"

												Ron Gilbert making an adventure, must be good, right? Well it is, and if you played his classic adventures you will recognize his hand in this game. You can't deny it is a typical Ron Gilbert affair. Adventure games have evolved, and there are only a hand full of actions you can do (pick/drop, use & a special action), so in some ways that makes it easier. Indeed, the puzzles are not that hard, except for a few and certainly if you played adventures before you will know quickly what to do. That doesn't take away any of the joy though, get this game and experience Ron Gilberts magic touch once again.			"

Double fine basically had an idea for a multiplayer game, and then somewhere along the lines they decided multiplayer sucked, but the game was based around it so then they made some sort of hybrid and that came out so bad they threw it away, and then they decided they wanted money so they gave it a smooth announcer and released it.

												I liked the game, because of its humor, his comic-style graphics and the funny characters. What i really disliked was the performance of the graphics engine. The game shows in steam sometimes 60fps, sometimes around 50fps+ and sometimes 30fps despite the correct gamesettings and vsync disabled. The developer wrote in 2013 that they would fix this behaviour and promised constant 60fps. This has never happended. Who does not care, go buy the game, but i can not recommend the game with good conscience, mainly because of the performance.			"

												A game that deserves better than the reviews might suggest. As a big fan of all the classic Lucasarts adventures like ""Day of the Tentacle"" and ""Maniac Mansion,"" I had a great time with this game. It's funny, clever in parts, and entertaining enough that when I finished my first run through (in about 5-6 hours) I immediately started a second game with all new characters. Yeah, the controls can be floaty at times and yes, there is some backtracking, but you won't get hung up on those issues for long. I got it half off on a different site but I would have no regrets if I'd paid full price. This one's a buy.			"

												Fun game. I love the characters. It's kinda replayable, especially if you chose other characters. It felt a bit short to me though, even though there are the other characters to play. I finished the game once with 3 characters, and partly played the game with an additional 3 character but didn't feel like finishing it through. Something about it felt a bit repetitive, even though I knew the other characters have their own stories. Overall, I'd recommend this game when it's on sale.			"

												The Cave is less of a full fledged adventure game and more of a compartmentalized adventure game. You choose 3 of 7 characters to enter the cave and each character will have their own puzzle level with 3 constant puzzle levels that the player must always play through.For the old school adventure aficionados, the Cave won't be a challenge and may not live up to the experiences of games such as Monkey Island. For the rest the Cave sits as an enjoyable puzzle game with simple control schemes and interesting puzzle levels.There are 7 total characters each with a different special ability, the only issue I have with the abilities is that most of them are really only used in their specific levels, otherwise some of the abilities are pretty useless through out the rest of the game. There are characters that will allow you to get through certain puzzles quicker than normal but no puzzle requires a character outside of the main character for that story. Each character has their own story to tell, mostly told through their own level as well as through the storyboards that you pick up throughout the game. Due to only being able to play 3 characters at a time, multiple playthroughs of the game are needed to see everyone's ending. This only causes problems when you have to play the default puzzles that always show up in the game. It would have been better if there was say 6 default puzzles and 3 random ones would be dropped in everytime you played to keep the player guessing as to which puzzle was next. I got bored of the default puzzles real quick after playthrough 5 and up.The main dialogue in the game comes from the Cave itself and is really well written. Sure you'll get bored of it after playing through the game several times but on first play through it's enjoyable to listen to.The Cave is an adventure game worth playing but don't come in expecting it to replicate the old school adventure games.

												This game was preety great. Loved all the stories and the environments. It was a really fun game to play through. I especially liked the artwork telling the characters' stories you'd find along the way. You'll find yourself replaying it with every single character and trying to get every single ending of their stories. The good and bad ones. And can't forget the epic narration voice. I also liked how the achievements were not too hard to get like in some other games I've played, becuase I always feel the need to get them all. Anyways, I really recommend it.			"

												Basically reiterating what other players have said. Pretty disappointing for a Double Fine title. The first play through is great, every run after that becomes redundant. I wouldn't normally focus on this, but since a handful of achievements for the game or dependent on you replaying it (i.e., alternate endings for each character, which would require you to play at least 6 times) you'd hope they would introduce new intermediaries (that prospector wore on me even just the first time around). Even if you don't care about achievements, you'd have to play three separate times just to see every playable character. I love double fine, but man does this game stink. Does not even compare to the great storytelling of Grim Fandango or Psychonauts.			"

												I enjoyed this gave very much - I even finished it 3 times to see the whole story for all the 7 characters. I rarely go through the same single player game more than once, so this could be enough for a recommendation all alone. The Cave's major advantages are: - clever story telling, - dark humor, - enjoyable puzzles - very nice graphics. The disadvantages in my opinion are the fact that: - monk's puzzles are tedious and boring - it requires 3 runs to know the full story (with all the common elements over and over again). All in all, The Cave is a great game that I recommend to everybody. 9 out of 10			"

												I didn't buy The Cave immediately when it was originally released and this is mainly because I'm not a Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, or Double Fine fanboy. I like all of those things, but the only Ron Gilbert game I ever played was Maniac Mansion (which was great, but I was like 8 years old), and both Tim Schafer and Double Fine have shown me that they can do as much bad as good sometimes (cough ... Brutal Legend .. cough). I did eventually acquire The Cave though and having finally played it, found I enjoyed it.Right up front, the presentation of this game is top notch. The art, controls (I used an Xbox controller), and sound were excellent. The core conceit of the game design (choosing 3 out of 7 characters to go through the cave) I felt was a bit lacking though. The game makes concessions for your not having certain characters (and their abilities) with you and with the exception of completely optional cave painting unlocks and very minor shortcuts, your choice of characters is purely narrative. This isn't horrible, but it means you'll have to play through the game 3 times to get all the character stories and content, repeating the non-character specific areas of the game each time.The actual control of the multiple characters works rather well and for the most part the puzzles designed to rely on them are interesting as opposed to frustrating. My one gripe with the controlling multiple characters is the backtracking that takes place for each one in many instances. While there are checkpoint-like locations where the two other characters will instantly appear at the side of your controlled character in order to alleviate the tedium of treading the same ground again, some puzzles still require going back and forth through the same area with two or more characters in order to solve a puzzle.In the end, The Cave is a pleasant blend of adventure and puzzle genres with what I would consider to be an entry-level to intermediate difficulty. What it may lack in complexity it makes up for in charm and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a mild puzzler with good personality.			"

												Movement is slow in general, climbing/descending ladders and ropes is even more painful. As a result you spend pretty much all your time either exploring to locate puzzle nodes, or moving between the puzzle nodes you've already found. Sometimes they make you do the same boring long bit of traversal multiple times (for no good reason), sometimes its for a repeater puzzle, sometimes it is because you need to get multiple characters to the same place. It's annoying when you've already worked out what you need to do, I imagine it's downright maddening when you get to a sufficiently large area with non-trivial puzzles. I don't intened to stick with it to find out.TL;DR: Traversing the environment in this game is so tedious that I don't think I can be bothered playing any more of it.			"

												Players choose three of the seven available characters, each with unique talents. I'm currently playing with a knight who has the power of invincibility; an adventurer who can swing a grappling hook; and twins who have the ability to duplicate themselves. When you access special areas of the cave, you uncover scenes from your characters' pasts. Also, each character has a special quest that occurs in a unique area of the cave. (The knight is tasked by a king to defeat a dragon and retrieve an amulet for his daughter.)You switch control between the three characters as you advance through the cave. Often, teamwork is required as you must position the characters in certain areas or have them perform tasks simultaneously. There are monsters, but there is no combat. Instead, you must figure out how to get past monsters with strategy alone. For one early example, you ""battle"" a dragon with a hot dog and a claw like those found in an arcade game.Controls are simple, consisting of moving side to side, jumping, climbing, and picking up and using various objects. Characters can only hold one object at a time, and certain objects are needed to advance through different areas of the cave. Because it's not always obvious which objects must be used, you will often find yourself doubling back to retrieve dropped objects. This is a new type of game for me, so I've found myself running around aimlessly quite a bit, experimenting with different combinations of characters and objects to try to advance.So far, I've experienced no glitches. What I have experienced are clever puzzles, beautiful visuals, and a game that will lend itself to re-playability as I will want to try out all of the characters.			"

It is whimsical, colorful, at times laugh-out-loud funny. The puzzles are challenging, but never tear-your-hair-out difficult. Think outside the box and you will go far. If you enjoyed Maniac Mansion (and who didn't??) or Psychonauts, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. There are more than a few nods to players of both of those games.			"

												The start of this game creates an immersion unlike any game I've played.  There are no loading screens.  It features a tutorial that teaches you how to play while allowing you to progress.  Unfortunately, this game has very little replay value.  Each character gets their own unique level, however all of the transitions are identical to one another.  After your first play through, the mandatory tutorial becomes tedious.  Until you reach a new character's dedicated level, the transitions become a grind.I very much hoped for a Spelunky-like procedural level generation at least in the transitions between each character's static rooms, but I was let down.  Much of this game is static and repetitive, though it is certainly very good looking.  I wish the developers would have put more resources into making the game playable more than once rather than making it shiny.Wait for a sale, I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for this game.

												Very fun platformer and with the exception of the dark humor, is a great game for the family.  It has a very good atmosphere and rich graphics.  One minor gripe is that we got stuck on 2 spots because of the very specific button combinations needed even though we were doing the right thing (mine car switch and prehistoric boulder).			"

												A fun adventure puzzle game. The overall atmosphere of the game is fantastic and straddles the line between whimsical and dark. Most of the puzzles are good, although a few are frustrating and based on some petty details that didn't seem at all relevant. The voice acting and jokes were overall well performed, although some of the jokes don't land as well as they were intended. If you enjoyed other Double Fine games, this one is a welcome addition to your library.			"

												Fun game. I love the characters. It's kinda replayable, especially if you chose other characters. It felt a bit short to me though, even though there are the other characters to play. I finished the game once with 3 characters, and partly played the game with an additional 3 character but didn't feel like finishing it through. Something about it felt a bit repetitive, even though I knew the other characters have their own stories. Overall, I'd recommend this game when it's on sale.			"

												A game that deserves better than the reviews might suggest. As a big fan of all the classic Lucasarts adventures like ""Day of the Tentacle"" and ""Maniac Mansion,"" I had a great time with this game. It's funny, clever in parts, and entertaining enough that when I finished my first run through (in about 5-6 hours) I immediately started a second game with all new characters. Yeah, the controls can be floaty at times and yes, there is some backtracking, but you won't get hung up on those issues for long. I got it half off on a different site but I would have no regrets if I'd paid full price. This one's a buy.			"

												The Cave is less of a full fledged adventure game and more of a compartmentalized adventure game. You choose 3 of 7 characters to enter the cave and each character will have their own puzzle level with 3 constant puzzle levels that the player must always play through.For the old school adventure aficionados, the Cave won't be a challenge and may not live up to the experiences of games such as Monkey Island. For the rest the Cave sits as an enjoyable puzzle game with simple control schemes and interesting puzzle levels.There are 7 total characters each with a different special ability, the only issue I have with the abilities is that most of them are really only used in their specific levels, otherwise some of the abilities are pretty useless through out the rest of the game. There are characters that will allow you to get through certain puzzles quicker than normal but no puzzle requires a character outside of the main character for that story. Each character has their own story to tell, mostly told through their own level as well as through the storyboards that you pick up throughout the game. Due to only being able to play 3 characters at a time, multiple playthroughs of the game are needed to see everyone's ending. This only causes problems when you have to play the default puzzles that always show up in the game. It would have been better if there was say 6 default puzzles and 3 random ones would be dropped in everytime you played to keep the player guessing as to which puzzle was next. I got bored of the default puzzles real quick after playthrough 5 and up.The main dialogue in the game comes from the Cave itself and is really well written. Sure you'll get bored of it after playing through the game several times but on first play through it's enjoyable to listen to.The Cave is an adventure game worth playing but don't come in expecting it to replicate the old school adventure games.

												This game was preety great. Loved all the stories and the environments. It was a really fun game to play through. I especially liked the artwork telling the characters' stories you'd find along the way. You'll find yourself replaying it with every single character and trying to get every single ending of their stories. The good and bad ones. And can't forget the epic narration voice. I also liked how the achievements were not too hard to get like in some other games I've played, becuase I always feel the need to get them all. Anyways, I really recommend it.			"

												I'm on my first playthrough with my first three characters, and all the reviews I've read have been on point: it's a beautiful game and the puzzles are easy enough to keep the pace going (there's nothing like that ""aha!"" moment), but the environments are too big. I didn't think that would be a problem (because I like exploring), but when you need to navigate the same series of sprawling passages over and over again to solve a puzzle -- especially when it's a trial-and-error puzzle that involves a prop you need to re-collect every time you fail -- you start to wonder what the developers were thinking. All the running around gets frustrating, which leads me to the walkthrough page faster than I'd like: if I've got to do so much ditch-digging just to try something that I don't know will work, I'd rather spoil it for myself.But I still recommend the game if you know what you're in for. It's a light puzzler with a dark sense of humour, and the visual design is breathtaking.			"

And as others have said, the 3 characters thing is totally pointless; you rarely use or need more than one. I did like the Cave as a persona.I played and enjoyed but wouldn't recommend.			"

The 2.5D-graphics are nice.The character specific stories as well as their hidden twists are great. The character design of NPCs, the player can meet during the adventure is excellent in humor. Another example, that Double Fine's character-driven humor is the best one in games at the moment (the speaking cave and the castaway with parrot made me laugh a lot).A short game, with medium motivation to replay it. Maybe not a groundbreaking game, but a fresh concept with the potential for a new sub-category of adventure gaming. I can recommend it!			"

												Not even on a Steam SaleFirst the good stuff: Art and character designThis game has a whimsical art style and can be a fun cross between puzzles and light platforming, with particularly funny narration and character design.The bad stuff: Poorly executed forcing of replayThe game punishes users for indulging in that whimsy. The game forces painfully slow backtracking as you figure out a puzzle. Funnily enough, what's worse is when you can't backtrack: Because you frequently pass points of no return accidentally and the game autosaves, you can't have fun exploring an area you've completed because you risk losing access to collectibles or missable achievements. If that is a part of gaming you enjoy, it pretty much forces you to play with a guide open to keep you from missing anything, completely devaluing the collectibles and achievements.However the most aggregious, avoidable design sin is tha for each playthrough you select 3 out of 7 characters (I'll say it again: Three) to take through the campaign, which changes three character specific levels to the game. Did you catch that? The selection of three out of seven? If you are going to obligate replays like this, why not have a number of playable characters that is divisible by three!? This is infuriating and since several puzzles in the cave are permenant fixtures, not character specific, this means you have to play through some puzzles 3 times, and other puzzles (for the two characters you'll play twice) 2 times. Getting all achievements demands a total of 5 playthroughs, but by then you'll have lost all interest.There are some great indie-like titles on Steam, I encourage you to find them instead of buying this one, regardless of the price.

												WHAT A GAME! It is a nice adventure and puzzel game until you do the twins story! Their story is way beyond dark that it is just pure creepy, scary and wrong! I guess that was one of the reasons I enjoyed playing this game and hated playing this game. Thankfully the good ending allows for a good resolution. The structure of the game is great but gets extremly annoying at times. When trying to get the no-one-dies achievement sometimes when you jump a tiny bit more than you have to, you fall down dead and have to start the game over in order to get the achievement. The stories are nice and most of them are understandable/relatable if you look at it in terms of revenge or human psychology.8.2 / 10.0ShadowThe Shadow Network (ShadowNET)			"

The puzzles are fairly challenging without a guide, but are quite simple with a few tips and tricks.

												The game is very repetitive. The first time is awesome, there are 7 characters, you play with 3 each time, half the caverns in The Cave are common in all playthroughs, the rest are character specific. The common parts start feeling repetitive in the second run (6 of 7 characters). At the third run you are repeating most of the game, but at least you have seen the whole story. But not, each character has a second ending, that only matters for one simple thing you can do before the end. Conclusion, good game but very repetitive, I would have preferred a shorter and compact game.			"

												The Cave is a fun-filled, addicting puzzle game in which you can finish in less than 8 hours, but is also replayable due to the amount of characters there are. Despite the rating seen above, it actually deserves much more because the puzzles are so complex and have their own little story behind each one. The only major downside that I could think of from this game was that there are no tips, help options, or anything of the sort, and if you are stuck, you must use Wiki or any other guide source to help you. The characters themselves are a little twisted, but I do wish there were more puzzles to go through with each character and that the stories were a bit more complex. Overall, I would give this game a 8.5/10.			"

												This is an excellent little puzzle/adventure game! As always the Ron Gilbert humor is funny, in a relaxed sort of way. RG wrote Monkey Island 1+2, Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken and worked on Day of the Tentacle too. You're not likely to laugh out loud at most of the jokes, but they're likely to make you chuckle or at least smirk. I'm not done yet, but so far the puzzles are generally fairly easy, and the game has a great flow. What drives it is really the storytelling though, as with most true adventure games.

												I think the most impressive feature of this game can be found in the multiple choice set up.  Choosing from seven characters you pick three and switch between their skills – e.g. teleportation, a brief moment of immortality, Telekinesis, etc. –  to travel through the cave and ultimately ""survive"" the game.  Characters each have their own backstory which are experienced through areas assigned to their stereotypical being.  As the adventurerer you will find yourself in a pyramid recovering a sarcophagus while, as the Monk, you search for enlightenment in a temple.  All of the above enables you to replay this game without experiencing déjà vu – which is a main reason why many of my games end up on a high shelf – so you can still experience different stories after your first time.  In terms of tone, The Cave is a dour adventure – existing through puzzles – but you can still find yourself grinning by the quirky humour of the cave and the lively gameplay.  The puzzles are never unbearable or difficult.  Given, they aren't difficult at all and constantly having to switch between characters can get weary but, eventually, the game's design and concept makes up for that.  The game will save you some time as you can't leave behind a character due to a lack of switching.  You can either go no further wihout the help of another character or if you are too far ahead they'll eventually follow you to where you are.  The variation in character skills and environments also helps.  Summed up, The Cave is great if you're looking to have some casual fun.  It won't challenge your mind.  You'll find yourself in a world where everything is turned into a joke – sometimes subtle or even cruel – yet the story is well constructed and narrated.  All that through the enjoyable voice of Stephen Stanton. Because after all, you experience the stories through The – speaking – Cave, which on its own is a cheerful concept.  It's a matter of whether you can enjoy a charming, casual game.  Don't expect challenging puzzles and levels that need a large amount of time.  This game can be seen as a piece of art, something to enjoy, rather than something you have to fight through.  8/10			"

												The Cave isn't a hard game to recommend, it has a charming art style, some brilliant voice acting, and a focus on interesting characters that has been somewhat lost in gaming recently. I doubt that you'd be surprised to hear that this game was developed by Double Fine, as the Psychonauts-esque zaniness and humour remains present in this title.The game is not without its peeves though. Take for example the fact that there are 7 characters with unique stories, yet you cannot adventure with more than 3 of them at the same time. This means playing through the game 3 times, once with 2 characters you've already played with, left as irritating third wheels. What's more, each character has a good ending and a bad ending, which means playing through the game more than once with each character anyway in order to obtain all the endings (Which I wouldn't personally recommend doing, seeing as the endings change very little) There are even several default levels in-between the character driven story levels, which you have to play every time, and playing through these levels becomes tedious very quickly, as you are often forced to backtrack in these stages.Despite all this, I'd recommend this title. Maybe not full price, but on sale, it's a no-brainer purchase.			"

												This game has no difficulty at all... every puzzle with a few very rare exceptions took some thinking to resolve, mostly due to the lack of option and tools available.The story lacks charm in all aspects and the achievement hunting became repetitive as hell.I never thought i would say this but this is a Double Fine product that is not worth getting.

												Growing up, I was always a fan of the old LucasArts adventure games; especially the Monkey Island series.  In my opinion, they're some of the funniest, smartest, most entertaining games ever written, even if they sometimes leave you wanting to throw your computer out the window in frustration while trying to figure out exactly why you've had a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle in your inventory for game hours.The Cave, having been developed by Ron Gilbert and Tim Schaffer's studio, Double FIne, manages to capture some of that charm in a simple yet challenging puzzler.  One playthough takes right around 4-5 hours to complete (depending on how good you are are solving adventure-style puzzles, I guess), and is different depending on which mix of characters you choose to lead through the cave for that session.  Throughout each playthrough, you'll experience a mix of both ""common"" areas (areas that you may encounter regardless of which characters you choose), and character specific areas with puzzles that require the use of that character's special ability to solve.  There is a dark, sarcastic sense of humor that weaves a thread through the entire game, and these character areas, which serve to flesh out the characters' individual back stories (sparse as they may be), are no exception.  Fans of the adventure genre, especially the LucasArts games, will find lots to love here.  Aside from the puzzles themselves, there are a ton of small touches throughout the game that pay homage to Gilbert's earliest titles, especially Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion.  The puzzles are, in my opinion, fairly straightforward, though they may take a little time to figure out.  Some other reviewers complained about the lack of direction in the game regarding how to solve the puzzles.  I don't get it--this genre has always been about making the player figure out what to do without too much help from the game itself.  In my opinion, that's always been core to the experience of playing these types of games.  The feeling of accomplishment is much greater when you figure out a particularly challenging puzzle on your own, rather than relying on a cascade of hints.  But, I digress.Having only completed one playthrough so far, I can't comment yet on the game's replayability.  It seems to be there, as different mixes of characters provide a different experience, but I can see how replaying the same common areas over and over again could get old.  All in all, I'd give the game an 8/10.  The style, art direction, and writing are excellent.  At the current Summer Sale price of $7.49, it's well worth a purchase if you're a fan of adventure games, or even looking for something that's a little different that can kill a few hours here and there.

												The Cave is a puzzle game, where you can choose the charachters you wanna play (you can pick 3 from a list of 7). That's really nice and adds a replay value to the game, as each character has his unique level. The only thing i can complain about this is the fact that there are 7 characters and you can only choose 3 each time, this way beat the game twice with entire different teams, but to beat with them all you gonna have to play again with some you alredly have. Anyway, the puzzles are really nice with a good difficulty level, and there are some really funny moments as you shoul expect from DOuble fine games. I didn't encountered any bugs or problems in my two playtroughs. The graphics are really nice with a cartoon style, but somewhat i couldn't max it even thoug i can play farcry 3 on max in this computer. So if you like Double Fine and puzzle games, this is for you.8.4/10			"

												Being a Ron Gilbert game developed by Double Fine, this was an instant purchase for me. However, I was a bit disappointed by The Cave. The graphics and atmosphere are quite beautiful and the writing is witty, but not as hilarious as I expected it to be. Where it's lacking the most is in the gameplay department though. The puzzles range from extremely easy to slightly more complex yet still fairly easy and the level design with sometimes quite long walkways and some backtracking makes everything feel more like work than fun. I did get some enjoyment out of my first playthrough and I will return to The Cave to finish it with the other characters, but I was definitely a bit let down by this game.			"

												Before I get into my complaints about this game, I just want to make it clear that I did, overall, really enjoy playing this game and would happily buy the sequel if they ever get around to making one.  The game play reminded me a lot of the old Vikings games, minus the perma-deaths, where you had to rely on the abilities of more than one person to get a job done.  The character levels and the “transition” levels (those stages usually between the character specific ones) were pretty fun and the puzzles, while not that hard, did give my brain a little exercise.     I won’t even bother gush over the art style or script for this game because you’d have to be made of stone not to like them.      This all being said, I did have a few problems with it.  First off, seven was not the lucky number here, it should have been nine.  The reason for this is that, by the time you get to the third round of the game, you have now exhausted playing all but a single character.  This means you have to repeat at least two people’s levels.  Knowing exactly what to do makes for a less fun experience the second or third time around.  I say “third time around” because of my second complaint.  I would have loved to see this game provide more than three “transition” stages.  Again, the ideal number would have been nine.  If the game designers had given each character their own transitional stage, then you would have never felt like you were playing the same game twice.  Tedium is the worst enemy of the “one solution only” adventure game.  If you have already solved the puzzle once, what value is there in solving it exactly the same way again?Of course, even after saying that, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants an excuse to laugh and enjoy a few hours running around a sentient cave.  Just remember, sometimes your greatest desires can be your own worst enemy.			"

												The game has good graphics and some great puzzles to solve, but you have to pick only three of the ten characters.Since each character has their own ""bonus"" puzzle, if you want to play them all, you'd have to play the game (including the common regions) multiple times with different sets of characters. Nobody has time for that, plus some parts aren't really all that fun - especially not when you already know the solution.I got it on sale, so It's okay, but I wouldn't pay the full price for this game.

												My experience with Double Fine's games are that they tend to be equal parts hit and miss. The hit is usually in the concepts, and the miss will be in the execution. This game's no different.This game is basically a hybrid between a point & click adventure and a platformer, with a party of 3 characters running around at once, and many puzzles based on using 2 or 3 at the same time. Said party of 3 gets stuck in a sentient, talking Cave, which challenges them to learn a valuable life lesson. Failure implied not escaping from the Cave. The concept is interesting, the art & music also work well. It's all remniscent of a brighter version of Tim Burton's puppet movies. It also has a dark sense of humor, and some exploration is required to get the full story on the characters you're playing with. That covers the hits.The problems lie in the execution:Each character has a special ability, and a special section of the cave dedicated to them. Sadly, those sections are also the only bits where the different abilities really matter. Outside, there's a few points where you can use them, but there's always a generic solution close-by that renders the different abilities mostly obsolete.As a minor gripe, the game also doesn't offer any real hints that the special abilities exist, unless you open the ""How to play"" option in the menu.The controls for the platforming also feel sloppy at times, not a huge distraction as there's no real precision jumping etc. involved - the adventuring is definitely the dominant gameplay. But it can get annoying at times.The most baffling design choice though, is the fact that despite death having no penalties, you can easily fall to your ""death""  anyway. This really serves no point, and just results in lost time as you turn into a puff of smoke and float back to a previous checkpoint.Overall: recommended if you're a fan of point'n'click adventures and want to play one with a twist. If that's not your thing, you'll probably want to pass on this though. "

Couple that with the idea that to see it all and possibly get all of the achievements you would have to play the game from start to end at least a few times (7? 8?) and you get an off-putting experience, at least that's how it worked for me. Only finished it once, started another round, but the repetition was already so painful that I give up.On the plus side the aesthetics are really pleasing and so is the Stanley Parable-sque narrator.Only for the die hard Double Fine fans.

This also means you'd have to repeat the universal stages THREE times in order to see all 7 character specific stages... ugh.  I also wish there was a button that you could use to call your companions to your location so you wouldn't have to move all three through the same stuff... man, this game gets SO repetitive.

												I found this a relativly easy game apart from one thing, without spoiling it I recommend NOT looking up a charactars ability before choosing if you wish to add some difficulty.What is appealing is the replayabilty, a game that only takes a couple of hours to complete at the most actually needs 3 full play throughs to see all the content and experience all its variety. Having certain combinations of characters makes it easier or harder as well!Think outside the box and this game is simple, fun and rewarding.

												Much of what I have to say about the Cave has been said in previous reviews, but I think it bears repeating in addition to some other things I've noticed.The story is an amusing one of dark humor, the graphics visually appealing, the music subtle and fitting, the controls easy and relatively smooth. The puzzles are simple and fun, but can get frustrating at times because of the lack of direction/clues/whatever you want to call it, which sometimes makes it hard to figure out where to start without referencing a guide. As people have said, there is a lot of repetitiveness, and there is a lot of running back and forth in many of the puzzles which at times can be frustrating if you don't have a lot of patience like myself. I never found myself having a problem working with the three characters per se, but at times it is annoying to only be able to carry one item at a time (which relates back to the running back and forth part). Having seven characters to play through with is certainly annoying by the time you reach the last one, because as people have noted, this means you have to redo all the puzzles for two of the characters you've already finished with. I definitely agree that for the most part the replay value is not very high, however, after playing it today for the first time in about six months, I found myself plesantly surprised at my renewed interest. The game has great potential and it's a bummer that nothing really gets switched up from runthrough to runthrough. I really enjoy the games that Double Fine puts out because they are simple but entertaining, with a colorful cast of characters and a little bit of snark and wit in the stories. I think despite it's flaws, the Cave still holds true to all of that. (And the scientist, time traveler, and adventurer are all women, which was a fun bonus perk for me because you don't often see women in those roles in games. None of that affects gameplay, but I still thought it was rad.)Overall, I would recommend the Cave. Maybe a 7 out of 10.			"

												the characters, including the cave itself, are just great. the gameplay recalls the classic monkey island style irony in every location, dialogue and plot twist. unfortunately the puzzles don't always live up to expectations since some of them feel a bit unbalanced, either too easy or just unintelligible. the lack of an inventory (each character can carry only one item at a time) is probably what makes puzzles a bit limited. it's still great fun to play tho, worth the money.

												Graphics and gameplay are generally enjoyable.  The writing is witty, and generally the strongest part of the game.  The downside is that it's pretty exhausting having to play through the game three times in order to access all of the characters' special levels, given the amount of game that you must play through (all of the regular levels) which is completely unchanged regardless of which characters you play with.  The monotony creeps up fairly high given that this is a game you're largely expected to replay, not necessarily to get the best ending or achievements, but just to play all of the levels.Ultimately, a fun little diversion at sale prices, and worth a tour thanks to its humour, but I would have been highly disappointed in it if I had paid regular price.  So, it's recommended, lightly, if you can get it on sale.			"

												The start of this game creates an immersion unlike any game I've played.  There are no loading screens.  It features a tutorial that teaches you how to play while allowing you to progress.  Unfortunately, this game has very little replay value.  Each character gets their own unique level, however all of the transitions are identical to one another.  After your first play through, the mandatory tutorial becomes tedious.  Until you reach a new character's dedicated level, the transitions become a grind.I very much hoped for a Spelunky-like procedural level generation at least in the transitions between each character's static rooms, but I was let down.  Much of this game is static and repetitive, though it is certainly very good looking.  I wish the developers would have put more resources into making the game playable more than once rather than making it shiny.Wait for a sale, I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for this game.

												The Cave was a really great game that gives you characters who are morally corrupt, forcing you to take the actions that they took in order to progress. However, I feel there was a lot of wasted potential in not having a non-corrupt method of solving the puzzles, like the Justine DLC for Amnesia, making it very difficult and possibly requiring knowledge of what went wrong in order to know what to avoid. I thought that maybe I could use other character's powers to circumvent the choices made, but it turns out even if you avoid the actions you were condemned for, they happen anyway. It feels like so much wasted potential. Still for what is there, it's a very solid game and I don't regret playing it.			"

												Dear Double Fine Team,I have just completed my second run through ""The Cave"" and I must say it's a lovely game!The graphics are great and they remind me of an up-to-date version of the old Tentacle and Zack Mc Cracken days. As for the sound, I especially enjoyed the cave's voice with it's funny comments on the progress during the game. Great humor!The puzzles that one encounters range from ""that was easy"" to ""damn, now I'm checking a let's play video"".  But as for the one riddle with the jugs (playing with the monk), I insist that I did it on my own! Yeah, I've watched ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" too ;)This is one of the games that I bought on a steam sale thinking afterwards ""Wouldn't have hurt to pay full price for such a great game"". Doesn't happen that often.Get's at least a ""triple fine"" from me!			"

												I'm on my first playthrough with my first three characters, and all the reviews I've read have been on point: it's a beautiful game and the puzzles are easy enough to keep the pace going (there's nothing like that ""aha!"" moment), but the environments are too big. I didn't think that would be a problem (because I like exploring), but when you need to navigate the same series of sprawling passages over and over again to solve a puzzle -- especially when it's a trial-and-error puzzle that involves a prop you need to re-collect every time you fail -- you start to wonder what the developers were thinking. All the running around gets frustrating, which leads me to the walkthrough page faster than I'd like: if I've got to do so much ditch-digging just to try something that I don't know will work, I'd rather spoil it for myself.But I still recommend the game if you know what you're in for. It's a light puzzler with a dark sense of humour, and the visual design is breathtaking.			"

												Not even on a Steam SaleFirst the good stuff: Art and character designThis game has a whimsical art style and can be a fun cross between puzzles and light platforming, with particularly funny narration and character design.The bad stuff: Poorly executed forcing of replayThe game punishes users for indulging in that whimsy. The game forces painfully slow backtracking as you figure out a puzzle. Funnily enough, what's worse is when you can't backtrack: Because you frequently pass points of no return accidentally and the game autosaves, you can't have fun exploring an area you've completed because you risk losing access to collectibles or missable achievements. If that is a part of gaming you enjoy, it pretty much forces you to play with a guide open to keep you from missing anything, completely devaluing the collectibles and achievements.However the most aggregious, avoidable design sin is tha for each playthrough you select 3 out of 7 characters (I'll say it again: Three) to take through the campaign, which changes three character specific levels to the game. Did you catch that? The selection of three out of seven? If you are going to obligate replays like this, why not have a number of playable characters that is divisible by three!? This is infuriating and since several puzzles in the cave are permenant fixtures, not character specific, this means you have to play through some puzzles 3 times, and other puzzles (for the two characters you'll play twice) 2 times. Getting all achievements demands a total of 5 playthroughs, but by then you'll have lost all interest.There are some great indie-like titles on Steam, I encourage you to find them instead of buying this one, regardless of the price.

												The Cave isn't a hard game to recommend, it has a charming art style, some brilliant voice acting, and a focus on interesting characters that has been somewhat lost in gaming recently. I doubt that you'd be surprised to hear that this game was developed by Double Fine, as the Psychonauts-esque zaniness and humour remains present in this title.The game is not without its peeves though. Take for example the fact that there are 7 characters with unique stories, yet you cannot adventure with more than 3 of them at the same time. This means playing through the game 3 times, once with 2 characters you've already played with, left as irritating third wheels. What's more, each character has a good ending and a bad ending, which means playing through the game more than once with each character anyway in order to obtain all the endings (Which I wouldn't personally recommend doing, seeing as the endings change very little) There are even several default levels in-between the character driven story levels, which you have to play every time, and playing through these levels becomes tedious very quickly, as you are often forced to backtrack in these stages.Despite all this, I'd recommend this title. Maybe not full price, but on sale, it's a no-brainer purchase.			"

												The Cave is a challenging puzzle game where you play between 3 characters to solve each stage. The story and narration is filled with dark humor which lifted my frustrations at times. The puzzles are fairly challenging without a guide, but are quite simple with a few tips and tricks. If you're planning to 100% this game, keep in mind that it requires a minimum of 5 playthroughs (even more, if you miss the missables).

												The Cave is a fun-filled, addicting puzzle game in which you can finish in less than 8 hours, but is also replayable due to the amount of characters there are. Despite the rating seen above, it actually deserves much more because the puzzles are so complex and have their own little story behind each one. The only major downside that I could think of from this game was that there are no tips, help options, or anything of the sort, and if you are stuck, you must use Wiki or any other guide source to help you. The characters themselves are a little twisted, but I do wish there were more puzzles to go through with each character and that the stories were a bit more complex.

												I would recommend buying The Cave for several reasons?1. The story of the game were made by Ron Gilbert, for that reason only you should expect an awesome game and you got that with The Cave.2. The Cave is funny, not only the game but The Cave itself. 3. There are so many good references and jokes. 4. The joystick control works fine, making the game highly enjoyable playing on a TV. 5. Every group of 3 characters you choose (from a pool of 7) has its own story and powers to help you solve the puzzles in the game. That guarantees a good replayability, since you have to beat the game several times to get all the character stories. The only bad thing is that the game is short, but that makes more interesting in trying distinct groups of characters and see its end story.			"

That's my first gripe with The Cave, it essentially makes you play it 3 times if you want to know all the storys. Yes, there's change in each story, but it is not worth playing 3 times. And, if you passed basic math, you'll notice that 7 isn't divisible by 3, so one character you'll have to play again. I think The Cave should of just given you all 7 to play as, and maybe only take 3 into an area. My first, and most likely only, playthrough I took the Twins, the Hilbilly, and the Time Traveler and still thought that I got what I paid for. Story telling is what The Cave excels at, giving you snipits of a characters backstory at a time. It's intresting to see how screwed up everyone is, and makes you want to find out more.Then there's gameplay, and it's a typical puzzle game. Click this, click that, maybe click that. If you're lost, you play the ""Does this go with this, this, or this"" game, seeing as there isnt a hint system. The only thing negative I can say is that jumping is a little wonky. You'll want to jump to a ledge and accidentally fall to your death. Oh, you die from tall falls, so watch out. Overall, The Cave is just...alright. Is it $15 alright? Ehhhh....do your research. Look into gameplay of it, maybe watch a walkthrough of one person's story. Though, if you love puzzle solvers, buy this.			"

Every puzzle in this game makes you that man, and tediously forces you to row, row, row that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boat back and forth and back and forth and BACK AND FORTH until you weep at the knowledge that you pre-ordered this pile of joy-sucking crap.

												Wonderfully quirky game.   I really enjoyed the animation style and the unique story concept.   You will need to play with several combinations of characters to get to play all of the puzzles.     I usually get tired of platform games when the jump combinations get extremely difficult.  This game has none of that.  The platforming elements are easy to accomplish.  The puzzles are the hard(ish)  part.			"

												Ron Gilbert making an adventure, must be good, right? Well it is, and if you played his classic adventures you will recognize his hand in this game. You can't deny it is a typical Ron Gilbert affair. Adventure games have evolved, and there are only a hand full of actions you can do (pick/drop, use & a special action), so in some ways that makes it easier. Indeed, the puzzles are not that hard, except for a few and certainly if you played adventures before you will know quickly what to do. That doesn't take away any of the joy though, get this game and experience Ron Gilberts magic touch once again.			"

												A fantastic game for those like me who are just starting out in gaming.The Cave allows you to play 3 out of 7 characters.  Each character has their own level where you have to solve certain puzzles in order to resolve their story line.  I enjoyed the narrator and the dark nature and wit of the entire game.I didn't find the puzzles as easy as some of the other reviewers but the game was still enjoyable.  It's also great that the game has replay-ability just by choosing different characters.I played single player and my nieces played local co-op.  Local co-op mode kept them from fighting over the controllers.I recommend and can't wait to play the other story lines.			"

												The graphics and sound of the game is in a bit goofy, cartoonish style. But it all comes together really well. I enjoy the idea as well as how they set things up to remind you visually that you're still in that cave even though the setting may change.The gameplay is more tricky than I expected. The hints are subtle and smooth, easy to miss if you're distracted outside of the game and not paying attention. Could be one of the reasons why it become so satisfying. Most things can be solved with some common logic though, the rest may need some goofy logic which makes it pretty amusing.The humor is definitely a big reason to why I enjoyed this game. Always able to smile every now and then at silly or stupid comments makes this game great.The only downside I can see is the constant running distances, both back and forth, which feels like I'm just wasting time. The design of the area makes it enjoyable in a way, but not sure if it's enough for me to make it feel worth it to pass through there several times while just running... not sure if it need to be that spacious.Great game overall though which kinda makes up for it.I definitely recommend it for people that enjoy puzzle games with humor.

												TL:DR A pretty decent puzzle/platforming game from Double Fine. Only major downside is having to complete multiple playthroughs to get all the different characters endings as the game gets a bit repetitive after playing through a couple of times.Probably not worth it at full price but a good buy if its on sale.Full Version:The Cave is a platforming puzzle game that has you controlling 3 different characters, who you pick from a group of 7, that you can switch between and control to complete the various puzzles and sections you encounter. The characters are all different (Monk, Knight, Scientist for example) and each one has a unique ability. They also each have their own backstory which is told via slides you collect as you go through the cave with the resolution(good or bad) being obtained when you complete a playthrough. The Cave itself is the setting (as well as the narrator) with your route through it depending on the 3 characters you pick at the start. There are two types of sections you'll go through. Generic ones which you'll have to go through on each playthrough, and the unique ones with each character having a unique section each and are dependant on which ones you choose. The gameplay itself is pretty simple with most of the puzzles not being too difficult to solve as well as the fact that you cant die because as The Cave puts it ""Nobody dies in The Cave"".Good points:-the dark humour in this game is quite enjoyable and it has its funny moments- the cartoon style of graphics fits the game quite well and the way the level design all ties in togther is quite cleverBad points:-to playthrough with every character will take 3 playthroughs with another 2 if you want the good and bad ending for each character. While this isnt too bad because of the unique sections for each character, the sections that you have to playthrough every time do get boring.			"

												This game is a barbed thorn in my side; confusingly long puzzle sequences, constantly switching between characters is obnoxious, and overall this game is a bit complicated for an unexperienced player of this style. An experienced player might really enjoy this, but I wouldn't reccamend it to someone that is unfamiliar with the tactics required. However the characters are weird but entertaining, the story is slightly engaging, its relatively slow paced, and the graphics are good. In my opinion, don't buy this at full price, it's not worth it. They over hyped this game.			"

												One of the best puzzle-adventure games out there, with a bizarre story, great voiceacting and dark humor., Made by Ron Gilbert (Money Island series) and Tim Schafer, so you know what to expect. Puzzles are not too easy, but also not too hard and mostly logical. Game can be played three times with multiple outcomes and different characters with different abilities. ""The Cave"" is primarily made for controllers but can also be played with keyboard/mouse. I'd recommend a controller although sometimes character movement turns out to be a little imprecise, but not game breaking. Overall great game for adventure/puzzle fans.			"

												I loved this game!With its usual Double Fine Quirks of Beautiful Music, Zany Characters and Backdrops and beautifully crafted game physics and storylines, I believe the replay value on this game is truly high.More so, this NON CO-OP Backtracking Puzzle game, gives you the choice of how your game is going to turn out in a sense depending on what character you choose. One thing that i loved is the fact that you can pick up an item and continue to do actions while the item is still in your hand. Another would be how the achievement system is set up and also how you sort of control the story as well.Sort of reminds me of those books with the alternate endings that i used to read as a kid.My 5 year old loved watching me play the game and even tried his hand at it. He was happier watching. lolThanks Double Fine.Edit during second playthrough:-Backtracking getting annoying but still worth it- Ladder/Rope  schematics are very screwy and rather slow. At first i thought it was my controller. Nope. It takes a while to go up and down them and quite a chore to mount them to begin with.			"

												Players choose three of the seven available characters, each with unique talents. I'm currently playing with a knight who has the power of invincibility; an adventurer who can swing a grappling hook; and twins who have the ability to duplicate themselves. When you access special areas of the cave, you uncover scenes from your characters' pasts. Also, each character has a special quest that occurs in a unique area of the cave. (The knight is tasked by a king to defeat a dragon and retrieve an amulet for his daughter.)You switch control between the three characters as you advance through the cave. Often, teamwork is required as you must position the characters in certain areas or have them perform tasks simultaneously. There are monsters, but there is no combat. Instead, you must figure out how to get past monsters with strategy alone. For one early example, you ""battle"" a dragon with a hot dog and a claw like those found in an arcade game.Controls are simple, consisting of moving side to side, jumping, climbing, and picking up and using various objects. Characters can only hold one object at a time, and certain objects are needed to advance through different areas of the cave. Because it's not always obvious which objects must be used, you will often find yourself doubling back to retrieve dropped objects. This is a new type of game for me, so I've found myself running around aimlessly quite a bit, experimenting with different combinations of characters and objects to try to advance.So far, I've experienced no glitches. What I have experienced are clever puzzles, beautiful visuals, and a game that will lend itself to re-playability as I will want to try out all of the characters.			"

												It is a puzzle solving game that reminds of the old Monkey Island days.The Cave, which is the main character, serves as a guide as you explore its depths. There are 7 different characters to play with, each with his/her own abilities and backgrounds. You must choose 3 of them and enter the cave to discover their true nature, and help them cooperate to survive.The game is handled with a very good, and dark, sense of humor, and alternative paths depend on what characters you pick, adding replayability.The game is very well done, and there are very clever puzzles in it. Well, we should not expect less from Ron Gilbert. The drawings are amazing, and the designers paid great attention to details. The music and sounds are simple but add a lot to the experience, and the voice acting is top notch.I did not give 5 stars because the game itself is very short. Moreover, even when playing with a new set of characters, there are parts of the cave that are repetitive. Maybe if they had done more sections that could be played by all characters and made them appear randomly, it would have added a lot of replay value, and would have made it more fun to try to get everyone through.Target audience: Casual players. It is too easy for hardcore gamers, though it can be enjoyed by anyone.			"

												This was an enjoyable play. Graphics are well done and narrative is humourous & whimsical. Although there are times where dialogue with in-game characters can get annoying when you're running back and forth trying to figure things out. Puzzles were unique and challenging. However, the time travel level, I found, was a little far fetched so it took me a while (and some hints) to get through that one. There were some levels too, that became monotonous & time consuming due to backtracking by having not chosen the appropriate character for a particular task or just simply trying to find clues on what you needed to do. I do like the fact you had to choose the character best suited to solve a particular part of the puzzle and that you can get through the most levels with whichever 3 characters you choose. Some levels aren't available if you don't have the characters to get through them, but you can always go back and replay with new characters - which is nice.  All in all, I would definitely recommend playing. It was fun!			"

Once you're done, turn around and play it again with three different characters to have a totally new experience. Great for kids and adults.			"

												Very fun platformer and with the exception of the dark humor, is a great game for the family.  It has a very good atmosphere and rich graphics.  One minor gripe is that we got stuck on 2 spots because of the very specific button combinations needed even though we were doing the right thing (mine car switch and prehistoric boulder).			"

												This game is simply amazing. I always liked games like this one, reminds a bit of Lost Vikings. I played that game with great pleasure and I'm doing that with The Cave as well.This game had me hooked from the minute I start playing and before I knew I was already a couple hours in. The puzzles of this game are pretty hard and sometimes it took me a while before I could proceed, but it's al worth it.This game is just beautiful and relaxing and I really recommend it.			"

												The entertaining narrator and decent art style are the only two things this game has going for it.Controls were slow to respond or did not respond at all in some cases. Using ladders or ropes is painfully slow even when holding the quick ascend/descend button.There is a lot of backtracking, which is made even more fun by the aforementioned rope/ladder problem.While it is nice that falling was not killing my characters it felt like a pointless waste of time to go through the respawn animation. Forcing a slow walkthrough of areas I have seen several times already is not the way to make a game entertaining.Multiplayer seems extremely poorly done. Players are able to assume control of any character even if another person was already controlling him/her/them. The screen also does not zoom out to follow a player when they go off screen. "

If you like fairly easy puzzles and a great story line, this is definately for you. The puzzles are not too difficult, if you're having a tough time, just click on everything and keep looking around. Sometimes the key is right in front of you. 10 out of 10!			"

												A fantastic game for those like me who are just starting out in gaming.The Cave allows you to play 3 out of 7 characters.  Each character has their own level where you have to solve certain puzzles in order to resolve their story line.  I enjoyed the narrator and the dark nature and wit of the entire game.I didn't find the puzzles as easy as some of the other reviewers but the game was still enjoyable.  It's also great that the game has replay-ability just by choosing different characters.I played single player and my nieces played local co-op.  Local co-op mode kept them from fighting over the controllers.I recommend and can't wait to play the other story lines.			"

A classic  point and click game with a great humorous story, in the same vein as Lucas Arts games like Day of the Tentacle and Maniac Mansion. This game has tons of replay value - I wish they would add new characters and storylines. This game is AMAZING!!! I'd give this one a million thumbs up if I could!!!			"

												TL:DR A pretty decent puzzle/platforming game from Double Fine. Only major downside is having to complete multiple playthroughs to get all the different characters endings as the game gets a bit repetitive after playing through a couple of times.Probably not worth it at full price but a good buy if its on sale.Full Version:The Cave is a platforming puzzle game that has you controlling 3 different characters, who you pick from a group of 7, that you can switch between and control to complete the various puzzles and sections you encounter. The characters are all different (Monk, Knight, Scientist for example) and each one has a unique ability. They also each have their own backstory which is told via slides you collect as you go through the cave with the resolution(good or bad) being obtained when you complete a playthrough. The Cave itself is the setting (as well as the narrator) with your route through it depending on the 3 characters you pick at the start. There are two types of sections you'll go through. Generic ones which you'll have to go through on each playthrough, and the unique ones with each character having a unique section each and are dependant on which ones you choose. The gameplay itself is pretty simple with most of the puzzles not being too difficult to solve as well as the fact that you cant die because as The Cave puts it ""Nobody dies in The Cave"".Good points:-the dark humour in this game is quite enjoyable and it has its funny moments- the cartoon style of graphics fits the game quite well and the way the level design all ties in togther is quite cleverBad points:-to playthrough with every character will take 3 playthroughs with another 2 if you want the good and bad ending for each character. While this isnt too bad because of the unique sections for each character, the sections that you have to playthrough every time do get boring.			"

												I love most of the Double Fine games, but this one missed the mark for me.My main issue is that you will spend 90% of your time just backtracking to pick up a different item.  The game limits any given character to holding only one item at a time.  This often means you might walk all the way from one end of a level to the other, only to realize you need the item you left at the complete opposite end.  Many sections only allow you to control 1 character at a time, so there's no real way around this issue.  Yes, without the 1 item limit the game would take WAY less time, but it would also be WAY more enjoyable.  I'd much rather have breezed through the ""possible"" 3+ playthroughs for each character than be annoyed to the point I didn't even want to finish the first one.If that doesn't sound like something that would bother you, there's a lot to enjoy here.  Classic Double Fine writing, interesting enough characters, and a few clever puzzles that spark that classic adventure feel.			"

												This game is a barbed thorn in my side; confusingly long puzzle sequences, constantly switching between characters is obnoxious, and overall this game is a bit complicated for an unexperienced player of this style. An experienced player might really enjoy this, but I wouldn't reccamend it to someone that is unfamiliar with the tactics required. However the characters are weird but entertaining, the story is slightly engaging, its relatively slow paced, and the graphics are good. In my opinion, don't buy this at full price, it's not worth it. They over hyped this game.			"

												Despite the ominous overtones of the introduction, The Cave is a playful adventure in guided puzzle platformer game. The puzzles are not very difficult (although an occasional one can be a bit abstuse if yopu miss noticing something).  I played it through and then my son; we both enjoyed it, but it is a bit short. You may be able complete a run through in an afternoon.  The content is somewhat light; it's not a top tier game, but it's price should reflect that.There are several different characters each with a slightly different play style.  So you'll want to go back and replay the game to see their story lines as well.A light snack of a game to be enjoyed a for a few evenings. "

												Do you want to play casually? Great, step right up and play a silly adventure puzzle platformer that will probably make you question whether or not you're playing the good guys the entire time.However, if you want to 100% the game, you're kinda screwed. Every time you play it you get to choose three characters to come with you. These choices change what three stages you have to make it through to get to the end. The first time you run through each character's stage it's a fun puzzle to figure out and escape. The second time you are mostly just annoyed that you have to go through the steps again. The third time you hate every second of it. To get every achievement you have to run through twice with every character and a minimum of three times with the hillbilly. This quickly becomes even more torturous when you then have to make it through the entire game without dying once with any of your characters. This is nearly impossible, and usually ends in you making it all the way to the end of the game and accientally falling off something and having to start over after three hours of grueling gameplay came up for naught. I have played every character at least seven times, trying desperately to make it through without a death. I gave up after a particularly annoying death in which I was at the actual end of the game, after each of the stages, and I managed to fall off the ladder and die. Uninstalled, never looked back.

I would of rather it just be linear so I didn't have to play the same levels twice to get the other character levels.  Narating voice is really good, and all the characters have charm to them.  Puzzles were easy with the exeption of getting stuck maybe 3 times.  Little short if you play it once through.			"

												It's been a couple of years since I played this game, but I still wanted to write a review for it because I thought it was great and still have strong memories of playing it. The Cave is a puzzle scroller underscored by a dark playful humor as it uses the common environment of 'the Cave' to tell the individual stories of the sins and tragedies of seven mysterious figures. Each character has a special ability and many sections of the map can only be accesed with these special abilities. The means that despite being all contained on one map, the route you take through the map is determined by the characters you play. This creates great replayability as you revisit areas with different skills and discover entirely new areas. On top of that, the routes themselves are themed around the character stories thus giving the playthrough a linear storybook quality that unfolds as you complete puzzles. In fact the puzzles you complete tend to echo the character background stories. Each play through is about 2.5 hours but expect to play the game at least 3 times. The concept and execution are well married making this a fantastic game.			"

												Do you want to play casually? Great, step right up and play a silly adventure puzzle platformer that will probably make you question whether or not you're playing the good guys the entire time.However, if you want to 100% the game, you're kinda screwed. Every time you play it you get to choose three characters to come with you. These choices change what three stages you have to make it through to get to the end. The first time you run through each character's stage it's a fun puzzle to figure out and escape. The second time you are mostly just annoyed that you have to go through the steps again. The third time you hate every second of it. To get every achievement you have to run through twice with every character and a minimum of three times with the hillbilly. This quickly becomes even more torturous when you then have to make it through the entire game without dying once with any of your characters. This is nearly impossible, and usually ends in you making it all the way to the end of the game and accientally falling off something and having to start over after three hours of grueling gameplay came up for naught. I have played every character at least seven times, trying desperately to make it through without a death. I gave up after a particularly annoying death in which I was at the actual end of the game, after each of the stages, and I managed to fall off the ladder and die. Uninstalled, never looked back.

												interesting storys and the puzzle hardness was also good the announcer was also really goodI didnt actually know you could get a good ending for the charactors until after I had beaten all the storys and looked something up on youtubea con that I found is that doing another playthough with other charactors was annoying not having an option able to skip the 3 neutral areas and having to go though them each time (they are pretty tedius)			"

												The Cave is a solid platforming game with some interesting stories to tell. However, the puzzles are easy enough that replaying to see all the content gets tedious quickly.			"

												Really good puzzle. And great dark humor. Love it.The only bad thing is that you would need to do the some levels at least 3 times if you wan't to see all characters in action.It would be nice to be able to skip them after first run.			"
