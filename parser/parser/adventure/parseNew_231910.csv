												Leisure Suit Larry is a point and click adventure game which was initially released in 1987. It was originally written for DOS and Apple, before being ported to the likes of Amiga and Atari.  In mid 2013, Leisure Suit Larry would get a remastered released which was funded by KickStarter.I had never played the original, so was going into this game with no knowledge as to what I was getting into. As with all point and click adventure games, we have a series of puzzles, some of which make no sense what so ever, whilst others are pretty straight forward. The ""world"" in which you play has a number of different locations to explore, such as a bar, casino, a love chapel and discos.  You are able to travel between all of the locations using a taxi service which costs money.A lot of progression in this game is based off how much money you have, and whether you are able to get past ""pay walls"" such as buying gifts for your lady friends. You are able to generate more funds by playing Blackjack in the casino. If you by any chance run completely out of money, like I did one on occasion, you may well find your self stumped with what to do, but if you find the local bum, they will spare you a bit of loose change ironically. Leisure Suit Larry is a very nice looking game. All of the scenes are well illustrated, and the cartoon style is one of my favorites to look at. There isn't really anything special to say about the graphics, given that it is all 2D though. Without wanting to spoil too much of the plot, and for those who haven't played the original, Leisure Suit Larry is based around a 40 year old virgin who sells software for a living. He goes on vacation to Lost Wages, which is a paraody of Las Vegas, to try and find the lose of his life - obviously he hits a few bumps in the road along the way, but the story ends sufficiently well, and does a good job of tying up loose ends. Leisure Suit Larry is fully voice acted; I absolutely think voice acting is a must in any point and click adventure game now. I probably wouldn't of enjoyed the plot as much as I did if I had to read the text myself. The comical voices and accents here really make it so much better. There are also plenty of comical sound effects too; this game is a walking innuendo joke, be warned. Like I said above, Leisure Suit Larry offers a handful of puzzles that can be worked out quite easily, whilst others forced me to look up online what to do to progress. That is probably down to my ineptness with point and click games though - The puzzles range from creating a new perfume for a potential lover, right the way to finding a way to marry someone after one hour after meeting them...some really whacky ideas. The game world is very well designed. If there is something that looks interesting, you can probably click on it and get some form of interaction out of either Larry or the narrator. This gives plenty of opportunity to let you explore each scene to your hearts content. All of the other characters in the game also offer some sort of interaction, whether it be a simple conversation or something else. A playthrough from beginning to end took me just over two hours to complete, this was with the aid of a guide so bear that in mind - I also don't really see there being any need to replay the game once you have finished it, as there is very little replay-ability or different ways to complete the game. The game does offer a large amount of achievements, of which I only managed to get 19 out of 40 from a full story run, and I didn't go looking for them either. Leisure Suit Larry runs extremely well on my rig, it allows you to play in resolutions up to 4k and runs at a sky high frame rate all the time - I doubt any modern day PC would struggle to run this game. To conclude, Leisure Suit Larry is a well put together experience, with a lot of comical value, however the price of £14,99 is a lot considering the game is not even 3 hours long. I would only recommend people pick up Leisure Suit Larry when its on sale for more than 50% off so you get your moneys worth. Players of the original may want to skip it too, since it also offers no new story elements, it just improves the technical side of things in every degree.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play

												First thing to appreciate with Leisure Suit Larry (LSL) is that it is a game that originally was created in 1987! The gameplay in this 'Reloaded' version is essentially the same, with updated graphics, interface & full voice/audio support.Being from an earlier generation, the gameplay can feel basic by modern standards and there is no real direction from a story perspective to guide you either. You only know that you need to guide Larry (the 40yr old virgin) to find love. With limited guidance, the ability to visit any of the locations in any order & a lot of abstract puzzles to solve LSL can leave you scratching your head for long periods. Simplicity aside, LSL is full of personality. It's a small point-n-click adventure, but each of the 5 main locations is filled with things to distract & amuse you. This is where the real charm of LSL comes through; if you rush through the plot you miss much of what the game has to offer. Achievements have been well utilised too to encourage exploration of 'Lost Wages' . Many are only obtainable by exploring the many these hidden 'side quest' dialog click-points or finding the Easter Eggs around the game world. Some will even need a second play-through. One of the most enjoyable elements of LSL is the amazing voice acting! The highlight undoubtably being the narrator. Besides having an awesome voice & a good dose of sarcasm, he is ongoingly degrading to Larry with some genuinely funny dialog. I just wanted to click everything just to hear whatever perverted thing the narrator or Larry might say next! The dialog & the entire game on the whole is full of sleezy sexual innuendo, political incorrectness, stereotypical 'one-dimensional' characters & toilet humor. If you don't find these sort of things funny then you probably wont like LSL.Graphics look good, but the animations are a bit average. Perhaps they are meant to be a bit retro in design (keeping to the original on purpose), but I would have liked to see them more detailed. Also there are a number of audio sections mentioning an 'action' you do that has no animation at all. Would have loved to see (not just hear) these in the Reloaded version. UI is good enough, but take the tutorial! Also, I would have liked to see controllers supported for big screen play in the lounge room & an auto-save function.As a kid playing LSL back in the day, it aways used to remind me of a naughty, very risqué game I needed to hide from my parents. Now it seems tame, more an ongoing tease filled with a lot of cheap, tasteless one-liners & gags. Despite my change in perspectives, the core essence of the game remains fun & true to the original cult classic.I find my fond memories renewed on playing through the Reloaded version, all these years on! Leisure Suit Larry remains a true gem of an adventure game!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												I bought this originally because I watched Danny Sexbang, and Ross play this during their PC focused version of Game Grumps, Steam Train. It was the early 90's remake, but obviously this isn't that version (which you can pick up on GOG by the by if you're interested).It's a short but enjoyable game. There are no dead ends in this game, but you can die, although it's relativly cheap, but funny.The funniest moments in this game are when you just use certain things on other things. For example, use the zipper icon on ANYTHING you can find. It will draw hilarious lines from the also very funny Narrator. However there is some negative here and there. For starters, this game loves to let you know that it got Kickstarted, Alot.Also the humor can be hollow at some points (I'm looking at you Comedian at the Casino, you're not funny.) The game also adds some things that feel kinda unnecesary and pads it out.Reguardless, if you want a funny remake that knows the best kind of humor is juvenile, then I'd grab it.Otherwise I would just go play the original, or something else.

												Big LSL fan here and Kickstarted the game as well. The Good - Great soundtrack, some nice background art and the original LSL voice actorThe Bad - Inconsistent animation and production quality, stiff enviornment (first thing you notice is that the Taxi's wheels don't turn) and the fact that they remade this game for the second time, was that neccesary? The game is littered with badly drawn kickstarter supporters and even the Al Lowe cameo in the end is all about the kickstarter campagin, which completely stains the experience.The puzzles are ok, nothing really clever and i found that i had to skip a lot of the dialouge as it was not that interesting.That being said Larry 6 and Larry 7 are great games still (much better than this) so you can go ahead and play those if you haven't alreadyRecommended purchase price (if you still want to get it) 3-5 $Follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/West7 for more game reviews			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded Original Release: 2013 (1987) Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Mature; Nudity; Funny My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 1-8 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Casual gamers REVIEWLeisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded is hilariously low brow and jam-packed with childish-yet-adult humor.  It's perverted to the point of stupidity, and that is what makes it so glorious.  It is a point-and-click adventure with only the basic aspects you would expect to find from such a game, and not much more. But the simplicity is fitting as the game's defining feature isn't the gameplay but rather the ridiculousness of the narrative.You can speedrun what you need to do to beat the game in about 20 minutes, but that’s not how you are meant to enjoy it.  There are little quips and perverted asides hidden within the hundreds of hotspots scattered throughout the game, each of which having about a dozen ways to interact with them and each combination of interaction producing different dialogue.  As I alluded to, the actual gameplay is quite minimal. The “puzzles” are pretty simple and nothing requires any extremely nonsensical actions that one would never think of without a walkthrough… mostly. And what you actually need to do to beat the game isn’t much, but there is a decent sized world to explore for auxiliary fun or achievements.If you are easily offended then this game is probably not suited for you.  Almost all the humor is sexual, perverse, and low brow in tone. If that kind of thing would bother you, you should turn back now.But, if you like point-and-click adventure games, and can get in the mood for a childishly low brow, purposefully offensive, and pretty humorous experience: then I highly recommend you check this game out.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												This is going to feel like an editorial from a morally narrow, somewhat straightlaced lady, not a review....Consider yourself warned.I never thought I would own this game. Never, ever, ever. Then it was suprise gifted to me by a sweet friend and it was in my library. It sat there. For all my concerns about this game actually dirtying my library, the thought to delete it or hide it never occurred to me. Then I decided. I am the Pointnclickster. I have to play this. Like it or not, this is a big part of gaming history. So one night-one late late late night- I got loaded on caffeine and chocolate and decided to try it out. The results, for me, were very suprising.(Bless you if you are still reading) It was fun. It was actually very fun, and extremely funny. I really tried to take the high road in this game, but it really doesn't exist. I'm getting ahead of myself. First of all, I love the look of this game. The bright colors and the cartoony world really spoke to me in a way that said that for all of its low humor, it was just a fun game for adults. Yeah, men probably get a lot more out of it, but I had a lot of fun too. The narrarator is just hilarious. His incites about the world that Larry has been dropped into and Larry himself are hilarious. Seriously, I loved the dialogue in this game. It may be low brow but it fits.Do I even have to go into what this game is about? Well, apparently getting laid in a parody of Las Vegas isn't always that easy. Watching Larry try and find love (thats what I am choosing to call it) is hilarious. He tries so hard, and it usually ends so badly. Now the puzzles can be a bit of a pain. This game calls for exploration and really immersing yourself in this world. Sometimes I was just at a loss at how to advance, and it made the game feel tedious. I hated the fact that you constanly have to watch your wallet and take time to gamble in order to continue in the game. I love minigames but the need to constanly play black jack felt like filler. Apart from the snarky dialogue, the other things I really loved were all the different achievements that you can get. You can do a lot in this game, and while it is possible to do it all in one sitting, one would probably have to play it more than once or load a save file. I also liked the fact that even though Larry can die in multiple ways, they are really funny, and it doesn't set you back. For all of its low brow humor and sexual innuendo, it is very quick to remind the player that it is just a game. As morally narrow as I am, I really enjoyed this game. To say the least, it broadened my horizons. This is a fun game for adults to enjoy after midnight. "

AUDIOFantasticVISUALBlandDIFFICULTYUnfair, ToughVIBENostalgicCRAVINGSierraON SALERarelyPROS: The soundtrack is awesome. (Tiers of Joy was really good!) Not much has been changed that wasn't necessary. The game controls solidly and the voice-acting is excellent. Timer has been removed, meaning you can play at a fair pace without the rush. CONS: The graphics are a bit weak. Animation is not very high quality. Some people had problems with the dated/US-based questions at the beginning. Some jokes don't land, though the cheese factor is sometimes intentional.WORTH: I find this remake to be worth full price due to nostalgia, though others may not agree due to the widespread availability of these games. If this is not your first round with Larry, you may want to consider getting it on sale, as a fair amount of the charm of it returning will be lost on you.OVERALL:  A great remaster of a classic  Point and click adventure game. Hopefully we will get to see remastered versions of all of Larry's shenanigans!SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												It's like a college sex comedy aimed at 40 year olds (don't worry you youngsters can also enjoy it)Leisure Suit Larry is an excellent point-and-click adventure game from one of the original veterans who started the whole craze to begin with (Al Lowe).STORY:The game focuses on Larry Laffer, in his eponymous leisure suit, a 40 something year old virgin who is visitng the city of Lost Wages to find ""true love"" (or at least a one night stand). This is your goal, and it remains constant throughout the game. The world and story are ripe with colorful commentary, self deprecating humor, and loads of adult humor that bears an air of sophistication slightly above your run of the mill flatulent anecdote. While you control Larry through the adventure, he is actually only half of the ever present characters, the other being the deliciously sardonic and condescending narrator who finds no shortage of ways to put you down, even when you are doing well.GRAPHICS:A far cry from the original EGA graphics of it's originator, the graphics manage to successfully capture the cartoonish nature of the world in which Larry inhabits. While nothing is groundbreaking, and the animation loops are very noticeable, you'll never be left wondering what it is you are looking at or feel the need to desperately click on every tiny pixel hoping it's something you missed.SOUND:While there's no music to speak of beyond a title screen, the ambience of the environments is rather basic and simple enough to convey the intended atmosphere. The voice acting ranges from excellent to subpar, the voices of Larry and the Narrator are done very well and you will rarely tire of hearing them (which is a good thing, they compromise 90% of the game's dialogue), the other characters however bring no real presence to their voices and feels like the casting call stayed within the offices if you catch my meaning.GAMEPLAY:True blue classic point and click magic! You are presented with a variety of interactions you can perform including looking, touching, sniffing/licking, exposing (unzipping your trousers), talking, walking, and using whatever object from your inventory you had selected. The game is ripe with entertaining and colorful commentary which often makes the quickest path not always the preferable one as hearing the narration on the variety of actions you can perfom is half the fun.In addition to standard point-and-click fare, the game uses money as a commodity, and you will need quite a bit to solve certain puzzles, buy certain items, and to transition between areas as each requires a cab ride. You can pad your income by playing slot machines or blackjack machines, or if you completely run out of money a friendly bum spots you a $10. These games are entirely luck driven but nothing discourages you from save scumming your way through it and simply reloading until you win enough to not have to worry about it anymore.One blessing is that unlike some point and click games of yesteryear, this game is devoid of any dead ends or no win scenarios, you may get stuck for awhile, but no puzzle will ever force you to have to start over.CHALLENGE/LENGTH:For anyone who has played a point and click adventure game before, they will feel right at home, even without the short tutorial gives you all you need to know about how to play the game. For beginners to the genre the game could prove to be a bit more challenging and lengthy but for veterans you can expect to breeze through. The game isn't very long, and the puzzles tend to be on the easy side once you have the proper equipment at least. On average the game should last you about 5 - 10 hours depending on how stumped certain puzzles make you. VERDICT:If you enjoy adult risque humor that possesses a bit of wit and point and click adventure games I can see no reason not to play this game. It is short but is packed with entertainment and humor. If nothing else at least pick it up on sale!			"

												I played this mainly for nostalgia purposes, if you didn't play Leisure Suit Larry  in the 90's you may find it to be a little dated. I'm not too keen on the Reloaded experience, it seemed to have been a better game when I was a kid, when this was more exclusive, before free internet porn was readily available, this was much more exciting back then. It's a legendary game in that respect, and somewhat of a classic worth experiencing, when put in context of its generation of games, its not a bad point & click game either, 6/10.			"

												I recommend this only to people who played the original game or at least another Larry back in the days. It's more of a nostalgia kind of experience and i don't think everyone will appreciate it. It has a ""Hey remember me?"" message all along the way and that's the main reason why it will fail entertain some people i think. I don't remember the original game to be that short or is my memory playing tricks on me? But if you're the kind of guy who think the price tag should reflect the time you will spend playing then this game will feel like a rip-off. It's short, it's really really short. I really dislike how Al Lowe is playing ""God"" in this game. He really thinks that he's a big deal or something. No you're not famous and no you're not hilarious. This game is called Larry not Al so no one cares about your likes and dislikes. It may sound like a negative review but in overall it's a good game. It's just not made for everyone. I hope they will remake them all but in a more professional way this time.			"

												A cool and impressive remake to the classic point-and-click adventure game, Leisure Suit Larry. This game is a lot of fun, especially thanks to the great work done and time spent on this quality remake.The only drawback, in my opinion, is the exagerated use of the narrator in the game. Wherever you go, whatever you do, everytime you click the left button of the mouse, you get a long and well-acted presentation from the narrator. Why is this bad, you ask? Because the long speeches get boring and tedious and kind of hurt the gameplay. At a certain point I started cutting the narrator mid-sentence, since I wanted to move on, thus missing some important information. All in all, despite the tedious narrator, I had fun. Definitely worth buying if you like point-and-click adventures, and especially if you've played one of the previous versions (the original from the late 80s, I think, and the point-and-click remake from the early 90s).

												Another game of my youth (on a Commodore 64), I got this just for the memories.  It's funny, the wit is dry and it's cornball, but thats the point.  If you want simple puzzles and a casual game with some pervy humor, try it out.  The higher numbered Larry games (especiall y #7) are pretty fun too.			"

												As a supporter of the Kickstarter, my dad was actually the one that introduced me to the LSL series. We have every game i think so far, and this Reloaded/Reboot version is a good return for Leisure Suit Larry. Some may not understand the humor or game, but i enjoyed my playthrough. i also enjoyed the return  of the old age verification - clever copy protection in it's past life, and i am glad it was updated with new and fun questions.

												After playing this game I realized how much I missed old school point&click adventure games. Also I missed Larry Laffer. Yes we grow up, it doesn't sound as dirty as it used to be, but it is still same Larry. I recommend this game for only old school gamers. I have some complaints, but at the end of the game, I had a stupid smile in my face because of all the good memories that I made while playing this game for the first time. What is good about this game you say? First is graphics. They are really smooth and really funny to set the mood of the game. It is a good feeling to see the old characters in this newly designed looks. It is a really colorful and perverted city. Second is the humor of course. Because it is Larry there are lots of +18 jokes and references but I didn't find them too dirty. They are fun. The sound is also great. Larry has the same voice as Larry 7 and most of the cast fit perfectly (I should say I am a little dissappointed for the change of old narrator, but his one is not bad). Music is classical Jazz and suit the tone. Gameplay is old school, if you are familiar with the old Sierra games, it won't take too much time to get used to it. Other then that it is almost same game. And adding the achievements is a good call I think.So what do I don't like about it you say? Game is short. I know it is the same game, but I expected a little more. I know it is too much to ask but may be making it more than just the first game could be a better. There are small bugs that bugs you sometimes (like a graphic glitch or froze) but it is extremely rare. Money thing is an issue of course, you have to gamble to pay for taxi and stuff, it is unnecassary and dumb I think. It would be great if they add a cheat or something to make it easier and then joke about it may be? And for new gamers, some of jokes are old. Questionnaire in the begining is totally unnecassary. There are some fun in there but making it a requirement is bad. And I think it is a little expensive for the experience it offers.In the end it is an old game with a plastic surgery. If you know who Larry is and why he is funny. This is a game for you. If you are not that old, you can try it, but don't take it so serious. And for the developers, please make other games reloaded too..			"

												Before I played this I was just you're typical virgin who was a chump with the ladies, I lived my life knowing that I was going to die alone, cold and never to feel the tender embrace of a women. I was willing to end it all there but then one night, while I was sleeping, Larry Laffer came to me in a dream and he told me ""It is okay my child, I can show you the way""And then, at that very moment, my PC roared to life and then on my monitor was none other than Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards! ""This is what Larry was telling me about!"" I told myself and then, at that point, I was never the same. The true me awoke. For days I trained, learning the moves, the pick up lines, the style. I had to give up my personal routine in order to learn the secrets of the Louge Lizard. On the last day of training, Larry put his hand on my shoulder and said ""You're ready to fufill your destiny"" The next day I went into college in my very leisure suit, armed with the knowledge that Larry taught me. And there, at the door was the girl who I was dreaming about for months. With my swagger I slided up to her, moving and grooving and she looked at me with an intrigued look in her eyes. I moved my glasses down my nose, looked her straight in the eyes and said these words:""Hey baby, you must be tired, running around in my mind all day""I finished with a wink and a smile and without warning the entire campus was flooded with female pleasure juice. Neckbeards, weebs and bronies were trying to find safe haven in this river of sexual erruption. And amongst it all was me, drowning in so much ♥♥♥♥♥ you needed to call the lifeguard.Thank you Larry. Thank you for giving me purpose again. "

												I didn't know about Leisure Suit Larry when it first came out.So when I go to a friend's place to play some saturday night Magic the Garthing. We walked in on a friend that's playing a sperm swimming mini game which the title Leisure Suit Larry.That burns a clear and unforgetable image of what this game serie is like at the back of my mind. So when I found out about steam is getting this one I jumped on the chance of getting this game. To tell the truth is much less perverted then i expected. There are a few sex scene but they are all censored. And being the first of the serie. It doesn't have any minigame except slot machine and black jack. Which leave it a basic find item and solve situation kind of game. You can walk, unzip, use, smell/taste, talk and use item on lots of back ground objects in the game. And reacting you do is fully voiced with really funny remarks. The jokes alone is worth it for this game.The puzzle and event you have to do to proceed the story is quite hard to find and some of the must needed information/event are very hard to find and they will come to you very randomly and without hint. (who the hell would be crazy enough to think about using hot sauce on the whale's blow hole to get an nessary item??)The graphics and music are wonderful. The scripting of all the diagloge is masterfully done and will make you laugh all the time. The game play removes some fun because of the pure randomness of actions required but overall it's still a very interesting and unique game to play... Achievement of this game can be gotten offline but they will pop at same time when it's auto synced.So if u looking for perverted game.. you will like this on the dialogue but disappointed by the actual event.8.5/10 would be my final rating.. give this one a try when you are bored. But if you stuck.. make sure you have a basic guide ready.			"

												This is the most perverted game I have ever played and it speaks my mind.From beginning to end I have enjoyed ♥♥♥♥ing hookers, Dancing with Fawn & then getting cheated out of $200, talking to the girl who is obsessed with perfume (I had to abuse a whale in the process), talking to a sexy female security guard who later rejects me because she has a boyfriend & finally Eve is the cherry on top which Larry wins his true love I think (Sorry for the spoilers but I want to be very accurate since I enjoyed this remake a lot, I never played the original 80s version of this game but I already had a blast from this remake).Pros:1. Perverted Humor (The comedian from the Hotel's Cabaret doesn't count)2. Sexy girls well except for the hooker3. Hilarious Narrator (I heard that the original narrator from the 80s version of the 1st Larry game is better but I still liked the narrator from the Reloaded version)4. Good puzzle solving5. Hilarious Deaths6. Good Art7. A few references like for example an arcade machine called Angry Broads (Doesn't that remind you of a popular bunch of birds?)8. Good Music9. Good Voice Acting10. Great Tutorial (Al Lowe Made Himself A Cameo In this Game)11. This Short Game Has A Lot Of Replayability If You Want To Gain Some AchievementsCons:1. The game likes to talk about Kickstarter a lot (I understand it got a lot of support but don't remind me all the time I get it)2. The gambling in this game kinda annoys me since the slot machines are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Black Jack is a cold ♥♥♥♥♥ too)Overall If you want some dirty humor in your games then let Larry Laffer teach you how to score girls (I'm kidding don't take his advice).

												As a remake this works in the ways it should.  Graphically it's charming for the most part, despite a conflict of styles when talking to people close-up, and the soundtrack - bloodless lounge jazz though it may be - is the highlight.  It fails in a couple of major ways, though.Sierra games from the era of the original were in a bit of a transitional stage from text adventures to what we'd think of as a point-and-click nowadays.  The remake replicates the awkwardness of this, but goes a stage further by adding to it: you now have three ways to access your various options, be it walking or picking things up.  Yes, you actually have to cycle to walking as an action, like the 'good' old days.  The purpose of a remake is surely to streamline and remove the clunkiness of this kind of thing, but this seems to be more about recreation rather than improvement.Another thing adventure games of this era were known for was insta-death on making a mistake.  This is gone, you'll always be resurrected at the time before you made a particular mistake, but in its place is a weird reliance on money and gambling.  You can literally - and I'm using literally in the correct sense here - get completely stuck and not be able to finish this game without doing a dance of saving and reloading as you play slot machines, as there is no way to move around the map without paying to do so.  If you go broke you will tediously have to build your way back up from $10, but nobody does that as they reload when they lose.  Broken game mechanics right there.On top of this...  well, it's Leisure Suit Larry.  Never as funny or as naughty as it thought it was, just that pub bore who has one joke and a mean streak that becomes more apparent the more you talk to him.  Play it for the nostalgia maybe, but then move on.			"

												LSL LotLL:R (What an abbreviation!) is a remake of the classic adventure game by the same name. The graphics, the voices (Which the original had none), the music and pretty much everything else has been upgraded. Every clickable point has full narration. The game is fun and humorous. I recommend you buy this game if you've played the original. Even if you never played LSL at all I still recommend this game as it's the first in the series so you don't need to be caught up to understand the story. I really can't say enough nice things about this game. The only minor complaint is that I did experience a few crashes, but then again it might just be windows 10 so whatever. 10/10 Would play again.			"

												A really nice remake of Leisure Suit Larry 1, you will have fun playing it, especially if you already know the original. Note that this game is not worth 20 bucks, get it if it is on sale or in a bundle.If you expect to see some sex in the game ... you will be disappointed, but the humour is definitely adult. You will miss many things if you just zip through the game, don't forget to sniff and lick everything. Death is present in the game, but never final (there is even an achievement to do all deaths!). The German translation takes many liberties and (the text) is censored in some areas (comedian), so it is way better to enable English text and audio.			"

												Let me start this review out by saying I absolutely LOVE this game. If you have a dirty sense of humor, you'll love it too. It's a point and click, with a few women you can interact with, but there is nothing like a nudity sex scene or anything crazy. It's humorous, punny, and dirty. The narrator is fantastic, and reminds me of the wit from the stanley parable. I have not played the original, but I love this game. There are a few moments where you might get stuck, I did and used a walkthrough, but it wasn't too hard. ALSO, if you don't usually have patience in games, I wouldn't get this. To really immerse yourself in the story and the humor, you have to click on A LOT of stuff. I have never played a point and click with this much dialogue on random items and scenery. I liked it, but if you are bothered by that sort of thing it might ruin it for you. Overall I thought this was a fantastic game. I would get it, definately.			"

												Rating 7/10What is it?Remastered point and click Adventure gameThe Good:The remastered edition does an excellent job of staying somewhat faithful to the original game. A few things have been changed and they added a whole new girl to go after extending the game length. The graphics fit the game perfectly and the voice acting and narration is great. If you ever played the original and enjoyed it, you should at least check this game out for the nostalgia factor alone. Never did I think I would be playing a lesiure suit larry game on steam. The humor is hit or miss, however you play the game to see what crazy antics the larry gets himself in. The achievements are pretty creative for an adventure game and I found it enjoyable trying to get all of them. Their is one that is a huge pain though. The Bad:It stays faithful to the original which means all the bad points come with it. Puzzles don't make a whole lot of sense and may require a walkthrough to help you. The biggest flaw is that you have to gamble in order to get money so you can travel and complete the game. This causes you to save/load while gambling over and over again until you have enough funds. Not fun at all.  The one achievement that is a pain requires you to hit a jackpot in the slots. ConclusionI bought it just for the nostalgia factor alone and I am not disappointed at all. I wouldn't pay full price though. If you never played a Leisure Suit Larry game, maybe now is a good time to do so so you can see what games were like back then (ignoring the graphical updates of course).			"

												Remake of the first title of a very perverted series, did the job that no others ""recents"" games did (the somewhat decent but too dirty Magna♥♥♥♥♥Laude and the horrible Hot Box Office): Show the true fun of Larry, with fun puzzle, a wonderful graphics (but with a lot of bad/rough animation, like the whell of the taxi not moving)and, finally, without the premature ending of the game (go to a bad street or after 6 hours).New girl added to the roster, new and redid old puzzles, voice actors and a lot of easter eggs and hidden things to find.Recommended to people who want to try the ""Larry's feeling"" and for others that were terrifed by Hot Box Office.Like i said before, the very downside of this game is the somewhat hard thing moving trought the menu/inventory (still easier then the old one), very bad / not well polished animations (i didin't liked the beat animation and the taxi's movement for an example) and some little bug with no-english translations.No vote because i'm lazy			"

												Do you remember that 11-year old boy in your class who still doesn't like girls but finds a student dictionary and draws male organs onto every picture of a guy he sees? That's who this game would appeal to. Close to 90% of the ""jokes"" if you can call them that can be explained by saying ""Get it? he's a loser!"" or ""get it? it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". In fact, there are an endless menagerie of male organ jokes and I found TWO referring to female genitals. The original Leisure Suit Larry had some charm, but time has not been kind to it. Making a fart sound in the bathroom when you go? Gone *until patched*. Middle Eastern clerk who doesn't understand English but knows somehow what a ""lubber"" is? Gone. He now speaks almost perfect English. Think about it -- the old one leaves you wondering how he found out, but the new one just makes the clerk sound like a creeper who was kicked out of India for doing things to little girls. Bet zero and get a funny message? Gone. Subtle joke about a left-handed hammer? Gone, it's now just a hammer. Chance to see a new game made? Gone. Paul Trowe got in some trouble  with the law and now all the people want nothing to do with him. The one improvement was the Eve scene if you turn the valve enough times. I kickstarted this game because I wanted to see the game done right, plus the prospect of an Asian girl was tempting to me. What I got was a game that was a lot like the original, and that wasn't a good thing because the jokes and humor haven't aged well. When you're young and can't find porn everywhere, a risque game sounds kinda fun, but now in the post-internet age, it's just flat. Sometimes you can't go back again.			"

												(8 out of 10)The good:+ From ground up completely updated remake of the 25 year old Larry game, where only the core stays the same.+ Lovely detailed comic graphics+ Impressive amount of (often funny) reactions from the Narrator no matter what you try or do in-game.+ Great and fitting tunes in Big Band/Jazz style from Austin Wintory (Journey, Flow).+ Otherwise good ambience sounds+ Great voice actorsThe bad:- Relatively short (if you just don't try much and go straight for goal)- Pretty tame for such ""mature"" content.- Unnecessary Taxi sequences and unfunny driving signs.And the ugly:- A few completely unnecessary repetitive tasks- Screen settings won't get saved, but others do for some reason.Conclusion:If you like humours adventure/puzzle solving, give it a try!On a sidenote:Even though Al Lowe is/was always the front man for the Larry games, the fine sarcastic overtones from writer/designer Josh Mandel helped the typical Al Lowe jokes from falling flat.

												Al Lowe did it again! I wouldn't mind playing this version 26 years ago... Unfortunately I don't think it'll be as shocking or funny for younger generations as it was for me - e.g. nobody's ashamed when buying condoms any more. Still, a very good and highly recommended title for older, mainly woman interested, parties.Pros:  beautiful girls (seriously), backgrounds, animations...  full voice over (and a pretty good voice acting)  funny dialogues with plenty of humour  that nostalgic feeling  casualCons:  not all of the humour holds up, some of the jokes are outdated  repetitive music  short, can be finished in about 2 hours and fully enjoyed in 5 "

												Beautiful graphics with FullHD scene resolution! Storyline is completely the same as in original LSL, so people who have completed the old game won't have any problems with completing Reloaded version. There is one additional scene but it's not so difficult to pass. As Russian I found very annoying ""age-check"" questions because I did not know answers to any of them and I had to google. Larry's voice sounds very similar to voice in LSL7. Jokes are in the same old-school style.Also game has several glitches: I scored 63000 of 50000; game is crashing while changing resolution during gameplay. I recommend this game for one walkthrough and to remember classics.			"

												If you cannot find a place in your heart for this game, let me begin by saying I feel terribly sorry for you. Because how anyone can dislike this game, is beyond me. Sure it's quirky in its own slapstick/sexual innuendo laden euphemisms. Yes, you'll hear jokes about Jews, cheating wives, drunks, perverts and the occassional eavesdrop through a hotel room door... YES, there are breasts involved! (HIDE your wife and kids!)But guess what? IT'S LEISURE. SUIT. LARRY.This is the real deal! Put a stamp on it. Certified!Seriously, this is an adventure title worth digging into and words alone cannot explain the kind of jaw dropping, lowbrow humor you're rare to find anywhere else without coming off as tacky, artificial or overdone. Leisure Suit Larry however? CLASSY... in a... 40-year old virgin sorta way.If you've played the legendary classic WAY way back when, then do yourself a favor and jump right back in with this 21st century revamp! And if you're new to the franchise... well... you're definitely in for a treat!			"

												It's not much more interesting than the VGA remake that Sierra did, but it does have a  short new quest chain. The in-game girls seem even more obnoxious and vacuous as ever, rather begging the question of why Larry even bothers, not to mention that they're drawn like they're from low-grade ecchi anime -- which is probably right about where this game should be classified. But it's pretty funny at times, especially thanks to the narrator.  Besides, supporting this game may be the only way to get a new LSL game that has Al Lowe attached to it, and since the later LSLs were varying degrees of fun and/or classic, a new LSL from Al Lowe is something I'd like to see.

												First things first: Neither a positive nor a negative, just a statement of fact - you have to be comfortable with somewhat sleazy, juvenile ""mature"" humor that is best characterized as avuncular. Just a fact of life when dealing with a Larry game, so it won't be your cup of tea otherwise.Positives:It's very densely packed with jokes. Pretty much every time you look, smell, touch, ""zipper"" a random background objects, you get at least even odds of a unique comical reaction. And the jokes... well, they're not terrible, and given the sheer density, you get at least few funny ones in every room.The voice acting is perfectly adequate. Even the narrator emphasizes the jokes rather than distracts from them, so I often let him finish (something I almost never do once I'm done with the subtitles)The translation is... adequate, as far as I can see. Not brilliant, but adequate, with attempts to find a suitable replacement for anything culturally specific. You can probably give this to friends that don't really speak English but are into adventure games. Negatives:The game is hella short. You probably won't be playing for the plot, but even if you exhaust every possible action on every object, you'll still only get a few hours out of the game.The remake is kinda pointless. LSL 2 and 3  were begging for a remake from the ground up (http://www.richardcobbett.com/codex/therichardperspective/leisure-suit-larry-2-preloaded)  but LSL1 was already remade once. The voice acting doesn't contribute that much, and the art style...The art style isn't a huge improvement, nor is the opportunity taken to add a lot of jokes. Larry and the settings don't look that much better than they did in 1991. Larry seems like a character destined for some slapstick hijinks, but (LSL7 aside) the jokes were/are almost in the form of smug replies and innuendo rather than anything that is actually portrayed onscreen.Most of the stupid puzzle solutions remain intact from the 1987 original (!). There aren't even any hints. One inexplicably mind boggling decision - hiding the entrance to a new room that's necessary to your progress ofscreen, with absolutely no hints that such a room exists until you blunder into the entrance / read a faq. For some reason, the one puzzle that was added to the remake involves a LOT of animal cruelty. Baffling to say the least - particularly given that Larry was a fairly decent chap by adventure game protagonist standards, despite his hornball antiques.			"

												This was a fantastic reboot of the original Leisure Suit Larry game.  Great graphics, animation, sound and the classic Sierra type interface.  There is plenty of innuendo and comedy, but you won't find any pornography -- if that's what you're looking for.  They even added an additional woman for Larry to pursue as well changing some of the original puzzles in an effort to keep things fresh.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who was a fan of the Sierra 2-d adventure games.			"

												The original Leisure Suit Larry game came out in 1987, with a VGA remake following in 1991, and it hasn't aged well. The current remake features modern graphics and introduces voiced dialogue, but other than that, the game stays basically the same. This means that there is a lot of unnecessary repetition, some actions required from you are so far from obvious that you may be stuck forever without a walkthrough, and the game is still laughably short. If you are a Larry fan, play it for old times' sake (the jokes are still good!). If you are not, don't waste your time.			"

												It was great to play a game in the point-to-click style of games that I grew up with, such as Space Quest, Kings Quest, and other Sierra games as well as old Lucas Arts games and so on.  Seeing Leisure Suit Larry, growing up, I learned later on in life why I was told no for these games.  It wasn't until I played Magna♥♥♥♥♥Laude a few years ago, that I understood why. This is an adult game. The jokes, the humor, as well as the situations were pretty good. I did things to a cat and a whale that I would have not have imagined doing, well, ever. I must say though, the idea does seem fun though, at least to the whale.  So now, the wait was worth it, since I appreciated it a lot as an adult, rather than what I would have as a kid.  With that all being said, make a strong drink and enjoy this game.			"

												A remake of the first (and now very old) Leisure Suit Larry game, this point-and-click adventure has a lot of the same kinds of (often terrible) jokes and sexual innuendo. With the objectives of the game being to find love and sex, you'll laugh a lot in the process of finding both as you explore the small town of Lost Wages to help our hero on his quest. The bulk of the achievements can be found playin through the game, and there are a few extra ones that will take a while to hunt down if you're curious.Good for fans of point-and-click adventure, adult parody, and/or the original series of games. For those who fall into all three categories, this is a definite win.			"

												It should be good. It looks nice, has the crass humor of the original (heck, it *IS* the original but with updated looks) but the game is just completely lacking in so many areas, I can't recommend it at all.No hotspots to click on (fine, neither did the original) but you just have no idea what is clickable. Try clicking on the bottle on the floor, you get a description of the floor, but the fly on the floor, THAT will get described. You click on items, Larry does not walk across the room, he just scratches himself as the narrator speaks. Even when Larry talks, he just stands around without his mouth moving. There are so many small problems like that, it just spoils the game.You can't help but think that if just a little more time was added tidying up the whole thing, it could have been good.

												Kickstarted into existence once again, Leisure Suit Larry is back. I played the original in the eighties, the remake in the nineties, and now this - The second remake. Was this version entirely necessary? Maybe not, but here's hoping we'll eventually get a brand new Larry adventure in its wake.I mean, Larry 1: Reloaded clings perhaps a little bit too hard to the past. Sure, they took out perma-death, but they left the supremely annoying gambling mechanic virtually untouched. Didn't like it in the original; Hate it with a passion now. Otherwise the game is serviceable, a dose of nostalgia just like the donators ordered. I can't see the game generating many new Larry fans, but I guess that's beside the point.			"

												Summary:I can't recommend it at full price, especially if you have never played the old Larry games before. If you used to be a pc-gamer back in the early '90s you will find some value here but I'd wait for a sale. I had some good moments playing it as it reminded of my early PC gaming days, however, once you get past the nostalgia you will see that adventure games have really evolved much since the '80s and early '90s. The game's flaws stem basically from that early era of adventure games that it is based on. Classic adventure games used to base their long gameplay hours on the fact that players used to stuck on some puzzle for hours and hours, pixel hunting through every available area for an item or interaction. LSL Reloaded fully retains this flaw. Puzzles feel illogical for today's standards and you will almost certaintly require a walkthrough at some point to get through it in a reasonable amount of time. If you don't get stuck much you could finish the game in 4 hours. Simply put, there is very little content and little originality to justify its price. Even if you want to play it purely for nostalgic reasons, or you feel that you definitely need it for your steam collection I suggest that you buy it during a sale.			"

												Great for fans of Sierra of old.For those familiar, this game is a giant overhaul of Leisure Suit Larry, itself a graphical update of the only text only game that Sierra ever released, Softporn (fun fact: the one and only Roberta Williams herself is on the cover of that game, topless in a hot tub). Since Larry 1 also got a revamp, this game actually borrows heavily more from the first Larry 1 remake than the original game. Most noticably, the interior of the casino has the double helix elevator that was in the remake as well as alot of the exterior look to Lefty's was also lifted from it. However, even if you've played all three previous versions of this game, alot of the puzzles are updated or changed so as to keep the game fresh.Voice acting was actually pretty good. Some old Sierra alums came along to voice some of the characters, which is a nice audio easter egg.Overall, very fun for a few hours, and a few more playthroughs to unlock all the achievements.			"

												LSL Love For Sail is my favorite game in the series.  That being said, this game is rather blah to play in comparison.  It looks and sounds fine enough, but the things that cause deaths in the game are really rather pathetic and I found the game play overall to be pretty bland.  It's also pretty unforgiveable to have characters whose mouth animations don't even try to synch up with the dialogue in this day and age.  I also cannot stand the sound of the narrator's voice - he sounds like he's getting over a throat infection, and does not have the charm or humor of the narrator from Love For Sail.  Not fun, and really not that funny.People can say what they want about Magna♥♥♥♥♥Laude, but at least it made me laugh.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter. Played a few minutes on the Linux standalone version last year. Today tried the Steam Linux version.  I only played seven minutes so far. Pros: Game is similar to the original I played in computer class in high school. Game looks great. Same style and humor.Con: Steam Linux version is not granting achievements (as of August 14, 2014) for me. If you liked the original LSL from decades past, this is a good updated trip down memory lane, it is a good game.If you like to get achievements in your games...On Windows: Get it.On Linux: Get the standalone, but that won't help with tracking achievements on Steam, so this is a pass. On Mac: No comment.As I try to play only on Linux, except for a few previously purchased games, I cannot recommend this game to friends until the achievements track. Note seeking help for this issue leads to an old thread with last post early in 2014.			"

												I was happy to see a new Leisure Suit Larry game, I love adventure games and nostalgia made it a no-brainer. I had to play this. That being said. DO NOT BUY.In less than a day I had to restart the entire game 10 times, redoing every single things because of bugs that would not go away by leaving and re-entering the area, save/reloading or even closing the game and starting it again. Permanently bugs that prevent you from progressing are just unacceptable.You shouldn't feel too safe with your save games either, and if you really want to play this make several each time you stop to save because you might just load up your save and find that your character is missing and you cant do anything; with no fix.0/5 - This is not a game that was ready to get put on the market.

Despite the chatty crass cheeky Love It or Hate It narrator (he could grow on you eventually or become the worst part of the game especially if you can't stand endless snark) this is a good and pretty funny adventure game. Fairly balanced difficulty too so it's great for adults that have never played the other games to start here. All in all a great remake.9.5/10			"

												You ever feel like you play something, you finish it, and you think ""That's almost three hours of my life that I could have done something useful with, like learn to lead a kazoo symphony or teach a turtle to tap-dance""? Welcome to what I'm currently experiencing after playing the latest game knocked off my backlog, ""Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded"". You get to play as Larry Laffer, who pulled off the 'forty-year-old-virgin' bit years before Steve Carell ever tried it. He's come to the city of Lost Wages in order to fulfill one of his life's goals- to find true love (even if it's just for a night). The airline lost his luggage, he's got no hotel reservations, and $94 and a squirter of breath spray to his name... and the game drops you off in front of a bar and tells you to ""have at it"". Things kind of go downhill from there.The interface... well, it was all right. I'm not a fan of the whole ""switch icons to do different actions"" bit, but at least it was rather easy to do so- the actions are available from the top of the screen, or you can cycle through them with the right mouse button. Each one makes Larry do something different- move, look, use, use item, taste, even... unzip.Yeah. It does exactly what you think it does.The game just throws you into the deep end- without any inkling of what you have to do, or what you can use, or what you can really interact with. Maybe I'm just spoiled by recent games, but hotspots are actually useful so you don't get frustrated by trying to click on everything or use everything with everything. I lasted for forty-five minutes last night before I just gave up and went searching for a walkthrough because I got so frustrated at not knowing where to go or what to do. Granted, I was running on caffeine fumes and gummy candy at that point, but... at least give the player a general idea of what they have to do next, yeah?The graphics... well, they're nothing really special. They look all right, but you're not going to see anything you shouldn't. Apparently they wanted to keep the spirit of the original alive- but in all honesty, the game could have used a better update. The voice acting isn't really all that much to write home about- they did get some of the original cast to come back and voice characters, but... honestly... I've heard better.I have two pretty major gripes with this game: the first is the grinding. You're going to need a good bit of cash to proceed through the game- and the only way you're going to get that much cash is to play blackjack. Literally a third of my playtime on this game is grinding and save-scumming blackjack to build up enough cash. One of the goals about a third of the way through the game is to break the bank at the casino- by winning more than $10K total and running the blackjack machine out of cash. There are few things less fun than grinding away at a crappy blackjack game because it's the only way to get more cash. (I may be personally biased- I don't exactly care for blackjack. I'm more of a flashy-lights slot machine kind of guy). It can take you forever and ever and ever to get to that point in time.The second thing... is the humor. Good grief. To put it simply, this is the kind of game that aims squarely for the ""teen sex comedy"" bit and faceplants directly into it. It's juvenile, it's rather childish, and to put it honestly, I was more going ""...really?"" than I was going ""LOL!"". There are a lot of tasteless jokes here, and yes, the game will go to the bottom of the barrel over and over again to try to be funny. This is the kind of stuff that might be funny when you're about sixteen or so; when you're in your mid-thirties, jokes like this just make you wonder why in the blazes you're subjecting yourself to things like this. There are people out there who might give it a pass simply because it's from 1987; in my opinion, it ought to have stayed there.The Kickstarter for this game somehow gained over $650K to make this remake of a remake; to be honest, now that Al Lowe has left Replay Games (on apparently less-than-wonderful terms, according to the wiki page), hopefully Replay can focus on something else.Steam wants twenty Gabucks for this. That sound you hear in the background is my laughter at somebody thinking this is worth twenty bucks. If you must buy this, wait until it gets at least a 75% off sale so you don't risk as much cash. You'll get maybe three or four hours out of this; maybe more if you don't just break down and use a walkthrough like I did (but in all fairness, I was just swimming as fast as I could towards the end so I could legitimately say I beat it).TL;DR - 1987 called; it wants its games back. 2/10.

												Leisure Suit Larry reloaded was ok. I played the original games way back when and I think I was expecting a little more from this particular title. So much time has gone by and so many new mechanics have been introduced into games over the years yet the old recipe was used again. It does give you a sense of familiarity, but it felt far too linear, bland and static to be honest. I don't think people unfamiliar to Larry will take a shine to this game. In saying that I believe this one is strictly for the old fans.  "

Pointless effort as all the remakes areYes, they did a decent job not to copy all the puzzles, there's a new tricky storyline, girs portraits, static graphics and backgrounds are good. But sprites look like they were cut out of color paper and music lacks that early 90s atmosphere (actually I was expecting original tracks). Taxi cab ride is a one hell of a faux, compared to renewed original of 1991 (for me - a new game actually and first of Larry series to play). By the way, I don't see any reasons for making such games, as old ones never actually getting obsolete. Just install DOSBox or grab you trusty 80x86 and play the original instead.5/10			"

												The game is well titled, at least: ""Reloaded.""  The game hasn't evolved in 20 years.  The crude humor is still exactly that, and while it can be appreciated as such, the game is probably best fit for a teenage or pre-teen audience... and not the adult audience I had assumed it was for when the game was created 20 years ago, before I was ""old enough"" to be ""allowed"" to play the game.Titilation, but no nudity, and mildly goofy.  There's much more risque content readily available.  Again, it doesn't compare well with what was (un)available 20 years ago.  In an age where the Playboy magazine is doing something radically different and NOT include nudes because the times they are a-changing, because of the internet... well, LSL should have sought to do something radically different as well.I'm not sure it's even worth $2, because even the 60 minutes it took to follow the game through the walkthrough were 60 minutes of my life I wished I had had back.  Spend that 60 minutes on Reddit or Imgur.  It's a better use of your time. "

There are elements in the game that truly are riotous, but the final output has to be considered as a missed opportunity. Good news for the fans that this remake doesn’t cost much. And, if you are a sexist by heart and enjoys trying out your bad luck with every female you come across, this is a title that gives you a graphical presentation of it.

												This was a weird gaming experience - despite Al Lowe's creative presence this game just wasn't funny - the recycled gags from the EGA original too familiar and the new stuff just came across as lame/obvious.  I also kept thinking back to the early 90's VGA remake that used the same user interface and felt it looked and played better (surely not?!).   The price point at launch also felt too high (£15 odd quid I recall).   Misfire all round for me.			"

												How well does the Reloaded version of Al Lowe's adventure game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards stack up against the original?Back in April 2012, Replay Games surfaced on Kickstarter with the news that they'd managed to convince long time conjurer of dirty jokes Al Lowe to come out of retirement for this top-to-bottom re-imagining of his 25-year-old graphic adventure game, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards.The game puts the player in the driver's seat of the story of Larry Laffer, a middle-aged, balding man trying to seduce attractive women. Larry was a nerdy geek all his life and eventually became a computer programmer. He now finds himself in Lost Wages, in front of the bar Lefty's, with a bottle of breath spray and $94 dollars in his wallet.I guess I was around 12 years old when I played the original Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards with my friends and even though we never managed to leave Lefty's, Larry introduced us to new words from the English vocabulary, like ""mount"". I think we even got our hands on an uncensored version at some point, but in all its EGA resolution glory, I doubt we really noticed any difference.What has changed from the original game? Not surprisingly, there has been a major overhaul of the graphics, sound, music and  there is now fully vocalized audio. There are also new jokes, new puzzles and even some new characters. One of the Kickstarter tiers allowed you to pay to be one of the drinkers at Lefty's, and although this was a great idea to rob someone of $5,000 (yes, that was the actually amount you had to pledge to drink at Lefty's), it introduces an element to the game that just seems shallow and unnecessary. The Kickstarter drinkers should have been replaced with over-the-top fictional characters instead.The HD background graphics is beautiful, but the character graphics and animation have a lot to be desired. They seem rushed and most of them, expect for Larry himself, stand so much out from the backgrounds, they look a bit like something I could have drawn myself. This especially goes for the Kickstarter drinkers in the bar. Maybe they had to draw themselves, too, who knows? While we're on the subject of Kickstarter: It permeates too much of this game, Al Lowe even appears at the end, thanking the Kickstarter backers. Get off the set, Al!Money is an important aspect of Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded, and the $94 dollars in Larry's wallet won't last you long. To get more money you have to gamble, and thankfully there are slot machines, blackjacks and other mini games everywhere you look. It does, however, become rather tedious to play these games to get money, and you'll find yourself saving and loading quite a lot. To go ahead and build up a solid cash balance at the start of the game is probably a good idea, so that you don't have to back and save/load/gamble time and time again.More often than not, understanding what you're supposed to do in the game is far from logical and your play style can easily turn into a click fest, where you try to use the hammer with the squid, the squid with the bungee cord, the bungee cord with the Tabasco sauce and the Tabasco sauce with pretty much every living and inanimate object in the casino, Caesar's Phallus. Although this is not something that is unfamiliar to point-and-click adventures, it's sort of in the name of the genre, it just feels like too much in this case. Clicking on everything will eventually pay off in the end, though, but it just seems so random. This kind of game style might not appeal to people who prefer to play adventure games where logic is in fact something that matters.But logic is not what Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded is about. It's about Larry Laffer's crazy adventure and there's nothing logic about it at all. If you laugh at fart jokes, start to drool at the thought of digital honka-honkas and enjoy clicking your mouse a lot, this is a game you should go ahead and buy.Personally, having finished the game, I'm left with a feeling that it was 5 hours I probably could have used on something more entertaining. The jokes are OK, I laughed every now and then, but I think I expected more. Maybe the game simply isn't for the adult me. Perhaps I left Larry Laffer behind at some point in life, when I actually grew up? But all that said, it was nice to meet Larry Laffer again and realize that the first time I saw Larry Laffer back when I was 12 should have been a warning sign about become a computer programmer myself.This review is also avilable on https://www.vegard.net/.

The game has been revitalized and revamped to this new state, but remains the same game it was all those years ago.If you enjoyed that game and want to re-experience it?  Great, this is a solid purchase for you!   But otherwise, this is just a very dated point and click adventure.

												The worst parts of old point & click adventure games brought into the present with updated graphics, but learning nothing from the genre's history.I played the original LSL games on my uncle's computer when I was younger, so when I saw this on sale a while back I was curious as to how they'd update the game for the modern era. Spoiler alert: they haven't.Puzzles aren't actually puzzles, more of a ""click everything on everything else"" trial & error situation. They haven't really thought about modernising the interface, just replicated the old one with a little polish. Same thing with the tone of the game - extremely sexist. I understand that's Larry's character, but it doesn't have to be the default feel of the rest of the world.			"

												While playing this game, all I could think about was how I wished I was playing the original instead. I was a Kickstart backer for nostalgic reasons - what a mistake.			"

												Really disappointing. I had long wanted to play the original Leisure Suit Larry games but never did because of tech compatibility (often an issue with such old games), so I was excited when the remake Kickstarter rolled around. I backed it based on reviews of the original, which is often hailed as a filthy, funny sex parody, implied to have multiple girls to bang and some romance to it. Instead, it's a super corny, cheesy, completely linear adventure game with only one girl to bed, and she comes out of nowhere and has no personality or connection to Larry. You don't have to work to get to know her or even ""unlock"" her sexy ending - Larry just sort of bumps into her at the end of the game and it's supposed to be some kind of reward. All the more interesting women are completely unattainable, as the story forces you to go through several women in order, watching Larry blunder & fail through each one until he receives his random booty call. There's also suprisingly little sex (almost none, and no actual nudity) for a game that I always hear described as a porn game. It's way more about puns than porn.This is super confusing to me, because it's not all that funny. I know humor is subjective and all, but the jokes on display here are kind of lame and often feel like they're trying to shock the player by being sexy or vulgar, when they're rather tame by today's standards. Especially when you factor in the shallow gameplay and often abstract puzzles of an early adventure game that is more or less copied exactly, just with the instant failure states removed, it often feels like you're just watching a bad movie - like a dumbed down version of The 40 Year Old Virgin that's had all the romance & humanity removed.I'm sure a lot of this has to do with people being easier to shock in 1987, but it really doesn't hold up well today. I'm frankly boggled that they didn't ramp up the quality for the remake.If you have nostalgia for the original, then this is probably a good buy. It's very clearly aimed at cult fans. If you're looking for a great comedy and/or sexy game, it doesn't hold up well to the competition.Disclaimer: I was a Kickstarter backer for this game, and received the full product at a discounted price.

												Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards (phew) is not my kind of game. Its animatons are dated, the gameplay meh and I just didn't get the whole hype behind Larry in general. Having never played the original (or sequels) might affect my judgment, of course, but I think it's for the better.  I guess this game is fun or exciting if you're 15 but even then I doubt you'll get a real kick out of it. Save your money for other point-and-click adventures, or at least for one with a better interface, because this one was terrible to work with.[Rating: 62/100]			"

Very memorable game, tons of humor, beautiful graphics and intriguing puzzles ( well, some of them pretty strange to a noob like me ). I definitely recommend it ot those who want to sit back, relax and help a guy find true love. No story driven game here, just pure fun!!!			"

												Is it worth playing? Yes.   Is this worth full price? No. While this is a very quality remake of the original game, and not exactly the first remake either, it is not by any means a modern version of what point and click adventure gamers may have come to expect. The soundtrack is fantastic, and the voice acting is straight from leisure suit Larry 7: Love for sail. If you were a big fan of that game, like me, then you will really enjoy revisiting the first adventure of pathetic Larry Laffer; for the right price.While this is more than just a common reskin, it doesn't add enough new content to justify the full price tag, and would really be more suited as a $10 game. That being said, if you are a fan of point and click adventure, this is a great remake of an old powerhouse that you should wish list and wait for on sale. If you are a fan of Mr. Laffer, then this is worth picking up at the price you think nostalgia is worth.			"

												A click-for-click re-re-retelling of Larry Laffer's first outing!Sounds outstanding on the surface, but once you're inside, the inherent flaws in the outdated and clunky control system become glaringly obvious within the first 5 minutes of play.Gaming has come a long way from Sierra's halcyon days in terms of control aesthetics, simplicity, and approachability -- all of which is ignored by this game's creators. Granted, the interface is supposed to work over all platforms including touchpads and tablets, but that's still no excuse to ignore about 25 years of advancements in intuitive gameplay design. There's no sense of nostalgia here, just overly-complex tasking and needlessly wasted time fumbling with an inaccurate radial menu, hard cycling through an incomplete series of options, or dragging the mouse to the top of the screen to temporarily pause the game as you decide what to do.The new jokes are raunchier, but also were not written by Al Lowe at all -- those duties instead passed on to this Josh Mandel guy, who might have voiced a good King's Quest king, but lacks any real talent for writing witty dialogues. This is probably the most disappointing thing about LSLR, since Al was the guy who made me laugh for a decade, and the man who I believed when he said HE was bringing back Larry.The new artwork and areas are pretty, but very, very generic and don't really capture a sense of 'Leisure Suit Larry', so much as 'colorful-but-bland and self-serving set pieces'.Larry retains the voice of Jan Rabson, as we've come to know and love it from the LSL6 talkie onward, but they apparently couldn't get the talent of Neil Ross, the original narrator -- who's pretty prolific in his body of work and couldn't be THAT expensive......What, with havin pulled in nearly three-quarters of a million dollars through Kickstarter supporters like myself...That is an awful lot of money...I'm sure it put enough in the budget for ""Series Staple Voice Actors""... Damn, this sure doesn't feel like a million dollar title...Perhaps there were contractual agreements from previous studios or some other, more nefarious reasons for changing this beloved presenter of shenanigans; however, their replacement (some guy named Brad Venable?) leaves much to be desired. His voice isn't smooth, or appealing, and even his insults fall flat and oftimes ruin a joke for lack of comedic timing and odd choices of inflection.If this is how they plan to continue and retell the series, it could be the death nell for our loveable loser... WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US, AL LOWE?!? GET BACK TO THAT WRITING DESK!!			"

												As someone who played the original LSL1 VGA on 3.5"" Disk in their youth, hiding it from their parents on their 486 AST Advantage. This remake is ACE. I have never enjoyed a remake more. The humor is completely intact, and even updated in some aspects. I can go on and on, but I'd rather just tell you to pick this game up - support the developer- and get MORE Reloaded LSL games on Steam. Graphic adventure fans rejoice  - this is what we love. Now if we can just get a ""Reloaded"" esque remake of Quest for Glory I'll be able to die happy.			"

												Love going back in time and replaying this game.  I had forgotten so much of it.  I really miss these types of games and the humor.  It always makes me laugh.  Wish there were new ones out by the same writers.  If you like humor, point and click adventure games then this is for you.  It was funny 20 years ago and still is funny today.  Some of the achievements are a little annoying to get since you need to repeat actions over and over to get it, but as a game, it keeps moving and gives plenty of laughs along the way.			"

												I first played LSL in the 80's in CGA and  I loved it. Played all the squels too, many times. This is more a review if you played the original and VGA versions. Pros: The graphic got a nice upgrade. Voice acting is good. New items. New location. Some quests are not identical than the original. You might have to search a bit to solve some, instead of just do the exact same thing, like the original. Cons: Lots of stuff and jokes got replaced by something with Kickstarter in it. It's really annoying. Animations sometimes freezes and it's usually when you're getting an achievement.   The new kickstarted characters looks a bit out of place with their different styles.Good game. I still prefer the VGA version. If it wasn't for all the kickstarter related stuff, it would have been near perfect.			"

												I never played the originals, but I did see the boxes of leisure suite larry for the tandy (I think) when I was a little kid. I never played it before. I'm not a big Adventure game guy, but this game wasn't too hard -- even though I did go through the walkthroughs about 4 times whenever I got stuck. This game was too short, but it was very enjoyable. I would get this game only if it's on sale; but I would say that it definately gives you a nice relaxing feeling. The jokes aren't that funny any more, but if you grew up in the 80's (and you appreciate corny jokes) , I think it's worth it. It's even worth playing this game over watching the youtube videos, because you can do lots of silly things which other people may not do.			"

												My first issue here, is that I am sick of remakes in general, and I would MUCH rather have seen a completely new Larry game in the 2D style. Another problem has to do with clunky gameplay mechanics. Mainly the ""economical aspect"" - yes, this game requires you to spend money (I'm not talking about real world purchases, to be clear, only in-game money) constantly. You must pay to travel between locations, you must sometimes pay to gain access to new conversations, and you must pay to obtain specific items. The only real way to gain money is to gamble at casino machines, which is quite tedious, even when you are using save/load to cheat. Eventually you will have enough to finish the game, but it's an unnecessarily painful step. Graphics are fairly good, voice actors are decent, and the sheer joy of seeing Larry on my PC monitor again is still worth the price of the game, though. I would still recommend this game to people who enjoyed the old games, at least.			"

												This game originally came out in '87. Long before a lot of you were born. (for some, even before your parents were born)What you see on TV etc, not even close to what the '80s were like. (and don't get me started on the '70s <grin>)At the time the game was hilarious.  You had to type in what you wanted to do, and you got killed a lot trying to figure out what to do.  Yes, it's shallow, sexist etc. WELCOME TO THE '80s!!  That's how it was.  (and Vegas was for ADULTS not 'families')The remake stays very faithful to the original, so those of us who bought the game for our original PCs, running from 360K floppies, it's very nice trip down memory lane. BTW, I still have said floppies in a box somewhere.  :)If you can take a joke, want to see what your parents (or even grandparents) had in the way of games after hunting sabretooth tiggers, then take a look.I'm actually going to replay it next month on the 30th anniversary of buying the original.(30th anniversary?? Good gods I'm getting OLD! Oh well, beer and some Larry will help)  :P "
