												Positives: It's short, like two hours or under.  The characters look about like you'd expect.Negatives: It's tedious and boring, making it feel much longer than the short runtime.'Bone' is one of my favorite books (graphic or otherwise) ever.  It's a wonderful fantasy adventure.  I also enjoy TellTale's games (though they aren't perfect).  So I should love this, right?  I wish. Every task you're asked to complete is clearly busy work.  None of the ""puzzles"" is truly driven by the story.  They're just hoops to jump through in order to get to the next screen.  The worst offender is when you're asked to guide Ted the bug across the river.  Without a walkthrough, I never would have gotten across as the logic dicated by the pattern of his jumps breaks down when you get close to the other side.  It looks like I should be able to make the jumps necessary as the stones are spaced just like rest, and I tried multiple spots to lead from, but there is only one single way to get across, and if you don't follow it, it won't allow you to make the jumps.An additional crime, less painful but still aggravating, is the inability to skip voiced dialogue.  I can generally read the text much faster than the voice actor will deliver it, and when I'm in the middle of an extended Q&A, I want to get it over with as soon as possible.  But perhaps that's my impatience with the overall game.  I just wanted to be done and wished I could speed up any little bit of it.  This lack of skipability carries over into the end credits.  They're slowly scrolled and, for some heinous reason, quadruple spaced.  And you... can't... skip them.To be fair, the early sections of the book are relatively uneventful, but maybe that should have been a sign to TellTale.  'Bone' would make a phenomenal animated movie, but videogames are an interactive medium, and that interaction needs to feel meaningful.  The source material here, as much as I love it, doesn't bear the weight of player interaction.  Unless you're the most die-hard fan of TellTale's games, skip this one.  Fans of the book?  Stay away.			"

												Telltale's first adventure game is a fairly short, graphically charming game which is clearly aimed at children. The humour would appeal to young kids and the puzzles are pretty easy. The minigames can be skipped if anyone finds them too difficult. It's not a great game, but it's not terrible either. Others have mentioned bugs, but apart from two moments of silence when characters should have been speaking, I didn't encounter any.The pace of the game is quite slow, characters move ponderously and dialogue can't be skipped. For a point and click adventure there aren't that many things to click on. There are very few objects to find and even fewer puzzles that require using those objects. The game is mainly dialogue driven with lots of talking and is very linear, interspersed with set piece games and puzzles. These are quite simplistic and frankly I found them rather tedious, although kids would probably enjoy them.I would not recommend this game for adults, but I would recommend it for the audience it was clearly intended for, young children.EDIT: It's not obvious from the title, but this game is Act 1 of a two part series. The Great Cow Race is Act 2, so they should be played in order. Unfortunately the story is not complete, they should have made more episodes but didn't.			"

												This is a short game, and probably one of the first games that came out of Telltale Games.  It's simple, short and a good adventure game for kids.  The story is good, but not great and even the dialogue isn't something that will be very memorable.  My kids enjoyed it and I enjoyed playing it with my kids.			"

												Bone: Out of BonevilleThis is the first part of a two part game series!I played through the entire game and I had a lot of fun with it. I am a big fan of the Graphic Novels, and it felt like i was part of the books. Unfortunatly the game is very short, I beat the whole game in two hours!   NOTE: This is a children's game, and the puzzles are pretty.The voice acting is pretty good, some of the voices sound a little odd, but overall really good and book acurate. The gameplay is very similar to other TellTale Games. the Graphics aren't great, but you get used to it. and this game is really worth buying if your a fan of the Bone Books, or of TellTale Games. 8/10			"

												With only a few dollars balance left on my account, I remembered back to my childhood when ""Bone"" was the most relevant and popular graphic novel out there. It had great characters, an interesting plot, and an expansive world and mythology. Now all these factors should translate well into a game, right? Sadly, Telltale did not live up to the comic with this game.Firstly, it is a point-and-click game. While in theory this would work in favour, there is just not enough to observe in the enviorments. It's a rather empty game, lacking in atmosphere and inspiration. The dull voice-acting doesn't help at all. There are several moments where the game transitions to a sort-of ""mini-game"" mode, and these segments do not work at all. They're unclear, dodgy in response, and attribute nothing to the experience.All in all: Stick to the comic-book. F&@k this game.			"

												if you read the comic books as i did as a child you will find this game sorely dissappointingthe platform is very frustrating to use, so i would not reccomend for a child. it was hard enough figuring out what to do as a 20 year old. As for the story, seems to follow according to the comics with minor changes to add more ""gameplay"" or just a crappy excuse for you to waste more time in a 10 minute conversation with a character or minigame. voice acting was far less than par, with choppy dialog that sounds that is recorded from a skype microphone makes this game very dissapointing.all in all not worth your time let alone $10, or $20 if you bought the sequel as i did.

												From Jeff Smith's graphic novel to a telltale game chapter in the TTG bible. The story is three bone cousins Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone get seperated from each other and Fone discovers a vally full of crazy creatures. The game is amazing and the charaters in this game are memarable: Like Ted the Bug, The Great red dragon, and the Stupid, Stupid Rat creatures!! I give this game 9/10			"

												This is the first part of the Bone series (you need the other game to see the end of the story), and it's the first game published by Telltale. It's got great humor for people of all ages, puzzles are fair (only had to use the in-game help once to figure what I was doing wrong), the dialogues and story are very fun and the characters are remarkable and professionally voiced. Only con would be only having a 1024x764 resolution, that you have to choose (the default is 800x600). Two thumbs up, 10/10!			"

												As a fan of the books, it's interesting and sometimes entertaining to see Jeff Smith's characters running around on your computer.  Unfortunately, Smith's artistic style didn't make the transition to the screen (Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' series is a great example of retaining the artist's style and tone).  The characters and locations are here, but they don't feel genuine.I'd recommend this only to die-hard Bone fans, or maybe children who have somehow discovered Bone but aren't old enough for the books yet.[There's also an inventory glitch that prevents you from progressing past Gran'ma Ben's farm.  I don't know how frequent it is, but Telltale doesn't have a solution.  This hasn't impacted my review other than expediting it.]			"

												Bone: Out From Boneville is a typical cartoonish Telltale game with no need for any prior knowledge of the Bone cartoon to appreciate.  This game is no different from the other Telltale series (Sam n' Max, Strong Bad, etc.).  The humor is abundant, and is appropriate for most age ranges (alcohol and tobacco use).  The puzzles are intuitive, but not overly simple.  The crisp graphics helps alleviate from tedious pixel hunting.  The overall difficulty isn't too hard, and the game length is relatively short.  I completed it in about two hours.  There isn't any hidden bonuses like there are in Strong Bad.  Very straight forward.  A fun romp if you enjoy Telltale games.			"

												It’s a fun little game and a testimony to how much Telltale games have evolved. It’s very short and have characters and settings that resembles Jeff Smith’s Bone, but none of the charm. Animations are dull and lifeless, especially facial animations are bland, voices are off, and where the game could add to the Bone universe, either by telling the story from a different perspective, or showing other inhabitants affected by the tale, it tries to tell a shortened version of the story in the comics. Game play is point and click, with 2 chase sequences that you can skip, most of the tasks are tedious chores, but nothing outrageous bad.For its humble asking price it’s well worth the money, and considering when it was released, it’s not a bad nor an ugly game.You can skip dialogue by pressing “space”.

												Jeff Smith's Bone series is a brilliant mix of fantasy world-building and timeless comedy... also, it's conspicuously absent from the description of this game. That seems a major oversight as Bone: Out From Boneville functions as a highlight reel of the first few issues, realized in 3D form. For fans of the series, there's nothing new here... which is fine, since the wit and wonder still works, even in Windows 10.Despite the comments to the contrary, I never experienced any installation errors or gamebreaking bugs. In fact, my only complaints about Boneville are its relatively short runtime (2-3 hours) and the visual depiction of Rose. While Gran'ma Ben's exaggerated features translated well to cartoonish rendering, the more 'human' Rose looks more like the cgi monstrosities of a Dire Straits video (ask your parents), but her voicework saves the performance.The puzzles are fairly light and simplistic (hide-n-seek as an integral plot point, for example), making the game appropriate for younger audiences. Admittedly, there are multiple references to smoking and gambling, but nothing more hardcore than the films of my childhood, the now-classic Goonies and Gremlins... again, ask your parents...Beyond the seeming straightforwardness, Out From includes branching conversational paths and puzzles with multiple solutions, prompting different later dialogue, so you would need to replay sections to hear all of the voice acting. Therefore, while the game itself can be finished rather quickly, there is enough content to recommend the title at its non-sale price, currently set as half of a $10 bundle. As for me, I'm off to the Cow Races...			"

												Why do people hate on this game so much? This is Telltale's first game ever! Cut them some slack! Anyway, this is what you would expect from Telltale, point-and-click greatness. It basically follows the Bone series of graphic novels made by Jeff Smith. The series ran from 1991 to 2004 and DAMN were these good books. But the game however..is lacking. As expected from Telltale's first game, this one isn't as long as say, TWD or BTTF. No, this won't take very long. The graphics fit the feel of the comics to a t, and features voice acting to go with it. Everyone sounds on par to me, just how I would imagine them in the comics. Although, Grandma Ben and Smiley Bone can get on your nerves real quick. But other than that, both the graphics and voice acting are decent. However, the puzzles, as explained in previous reviews, are what break the pacing. Finding the possum kids was a snoozefest in itself, and guiding Ted through the river was a hellish ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. I swear to God if it wasn't for a guide for a game aimed at 7-11 year olds, I would have been stuck there for HOURS. Yes, there are some crashing issues and bugs, but that did not stop me from enjoying this gem. Recommended for fans of the comics? Yes. Recommended for fans of the Telltale games? Well...that's all up to you.Pros: Captures the feel and look of the graphic novels beautifuly. +         Found myself chuckling at more than one occasion. +         Decent graphics. +Cons: Incrediblely short. -         Voice acting is hit or miss. -         Awful puzzles. -OVERALL SCORE: 6/10RECOMMEND: FANS OF THE COMICS: YES.

												If this should be recommended probably depends on the other acts of this series. As it is, Out From Boneville feels pretty unfinished, as if it didn't even make to the polishing phase. Altogether this seems to be more of a proof-of-concept adventure for the TellTale engine. From design (protagonists' models and movements are somewhat similar to Max's) and voice actors (e.g. main protagonist's voice is Sam's) I'd say this adventure was done to show the Sam & Max adventures could be done, which incidentially are what I would recommend everyone to play way before touching this game.+ It's an adventure+ TellTale engine: 3D world, camera 'following' the player+ Good voice acting: David Nowlin (Sam) and other voices from TellTale's Sam & Max- Way too short and still somewhat boring- Story almost completely developed in introduction cutscene- Awful controls in action sequences- Skipping dialogue parts may skip more than can be read at the timeThe story builds little momentum, mainly driven by the introduction cutscene and by some pieces of dialogue that appear disconnected at times. And the first act is over in nearly no time.Puzzles are very easy. Basically it's combining the few things you find with the environment, the main obstacle here is finding items as they are not highlighted in any way (which I'm fine with). Other times your current objective is helped by dialogue.There are three scenes with their own puzzle mechanics - labyrinth, hide and seek - which is nice.Using items inconsistently makes the mouse cursor that object or the standard 'use' cursor.There are two very bad third-person action sequences in which you have to escape whatever follows you. They are bad because your control options - jump, go left, go right (as opposed to turn left or right) - are executed with the mouse and the left-right movement control is nothing close to tight. There is no indication as to how far you just moved the character before it stops moving in that direction which can feel pretty long after you let go of your mouse and make you run into obstacles - not fit for reaction sequence. Both sequences are short but not short enough to not bore. Then again you can simply fail them after which the game offers to skip them.Personal preference: I don't like it when the played character, one of two, behaves like a prick, more so if that interferes in no way with completing objectives. Maybe that's why the 'protagonists' are from Boneville.I may recommend this act after playing the next one as piece of the overall experience but I don't expect the second part to take it away.For now, I don't recomment Out From Boneville.

Otherwise, this is an okay adaptation.The characters look and sound as I thought they would (excpt Fone Bone).Most of the animations are pretty good.The graphics are really pretty.It's rather short.Again, they cut out a lot.The gameplay/puzzle portions are boring and just there to be there.And it was clearly ment for smaller children, and we ALL know how well it goes when Telltale games tries to make a game for kids  *ahem* minecraftstorymode *erm*!  I think anyone older than the intended age would find this to be rather boring.Otherwise, if you're a huge Bone fan (like me) and want to play a game about it, I reccomend it. But, it's not worth it if you havn't read all the books yet.One other thing I should note is that there is another Bone game in developement that will adapt all the books on GameJolt for FREE.

												Bone Out From Boneville is the first adventure game made by telltale games. Did they start off with a bang or did they screw it up entirely ? In Bone out from boneville we take controll of two charecters. Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. We take controll of the characters after they get kicked out of theyre home town and travel across the land to find somewhere to live but after they get attacked by Locust they split up and they need to find each other. So how is Bone Out from Boneville ? This game is actually pretty good. The game is not like the other Telltale games where the story progress by itself. Theres tons of puzzles to solve. But there are some problems with the game as well. There are very annoying puzzles in the game. The game is also quite buggy and theres a problem where the charecter doesnt go where you want him to go. Overall the game is alot of fun and for the first telltale game its quite impressive. Great story. Awesome puzzles (excluding the possum one) and great art style. Just a few problems like minor bugs and thats pretty much it. Without a doubt give Bone Out From Boneville a try. I give Bone: Out From Boneville a 7.5/10			"

I oftentimes stay away from PnC or play them solely for their story while using a walkthrough, because mostly I can't for the life of me solve all these puzzles. But this game has both a decent storyline and solveable/reasonable puzzles.I like it. I didn't like the second part (cow race - you have to buy that too if you want to know the end of the story) as much and found it to be a bit odd, and thus stopped playing that halfway through. This one was alright though.			"

												Okay, I've just finished this game like I do for all of my reviews and here's what I think.Eh...Bone: Out From Boneville plays well for it's time and I think Telltale, from that time, did a wonderful homage to the Bone books. The game starts and ends fairly strong and the whole game is consistent with the book, a little too well. One major issue is that the entire game focuses on Fone Bone and while that's all well and good, the book took time to show the development with the other characters as well, and although you do get to spend some playing time playing as Phony Bone (sorry, I lied earlier), It never felt as strong as it could have been.Is this a good game? Only if you've read and really enjoied the Bone books, like I did. Otherwise, it isn't a game, it's an interactive storybook that's done better than most of the interactive storybooks from my childhood (even green eggs and ham but then again, green eggs and ham didn't have rat creatures chasing after you).It's good, but not fantastic, the voice actors threw me off and the character models aren't the best. Not to mention the end wasn't as strong as it could have been since (spoilers) we had no introduction to the mysterious figure, which I might add was introduced in the book in a segmanet that was touched on in the book. That left the ending very confusing as if we were missing a section of the story, which we were.Anyway, I give this ""game"" a 6/10 if you love the bone books5/10 if you liked themand a 4/10 if you're unfremilar.As a remind, this is my own oppionon, I could be compleatly wrong. But I feel that if TellTale ever made a remake, It would be tons better than this game was.			"

												Well, i have always loved the Bone books by Jeff Smith. Jeff Smith wrote a five book graphic novel series of pure epicness. The games have a little smaller of a thrill. They are nowhere as good as the books, but they are still good. Bone: Out From Boneville follows the story rather well. My biggest complaint is that its too easy. I turned off hints because it wasn't that hard. I only got stuck once without the hints, and it wasn't even that hard of a thing, I just got confuzzled. Even the mini games in this one aren't too hard. Of course, there is also a locust chase at the beginning where you get caught in a swarm of locusts. You run away, and use basic monuveres by moving the mouse back and forth and left clicking to jump. You do the same game style later in the game when being chased by rat creatures. The dialogue tree things aren't that hard either. With your dialogue tree, you have basic conversation and its pretty obvious what to say, depending on what is going on and what character you are. In this game, being the first, out of the three main characters (Fone Bone, Phoncible P. Bone 'Phoney Bone', and Smiley Bone) You only get to play as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. YOu also get to play as a talking, leaf-shaped bug named Ted for a mini game where you hop across rocks. It is too quick of a game. For me, seeing how I played it and beat it before I got it on steam, it only took me two hours to beat. FOr a newbie with a sensible head on their shoulders, 3 hours to 4 hours. Overall, it is a great experience. I'd recommend the game. I give it a 7 out of 10. It has some pros, but mostly cons.			"

												oh this brought me back to my childhood but it's not all that good. Seriously, as long as you don't lack common sense you beat it within an hour with very little satisfaction. I mean yeah you also get the great cow race with this purchase but that only totals it up to 2 hours of meagre simplicity. I would only recommend this to people who are familiar with comics and are able to buy it while it's on sale.			"

												I didn't like this game as much as other Telltale games. I have not read any of the Bone comics so that could have contributed to my difficulty in getting in to this game. It does have the nice style I have come to expect from Telltale but the puzzles did not seem as interesting as other games. The story is quite good but it cuts off in the middle which is disappointing. I'd only recommend this if you are a fan of both point and click games and Bone.			"

												My negative rating isn't really a knock against the game, but rather the disaster that is Windows 10. The two Telltale-developed Bone point-and-click adventures don't play nice with Microsoft's latest muck up.1) Both Bone games crash unless you delete prefs.prop from each directory.2) The games will continue to crash if fullscreen mode is selected.3) Resolution settings are limited, meaning -- depending on your screen size and resolution -- the window is nigh unplayable. 3b) To solve this, a third-party application needs to be downloaded (http://www.wsgf.org/article/tell-tale-games-custom-resolution-tool).Finally, I was able to start and play the game. I love how it captured the look and spirit of the Bone comic series, one of my all-time favourites. The interface and movements are significantly clunkier than in modern Telltale games, so definitely take that under advisement.After a while, I decided to save and quit. The reason? I found that Steam's screenshot tool wasn't working, possibly due to the custom resolution tool, and I enjoy snapping shots of my games. Anyhow, I reset the resolution and booted the game up again.It couldn't find my save.At that point, I decided enough was enough. I really do think that the games, at least an hour in, respect the source material. Unfortunately, I may never know if that continues. Seeing as I doubt this game will ever be patched to play nice with this awful operation system (after all, it's not like Steam is GOG -- they don't care), I simply have to rate it down and move on. Maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to play it again someday but I'm not holding my breath.I guess I'll just read the comic again when I need to get my fix for Jeff Smith's wonderful characters, story, and world. Sigh...			"

												Played March 2016, Gametime, less than 2 hours. Note: I had problems with a glitch preventing gameplay, but the community board helped me fix it. (Delete a settings file, then play the game in windowed mode. Set the resolution as good as you can, you can set it back to full screen, restart the game).   Recommend, with reservationsIt's a Telltale Games point and click adventure through the first Bone graphic novel. Bone is one of my favorite comics from my youth, but I'm not a fan of Telltale Games.It is sort of faithful to source material, with most of the dialogue coming straight form the book.BUT, it cuts out a lot, and in my opinion cuts out too much. I think some of the cuts were made to make the game shorter/cheaper to make, and some of the cuts were because I think they were trying to get some ""ultra G"" rating, rather than the ""normal G"" rating that the original material has. Given Bone's history with appearing on banned book lists (possibly the silliest book to ever appear on such lists), I understand, but it is still disappointing.For example,  When Fone meets Thorn, she is just sitting by a hot spring, not soaking her legs in it. And she is always fully clothed, vs the graphic novels, where she is always clothed, but sometimes she is dressed hastily.  It cuts out the entire winter section, leaving everyone running from the farm during their first night in the valley. Sadly, this cuts out one of my favorite jokes in the series.  When they flee the farm, it removes all of Gran'ma's fighting.  It cuts out almost everything from Barrelhaven, including all of the bar scenes, but that also deletes a big chunk of the book.But they also dumbed it down to make it easier for even really young kids. For example, there are two chase scenes. If you fail them, it will ask if you want to skip them. There is a help button that will start out with a task reminder, progress through hints, and eventually tell you exactly what you need to do. If you are considering it: It isn't as good as the book.  It is a Telltale game, so if you hate Telltale games... It is less than 2 hours of gameplay It is definitely made more for kids than for adult fans of the game.  The voice acting... isn't bad by 2005 video game standards, but it's not the best. "

												One of Telltale's earliest games. Standard adventure game fair, but if you are a fan of the comics it's cool to see everything animated. The voice work could be better but they were still a pretty small studio at the time.			"

												I love the comic this game is based on, and had to buy this game as soon as I found out it existed. The voice acting is good and the dialogue is funny, but anyone interested in Bone would be much better off reading the comic. The graphics aren't very good at all. The mini-games are absolutely awful.			"

												Bone: Out From Boneville was one of the first point and click adventure games released by Telltale Games. It was also one of their first licensed properties to help them get over a hurdle for their start in their gaming business. Based on the highly acclaimed comic series by Jeff Smith, Bone started off as a cult comic but years later it would become a household franchise recognized by various libraries and comic award committees. It was only logical that it should get it's own game. Anyways even if you never read the comic, this game is a direct adaption of the first volume under the same title. It's a cross between the Peanuts comics and the Lord of the Rings series which is the best way to describe it. The main protagnogists are white anthropomorphic creatures that don't resemble anything else seen in the series. Which is part of the appeal of the series is that they are easy to recognize and to isolate them from the other more realisticly drawn characters. Now for the plot: the game starts off with our main hero Fone Bone who is out in the middle of a wasteland with his cousins Smiley & Phoney Bone. They were ran out of Boneville due to Phoeny Bone's election for town mayor went sour. With food and water becoming scarce, they need to find civilazation if they want to survive. When Fone Bone finds a map, they spouted a upcoming swarm of locusts and have to run for their own lives. Upon the encounter of the swarm, Fone Bone got seperated from his cousins and is now alone. Not willing to give up Fone uses his best outdoor skills to track his cousins and soon finds himself in a forest region that is more lively than the barren wasteland. A stranger in this unknown land to Fone, he soon makes new friends with the locals and with enough luck will soon find out what became of his cousins. The mechanics of the point and click system are at times a little off but since this was Telltale Games' first attempt in the genre, I will forgive them on that small error. Otherwise this game is easy to play, and while it's not a lengthy game keep in mind it's only covering one volume of a nine volume comic series so it was intended to pile each installment upon the other. Anyone who loves the comics will enjoy this game for certain.			"

												It gives me great dipleasure to say, this is a game that should never had been revived from the early 2K's and allowed back into this world.I love the Bone Universe and here be the p & c of it.Pro's;Excellent character's rendered in 3-Dsmooth animationCon's:Horrendous voiceworkAggravating Point and Click detection.Annoying ""Mini-games"" that are frustratingly un-skipable whilst others are allowed.As far as a Jeff Smith Graphic Novel being translated to a game. I truly expected more from TTG.Especially considering how Character's are what make his comics and thusly the story, worth telling, reading or in this case playing.Bumping this from my library and headed back to the valley via my book.
