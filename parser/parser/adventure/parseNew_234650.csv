												Now I've never played a Shadowrun game before, however I'm not exactly new to  turn based/strategy RPG games, having played games in a similar vein like the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor series and Fire Emblem. However, I'll be the first to admit I'm far from a veteran in the genre.One of the key things I think Returns did right, is the tricky task of drawing me into the story immediately. It's pretty simple: your friend is dead, he's left you a ""dead man's switch"" - a recorded message promising a hefty reward if you can find the killer. OK. I'm in.As for the ease of playing the game... as someone who's often daunted by complex RPG interfaces with endless choices, decisions, and items to equip, I thought Shadowrun's interface is a breeze. It clearly shows you your weapon slots, inventory slots, and which body parts you can equip on armor or modifications. As for playing the game itself, you can simply click on your HUD to switch between weapons or end turns, but there are hotkeys for the more practiced player, too.You encounter many characters on your way to solve your friend's murder, and you get to pick and choose your own team of Shadowrunners to go on every mission with you. Each has their own specialty - summoning mechs, specializing in ""decking"" (hacking), melee combat, guns, magic, and so on, and I had a great time testing out all the different classes.All of the characters have their own specialties, but the game is forgiving, and you could probably get by just using guns on everyone. I realized one of my runners had a healing ability 3/4 of the way through the game, and had been getting by just fine without knowing that. So if you're worried about difficulty or complexity, don't be.Another positive for me is the game is heavily text based. There is a lot more discovery and reading than combat. You can also save anywhere except an NPC turn in combat, or in conversation. So I could get up to answer the door or grab some food without bothering to pause, or quit at a moment's notice if my friends asked me to play a multiplayer game.I know I'm writing a review no one will ever read, for a two year old game, but it gets an easy recommendation from me, especially if you're a busy person who can only enjoy games in bits and pieces before you're on the go again.

												Strongest point of Shadowrun Returns is its writing. In best tradition of older RPGs, game describes what you character sees in flowery language. Character introductions, location descriptions and dialogues are smart and charming. The setting of Shadowrun is a blend of cyberpunk and urban fantasy - don't think I knew something like this exists before. I wouldn't mind experiencing Shadowrun Returns in book or graphical novel form.As a game, however, it is not so magnificent. SR was made by relatively inexperienced developers on tight budget using Unity and it shows. Graphics are mixed bag - wonderful character portraits, bright and detailed, if somewhat cartoony 2D backgrounds, but awful character models and awkward animations. Sound direction feels cheap overall - music are fine, but forgettable and there is absolutely no voice acting. Combat mechanics ripped straight off X-COM: Enemy Unknown.The biggest flaw of SR is its linearity. I just didn't have the opportunity to explore the world of Shadowrun - game kept railroading me on one story after another, with brief breaks in same   small hub. All two side missions are one chance affairs - go on them right now or miss it forever. While writing itself is great, spending points to improve charisma and get new dialogue options felt like total waste - game is too short and there is almost no opportunity to use your mad speech skills - I think I used each etiquette only once or twice in whole game. Story starts as a noir-like murder mystery, but after halfway point abruptly turns into ""save the world"" scenario and ends with series of boring battles against bugs. Absolutely unnecessary twist, in my opinion.My final impression: SR is an enjoyable short RPG; not without flaws but if you are able to overlook them, you will have a great time playing it.			"

												First all, let me tell you about my background - 39, working professional, married with kids. Was looking for an RPG game that I can really sink my teeth into without getting bored, and coming from a gamer background myself, not many games can catch my attention.Then saw a recommended game review somewhere about this Shadowrun, so being the typical gamer that I am since I dont like to pay for something I haven't tried yet....so I *cough*cough* got  a copy of the game to try........and then I closed the game, went to the Steam website, and purchased a legitimate copy. Let me tell you why :-a) this is an RPG - story, story, story - this is what's it all aboutb) the interface and game - slick, modern XCOM style combat, with that turn based system thats good for my pace and strategy.c) the real world/cyber world - the transitions are nice, a good break from the routine.d) Story - did I mention story? I like how I have to slow down to read, even the freaking Splash screens got something to really readSo I parted with my cash to show support to this developer. Keep up the good work and I look forward to purchase Dragonfall and any more of DLC of this kind :)			"

												Review for DMS (Dead Man´s Switch) & DF (DragonFall) CampaignsWhen Shadowrun Returns DMS came out, i liked it, but wasn´t really happy.The writing, atmosphere and graphics were nice and fitting, you really could delve into the Shadowrun universe and have fun.What was not so nice, were the lack of good/real party members and the unability to customize them. Also the story itself was pretty straightforward, with few optional decisions possible.What was horrible was the lack of a proper saving system.With DF Harebrained Schemes finally delivered the save system. So the horrible part is gone. They also tried to deliver some optional questing and a bit more interesting&permanent team members. B for effort, but for a truly good rpg the customization/inventory management of your party is still lacking, also the characters of the fix team members could still use some makeover, at least personal quests.The story once again is fitting, and the whole game has a bit more variety, without changing much of the base gameplay.So, to make this short, if you like Shadowrun and haven´t bought this game yet - do it! ;)If you like rpgs/cyberpunk, you now can give it at least a try.

SHADOWRUN RETURNS - Cyberpunk adventure/rpg with a compelling story   || 8 || Score Comment   Graphics 7 The game has top down isometric type view, graphics are very well done: the lighting, effects and areas feel very fitting and atmospheric.  At points, however, it feels like it would be nice to have a little bit more variety to the areas, some of them feel quite samey. Character creation and portraits are ok but you can't go into the level of detail of some other RGPs.  Audio 7 Music and sound effects are good, there is however quite a bit of reading to do in this game, do not expect voice acting for all of the story / dialogue.  Gameplay 8 I really enjoyed playing this game, its a nice mixture of adventure / mystery and rpg with turn based strategic combat (think xcom). You control a small team of characters (you collect them as the story progresses) who follow you as you play through the story completing various missions and solving mysteries. There are some good puzzles to solve as the story develops and you can choose to upgrade various skills as your character advances in levels. A really nice feature is the ""hacking"" that the decker class can perform, this takes a form similar to combat in the game but its you and your constructs against the computer systems defences.    Story 8 Shadowrun Returns is set in cyberpunk-esque world where magic meets machine. You can play different stories in the form of campaigns, the official ones are complemented by community created ones via the steam workshop. The campaigns are extremely well done and have a very noir feel to them. There's a lot of background and detail to the world (and a lot of reading to be done) and the story had enough intrigue and action to keep me interested right to the end. The nature of the game (your characters acting out the story) basically means that play feels quite linear and that sometimes the decisions you make don't really have lasting effects but this didn't effect my enjoyment too much.    Replayability 5 As much of the main campaign is story based, once you have completed the game there isn't that much to draw you back in. Having said that there is an excellent DLC (dragonfall) and there are community created campaigns and an editor which should add quite a few hours of playability   Overall 8 Excellent game for anyone who loves this style of gameplay or the setting. The community content really adds a whole new aspect and lease of life to the game, just be prepared to do a lots of reading.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment "

												As an avid Shadowrun fan, I was psyched when I heard about the kickstarter for Shadowrun Returns. I immediately backed it and kept careful track of the progress. Based on some of the design decisions and the concept art, I was initially concerned. My worry proved to be unfounded though. When I first opened Dead Man's Switch I was immediately pleased with the depth of detail in story and graphics.It does a respectable job of emulating the pen and paper game feeling. There is room for improvement, and I certainly hope some of the issues are addressed in the future, but there is enough variety for you to at least customize a character to reflect you (combat) style. Lacking stealth is a particularly strong drawback. So is the way social skills like negotiation and con are replaced with etiquette, but a smart modder can work around that and present an experience which will tailor to your needs.Which brings me to my next point, the editor. Say what you will about the main story, give it a couple months and it won't matter. The game comes with the same editor the developers used to make the game. Based on the community, you can expect some amazing modules to come and I look forward to them in the future! As for the main game, I enjoyed it even though it was fairly linear. It had the feeling of playing shadowrun at a gaming convention, you needed to follow a set script, but there was a decent story to back it up.One of the biggest concerns myself, and the community had was the lack of a save anywhere feature. Fortunately HBS was quick to implement this after release. They are very attentive to their fans needs. Now if only they could do something to limit ammo!Overall though, I am happy with Shadowrun Returns. If you are an avid fan, get it. If you are a casual gamer, do your research first. This game is not made by a major studio, you cannot hold it to the same standards as you would something from EA Games. If you want voice acting, amazing graphics, and more options than you can imagine, this is not for you. If you are willing to give the little guy a chance, and want the feeling of playing Shadowrun with your friends, then you will probably be pleased with what you get. At the very least its the best Shadowrun game out there currently.UPDATE 6/29/14I was asked about the game's replayability, so here is an update to address that. I will (most likely) better update the review later, but for now here it is.Most of my hours were spent inside the editor, you can easily spend hundreds of hours making your own mods. If you want to tell your own stories, and share them with the community, this is the game for you. The editor is the same tool used by the devs to make the official modules. A regular player will get less mileage out of the official campaign. The base campaign, Dead Man's Switch is under 20 hours for a playthrough. I played through it 3 times with different style of characters, but the experience is more or less the same regardless of character type. The expansion, Dragonfall, was also under 20 hours of playtime. I have only played that campaign once. Its a much more satisfying experience than the base campaign, but still, limited replay-ability. There are a couple optional missions you can play, but they both are fairly linear overall.The place where you can get strong replay-ability is the fan made modules. Some of them are really incredible. The downside is that being fan made you need to be patient for them to finish. It is entirely likely that you will start one and then finish everything that is there and be stuck waiting for the next installment.			"

												Hype and expectation are funny things. They can invite even the most rational and level-headed into wish fulfulment FAR beyond the truth, and we all know how prevalent that is in video gaming. I honestly believe that this game's reputation absolutely suffers from precisely this, especially from the view of some players. So, Shadowrun Returns - the question is ""does it"", or rather ""does it REALLY warrant the return?"" Let's start with the expectation part I mentioned. When this game was proposed, those that were fans of the old tabletop RPG and the old SNES classic sat up and took notice, and for good reason. Nostalgia aside, both are truly excellent games in their own rights. The downside to this is that it tends to set the bar VERY high, expectation-wise.Fast forward to the game's release, and there were certainly mixed views; much of the criticism dealt with there being less on the action and more on the text and story. Also, length was cited too, or rather, lack of it. On the face of it, very valid criticisms, except that many of these either forgot or didn't understand WHAT the game was achieving - a new version of the classic games, adhering closely to the rules - in short, Shadowrun RETURNS. The clue's in the name. It does what it says on the tin.So, there's an abundance of text and story, and less of the action itself, and yes, it is a bit short. While they are valid concerns EVERY game buyer should consider before dropping their cash, context is also equally important. Apologies for this slightly overblown introduction, but I felt it valid to lay this down at the outset. Let's get on with the review.If you know what Shadowrun is (or was), then there's little point in going over this and you can skim to the last paragraph. If you don't, then as I've already said, there's the classic tabletop ""D&D style"" game - a pure, unadulterated old-school pencil and paper RPG. The hook here is that elves, orcs, goblins and all the staples of fantasy exist, but the one major difference is everything is a futuristic sci-fi bent. It probably sounds completely at odds with one another, but it works so very, very well, both in lore and in combat ... ESPECIALLY in combat. You can still hack 'n' slash if you want to, you can still use magic if you want to, but add to the mix firearms and a complete veneer of futuristic and modern tech, and you have Shadowrun.It rather goes without saying that anyone who has spent any time playing old-school tabletop RPG knows that story and text are perhaps the premier parts, and that is the case here, naturally. But the question to the critics remains ""ah, but it is any good?"" Thankfully, the answer is ""yes, it is"".I confess I'm a little jaded. I've been around gaming since the very start, and have never had a period when I've not been involved. I've seen a lot, played a lot, own a lot, and have even worked in the industry (albeit relatively briefly). For the most part, I care little for story in games - most times I'm merely concerned with the mechanics over everything else. I couldn't tell you the story of Halo, for example, as it never gripped me in any way. So, why on earth am I saying this game's story is good? Because it DID grip me right from the off. It works. You know the story's working on you when you can start to identify and remember the characters. So, being heavy on the story is an ASSET to this game, and in no way a hindrance. I shan't spoil it in any way, but it's a fairly standard story, but it does it pretty well, so in summary I don't see the critique of ""too much story, too little action"" in any way a bad thing unless it's REALLY not your thing.Now, onto length. Yes, it IS relatively short. However, you should at least consider the reasoning behind the game's existence - it would never have seen the light of day AT ALL were it not for crowd-funding. Sure, you can claim they made big promises and ran out of resources and/or time, but the conclusion here is that putting all those aside the end product is pretty damned good. As stated before, it very much does what it says on the tin. So, if you don't mind quantity being less if the quality's good or reasonable, then there is no issue here. What does render the length argument completely invalid is one thing - WORKSHOP support. There's TONS of user-generated content out there which not only mimics what tabletop RPGs are all about, but the inclusion of mod tools (which I haven't tried) ensure that it's pretty easy to dole out a good scenario, and it certainly shows. So, if you finish the game and want more, you won't be disappointed at all.The combat is best described as being very similar to XCOM. It's turn-based with the dual-turn set of movement/action phases per character, or a mixture of those: you move, you shoot/swing/etc, and your turn's over. Your playfield is peppered with objects that you can utilize as cover, with the shield icon offering how good that cover is. This all offers a lovely tactical play where you don't just consider dumping your character up against the enemy and swing away at them, but you have to consider balancing cover with line of sight, flanking, and a number of other little tricks to make the best use of the battle.Character skills are great. As you'd rightly expect from a combination fantasy/sci-fi, it lends you a VERY wide palette of things to mess around with. Fire-based magic attacks? Sure. Rifles, pistols, or SMGs? Yup, have at them. Fire-based attacks WITH your pistol? Yup, that too. It does the Shadowrun rules well, and the interface is clear and intuitive and you'll have no issues picking it up quickly.Visually, the game offers a very nice art-style that does the medium justice. Backgrounds are all pre-rendered and hand-drawn (or at least they LOOK hand-drawn) in a graphic novel style which suits perfectly. Nothing I can fault here at all. Musically, the soundstrack is really good. I'm not a big fan of music soundtracks - I'm not one who will listen to them outside of the game. To me, they're a background that serves to provide ingredient to the recipe. They should illustrate without hindering the game in any way. Not only does the style and mood of the music suit perfectly, but it's not repetitive, and remains interesting without hindering in ANY way. If you're someone who does listen to game music absent of the game, you might well find this one very appealing.So, final summary time. Is it worth purchasing? Yes. If you are expecting a good turn-based old-shool RPG, it's worth it. Steam Workshop really underlines this, value-wise. The only caveat I would make is that if you're either not sure whether this sort of game's for you, or the length of the official game really is an issue for you, I'd thoroughly recommend waiting for a sale - it's still worth picking up.Final note I'm doing with all my reviews now: I'm giving a ""what do I think the game's worth?"" instead of any score or other metric, as I think that's the most valuable metric anyone could have. I'd say this deserves a £9 (or your regional equivalent).			"

												Pros:-Some good writing-Turn based combat is great, slightly better than Fallout with cover system.-Beautiful hand drawn world-Game editor and User Generated Content. (from what I read, the editor is quite restricted.)Cons:-Clunky user interface, clearly meant for touchscreens-No voiceover.-Non interactive world. Everything that you can interact with is highlighted with the hand icon. Anything not highlighted is just a background. Makes the world feel empty. -Non practical inventory system: cannot trade items between party members. You can only manage your inventory during start of a mission and at the safehouse.-Too little choice of weapon and armor.-No lootable corpse. Perished enemy will simply disappear into the thin air.-Moving and clicking is a bit off, particularly because it's a tablet game in the first place.-Extremely linear campaign and no sidequests.On tablet this game easily score an 8 out of 10. The game was designed for tablets in mind, making the developers overlooked some of its flaws and ignored many of the aspect of a good RPG other than writing. In fact, Harebrained Schemes (HBS) is a tablet game developer, has only released mobile games.Bear in mind that Shadowrun Returns comes with an editor and a default campaign made by HBS. The campaign is restricting and painfully linear. You cannot go back to previously visited place and there's only a few sidequest that you can do for extra cash. Right now there is some user made campaign available on the workshop which was designed better than the campaign made by the devs.Shadowrun Returns is a disappointing RPG lacking of real depth with so many unfullfilled potentials. If you're really looking up for this title and has already run out of RPGs to play, just wait for a sale.Score: 6/10Edit: You can now save anywhere in this game. And they lower the price too.			"

												** My full reaction is here on my blog should you want it http://riksreaction.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/riks-reaction-to-shadowrun-returns-pc.html **I thought this was great, from start to finish. Excellent. It is difficult to know what else to say... I just thought this was great. I'll just ramble as follows.As an RPG it was the perfect amount of complexity, deep but easy to understand.The artwork is lovely, everything is well animated and it is just generally a really attractive game.It is VERY well written IMHO, the characters come to life through the text and written dialogue, it's great! I honestly felt like I was enjoying an interactive book, which is a feeling I tend to get when I am fully engaged. The locations, the people, the story.. all of it is vivid and believable, not so much due to the on screen action, but more through the filter of my imagination which the writing nutures throughout, things playing out in my mind's eye as I read the next interchange between characters, or digested the description of the place I'd just arrived at.The narrative is solid, and makes sense (within the world it is told) and pans out well, I thought the pacing was excellent.Some might dislike the linear nature of the game, I personally love it. Side missions are available, but they are in direct relevance to the main storyline at all times which keeps things moving, and therefore aren't always available for you to come back to tidy up and complete later, so bear that in mind. I am a fan of a well told story, and ""sandbox"" games are never as good as experience for me as being told a well crafted story. Shadowrun Returns nails this.I really enjoyed this game, took me 17.2 hours to complete but it felt like a lot less purely because I was enjoying every minute of it and was just waiting to turn the next page in this electronic short story and learn what was going to happen next. Like a good book, it was tough to put down.It has it's flaws here and there, like checkpoint saves (due to be changed in a patch or via the next DLC I understand), some sections keeping you in turn based combat mode when there aren't any enemies about and on some of the longer battles the combat music can get a little tiring, but those are small complaints. Excellent and I'm looking forward to see what they do next! Recommended.			"

												The SNES Shadowrun was the jewel of my cartridge collection. I've honestly lost count of how many times I've played through it. With that in mind I started up my journey into Shadowrun Returns with a healthy dose of nostalgia and optimism, and at the end of the journey I came away happy, if not entirely satisfied.Unlike the Shadowrun of yore, Returns plays like an odd crossing of point & click adventure and turn-based strategy. Your runner is investigating the death of an old friend, and in each scene spends most of their time navigating dense dialogues with the many NPCs on hand. You might also be tasked to click on an object or a door, but the vast majority of the non-combat gameplay is talking. It's good talking, though, with some very colorful characters and attentive writing. The parentheticals get a little too heady and poetic for my tastes, but they set the scenes well enough. Overall the game nails the Shadowrun setting, which goes a long way towards keeping me interested.Combat is the other side of the coin, and while it works better than the ancient art of ""stand in place and shoot forever"", it's not without its flaws. Your crew and the enemy forces each take turns expending the action points of their members on a grid map with cover objects, much like in the recent XCOM. AP is spent a little oddly, however. Each move within a certain range costs one AP, whether it be a single step or a dash to the edge of their range. With melee weapons this is fine because the melee attack is included with the move, but ranged weapons cost at least one AP just to fire, so getting into an ideal position and firing can be a costly proposition. Doubly so when the sight lines around the environments are not terribly consistent, and it costs a full AP just to reload. It's an imperfect system that works well enough, but could definitely use more polish.There are plenty of ways to kill people though, and enough skill points to earn through the game to make the most of them. You have melee, five different firearm types, drones, and two kinds of magic, and that's not even getting into the support skills. Unfortunately, there's not much reason to diversify, and the game even tells you as much. High ranks in skills are very powerful, and spreading your points around won't give you the ranks you need to pass skill checks or hit later enemies. Plus, you hire party members from a large roster of shadowrunners who can easily fill in the gaps for you.These gripes are really part of a larger trend with Returns. You can buy weapons, armor, and other upgrades, but they are unevenly spaced throughout the game. There's not much to interact with in the many levels, and no real branching paths to explore. You can be a decker and get into the Matrix side battles, but they are few and far between. Your hired runners have no personality and can't be interacted with other than ordered around in battle. Even the story, built on some genuinely good writing, is small in scope and lacks any sort of proper build-up. It all points to a game not fully realized, a lot of potential without a lot of substance. The whole time I was playing, Returns felt more like a demo for the game engine than a full product.That's not to say it wasn't fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8-10 hours it took to complete, and aside from a particularly annoying final mission, had no major complaints about it. The issue is more a lot of little shortcomings mounting to give Returns a very half-baked feel. It's definitely worth playing, and I'm very interested to follow it with Dragonfall, but I wouldn't fault anyone who checked out after a few hours. Shadowrun Returns is a good enough Shadowrun game, and now I want a better one.			"

												I love Shadowrun as an IP.  It was one of the first pen and paper games I ever played 20 years ago, and my friends and I still plat it regularly (though now we're on the 5th Edition). But this is a hard game to recommend.  The mechanics are fine, but it's very easy to run into unsolvable problems - if you roll a hacker, you're going to have very little to do in the main campaign and are going to rely on NPCs and hirelings.  And if you're not a hacker, every time you NEED a hacker you'll be provided one free of charge.There's more too it than that, of course, but that's pretty illustrative.  The game feels extremely limited in a lot of places, from missing mentor spirits to customization through what's available from the NPC stores.   Honestly you'd probably be better trcking down an old copy of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magicka Obscura.			"

												I think I had never heard of Shadowrun before a friend of mine gifted this game to me. When I started playing it, I discovered a great world, filled with an unique style and characters.The setting is fantastic. A futuristic world where people can replace their limbs with mechanical implants a la Deus Ex, mixed with magic and fantastic creatures. The gameplay is quite fun, it reminds me of the turn based RPGs I used to play when I was younger, although in this game the combat is more tactical, with things like cover and area effects.The character customization is great; you can select your character's gender, its race (Human, Elf, Orc, Troll and Dwarf), and its abilities, some of them being street samurai, shaman, and decker. Even then, you can further customize your character by spending ""Karma points"" to unlock new abilities.The story is quite good, and there's plenty of dialogue options during the conversations, even more if you have the proper abilities. Another great point is the soundtrack, which really set the mood.So, to conclude, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I hesitated in picking up this game after reading a lot about how terrible the original campaign was and how the game was dull and boring. It also didn't help that I didn't really know anything about the Shadowrun universe. During the Summer Sale though, I was in the mood for something new, and picked it up. I just finished playing through the original campaign (Dead Man's Switch - DMS) and have to say, I'm glad I bought the game.Getting the basics out of the way, I admit that DMS is very linear. There is a lot of reading involved. And besides combat, there's not a lot of interaction with the world. Still, as someone who knew next to nothing about Shadowrun before I started, I think DMS does a very good job of introducing the player to the world and the mythos surrounding it. The reading will probably be boring to someone who is deeply familiar with the setting, but I found it very useful. Gameplay is likewise straightforward which allows a new player to dive in without fear of messing up. I played a Street Samurai / Decker and had no trouble. I did find myself wishing I could build a party and level them up, outfitting them and whatnot ala Baldur's Gate, but perhaps that will happen in an expansion.All in all, this game was well worth the $4 I paid. I also picked up the DLC, which I read is much better - I look forward to trying that next. "

												There are curently 3 Shadowrun games from Harebrained Schemes. Shadowrun Returns is the first one they have released and clearly the weakest of the three. That does not mean that Shadowrun Returns is a bad game, far from it. The following titles are simply much better and deeper experiences, making Shadowrun Returns kind of no longer relevant. For people with limited free time, if you want to play a Shadowrun Game, go for Dragonfall first, Hong Kong second and, if you still crave more, give Shadowrun Returns a shot. The Good:+ Great, immersive atmosphere+ Well designed visual styleThe Mediocre:~ Combat needs polish, some character builds are overpowered, other almost useless~ Relatively short~ The plot is not very interestingThe Bad:- Extremely linear, the player does not have much say in how the plot unfolds			"

												If you're expecting an RPG with open world and long hours of playing, this is not for you.This is a short (I finished it in about 12 hours of gameplay, not rushing or anything) and linear (at no point there is even an option of doing something different, picking different ways, or other stuff you would expect from an RPG) game.That being said, during those 12 hours I had a nice time. The story is interesting, the gameplay & interface is enjoyable, and for a simple game with no voice acting, the atmosphere is amazing.I would definitely recommend if you find this at a discount. Well worth if a few bucks for the 12 hour fun - just don't expect it to be a super production. "

												Tactical RPG putting you in the role of shadowrunner - a freelancer merk with private motivation to do some investigation properly. World of Shadowrun is rich, full of postmodern and fantasy, yet it is a very pragmatical and cynical one. Lovely thing, just like the big world behind the window, only with magic. Sadly, unlike D&D universe, it was poorely pictured in the videogames (there was 2 good games, but only on 16bit consoles - Genesis and SNES).Aside from my previous experience with the Shadowrun universe, game's a good one. Solid cyberpunk story (and fitted to Shadowrun agenda, as well). Fascinating music. Good battle system (if only too easy for my tastes, even on the hardest). Decent rpg skills system, not without a flaws, but - fair enough.So, generally - it's good. Not excellent, but good. Like 7/10 in my book.Although. I love Shadowrun, and I would give the game more - just for good revival - if only they would made Matrix better. That's a major disengage for me in the whole game. They just did another field for shootouts in the Matrix, not anything near hacking. I've played many interpretations of Shadowrun, and that game made almost everything fine - but ruined cyberspace. It's like making a remake of ""Singin' in the Rain"" movie without actually singing in the process.Think I'll go and play some blues now.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a decently capable game and most of all is a good start. It will be interesting to see where the game ends up, as the game comes bundled with an editor allowing for a lot of potential from the community making Shadowrun Returns a game that is likely going to grow a lot over time. The current module, The Dead Man’s Switch, is an okay experience which is sadly awfully limited in story decisions and suffers from many little oversights and rough flaws such as underwhelming AI and a lack of simple quality of life systems such as manual saving, but does contain excellent writing that incorporates much of the interesting universe without overwhelming newcomers.As such, the potential is definitly there and what it currently contains will be entertaining and fun to go through for the RPG fan, but it isn’t anything that will happily surprise you or amaze you in any way. If you are looking for a decent RPG with good writing and a solid amount of abilities and skills to choose from, Shadowrun Returns is an easy recommendation. Full review:

												Hoi chummers! Welcome to Shadowrun Returns. This game has a wealth of content to explore, including full campaigns in Seattle (Dead Man's Switch) and Berlin (Dragonfall). After you finish the professionally made campaigns, try out more free content on Steam Workshop. You can also write your own stories in the Editor, kind of like using Legos. There is a large and welcoming community of fellow players and content creators and we hope you enjoy the game!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a turn-based cyberpunk themed strategy R.P.G. developed by Harebrained Schemes and published by Harebrained Holdings. Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical roleplaying game. The year is 2054 and magic has returned to the world awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend as technology merges with flesh and consciousness. As a shadowrunner, you're a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. Shadowrun Returns harkens back to the classic old school roleplaying games from back in the day. The top-down isometic view, intense turn-based combat and non-voiced dialogue of a traditional R.P.G. are expertly blended in this fantastic indie title from Harebrained Holdings. The story is divided into campaigns which can range from solving murders to battling corporate espionage and a number of other different situations and once you've finished the games main storyline you can download new user created campaigns from the Steam Workshop or the Nexus which further extends the replayability of this great title.Besides the excellent story, the turn-based combat of course is one of the best features of this game. Progressing through the narrative will reward you with experience points and allow you to grow your character in any direction that you choose. Want to summon spirits as an elven shaman, be an expert hacker or go guns and blade ablazing as a Street Samurai? The choice is up to you. As the leader of the group, it's also up to you to choose the right balance of combat, tech and magical abilities in order to have a successful run. The gripping tactical combat system is quick and responsive and just a fun alternative to the combat of today's more popular roleplaying games.Graphically the game looks terrific in full high definition with its futuristic cyberpunk setting. The environments are also quite varied as you will travel from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations and beyond. The character portraits presented during conversations have a unique style that lends itself well to this title and I find the isometric backgrounds and set pieces delightful to view. One of my favorite things about these types of games are the small details in the world around you and this title is chock full of them and add to that some excellent sound effects and a terrific musical score and Shadowrun Returns delivers big time. If you're a R.P.G. fan looking for something a little different to add to your library or just enjoy old-school or retro games then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Shadowrun Returns! You will not be dissapointed with this title.			"

												A huge disappointment.  I was really looking forward to this game since it showed up on Kickstarter.  Fallout 1 & 2 are among my favorite games ever, and this was touted as a return to that style of RPG.  It...isn't.I find the combat enjoyable.  It's basically a simplified version of XCOM:  Enemy Unknown.  One problem with it is that once combat starts, it doesn't end until you move to another map, even if there are no enemies around.  So after a fight ends, you'll have to move your party through the map in turn-based mode until you get to an exit.The story is good by video game standards.  You receive a recorded message from an old friend who's been murdered and are tasked with tracking down his killer.  For the most part, dialogue is well-written.  There's no voice acting, which some may take issue with, but it allows for more robust dialogue.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't take advantage of that benefit.The game is extraordinarily linear.  There's exactly one path through the story.  A handful of situations where you may be able to get from point A to point B by a slightly different route exist (i.e., bluff your way past a guard vs. hacking through an unguarded door), but these are so few and so insignificant that they don't make any real difference overall.  Dialogue is pretty much the same no matter what:  Ask about story-related stuff, ask about general backround/setting information.  Very little opportunity to employ your character's personality.Sidequests are almost nonexistent, and the few that the game does have are simple ""go over there and get me that thing,"" or ""while you're on this run, see if you can find a thing I want"" sorts of things.The whole game is designed entirely around mobile devices and it suffers for it.  The UI is a bit clunky and unintuitive for PC, limited to what would work on a touch-based interface.  The save system is simply unacceptable.  The game has no manual save option.  Not even a save and quit function.  It's entirely based on reaching checkpoints.  This is supposed to be fixed with the DLC scheduled for January 2014, but until then, if you screw up a fight at the end of a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  Have to leave before you finish a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  As I understand it, this is because the game cannot save the current map state, which explains some of the linearity.  When you return to a location, you're actually loading a completely different map of the location with its own triggers, different versions of NPCs with dialogue appropriate to that point in the story, etc.  This means that the player can't affect any change in the game as every change or combination of changes to a location would require its own unique map, and I'm not even sure if the game is able to load different versions of the same map based on variables.I can't really speak to the user-generated content as I haven't used the editor or played any user-made campaigns yet, but from what I've heard from those who have, the editor is very, very limited in what it can do.  As a result, a lot of people who were planning on making content for the game have given up.Maybe the upcoming DLC will improve the editor, maybe (probably) it won't.  Either way, I wouldn't suggest paying more than about $5 for Shadowrun Returns.			"

												Shadowrun is an RPG set in a future version of Earth where Elves, Orcs and magic exist. It has a strong story, involving murder investigations, corporate espionage and supernatural rituals. There are many interesting NPCs and good dialogue choices, although sadly no voice acting. The stats/skills level up system has some nice depth, and some stats can influence dialogue options. Combat is like Xcom, turn based with a squad of 4, with action points to spend on moving, firing guns or using items/magic. Some squad members are hired temporarily before each quest, have no dialogue, and you can't customise their stats/gear, so unfortunately they lack personality. Levels are small and the whole game is quite linear, with not much scope for exploration. But the campaign lasts around 11 hours so value for money is good. The music is fantastic and really adds to the atmosphere. Although some things could be improved, its still very enjoyable and well worth checking out.Review update: DragonfallDragonfall takes the formula established in the original release, and improves on it in several ways. Its actually misleading to describe this as ""DLC"". These days, particularly in the RPG genre, that term conjures up thoughts of short quests and meaningless item packs. Dragonfall is more like the good old days of expansion packs, where you got a meaty chunk of gameplay to sink your teeth into.The story is excellent, one of the best I've played through in any game for quite some time. The action has shifted to Berlin, where you've joined a crew of shadowrunners on a contract to extract some data from a vault. Predictably, the mission goes wrong, dragging you into another deep conspiracy full of twists and turns, that also helps to explain more of the world's lore.Because your crew are fully fleshed out characters, instead of the original's mostly hired help, each character has much more depth to their personality. They have a past, they have feelings, and the story is given increased emotional weight through conversations with these characters.The gameplay mechanics, tactical turn based combat, and level up system all remain intact, and we now have the ability to save anywhere, rather than being limited to the original's checkpoint only system. Quest structure is less linear than before. You have some control over which order to play certain quests, and most quests have optional objectives that, if completed, provide greater (or alternate) rewards. You'll also have some tough moral choices to consider which affect quest outcomes, and many areas allow for the use of non combat skills, including talking your way past guards or hacking computers to gain information.Dragonfall took me 19 hours to complete, which is significantly longer than the original game, and represents excellent value for money at full price. I don't recall encountering any bugs at all.Overall Dragonfall is amazing, and I rate it as an absolute MUST BUY.			"

												My last reccomendation was unfair to the development team. I overlooked the fact that this game was pumped out by a minimal staff in a very short deadline, so I'm going to re-write my assessment.Boring, clunky, and linear. This game has great concepts behind it, but is not executed well. The storyline might be a fascinating read, but does not engage the player at all. The best scripted fight, the last fight of the game about 8 hours in, is almost as fun as the prologue of Neverwinter Nights. Almost.My biggest complaint is with the story, but the game has potential to give the community what they are thirsty for. I'm not overly impressed with the graphics, and I really wished I could have changed angles from the point of view on the field, but for the most part the combat and character navigation is easy enough to manage. The equipment is very simple, though not explained well (*cough cybernetics cough*), and you don't have to put much thought into micro-managing your character or your hire-by-mission squadmates. It's impossible to get attached to characters as they're just a portrait to represent the mathhammer you wield as the gamer.I did really like the etiquitte aspect to your character. The game gives you more conversation options if you have a higher Charisma stat, and with a higher Charisma you learn new jargon by which to speak with the appropriate factions (ie shadowrunners, security, corporate, or gang). Unfortunately, the dialogue is still linear and it only provides introductory ports for the equifinality of the storyline.Pros: cheap, potential for community contribution, non-demanding of hardware, neat concepts.Cons: easy, impersonal, clunky, and inconsequential.4/10			"

This is the order in which I suggest you to play the Shadowrun Returns games in order to fully enjoy the experience : Shadowrun Returns > Shadowrun: Dragonfall > Shadowrun: Hong Kong > Shadowrun ReturnsReplaying Shadowrun Returns last will allow you to really enjoy it, since going through the 2 others will allow you to better know the game's story and gameplay.

As of now it's just a cyber space with the same mechanics of the real world, just with different weapons and enemies.Little tips to new-comers: don't spend your karma points until you know what type of mission you're about to face, don't spend all of your money and make use of allies' items first of all.

Buying this game is like buying the books fro a Table-Top-RPG, youinvest upfront so that you can play mulple home-brew stories later. By the end of it, you will want to tryto build a character that can't be completed in just one run of the game, and since you can't replay the base campain with the same character... you do the math.I give it an 8/10, worth your time, chummer.

Short version: 76%Harebrained Schemes made a nice but not too spectacular attempt at adapting the rules of the original Shadowrun game books in a video game format. The end product is a bit simple but still enjoyable, medium-length turn-based tactical combat RPG in a great cyberpunk setting.Long version:Whenever pen-and-paper RPG rules are adapted in video game format, the results are always unpredictable. In the case of Shadowrun Returns though, there was no risk involved: one of the original creators of the Shadowrun universe leads Harebrained Schemes, the studio behind this game.On the flipside, the developers pretty much assumed that those who will play this game are already familiar enough with the setting. While this lack of handholding can be refreshing, it may scare away a few people who won’t have the patience to delve into the depths of the game mechanics.And learning is an important part, since Shadowrun Returns is an almost purely tactical combat RPG. There are plenty of dialogues and datalogs to read, but they have very little influence on the events; the bulk of the game is spent on the turn-based combat levels.Said levels try to offer many different layouts, settings, and even enemy types, but they lack in variety when it comes to approach. Out of all the possible classes, deckers (hackers) have incredibly limited roles on a handful of runs, and magic or hand-to-hand feel underpowered compared to a simple-as-a-stick assault rifle wielding warrior. (Not to mention that one mission will force the player to use a specific weapon type, even if they have zero points in that skill.)Some of these unbalances can be corrected with a good party, but by limiting the player in choices, one still cannot help but feel as if this game is only good as a first attempt, nothing more—which would be correct, as the later entries will open up a much wider world…			"

												One of the first big Kickstarted franchise releases, Shadowrun Returns had a great deal to live up to. Not only did it carry the torch for the next generation of crowd-funded games, it was also the first title in several years for a much beloved franchise. A sequel of sorts to the very well-regarded SNES title, Shadowrun Returns revisits the grungy streets of Seattle 2054, an urban wasteland controlled by mega-corporations, into which magic has re-awakened, and a variety of meta-human races have re-emerged. You play as a Shadow Runner, a sort of special agent for hire who offers their skills out to anyone willing to pay the right price. In this case, you’re contacted by an old buddy who wants you to hunt down a murderer. His own in fact.The campaign that comes with Shadowrun is being touted as a sort of sample story to inspire modders to create their own stories, but honestly it’s of sufficient quality that it justifies a purchase on its own. Dropping enough hints and allusions to the greater Shadowrun fiction to get hardcore fans salivating, it tells a standalone tale full of double-crosses, femme fatales, duplicitous corporations and shady cults that immerses newcomers in the world without bombarding them with unnecessary exposition and world detail.One of the great joys of the setting is the clash between familiar fantasy and cyberpunk tropes. Traditional fantasy races and concepts like mages and elves exist alongside mega-corporations and streetwise hackers, struggling to survive in the lawless urban wasteland. Over-familiarity with basic conventions is a common problem in fantasy, so it’s intriguing to visit a universe where that predictability has been largely removed. Although, unsurprisingly, elves remain pompous, haughty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥even in Shadowrun. It’s a world that feels both vibrant and entropic, colourful and bleak, and it’s brought to life through a vibrant and consistent art style. Character art stays just on the right side of cartoonish, each portrait giving you a sense of the character while allowing your imagination, and the excellent dialogue, to fill in the rest. Hulking trolls and lithe, graceful elves scamper about on a lush selection of neon-lit cyberpunk cityscapes, while the rain pours down and shreds of newspaper and cigarette packets are scattered by the wind. The thumping background score completes the sense of immersion. It’s genuinely one of the most visually stylish games released in 2013.While the visuals do their part to set the scene, it’s the writing and storytelling that really sell the setting. Characters are understandably painted in rather broad strokes, but they still feel believable and likeable, from your hard-bitten buddy Coyote to the streetwise Jake Armitage (think a ginger Han Solo with a penchant for sleeping in morgue trays) and the politically astute troll bouncer Mr. Kluwe. Even negotiations with background NPC’s feel real. Thugs and gangsters speak in an unfamiliar street cant, peppering each sentence with baroque and occasionally impenetrable slang. Grab a rank or two in the charisma stat and you can select an ‘etiquette’, essentially giving your character a familiarity within one of the social strata that make up the Shadowrun world, from high-flying socialites to street-level hustlers. Your character’s possible dialogue responses are also really great, allowing for a range of deadpan cynicism and/or colourful insults.The focus on one small cabal of runners is a great idea, as each character gets their moment in the spotlight, and the sense of a dysfunctional family of scoundrels is well developed over the course of the game. There’s even a surprisingly deft and touching final scene. While the main plot itself loses a little character in the final third, and there’s relatively few chances to dramatically affect the flow of the story, on the whole it’s an enjoyable adventure with a couple of nice twists and some dastardly villains to take down. Hopefully developers Harebrained Schemes will serve up some more adventures with this bunch of miscreants and rogues.When you head out to crack some heads, Shadowrun Returns offers a deep and satisfying turn-based combat system. Everything revolves around ‘action points’, which govern exactly how many moves you can make in combat. Firing a single shot from your pistol might take up one point, while carefully zeroing in on an ork thug’s eyeball takes two – the former frees you up to move into cover, while the latter eats up your movement but increases the chance of a critical hit. Adding to the mix are various abilities from different skill trees. While this is essentially a classless game, meaning you can build your character however you like, for new players it’s advisable to stick to one of the pre-arranged packages, which range from spell-slinging mages to riggers, who take the Robot Wars approach to combat by using controllable drones. You can branch out of your chosen package at any time if you fancy dipping into weapon skills or even grabbing some cyber-warfare skills. Jack into the matrix as a ‘decker’ and you’ll find you can circumvent some of the detective work you might otherwise be forced to do.Each play-style has a few unique tricks for you to discover in the heat of battle. Mages can find lay-lines of magical power, that if stood on increase the efficiency of their spells. Shamans can instead spot hidden elemental spirits that can be summoned into a fight. In one of Shadowrun‘s best combat features, controlling a spirit becomes a dangerous game of risk and reward. You can invest your summon with up to four action points, making them extremely dangerous in a fight. Charging them up too much, however, increases the likelihood that they can break free, leaving you with one incredibly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off fire elemental to deal with in addition to the other twelve ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Riggers can use their robot buddies to flank enemies through conveniently placed vents, allowing you to both scout ahead and get the drop on guards. My only qualm is that sound effects don’t quite carry the punch of the rest of the audio design. Some more weighty gunshots and spell effects would be welcome.Since Shadowrun is all about disparate operatives coming together for well-paid but dangerous missions, it makes sense that before each mission you can select your team. Contacts in your base of operations provide a list of agents covering each class, as well as some more unique multiclass characters. You pay a certain amount to each runner to get them in your squad, with some of the more devastating operatives only available to those with sufficient cash. It’s a nice touch that encourages careful selection,as each runner possesses their own load-out which may or may not mesh with your needs. However, the lack of customisation seems like a missed opportunity, as Shadowrun seems tailor-made for the same kind of attachment you had to your X-Com: Enemy Unknown commandos.Bugs seem largely non-existent, apart from the occasional grammatical mistake buried deep in the text. Despite these relatively minor imperfections, however, Harebrained Schemes have done a bang-up job with Shadowrun Returns. Interfaces are clean, slick and, despite inventory management being slightly awkward due to the need to keep cycling unused items back and forth to your stash, generally intuitive.Shadowrun Returns exceeded my every expectation. It is by far the best title in the franchise since the 16-bit era. Shadowrun fans and RPG enthusiasts who loved the late-'90s isometric games should definitely check it out.			"

												I love the Shadowrun universe, so I was pretty excited about the kickstart campaing and the eventual release of this game. As an old school gamer, my gaming history is based on games like Fallout(1&2), Shadowrun(original), XCOM(originals) and many other genre-defining legends, my expectations were pretty high I must confess.Once I finished the game (about 10h or so) I couldnt believe that it was over, it felt like something was missing.It was the realization that the experience I hoped for was never going to be delivered.The game is not a total waste but it's tremendously shallow, as linear as it can possibly be.Character creation doesnt feel deep enough: generic 3D models, character photos that do not represent your model, lack of customization, lack of classes information...During the course of the game you do not interact with the game-world but with overlays on it, you will never go up or down a stair, you interact with the overlay near the stair and then you go up or down.Leveling up feels boring, most of the time you don't feel like getting stronger. Also the possibility to wait for a stat check barrier (the game tells what values are needed) to spend your karma points feels really sad.All around It's an excessively minimalist game: graphical engine, art, interface, world, combat, skills, progression... everything.If it was a mobile game it would've been a fair accomplishment, but at this point in gaming history, a ""return"" to Shadowrun universe as a PC game shouldn't have looked like this.This game lacks depth for a Shadowrun universe PC game.Two good aspects of the game though:- story: Does a good job immersing you on the plot.- content creating community: The level editor and the content created by the community can keep you entertained if you happen to like the game. The community made a lot of other adventures for you to run if you wish.For me, that is not enough and, most importantly, not what I was looking for on this ""return"".For people with high expectations as mine I cannot recommend this game.

												Huge oversight on the design of this game, is that noncombat ""skill checks"" for interacting with the environment can only be done by your character.What this means is, say you have three hired mercenaries on your team.  One of them is the ""hacker"" role.  You go to a computer in a noncombat situation, and want to hack it.  You have no hack skill, but the hacker merc you hired has plenty of hacker skill level to break into the computer.  But the game doesn't let your use your hacker to open the computer - only YOUR character's hack skill is checked.  So, there is NO reason to hire a hacker, since they can't be used to hack in noncombat situations.  Utterly stupid.  If you don't take the hacker role for your character, you literally have NO ability to hack outside of combat situations, since your hacker mercearies can only hack in combat.  Thus, hacker mercs are pretty terrible. There's things like Strength checks too.  Like, your character is not strong enought to move a fridge, but the troll you hired has enough to move it.  But again, it's not combat, so your troll can't help you.  WTF.AND THERE'S SO MANY BUGS!  Scripted events fail to trigger, game freezes, can't progress in missions...Sloppy.NOTE:  The later sequels, Dragonfall and Hong Kong, have fixed the hacking oversight.			"

												This is a rpg game in a world where fantasy and technology mix perfectly.  If you enjoy androids, giant insects, cyberpunk, guns, and are a fan of ""Blade Runner"", you will enjoy the odd characters and turn based combat. If you enjoy reading narrative instead of hearing it, this is for you.			"

												This game has one official story, and it is pretty linear. You can complete the full campaign within hours, and there are no official post-game contents.The battle system is turn-based, grid-like strategy fight. You control up to 4 players, and fight againts enemies either by using guns, melee weapons, or spells. The battle itself isn't hard to understand, but it is very challenging if you are playing harder difficulties with an unprepared party.The main character is very customizable, it takes my first playthru a lot of times struggling on how to develop my character. However, after one playthru, I find the customization choice is pretty unnecessary, since you can always hire a full team of balanced shadowrunners to do all the work.The story or dialogue choices make very little difference to the plot, most of the time they just affect the next NPC sentence and that's all.The plot is interesting and fit in the game setting pretty well.Glitches still happens to me in this game, most of them forces me to restart the game and lose less than 20 minutes of playtime since the last checkpoint. But so far nothing game-breaking.I was a huge fan of the SEGA Genesis version. This game gives me some nostalgia because of the character and plot setting, but the gameplay itself is very disappointing. So I have a mixed feeling for this game.The game on itself is pretty decent, but it kinda ruins the impression I have for the franchise. In my opinion, this game is pretty good for players who are new to this franchise, but it is a disappointment for old fans.I wish this game have achievements.My Score: 6/10			"

												I played the classic on the SNES back in the day and only lasted 10 minutes before dying. No matter what I did, I died. I thought Shadowrun Returns might be as deadly as the original, but (thankfully) it wasn't.Shadowrun Returns looks amazing, and from the first moment it makes you wonder just what lies ahead in this strange cyberpunk world. The inviting world teasing you to explore and uncover the truths behind the deadman who wants you to find his killer, however... it never really got there.Don't get me wrong - the various maps look amazing, but there's little to them other than being a very impressive backdrop. There's no real reward for exploring, and the various NPCs that litter the sidewalks aren't much more than fancy decoration on an already good looking cake. Perhaps I was asking too much for this to be a deeply engrossing world, yet in a way it is an engrossing world thanks to the storytelling.What you are going to get in Shadowrun Returns is a great story, and for some it might even be too text heavy (especially if English isn't your native language). However, I enjoyed it, the story is basically a detective novel as you try to uncover the mystery of who killed your friend. The catch being the client is the deadman himself, which is great and is a nice nod to the old film noir movies of old.It's due to how well the story is written I can forgive it for being very linear with almost no plot trees or divergence due to your actions or selections that I noticed.In fact, that seems to be the theme of the game. It's a very well presented world, with a very well written story, but just seems to lack a little spice. There's very little loot, there's very little to explore, the skill tree looks rather impressive, but doesn't seem grab you at all. The same with character creation.I don't want to come across as overly negative with the game, as I really did enjoy what was offered, yet I feel like it could have offered so much more. Again, perhaps I'm demanding too much from what is already a very well presented game. On the plus side it has Steam Workshop intergration and there seems to be a host of community mods and projects underway, so a host of new content should just be around the corner. Likewise the developers have released DLC, which seemingly adds another layer to the game (perhaps that's what I'm looking for?). In short, a very solid game and a welcome return for Shadowrun, but it's not as brutal as the original and perhaps lacks that little something extra to make it a true great. Enjoy the detective story.			"

												While it could have been great, the game is simply flawed with the save system.I played Shadowrun in the late eighties, early nineties, and this game reminded me well known emotions during half an hour, after it was lost. Too few items, too few weapons, too little roleplaying.  "

												If you were to cross Bladerunner with The Dresden Files into a quality tactical strategy RPG hybrid, the result would no doubt be something very akin to Shadowrun Returns. Shadowrun Returns excels at story telling, the game is rich with lore, well written dialogues that feel more conversational than what most games accomplish, and a structured story full of plot twists and interesting characters. Perhaps my favorite point about the story is that it starts out small-scale, you are on a simple mission to look into the death of a friend, but it slowly ramps up into something larger as the story progresses. To top it off the game is set in a beautiful futuristic game world and has solid tactical gameplay to boot.More than anything this game to me was about an awesome sci-fi detective story. The mystery and intrigue suck you in, the stellar writing especially in regards to dialogue keeps you hooked. I'm not saying the game mimics what street talk may actually be like in the future, but it was great enough to get me immersed in the street life of futuristic Seattle. The characters within the game range from annoying (intentionally so), charming, grumpy, and likeable; chatting with the regulars throughout the story and going through the different chat options was something I enjoyed doing (shout out to Mr. Kluwe, you're the man, man!). The game's audio and visuals do justice to this story, bringing it to life with stunning hand drawn environments and appropriately mood setting music.The game's combat also leaves little to be desired. Although I felt the large scale management of the game to be a little inconsistent...for example the money you earn throughout the story can go into temporary lulls, and if you need to do a mission when you aren't expecting it you may find you don't have enough money to buy a full team of mercs. The game runs similar to most other tactical RPG games, especially similar to the XCOM series. You use the terrain to your advantage and in a turn based fashion you move your team about and order them to attack or use utility items/spells. On hard the game isn't terribly difficult and you shouldn't have to think deeply each turn on how to best arrange your team and how to best utilize there action points (how many actions they can take per turn). The combat is a bit sparse at the beginning of the game but as you progress further you start to battle the baddies more often and that's when the fun starts.Shadowrun Returns is a solid tactical RPG game, and with the addition of the Steam workshop can keep you playing well beyond the twelve hour campaign. The game's story is strong and the characters within are fun ones. It's nice to play a detective style game that isn't a point and click for a change. The game is quite gripping and just like any good detective novel it kept me at the edge of my seat until I got through to the end.			"

 Never trust people who you cant punch. Especially if they are already dead. Shadowrun Returns  is linear story-driven game with turn-based combat. You are a mercenary in a sci-fi world that also got few drops of magic and your goal is to find the murder of a friend of yours. Story and Writing The story plot is generic: You are called by your friend who was recently murdered and you have to find his murder. On the way you gonna meet other runners and people that will show you that there is more than meet the eye.Even with the generic plot, the writing is solid and often you see that there are several approaches in a conversation that is based on your stats and etiquette. But dont worry if you cant talk your way out, few bullets can do the same or maybe a few slashes or fireballs. Combat The combat in Shadowrun Returns is turn-based with Action Points and cover. If you played X-Com : Enemy Unknown , the combat will be old friend of yours if not then you will be in luck since combat is simple enough to learn but it can be hard to master.  First thing first : being melee you are allowed to walk and attack with 1 action point( more if the target is far away) while for range you cant run and gun. Instead  you will want to get in cover before you start spreading love/bullets/magic. If you arent fan of direct attacks you can instead use drones/spirit to do the dirty job. We should not forget and the AoE skills mainly because there is friendly fire so you have to be careful when you use them. Especially if there is low hit chance because if it misses, the AoE will hit somewhere near the targeted zone.Cover is mainly to reduce the chance to be hit but at times it may seem broken . Once I went behind a target that was in cover and my hit chance got reduced(in pointblank range) which was weird.Once you are familiar with meat-world combat you will have to encounted and the Matrix which can be accessed only by deckers . Combat in the matrix is the same but you use different skills and death in the Matrix means disconnect and damage to your real self. Equipment Thats one area which lacks content. While you have on your hands several kind of gear to use, you will find that there isnt much variety in it and you will just look for the higher numbers.First you have your outfit that provides armor and bonuses to different stats. Then you have your weapons melee/range/drones/ spells , Then you have slots for skills and last but not least you have consumables : medkit, revival kits,grenades , spirits.If you arent fan of using spells/magic then you will be glad to upgrade yourself with cyberware. Cyberware provides you with improved stats at the cost of your essence(the ability to use spells) which is a fair trade if you count on melee or range weapons.But still Equipment pool is lacking a lot. Character Customizatin Here we are with the best part of this game. I mean what is an RPG without a decent character customization , huh?While you can pick one of the 5 premade classes you are better off with making your own class and the customization deliver just that. There are 6 main stats : Body, Quickness(Agility), Strength , Intelligence , Willpower and Charisma. And each one of them got different branches that offer different skills(only Body doesnt have any those since its mainly to increase your HP). Quickness is important for your range gunners . It allows you to spend points on different gun types : Pistol,Shotgun, SMG and Rifle. It also let you increase your points in dodge which makes you harder to hit with physical attacks. It also allows you to specific actions in a conversation.Strength is important for your brawlers because it let you spend points on close combat : melee weapons or unarmed.In the same tree you will find and the throwable stats. And just like quickness, you can pick unique options during a dialogue.Intelligence is important for your techwizards: hackers or drone users. Hackers are useful when you are investigating because you will often find hackable objects that provides useful information. Also only Hackers(deckers) can enter the Matrix to provide you with extra information. Drone users on the other hand will be able to use higher level drones . On top of that Intelligence also contain the Biotech branch that increases the amount of HP you recover with medkits. And just like the other stats you are given unique dialogue options every now and then.Willpower is the main stats for mages. Increasing it will allow you to equip more and better spells. It also increases the chance to hit with them.Charisma is the main stats for spirit users and sweet talkers. Its most helpful if you try to talk your way out of a situation. It also allows you to have different etiquettes.Its worth noting that different races got different limit on some stats, And a friendly advice from me : Never try to be a Jack of all trades because there arent enough Karma points to let you do that. Instead focus on 2 stats and let other shadowrunners fill the weak spots(yes you can hire other runners on some missions). All in all is a solid game if you want to play a decent RPG nowadays. Often there will be different roads in solving a problem so its worth exploring and see the one way that fits you  "

												Note: this is for the base game without DLC/Dragonfall.I've never played a turn-based strategy combat RPG or whatever kind of game this is, before, so I didn't know what to expect. The gameplay mechanics felt so-so when I started. I played for like 30 minutes , gave up, then picked it up again a month or two later. Strategy isn't my forte so I was hesitant to crank the difficulty up for a challenge, it already felt frustrating to miss shots and then have to wait for things to happen during enemy turns. I got used to it after a couple hours, as I learned the game more and generally got smarter about what to do. I upgraded my opinion of the game play to ""yeah that seems alright then.""The class/karma point system is pretty interesting and I had fun toying with that. The decking/hacking bits were cool and I wish there were a lot more of those scenes/levels. Be wary if you go for a rigger build, there are a couple points in the game where glitches are possible to encounter, you'll have to unequip your drones to progress and it felt kinda sad considering that's the whole point of the build I wanted. The story is also very linear, I think there's only one optional mission you can do that diverges from the main plot.It's a 2d isometric game, so if you're not into that sort of retro style you may not like it. I thought it was gorgeous, and along with story-telling and the slang it was really easy to feel immersed and taken away by the plot. There's no voice acting, only text with pre-written options (of varying personalities) of your character's reply. After a couple hours of playing I didn't want to stop because I wanted to see what would happen next. The story and atmosphere are A+ for me and I plan on buying the new game solely based on that. There's a decently sized mod community as well. I haven't played any yet but I have a few user made campaigns to try out soon that seem worthwhile.			"

Shadowrun Returns is a isometric tactical RPG. In a dystopian future, where dormant elf, orc and troll genes reemerged in the population, where immortal dragons run mega-corporations that control the world, mercenaries run the shadows to do everyone else’s dirty work with the use of guns, magic and technologies. They call themselves Shadowrunners. This review takes into account the free Dragonfall DLC released later after the game.Pros: The first module, called Dead Man’s Switch, is a nice although straightforward introduction to players who aren’t familiar with the game and explores the Seattle setting. The second module, called Dragonfall, offers a lot more character development and additional flexibility and options to complete any given quest, all while exploring the anarchy-governed flux-state of Berlin. The game backgrounds are gorgeous hand-drawn stills, added with the techno-trance music gives the game an eerie atmosphere, each building and object seemingly having a story of its own to tell, while the music adjust to combat scenes before slowing down once you’re back from it. The game progression is straightforward, the skills are broken down into skill trees with a clear view of what you get from raising any attributes or skill. There is no set character class, although you have pre-generated archetypes you can start from. Cons: The story is somewhat linear, most of all in Dead Man’s Switch, where choice will change the dialog but not the outcome of the story. General graphics aren’t on par with the AAA industry, so anyone looking for graphical realism will be sorely disappointed. There is no voice acting, so get ready to read a lot if you want to have any hopes of feeling involved in the story. The two modules which happen at the same time, aren’t related to each other, so there is no progression from one to the other, and are both somewhat quick to play through.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youLet’s judge the game for what it is: a crowdfunded indie game (the success story that put Kickstarter on the map for many people) meant to be used as an engine for the modding community, community that has been very active at creating new stories, new equipment, new world object for other modders, and is using the engine in new and creative ways. As you play, you can feel the richness of the game’s tabletop RPG heritage, and you just wish you could learn more about that world. It is fun, it is well worth the money and time, and it’s definitively a game I recommend!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Oh. My. Goodness. What an amazing game that I've stashed for thus long. I were not a big fan of cyberpunk, but the atmosphere  of the game was well articulated, as I didn't feel uncomfortable. The story is immensive, well-written and intriguing. The combat (as well as navigation around the map) resembles highly XCOM, which is tactic-intensive. Some cons: it would be better if voice is added to the main campaign. The total silent during the conversations breaks immersion a lot. The skill tree looked very intimidating to me as a newcomer to the series. Finally instead of a ""comprehensive guide"", an integrated tutorial would be a huge help (albeit basic navigation/ combat was as simple as point and click, some profession-specific capabilities were not straightforward). Overall it is a great game, and I recommend it to anyone who like RPG with turn-based combat.			"

												Mediocrity is the word that best describes this game. Its art style is really charming, but only in screenshots.The combat is made of a fixed number of battles in the campaign, wich are not hard, not easy, but neither do they require strategic thinking. The tutorial is also really bad, only by the end of the game you'll get to understand what some type of characters do. The story is pretty simple, but the included campaign lasts more than it should. I often thought the game was gonna end after one battle, only to be surprised by villains who always run away and another few pointless quests.I should note that the game also lets you create your own campaigns, a feature I didn't use. It might be interest for someone.			"

												I got this free from a great friend!The original ShadowRun. I really enjoyed this remake of this game. Actually, to be technical this is a remake of a remake. The 1st game was on NES ..there was also a game on the Xbox, but it did not pan out and was not a rpg.Anyways, this is a great example of a rpg done correctly. If i can make a suggestion, this is not the remastered version and they are different...feel free to play this version before that one...but the remastered version might be better..i have yet to play it though.This game has a great storyline and has multiple paths to different endings. Any rpg that has multiple endings is great in my book.One other thing, probably one of the best uses of kickstarter was this game. They promised stuff and they pan it out.Anyways, recommended alot for great rpg mechanics and storyline.			"

												To write a review about this game (orginal dead man switch campaign) is really difficult for me. On the one hand the game is not bad and on the other hand I can't recommend it to someone who expects an RPG. Many aspects of this game are good and are a solid foundation for an RPG but the campaign is way to limited for an recommendation+ The Charactersystem: It allows lots of different builds. Unfortunately they are not balanced and some skills won't be needed too much. + The interface: It was created to also work on touchpads so it can feel a bit ""clunky"". However I did not have any problems navigating the menus.- The save system: The game only saves on the beginning of a map. This can be annoying but it is not the reason why I can't recommend the game to RPG gamers. - The story/campaign: This is the my main problem with the game. It is way too linear. Don't get me wrong the story is good in introducing the world too you but all the time when I played the game I thought: ""Surely after the next mission I will have more freedom to explore the world, have some more banter with companions or get better gear"" In my opinion the story ends to fast, dialogues with the few interesting NPCs is very limited, no decisions which could affect the story... well the important stuff besides a good character system.+ The graphics: I liked the graphics the only bad thing: The resolution-settings: define how far you can zoom into the game. Long story short: The base game itself is good but I can't recommend the game with the ""dead mans switch""-campaign. I hope I can recommend the game after the release of the next (dlc) campaign because as I said the game is not entirely bad it just needs a good official campaign.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a throwback to the days of old, which feels absolutely fresh in this modern era. This takes me back to the golden era of RPG's in the mid-to-late 1990's - which was back when RPG's were often isometric; turn-based; party-based; and used a mixture of both 2D + 3D environments + character models. If this sounds like something that would be up your alley - you likely have already have purchased SrR (Shadowrun Returns) or should buy this game ASAP. Shadowrun Returns is simply nothing short of fantastic.Shadowrun Returns (base-game) comes equipped with ""Dead Man's Switch"" for its base-game's single-player campaign. You play a runner (whose class, if you want to pick one; race, class, skills, etc can be determined by you) whose friend recently died. Actually, he was murdered. Your job is to find who is responsible, why, and decide what to do about the matter. It seems that our friend is linked to a bunch of strange murders that have being happening in this futuristic mix of both a cyberpunk setting (futuristic world where corporations, computers, hacking + whatnot are all par for the course) + fantasy elements (elves + dwarves are here; and magic can all take place in this game-world here). And that's just the start of things - so, that I don't spoil everything.One thing that absolutely sets SrR apart from many other modern-day games - there is just no voice-acting. It's not that this game needs voice-acting, either. This is one of the best written games I've seen in years, feeling like a throwback to the days of Planescape: Torment (late 90's). This game is not just a great game, but it also so happens to be a great book to read. You'll be doing plenty of reading here. The prose, dialogue & characters are absolutely excellent - littered with tons of description + is extremely verbose. If you've been missing games to be littered w/ tons of description when characters actually do things, since graphics do plenty of the talking these days - you're in for a treat here with SrR, since the writing here is excellent.While the graphical quality will certainly not top the technical aspect of the most recent hardware-pushing graphical show - the direction of the graphics are excellent. The artistic direction game is loaded with tons of style + substance - with its excellent 2D + 3D mixture of graphics. This feels like a modern-day revival of games from the Infinity Engine.Combat feels very similar to the classic Fallout 1 + 2. You have a limited number Action Points that you can use spend to do attacks or moves. The combat of this game is quite tactical + turn-based. It always feels great, sounds great, and is a lot of fun to take on. Some of the most interesting + fun battles take place when some of your party members are in the literal game-world, while other party members might be in the computer-world matrix - where you'll be balancing doing combat on two different fronts. Nothing short of awesome.Most of this game's campaign is a linear affair, where you also might have a few side-quests here and there on your way. This is not an open-world game, by any means. Not that it needs to be, either - as the game often stays very focused on its excellent story, game-world, settings, and characters. Here and there, you'll be given a few different ways to solve quests - which can be be done or result differently, all based on your stats, skills & whatnot.Shadowrun Returns is a fantastic throwback to the 1990's era of RPG's, if it was just made with modern graphics + high-resolution support. Gamers that have been wanting a high-quality turn-based RPG where you control an entire party entirely - look no further. If you've wanted superb prose, dialogue, and writing - look no further than SrR. If having this great ""Dead Man's Switch"" campaign (which took me around 16 hours or so to finish) wasn't enough - this game has the Editor come with it. SrR is on the Steam WorkShop and there are a good deal of mods + campaigns made by gamers out there. Being given such a great campaign + an editor here - is there more that old-school RPG gamers can really ask for here? Grade = A.			"

												Rating: 8.5/10What is it?Turn based RPG set in a cyberpunk setting. The Good+ Great story and dialogue options + Great character development, you can choose between a variety of different types to fit any playstyle. Brawler, weapon specialist, hacker, drone control, mage, shaman etc... Different stats determine how good you are in each ability.+ Fun combat. Its turn based so strategy is involved in how you develop your character but also your party members. Combat is also fast paced. + Lots of spells, weapons and armor to further customize your characters + Easy to learn game mechanics. At first I thought the game would be intimidating however a few minutes into the combat and I realized how simple it was+ Great graphics and art style. I really enjoy the cyberpunk setting mixed with all the crazy characters. + Character portraits look really nice+ Very slick UI and HUDThe Bad- Can be frustrating when you character misses on enemies even with a high hit percentage. - Even after you kill all enemies, rather than the game exiting battle mode you have to control each party member to the exit to progress- minor bugs.ConclusionIf you loved the original Fallout games or even Baldurs Gate, you need to play this game. I was surprised how good it was.  "

												I was pretty skeptical of this game, i watched a few videos about it and read a couple of articles about the game, the universe looked pretty interesting, but the gameplay didn't look appealing to me.However, since during the cristmas sale, the game got really cheap , i decided to give it a try, and oh boy. Though i still have mixed feelings about the gameplay, the writing in this game is amazing, i never thought i'd enjoy reading this much in a game before. There is a lot of text, which is actually a good thing. A lot of interesting characters and stories. Would i recommend the game? Sure, but be warned  there is a lot of text, that's pretty much most of the game, and if you don't enjoy reading you are not going to have a good time with this game, though the combat can be pretty fun and chalenging, the writing is pretty much what makes this game great.If I have one complain is how linear it is. Though the level design is pretty good, I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of exploration. There is a little bit, but the levels are way too linear and it hurts the gameplay. But not by much, since again, the meat of the game is the writing. Also this game looks pretty good. I love the art style of the characters, especially the portraits for the different characters you'll meet, very creative and interesting looking people.			"

												Surprisingly great cyberpunk round-based RPG-ish tactic game:Pro:+ story+ atmoshere+ tactical gameplay, neat classes+ cool soundtrackContra:- no possibility to ""enter combat"" on your own resulting in enemies (almost) always start the encounter- only your own Hero is equipable with equipment (NPCs can only equip items such as grenades, medkits...)- (need to read much, not voiced)__________Playtime: ~20hrs for 1 playthrough			"

												I had some fun with this game but the number of bugs I've encountered spoiled all the fun. The game has a huge potential, but it seems it has been wasted.1) The engine looks nice but it's FLAT. I'm not asking for much, even ""Fallout 2"" nearly 15 years ago had stairs in it. Not to mention original X-Com/UFO series from mid 90's. Also there's absolutely no interaction with it accept for cover options and a few active objects.2) The autosave option is a pain... especially when you have to reload due to a bug.3) Numerous BUGS! ""escaping"" camera (occuring even in ""locked"" mode!), unselectable ""active objects"", weird interface lags.4) Original campaign storyline is linear. Don't expect many side quests or free content exploration becouse there is NO CONTENT, there's only a series of tactical missions.The only hope for this game is fanmade content, but I'm dropping it untill the engine gets fixed (that might be forever).

												Shadowrun returns is a turn-based RPG on which you focus on 1 character (your own). This is a bit disappointing since even though the games features a lot of flavors of combat with different branches:- Summoner- hacker- Guns (Pistol, SMG, Rifles)- melee (Throwing, Melee)- mage (Offensive, supportive). You can only pimp your own character. If you need to go in a mission, you can hire ""Runners"" to help you  do the mission. You can only fill them up with consumables and not be able to temporarily equip them.Despite all of that, Shadowrun returns is a solid game with it's gameplay and a decent 13 hour length game. Plus the fact that the modding tools of this game can allow you to make your own storyline, this is a great purchase overall. WAAAAAAYY better than Invisible Inc which has very short mission line, very weak modding tools (can't make your own story) in exchange of a almost perfect gameplay. "

												XCom meets Baldurs Gate squished into one.Lots of reading, but thats how these games are, but there is a lot of reading.About 1/2 way through I started to notice some of the text grammer and spelling started to show some foreign traits, but nothing that detracted from the game.The campaign was a touch short.  I'm a casual gamer and I finished my first run in about 18 hours, but I enjoyed it!  Yes I will probably be playing through again.  By the time I was getting to the end I was finially remembering how the talent points worked (yes I played the pen and paper ver some way back when), and what skills/abilities I wanted.All in all I would recomend the game.  Especially if you like XCOM or any of the D&D RPG style games.			"

												If you're a fan of the old Shadowrun games on Genesis or SNES, this might be for you. If you enjoyed the Shadowrun FPS/Counter-Strike clone from a few years back, you probably won't like this so much. I give this a mixed thumbs up- the combat and leveling system are fun, but the story/writing and conclusion are pretty balls.			"

												If you are looking for a classic CRPG experience in the style of Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale, you've come to the wrong place. This is one of the most linear Rpg's of it's kind i've ever played. Like exploring an open world, picking up side missions, and finding gear? Shadow run has none of this. Instead your stuck in an incredibly tiny hub area (usually just a bar, which you can't leave, though sometimes you have access to the city), which you use to hop from one mission to next, as mentioned before only a couple of these which deviate from the main storyline.  There is no loot really, the only item progression you get is buying the slightly better piece of armor/weapon/decker interface from the hub store. The story was holding it's own, and was a fairly interesting murder mystery untill about halfway through when ***SPOILERS*** you suddenly have to fight a bunch of astral bugs from another dimension and save the world... somehow? It gets completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in other words. The combat is fairly good, but most of the time you're actually not even fighting anything so I can't reccomend the game based on the combat alone. This is not like an old school Black Isle/Bioware game like the trailers and screenshots make it look to be, so if that's what your looking for don't let this game sucker you into buying it like it did me. 4/10			"

Short Review: Keep in mind this relates to the Vanilla game as of Dec/6/2013The combat is great and fun,1 skill tree class is pointless,game is linear,not much consequence of choice quest endings are irrelevant.Character creation is limited,skill tree point allocation brutforces max stats based on race.Graphics and locations are varied and lovely to run through.Mods can be made for the game via the limited tools,but are restricted to custom campaigns.Levels have lack of map rotation which gets in the way very few times if at all.Save system is horrible you have to playthrough section by section in order for the game to save, no manual saving options.Audio effects are good. If you want to play a tactical rpg with a so-so story (seems akin to kings bounty) in terms of a passable but not memoriable story,and can deal with the items I mentioned I say get it when its on sale.If it was not for the apparent flaws in the game,short length,and bad save system, I'd say its worth full price but to me its only worth $10 at most.Either get on sale, or wait til all the dlc comes out and buy as a goty,gold,platinum,complete, w/e they will call it.Otherwise skip it. I give it a  3/5 I do not see myself playing through this game again other than once every few years or something,it just lacks replay value to me.Full Review:This game has probably one of the best tactical rpg A.I. in terms of difficulty I have seen in awhile.The combat system is pretty good and the % chance to hit works just fine. The locations you goto are very vibrant and colorful and fit the setting of the game quite well. The lack of the ability to rotate the map becomes a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in a few instances but not anywhere near as much as one would think thanks to careful placement of obsticles. Skill tree wise, there are some aspects I do not like such as the fact a summon has to buy spirits to sommon.To aide with this though one can summon a spirit from a location on the map bt only some locations have them. I played my first playthrough on hard as a summoner with riffle skills and conjuring ability.The Decker class (a cyber hacker ) is completely pointless because most of the missions where it matters to have on you get one for free or get recommended one for cheap that is pretty strong.Its a waste of time to even bother with the decker skill tree and there not many places you can hack which takes away from having a multiple way of doing things.I find this a bad flaw since this game is linear and there is hardly a choice of consequence. All the other skill tree classes are useful. Overall though the skill tree point allocation system some have problems with,but it seems balanced for how the game is so I had no problem with it. Pistols,shotguns,rifles,drones,gernades,elemental spirit summons,med kits,cybernetic implants,etc are your purchase choices.Quests in the game seem mostly geared toward the main story,I found there to be hardly any side quests.There are more optional objectives that you can do while on a main quest than there are side quests. This a let down since the optional quests in the main quest seem like they are naturally apart of the main quest anyway.Character creation is standard though limited.What character you pick decides what your starting stats will be.Now here is where some people might not like.In the skill tree races have a max stat they can reach for skills.For example in many lure Elvan are largely focused toward magic,nature and spirits so they tend to have high max stat allocation ability in areas related to it than other people. This sort of system in my opinion takes away from being able to make your character your own,however seems to convey a standard lure for the different races.Human,Elvan,Dwarf,Troll are your races to choose from.The story for me was very passable.You will need to follow it because of having to pick different dialog tree's so you will need to know some of which was going on,but I found myself skimming through parts of the dialog exchange because it was not engaging enough to keep my interest. There are some interesting points to the main story but overall I feel the story hurts the game the most.I wont say its not an okay story, I just found it very uninteresting. Some of the ingame events that occurred were fun however short lived without much detail for some.Overall The game is playable because of various locations,graphics, and a good tactical  battle system.However being an rpg there character classes hardly have much difference to them and the skill system is lackluster.The lack of consequence of choice and branching story/quest elements touted to be in makes the game suffer for it.The combat system saves it making the game playable considerably but the story is forgettable and I found myself not being engrossed into it. Since steam lacks any other option other than a thumbs up or down I have to give it a down for its weak presentation of rpg gameplay and story.			"

												I heard a lot of mixed reviews for this game, and I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. It's not a perfect game, but it's a very enjoyable take on the genre, with enough innovation to feel fresh.PROS:- the biggest pro is the writing; the story is excellent noir-ish cyberpunk fare, and the dialogue is very well written- combat (especially late game combat) can be thrilling- the environments are attractive- there are some small and pleasing genre innovations (for example, hiring a party on a mission-to-mission basis, inventory/stash management is well done, the stat/levelling system is very versatile and effective)- the hacking system can lead to some really great combat encounters with fighting happening simultaneously in the real world and the matrix, and consequences of each fight has limited spillover on to the otherCONS:- the game is quite short with very little outside the main story path; I did every side mission and finished in under 9 hours- the combat music is repetitive- not enough weapons,  some balance issues,  some stats/classes basically worthless- the environments felt dead; few people in the environment, even fewer that will talk to you, and zero incentive to explore (not really any scavenging)- some of the lategame setpiece fights are too long and repetitive- the game was too easy overall (played on normal)anyway, I hear Dragonfall is better, so I'll be getting that too, but if this is on sale or something and Dragonfall isn't, it's still worth your money.

												I enjoyed this and its sequal dragon fall for several reasons.1. portrays shadowruns setting fairly well a dispotic apocalyptic wasteland with trolls and mugic and stuff.2. feels very close in character creation and growth like you are playing tabletop shadowrun !3. memorable characters and a cameo from the old nintendo shadowrun game ! nice.4. a pretty decent amount of options for strategies and you hire your own supporting runners.------------the few cons i found are as follows -------1. first one has kinda poor cyber parts until very late in game.2. healing from mage or shaman is kinda clunky and seriously gibbed by a lot of late game debuffs that give you damage at the start of your turn as healing only heals ""the last wound"" which is also kinda wierd in the players favor if you have 1 point in healing you can heal say a 24 damage crit in one shot if it doesnt have any lingering damage or anything.3.  Riggers seem OP once you get some money under your belt riggers can be up to 3 individual characters (combat) and circumvent things with drones (vents).4. Adept felt on the whole kinda meh. i beat the game and the sequal as an adept first and the second one helps but you still have to activate your abilities wasting 1/3 or 1/2 of your turn just to do the same damage as other people when in the scource game (tabletop) adepts can be passive wrecking machines just as dangerous as any cybersam.5. a few targeting glitches very rare but not being able to shoot at certain enemies at certain times ""just cause"" is a little annoying.6. i would have liked to see more control over your crews loadout and even maybe talent growth especially in the second one as the characters are more integrated into the story as opposed to just coyote in the first one.----------------------------in closing all in all the stories are good for both this and its sequal, the gameplay is solid enough especially for a small dev. They both allow a lot of character options, and advancement strategies. It feels kinda like shadowrun tabletop (a good thing)			"

												I finished the game.This game was developed for tablets and it hinders the game massively, many reviews seem to leave this part out.+ The story is great and very well fleshed out+ The NPCs you will interact with are interesting, unique and fun to read+ The graphical presentation suits the game's style very well, although key items and interactable objects blend in with static scenery+ The pacing is good+- The ending was satisfactory but nothing great- Short game, for an RPG, definitely not worth full price- A watered down XCOM combat system, boring, dull and clunky. Percentages seem to be broken, movement is annoying, cover is scarce and in illogical places. You can't peak around walls or anything like that.- The UI is barebones at best, you wont spend much time in menus, and as far as I could tell, there's no way to customise your character's gear and inventory unless you purchase something first.- There is little to no explanation of key features of the game, the UI, or the combat. I had to trial and error pretty much everything in the game.- No permanent party members, this means no customisation other than your character, no relationships to develop, no party member backstories to uncover. - The game locks you in combat between encounters, making exploration and navigating and absolute chore. Killing any semblence of enjoyment in exploring the detailed environments.  "

												So, really XCom is the leader in this sort of game, but Shadowrun compensates by adding some decent story and RPG elements. I had a good time with it, and apparently the sequel buffs out some of the quirks. There's a few oddities. The inventory management and party system is non-standard, but you're a grown person - you'll figure it out. The art is great, and you want a closer look at it. I only wish the game didn't keep trying to force you to zoom out. A few other weird issues manifest, especially in the early game when you and the game are still getting to know each other. I get the impression of a solid foundation having been laid but then parts of the structure being abruptly canceled and quickly made to achieve a base level of functionality. You can specialize in a weapon but then there's only 3 weapons of that class you can ever buy sort of stuff. Probably a result of the tabletop system being implemented literally without followthrough in the game properA few other areas assume a familiarity with the tabletop system and aren't explained especially well in the game, but they weren't gamebreakers for a 13-hour long RPG. You might make a bad decision and sort of de-optimize your build, but it's not a huge hassle. The game isn't very unforgiving. I played through on hard mode and only failed once in an early mission. For example, cybernetic upgrades aren't really explained very well in the game, and I purchased some cool robo-legs, and then later discovered that I was kind of stuck with them and there would never be any significant upgrades. I get the impression that the tabletop actually has lots more depth that they just sort of ran out of time to implement, and that these shortcomings (Just add more items to the shopping cart) could be easily addressed in fan made levels or whatnot.

												Shadowrun Returns is an top-down isometric RPG game, set in the universe of the Shadowrun pen & paper role-playing game.You take direct control of your central character, followed by the companions you choose or forced to by the game. Combat mode is activated when you encounter aggressive NPCs. Combat options include using cover, summoning creatures to fight for you, healing and boosting your team, spells, melee weapons and gun play. You have direct control of your own team. Interaction with the world and team is highly limited when out of combat unfortunately. When you start a game, you pick your character's gender, race (human, elf, ork, dwarf or troll) and either pick a pre-designed class or build your own. The character creation and progression system is highly flexible, you are given points which you allocate to certain abilities, enhancing them or giving you more options. You earn more of these by progressing through the plot or doing side quests in game. Throughout the game, you can also learn new spells, buy new weapons or invest in implants (at the expense of your ability to cast spells).The default campaign that comes with the game is short, linear, and filled with plenty of good and interesting characters that aren't fully fleshed out. Good plot, but missed opportunity. User generated campaigns are hit and miss, but some surpassing the default campaign.Graphics look beautiful, and really delivers the cyberpunk look and feel. Music and sound effects are good, but with only a limited selection, you end up hearing the same few tracks and sounds often. TL:DR: good for scratching that old-school isometric RPG itch, some good strategic choices to make in the game. The default campaign is fine, but limited, might want to check out the user made stuff, or DLC.			"

												I have a lot of respect to guys who worked on the cool artworks of the game. As a RPG fan, I really wanted to like Shadowrun Returns, but the game kept disappointing me on so many levels and I constantly failed to find RPG features that make me love RPG games.The story is very weak. Just compare the plot with Fallout series, the story of Chosen One, or Planescape Torment, the story of nameless one who wakes up in a mortuary one day and tries to find his forgotten past. Imagine Baldur's Gate's story, Candlekeep attack, Gorion's death, and the hunt for Saverok. Not to mention Kotor. This story doesn't give you any excitement or mystery in the storyline, and I constantly felt like the whole thing was written in a few days after the artwork was designed, although I am sure it is not true.There is no freedom of open world environment. The game dictates where we should go, what we should do to complete a quest. There are no random encounters, locations or rare items. The game doesn't reward you when you succesfully accomplish a mission besides karma points.There are certain areas where you can buy your supplies, have information on your investigations and you can't miss them. There is no puzzle that players can possibly struggle with.We are very limited with NPC options as well. Instead of choosing among several NPCs who have different POVs on matters, we have to choose no-name mercenaries for each battle. Think about Might and Magic series, Baldur's Gate, KOTOR, or Fallout and imagine how NPC choices were changing the gameplay, and how each character had different point of views on your actions. If Shadowrun Returns hadn't described itself as an RPG game, I wouldn't write any of this, but I think this game does not even  deserve to be in the same category with all of the other RPG games. I would even go further and say that even GTA IV, or Diablo is more RPG than Shadowrun Returns because of all the reasons explained above. I think the game tried to accomplish a lot and failed miserably because of this, and I hope they won't make the same mistakes in the future titles.			"

												Unfortunate Shadow run is really not that good of a game.I've sunk a considerable amount of time into the title and tried to like it because of the editor but in the end I cannot recommend it. The main problem is that the battle system is incredibly shallow, it is not balanced and to be honest it feels like there wasn't any attempt to create it like a system. It just seems like they added stuff because they thought ""well this is Shadowrun we need to have that"". Decking for example is largely useless unless you are playing a deck heavy UGC, other than that just bring along a decker on your mission and you're good to go. The guns don't feel much different from one another and spells that arnt bugged just seem bland, with again there appearing to be no thought put into the design and place of each mechanic. I think the main problem with the approach they took was that they were trying to develop it for tablet as well as PC and unfortunately it makes the PC version suffer through a general lack of options and customizability that you find in most PC titles.

												It plays a lot like the new X-Com on a more personal scale, and a lot more choice when it comes to combat. Since it includes a lot of RPG elements and the Shadowrun setting, you can create a character any way you like, from a run-and-gunner to a mage slinging fireballs, to a mage slinging buffs, to a mage with a pet, or something in-between. Some things seem unpolished or foolish, however, like running a melee combatant or a physad; The few times I tried to melee an opponent, even with a physad NPC, I got chopped into hamburger. I'm also unsure why you'd want to stick with pistols when rifles and shotguns are available, no matter how good pistols get later in the game. Maxing out pistol skills seems silly. Similarly, some of the etiquette skills are nearly useless, while some are indispensable. I suppose that's true in life as well, but it's easy to feel annoyed that you've wasted your skill points.But the setting is fantastic, and feels like it was written by people who know the game and want to make it as authentic and immersive as possible.

BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO: Jagged Alliance 2, Jagged Alliance: Flashback, Wasteland 2WHAT TO EXPECT: Basic kick-starter funded game. Short story.  Very limited RPG.  Cyberpunk themed.  Single-player. Virtually linear.  Great tactical combat.  Great graphics and art direction.  Superb writing.  ACHIEVEMENTS: NONE.STATUS: COMPLETE.WHEN TO BUY:  ASAP for fans.  Otherwise a good sale.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Shadowrun Returns is a story-driven, party-oriented RPG with tactical combat.  The action takes place a in dysoptic cyberpunk version of Seattle around the year 2050 where trolls, elves and dwarves live alongside humanity.  The heavy use of stimulants and cybernetics pervade most aspects of life.  Magic exists.  Crime, and drug-taking are rife.  The internet has become an alternate reality where anything goes.  Rich and powerful corporations hold sway over everything and everyone, resulting in prevalence of industrial espionage carried out by Shadowrunners. These are mercenaries for hire who will perform any job if the price is right.  Players take on the role of a shadowrunner character and specialize in many abilities becoming a warrior, hacker, drone operator, magic user and unarmed combat specialist or a mix thereof.  The game world is shown in isometric form across a dozen or so fixed locations.  Play alternates between real-time exploration and investigation during the adventure phase and turn-based tactical combat.  Additional party members can be hired from an extensive roster of NPCs before going into battles, on a temporary basis.  The game begins with the player investigating who committed the murder and why, but this will ultimately lead to much greater quest with much direr consequences.  Are you up to the assignment?THE GOOD:+ A very good story with fantastic writing.  Even if some gamers may find it too much!+ Strong combat dynamic across a variety of categories: Magic, drones, ranged combat, melee and unarmed.+ Superb range of tactical combat options; from specialized firing modes, overwatch, to reloading without using an action.  Most become available by leveling certain stats.+ Amazing array of character selection and customization.+ Wonderfully created cyberspace levels reminiscent of System Shock, that plays like the tactical combat.+ A large array of equipment and items, with better items only becoming available as the story progresses.+ Very well balanced if a too easy for hardcore RPGers.+ Lots of well-made custom scenarios available in Steam Workshop.+ Ace production from its crisp, isometric graphics, well-drawn artwork and midi-based soundtrack (non-dlc), altogether produces a great ambience.+ Strong easy to use and understand interface.THE BAD:- Not open world.  Series of linked map areas.- Too short with very linear gameplay.- No voice-acting. Really could have done with it.- Only a very few optional quests.  Needed a few more at least.AND THE ORDINARY:* Needed more environment interaction with containers and searchable dead bodies to give the proper feel of an RPG.* A few more vendors would have been nice.  But theres just enough to sell old or buy new items.VERDICT:Shadowrun Returns is a really polished game.  For what it is, its a solid buy.  Built on a tight kickstarter budget it was designed to re-boot the franchise back to the video game format.  It has a very strong story with a neat twist.  Some great writing, complex RPG character building and  turn-based tactical combat with many possible choices.  One of the best features of the game is how it uses the isometric engine to make the sequences in cyberspace as relevant as the tactical combat.However the lack of an (even semi) open-world and voice-overs resulted in an incomplete experience for me personally.  Maybe I wanted too much from this first outting; more of an open-world where places could be visited, more NPCs to talk to in the background.  Just more padding, to add to the overall atmosphere.  Perhaps even more of a permanent party with more control over their stats.  But that doesnt take away from this first decent effort.Others have said that this feels more like you are taking part in an interactive video novel, a linear story where you are more of a passenger than the driver, like you should tend to feel when playing RPGs.  I agree with this but even for a casual Shadowrun fan like me, its enough to ensure that the franchise is back on PC.  For that I am thankful.All-in-all Shadowrun Returns feels like an entry level adventure.  Thats not a bad thing afterall because it is the first of the latest series, of modern adaptations to PC.  In this the developers have done a great job to make the game accessible, enjoyable, mostly accurate to the pen & paper RPG but most of all, to leave the player wanting more.  Shadowrun Returns sticks to the addage walk before you run and if this is built upon in the follow-on games (Dragonfall and Hongkong), then I wont complain.  As it is I would only recommend playing this if you are after an easy albeit interesting introduction to the world of Shadowrun or if you are a hardcore fan and want to play the current series from this developer, from the beginning.  I would suggest either way that you get this on sale or in a bundle as Ive read that the other titles are superior.  Cant wait to try those out!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an old-school isometric cRPG in the vein of the classic Fallout games based on, as its title suggests, the Shadowrun franchise; one of the pioneers in the fictional literature best known for combining cyberpunk, magic, urban fantasy and crime elements into this unique lore. Initially started as a pen-and-paper boardgame, it was long “forgotten” by today’s generation or occasionally overshadowed by games such as the widely popular and highly-acclaimed Deus Ex – at least that is how I see it.The gameplay in Shadowrun Returns is similar to many classic cRPGs. You manage a team of up to four Shadowrunners where you can choose from the story’s main characters to use or hire random, more specialised, Shadowrunners which suit your mission’s requirements. Just like in any RPG, you can pick a race and class for your character at the start, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The combat mechanics are turn-based and generally well balanced, resembling the one used in the recently rebooted XCOM franchise by Firaxis Games, thus if you are familiar with it then that is good news because it is solid. In addition, by completing missions or triggering certain events in the story, karma points are earned to be further spent on enhancing your main character’s attributes which include the typical Strength, Intelligence and Charisma, to name a few, seen in most classic RPGs. For instance, investing lots of points into Intelligence allows your character to be highly competent with Decking or Drone Control specialities, or investing a lot into Charisma can unlock specific dialogue conversations to bypass certain key situations in the game (other attributes are used sometimes for exclusive dialogues too). In fact, the game does a good job in making sure the player cannot master all the available attributes, because as the game explains in its tips during loading screens: a jack of all trades is a master of none. As a whole, perhaps one of the key aspects of its gameplay aside from its good turn-based combat is how you can approach the narration by choosing your responses based on what personality you want your character to be like when talking to NPCs. While not all responses follow a choice-and-consequence pattern, some do actually have an impact on how things develope; and Shadowrun Returns provides a wide range of opportunities. Ultimately, this also increases the replayability of the game a great deal. One last addition is The Matrix which is like a cyberworld used by Deckers to hack into systems. It is an interesting concept but feels a bit underdeveloped as it can feel a bit of a chore most of times.The art direction in Shadowrun Returns is at the very least appealing. The backgrounds, which do vary, are nicely drawn and the colour pallets used fit with Shadowrun’s universe and its cyberpunk roots, making it easily one of the best looking traditional isometric games out there.  The neon light effects used are also something to praise it for since they bring the game’s world to life, despite the lack of NPCs roaming the streets. Unfortunately, the character models, including their animations, are about the only things which look visually mediocre in this rather attractive game, almost making it look like it was ported from a mobile game. Moreover, Shadowrun Returns also boasts a brilliant soundtrack with a couple of memorable tracks, such as the one from the main menu (“Return of the Sixth World”) and “Puppet Masters”, which fit with the cyberpunk vibes of the game. Sure, while this soundtrack does sound slightly different to the one from the original Shadowrun game on SNES, it still sounds cool.Without a shadow (no pun intended) of a doubt, Shadowrun Returns’ strongest aspect is its narration with its great character development. Whilst it takes a bit of time at the beginning to get to like (or despise) individuals you meet, eventually you will be surprised by how many who become your companions or allies will quickly turn out as memorable characters by the end with who you can at least sympathise. Starting off as a simple detective story in the style of Jack The Ripper which progressively deepens and deviates from just a simple detective case to solve later on, the “Dead Man’s Switch” story in Shadowrun Returns is mostly solid, even though it sorrowfully turns into a Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy) type of story in the last quarter of the journey. While it might not completely ruin the endgame experience, that latter part personally left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Despite featuring no voice acting, this does not ruin the experience either since it allows you to use your own imagination on how characters are supposed to sound like in the story. As a result, it might require a bit more effort and dedication to read some of its pompous written dialogues, and this will certainly not be everyone’s cup of tea.Shadowrun Returns has some glarying imperfections though. Being an extremely linear (pretty much most of it is on rails) and story-driven game, it lacks any sense of exploration due to its contained maps and minimal interactions with their environments. This is something which might frankly turn off quite a number of RPG fans, old-school or contemporary. Clicking on certain hotspots, found only intermittently around places, usually pop up a text-box describing what the character is observing, but these are indeed very few throughout the game’s journey. For a text-heavy game, this aspect of interaction seems like a lost opportunity for further enriching the experience. On top of that, once a mission is completed or the area is cleared, in most cases there is no way to revisit an area afterwards. For a completionist, it is crucial to check everything prior to proceeding to the next area. The lack of a deep character customisation is another aspect that will not please every RPG fan out there since it is very basic and only allows you to choose from premade character models. Additionally, there is also no inventory customisation/management for your companions either which can cause some annoyances when planning your tactics prior or during combat.  One further frustration with the game’s design is its tendency to occasionally lock the player into combat even when everyone in the area is eliminated. This results in wasted time trying to move your team to the next objective location on the map as it is agonisingly slow due to its turn-based mechanics. And lastly, as much as the writing is top-notch, the game can sometimes drown you with its longwinded expositions from time to time which can be underwhelming especially for those looking to jump into action more often.In conclusion, Shadowrun Returns is an adequate and faithful entry to the franchise, albeit a limited game, that should please any cRPG, cyberpunk/fantasy fans and even book readers out there to some degree. While it can honestly feel shallow in places, its stellar writing, good narration, memorable cast of characters, distinctive art direction and competent XCOM-like gameplay should keep most people invested in its relatively short 10+ hours campaign, even if its story loses some of its early charm near the end. This, however, remains a borderline recommendation as many things could have been done to further improve the game as a RPG since it can feel a bit basic. To get most out of it is to always remind yourself that it is a very story-driven experience foremost, so any notions of open-world or high-budget production values in the manner of The Elder Scrolls should be dismissed, otherwise you will be disappointed by your own misconceptions. The best way to describe Shadowrun Returns is like reading a long, but relatively good book (that will not really blow you away) accompanied by solid gameplay elements to justify it as a game -- because honestly, it is not too far from being no more than a visual novel.

												High fantasy, cuberpunk and a film noir style that makes this a great game.It is a turn based role-playing game from a popular tabletop game ""shadowrun"".The game come with one campaign ""Dead Man's Switch"" that got 10 to 12 hours gameplay.But when youre are done playing that one you simple can make or download a other story on the steamworkshop.The only problem i have seen there is that you need ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"" for some of the downloaded story's.But thats a simple matter of looking for other story's.Combat is rough, sometimes a near dead experions.You need to find cover and try to use youre team togehter to kill the enemy.Sometimes you even need to plan your staps or use a decker ""hacker"" to kill the secerty or turrets.After a battle you feel like you have done someting but if combat ends youre life dont come back so you need to still watch out so you dont die.There is so mutch to tell about this game but all i have to said.Dont wait mutch longer and give it a try.I give this game 8/10 "

												I was a big fan of the genesis version of this game and old fallout series. This game seems to combine both, but it doesn't.The game is very linear, with no options to go back or visit previous places.. All the chat options are meaningless, leaving to the same course. Even the special ones, that you can acquire with 'etiquette' are useless most of the time, useful only a few times to get a bit more money as rewards. Besides, it seems all the etiquettes are used not more than once during the entire game.The gameplay is annoying, with a lot of delay to execute actions. They made a lot of options for classes but you end up not feeling like exploring it. It's like they made a cool framework for a game but forgot to invest in the game itself. Did I already said it's very linear?On the other side, the story is worth paying attention, it could lead to a great 90's investigation movie. I finished the game and don't feel to ever play it again. If you expect even a bit of what I thought it would be, don't buy this game. I'm sorry :(			"

												I was looking for something to tie me over until the release of a game I'm waiting for and so I decided to give Shadowrun a try.It is amazing! As I am someone who plays for story and characters, I was absolutely smitten by the writing. It's not so much the plot, but the little things that make this title superb. Dialogue, descriptions, and the mechanics of their delivery. Some people may not enjoy this much text, but I delight in it. At this point I am 8.5 hours into the game, and I cannot get enough. In addition to the writing, combat is also enjoyable. I'm not a power-player so my builds may not be efficient, but I appreciate the game allowing me to develop my character the way I see fit in terms of role-playing, and still have fun fighting. Once I am done with the campaign, I will be sure to check out the authoring tools. At this stage I might just be inspired to try creating a story of my own.			"

Shadowrun ReturnsExperienceWhen I was a little boy, I remember a tabletop roleplaying game my friend had. It had so interesting looking manual, I couldnt stop browsing it. It had pictures, formulas, almost nude cyborg chicks, mages, lot of guns and swords. It had orcs, elfs, humans, dwarfs, gnomes, giants and minotaurs. My little mind was blown away. I was so excited, I couldnt stop browsing. Time passed and memories faded. I was a teenager and girls were much more entertaining, than a tabletop roleplaying game. Roleplaying games were nerdy thing to do - girls were the cool thing, and you get to kiss them. You can kiss a rpg manual sure, it just taste like a paper.Not so long ago, I saw Shadowrun Returns in Steam Store. Something clicked. I had this indescribable feeling in my stomach. It felt so strange and familiar at the same time, I didnt know what to do actually. My mind went to some kind of automated state, and my mouse pointer hovered over the BUY - button. 30 minutes later, I was playing the game.UniverseShadowrun Returns is set in an alternate future in which magic returned to the world in 2012. Its cyberpunk themed. High fantasy meets science-fiction. Shadowrunners are the elite criminals for hire. They do your dirty work, for a wealthy payment, ofcourse. Cyberspace, omnipresent computer networks, genetic engineering and cyberware are reality.Gameplay Shadowrun Returns is using isometric view, and you get use cover like in XCOM. Gameplay is fluent and fun. You have many races to choose from, and lot of interesting classes. My first playthrough Im using a rigger. You are basicly an engineer with 2 droids to use and control. Im using shotguns and most of my points are in intelligence, drone control and drone combat. Partysize is four, and you have tons of choices. You hire your party members to every missions. Im usually using me ( as a rigger) , a mage, ranged specialist, and a shaman. Enemies vary alot, and story line is amazing. Its so fun, and entertaining. You can create your own campaigns and upload them to Steam. There are many good custom campaigns to download. This game is gonna entertain you a long time. Length of the original campaign is 15-20 hours, and gameplay is linear.I recommend Shadowrun Returns to all isometric rpg freaks.			"

TL;DR at BottomIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!8/10Recommended PurchaseBetween the CracksShadowrun Returns is a cRPG that was successfully kickstarted and has made its way to steam. The game is set in a cyberpunk world where risk takers, known as shadowrunners, undertake dangerous jobs for whoever pays the most. The game has no multiplayer but instead focuses on its strong singleplayer story and even has steam workshop support so that people can create their own stories and share them with others. Shadowrun Returns is a reboot of an old franchise on SNES going by the same name. This reboot truly sets a new standard for cRPG's with its phenomenal storytelling and graphics that really immerse you in the world of cyberpunk Seattle. The lesson is this - the game is rigged. The cards are stacked. The dice are loaded. It's the same as it always was.-HarlequinShadowruns combat is turn based and, as is usual in the genre, in order to perform any action you require AP. You start the game with 2 points of AP and about halfway through the main story you upgrade to 3 AP. The combat in Shadowrun is pretty usual and there really isn't much special about it. You play as one of 6 classes but really they only affect how you start off early on in the game. Something pretty cool about Shadowrun is that you can build your character however you want regardless of class and your build will still be viable. There are a handful of main skills you can upgrade, such as charisma and strength, and then under those you have at least four or five sub stats such as melee weapons or rifles. The problem here is, at least in the main story, that there are so many stats to upgrade that you can only get about halfway through the skill tree before the game is over. I did almost every side objective there was and I still only got about 3/4 of the way through some of the trees. The game is incredibly linear too so that there is very little you can do in the way of exploration or side objectives. Sometimes you can pass stat checks so that you can avoid combat or haggle price when selling an item but overall the stats really don't feel like they matter in most cases. In some cases, like upgrading rifles or submachine guns you can unlock new abilities to use in combat on those weapons but overall the upgrades from the skill trees are pretty boring. Some of the classes feel really unique and different but others are just typical RPG classes. The rigger, for example, is a class completely focused on controlling your own robots that can do things like sneak through ducts and ambush enemies. Other classes are just basic mages or soldiers and I feel that, while the unique classes are certainly cool, they're overshadowed by the more basic ones. The most interesting part of the game was when you get to hire mercenaries to go on runs with you. You put together a team of runners who come with you on missions and, for the most part you get to pick who you want to come with you, but in some cases you are forced to take main characters. Generally the gameplay is average for a game like this, but I feel they managed to pull it off in a way that, while getting stale after a while, still is respectable for the genre.""Allow me to share a truth with you, Shadowrunner. The truly powerful do nothing themselves unless they absolutely have to.""-Hans BrackhausNow lets talk story. Shadowrun is quite short for a game in the same genre as Fallout 2 and Wasteland but I feel the story is compelling enough to make up for the poor length. You play as one of the aforementioned shadowrunners and you're in your apartment when you get a recording from your friend, Sam Watts. He tells you that if you are hearing this then he's dead.However, he has set up 100,000 nuyen (The games currency) wired on a dead-mans switch to be transferred to you if you can find his killer. You accept the job, be it for loyalty, money, or a mixture of the two and set out to look for the man that murdered one of the few you called friend. You journey through this gorgeous cyberpunk Seattle and as you do the game starts pulling you in and immersing you into this dog-eat-dog world. The environments are so incredibly detailed that you can't help but to want to know more about them. The game, however, doesn't really give you much backstory on the world and tries to keep you focused on the main storyline. The first half of the story you're looking for the cyberpunk equivalent of Jack the Ripper and for the latter half you have to stop an invasion by a horde of monstrous spirit bugs that cannot die. Every character you meet will make you care about keeping them alive and doing right by them or, at the very least, get you to want to learn more about them. Even though it's incredibly linear the story itself is very unique and fits in perfectly with the settings and characters in Shadowrun.TL;DRShadowrun Returns shows that combat isn't everything and an intriguing story and artwork to match can be just as importantIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												SR is a good way to kill about 10 hours or less; though I expected it to be longer.  Because of this, you might want to get it on sale.  The story-driven gameplay has a limited, if not non-existant, replay value... and you can't really stretch it out.  Well, you could make it longer by getting up from your keyboard between turns and spending that time with your family, but no one wants that.  Especially your family.The skill trees don't seem very important to success.  I put every karma point I ever got in dodge and/or shotgun... only.  And, still I blindly walked through the game without any actually difficult combat - which you'd find odd if you compared my random clicking to any real strategy.  I even destroyed the turrets that you're supposed to have to hack, because my dodge was too high for them to hit me (and then the game forces you to hack them to proceed anyway).  Most items are also pretty pointless... you can just buy one really good weapon, a couple of medkits (or just put a healer on your team), and forget the rest.The option of buying all that cyberware is confusing, because there doesn't seem to be a way to repeatedly take missions for money.  I can imagine some people making the game more difficult by blowing all their money on gear and then not being able to hire a proper team.  I only recall seeing one 'bonafide' side-mission, and the way I resolved it seemed to aggrevate the mission-giver at the Seamstress Union to the point where he quit talking to me - which I take it to mean that he wasn't intrinsic to the play mechanics and probably wouldn't have given me more missions even if he'd stayed.  It really seems like the player is stuck to the rails of the story and that there's no real economy in the game.Another thing about the gear:  Some items like the leg options only seemed to be slottable on one side of my body, though there was no apparent indicator that they were either an upgrade (I already hade a cyber leg on that side of the body) or are somehow restricted to one side.  I'm thinking this is a bug, but the game's not long enough, nor are the gear upgrades important enough, for it to matter.Other than not properly supporting my native 2560x1080 resolution (1920x1080 was the max, and that gets stretched when in fullscreen mode), the game works really well under Linux.

												The good: The setting is great, the story/characters are interesting, and there is a lot of flexibility in playstyle (being a mage feels different from being a decker, which feels different from just shooting up everything with an assault rifle). It's also a reasonably pretty game. The graphics are a little cartoony, but with enough detail to let you enjoy the dystopian cyberpunk future theme. The bad: It's extremely simple/easy, painfully linear, there's no voice acting, and while conversations give you the impression that your choices matter, the game appears largely devoid of meaningful consequences. I'd call it a ""video graphic novel,"" except the writing isn't even all that good, and (despite some more positive reviews) there's not even that much writing to begin with. It's also short. Really short.Bottom line: This is a simple game that would feel rewarding if it were a free mobile game instead of pretending to be a full-fledged PC RPG. If you can get it on sale for a couple of bucks, it might be worth it as a gateway to the superior Shadowrun games that follow, but as is, this is not a $15 game.The ""crime/detective"" themes try to make it feel like an old point and click adventure game, except your options are so limited that it feels like a ""mystery"" designed for a 5 year old to solve. Despite the emphasis on ""tactical combat,"" fights tend towards the easy. Resource management is a joke because you should always have plenty of money to buy equipment and a full high-level team, so there's no additional ""should I get better armor or a new gun"" type of trade-off. The result is boredom. The game spends too much time in the turn-based combat mode (even between discrete combat encounters), so simply walking from one fight to the next has to be done individual party member at a time.

												This game was a suprise for me. I did not now about Shadowrun universe before, and i was kind of dumbstruck about the setting. Think DnD with cyberpunk. This alone made me buy this game, and this beauty did not disappoint me. Combat is like the X-COM Enemy Within. Not detailed as much but still, enjoyable. The campaign is interesting (though not as much as dragonfall) and you can download more campaigns through steam workshop. There are many campaigns there and some of them are very, very good. Have I mentioned the setting is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome?This is an awesome game and it deserves it's pricetag.			"

												I really enjoyed the elements brought into the game from the RPG books.  They have done a great job merging the different types of combat, and interaction with the world even though the game sets you to run a specific story I found myself not minding the limited scope.  Normally I go for action-rpg combat, but this game manages to still have good flow with the turn based combat.  Overall I'd say it's a very well put together game especially for the price.			"

Posted: August 10, 2015
												So let's start this review by criticizing the story-module they offer with the game, since its the only story provided with the game and while yes you can acquire others from the Workshop, you'd expect something more solid, At this time I have about 10 hours I believe put into this game and with that I was able to start a first game, went maybe a quarter to a third of the way thru, than decide to restart with a different character and finish it... all in 10 hours, its very short overall, and the logevity of the game depended solely on the players themselves building new stories, which is not a good idea, since players didn't program the game or get paid for it, their work will most likely not be up to par... typically, but in this case, I am not really sure of the quality of the module provided with the game.Look at the Deadman's Switch story, effectively it has alot in common with Robert E. Charette Secrets of Power Shadowrun Novel series, you have a Sam Watts, instead of Sam Verner, heck you see one of Verner's buddies in there too, also with one of your runners named Coyote, somehow a connection to Sam Verner, however indirectly this time. Ultimately like that Novel series you are a man (or woman) on a hunt, in the Secrets of Power it was Sam Verner on the hunt for his sister, in here it was your Shadowrunner on the hunt for Sam Watts murderer, and in the end just like with the novel you end up dealing with some creepy spirits and it became the main issue to deal with at the end of the story. Frankly I am shocked nobody else saw how they merely copied various elements from the Secrets of Power novel series and recreated a cheaper story based on such elements but of far more mediocre result and with a far too cliché ending for the genre. So story wise the single module provided is a enormous let down.Now for the Gameplay, well its not too bad, but felt fairly limited, you have effectively a single Shadowrunner you can buid and equip, those you can hire are pre-made entirely and you can't even modify their gear, shouldn't you be able to buy weapons and stuff and loan it to them or something? It would make sense... rather you are stuck with whatever they want. Also they don't level up along with you, but as the game advance the entire list of potential runners is updated at a few spots in the storyline, also you only have two runners that have any connection to the storyline mostly, those two are involved in it and one of them is only available for a couple of missions, the other is only available after the first is not available anymore, which mean you never truly feel involved with your crew all too much and they are very much expandable assets. Also a problem is the bits of the story in the Matrix, unless you make your char a Decker, or at least update one to be a Decker on the side of anything else you want it, well you are going to have issues, the few spots where you have to deal with the Matrix would have to rely on pre-made chars that you don't have any choices over the build for, which can be a serious issue. They shouldn't have made the Matrix runs a necessity if you only have one custom char and that char might not be a Decker.Another issue is the game sometimes bugs and those bugs can be dire, at one point I wasn't able to do anything anymore during a fight, I couldn't attack or anything, so I had to close the game and load my auto-save, only happened once, yet its still annoying.

												A captivating turn based game, the like of which I've not played since Fallout 1 & 2. The story's amazing (heck, I just played through the game in one sitting, was worth it!), just wish there was voice acting for it as well. Little snag I had was that it sometimes would keep you in combat for too long, meaning it would be a hassle to move your troops from point A to point B once everything in the vicinity is killed off. Other than that, no complaints about the game. Time to play the other installations!			"

												I've heard ""this game is like XCOM."" Scratch that, because it's nothing like XCOM. Sure there are some minor similarities in battle mechanics but that's where the similarities end. This game is good in it's own right. You've got a pretty interesting plot about finding your old friend's killer to make a couple of bucks. From there the story goes down a rabbit hole to uncover the culprit and turns into quite the adventure. This game isn't necessarily about saving the world or some greater good. You're pretty low on cash and a lot of times I compromised my morals to make a couple bucks. Mercenaries don't come cheap in this run down futuristic, magic tech world and we've all gotta eat. That being said although this game is short, for an RPG you'll end up taking a lot of jobs and get to meet a few brothers in arms. There are many characters you'll encounter but aside from the handful you actually get to know a bit most are for fighting purposes.There are numerous skills to customize your character with. When you complete missions or do good deals it rewards you with karma points pretty frequently to upgrade whatever you like. I suggest finding a particular specialty and sticking with it. When I started my I decided I'd be a decker with focus on melee skills. Decker was a good choice as there are a couple of situations later in the game that require that particular skill set. But I soon found that most enemies carry guns and you know what they say about bringing a knife to a gun fight. Charisma was an important skill as you can get more money by charming the pants off of people using your words. This also had a couple of layers to it as you learn new etiquette surprisingly it's the choices I don't expect that pop up in dialogue. Like most strategy RPGs having a diverse range of companions helps in all missions but you'll end up hiring the same people who complement your style. Battles require a bit of strategy as AI isn't stupid. If you cluster all your forces in one spot an enemy will likely bomb your group. That being said you'll have more of the ""kill all foes"" variety of missions. How you do it is up to you. This game is good but I would have liked to see more locations or other town like places you could meet runners in between missions. There are conversations referencing other places in the Matrix but sadly you never get to experience them. There were also a couple of bugs that froze my game during missions. They were random and seemed to fix it self after a restart but saving often helps. Hopefully all these issues are resolved in the Dragonfall sequel but in itself it's an alright game and you should try it if you're into tactical, futuristic RPGs.			"

												Why does this keep happening to me? And by this I'm referring to the fact I can't seem to play a game where I can say, in clear-cut manner ""this is good or this is bad"", but always have to keep a balancing scale in my head and actively weighing positives and negatives against each other. Well, in one more attempt to remain consistent such is the case with Shadowrun Returns so let's get down to it, chummer.First thing first – it's GREAT to see Shadowrun make a proper return to the world of video games following its less than stellar last entry. That does come with a caveat or two because Returns was funded thanks to a Kickstarter project and this fact seeps through almost every aspect of the game, but we'll get around to that in due time. If there is one major Achilles heel worth noting it's the fact the entire game feels like a very light venture into the world of Shadowrun, but also one that makes only a token effort in explaining inner workings and setting itself to the uninitiated. If you don't know much about Shadowrun you'll get a brief 101; only for parts pertinent to what you're dealing with and delivered to you at a snail's pace primarily through loading screen text. This goes beyond matters of fluff and extends to systems themselves  - it's a borderline RPG-lite experience compared to what many have come to expect these days, eschewing things like looting fallen bodies and any great interaction with the world that surrounds you aside from few mechanics-related interactable points. This goes hand-in-hand with very light-weight tutorials which you'll have to actively seek instead of them being naturally introduced to ease you into the game. This may or may not be a relevant sticking point depending on your level of familiarity no only with Shadowrun but also with RPGs in general, though.To keep everything in perspective it is important to note this game was not made on a multi-million dollar budget and that should exempt it from some of the problems, even if things such as sometimes unresponsive functions and somewhat uninspired takes on certain elements like implementation of the Matrix remain annoying throughout the game. Speaking of which, as much as I love to see everything ranging from Adepts to Deckers presented not all Archetypes were created equal as far as unique selling points go and neither were Etiquettes aka your social ""specializations"" which unlock specific options in dialog. Game really could have used more of these options in general, but I guess it functions acceptably well with this overall linear structure of the game taking you from location to location as story demands and not letting you re-visit older ones, local quasi-hub notwithstanding.That was enough nagging about the game, where's the good stuff? Returns is not a bad game and you may have noticed I gave it a thumb up recommending it despite my incessant complaining in paragraphs above. Why? Because it's a still a competent RPG with great flavor and decent character building options. It smartly offsets the fact you only customize the main character by letting you choose who to take with you on missions from a roster of contracts, quality ranging depending on how deep your pockets are. Even though it kinda takes a while to kick in, game's story certainly delivers on everything from standard Shadowrunner fare to more... out there revelations and twists you will probably not see coming, but which still have absolute basis in existing lore.  Relatively short by RPG standards, but succinctly to the point and with no filler to waste your time. Characters? They definitely take a backseat to events unfolding although I have no doubt you'll find favorites among them.Last advice, chummer – never EVER cut a deal with a dragon if you value your sorry existence.

												Shadowrun Returns (SRR) is a story-driven linear RPG with turn-based tactical combat. You play a Shadowrunner (something like a private detective or a hired special agent) who's thrown into the investigation of an ex-colleague's murder only to find himself wrapped in a much greater plot...Review DetailsFor those not familiar: ""Shadowrun is a science fantasy theme set in a near-future fictional universe in which cybernetics,magic and fantasy creatures co-exist. It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, with occasional elements of conspiracy fiction, horror and detective fiction."" --Wikipedia. I would add the ""Noir"" keyword in that passage, as well.SRR is best played with a mouse and is entirely built into a third person isometric engine, just like the original Fallout games. The visuals (scenery, character portraits etc) are very well made and capture the atmosphere of the world, resonating in its depth and mystery. The music and SFX are just OK, and note that the game has no voice-over at all. The mechanics of the game are solid but they could use some more balancing and polishing. What annoyed me most is that the game tends to ""lock"" you in turn-based combat mode, even when all enemies are downed, until you reach a specific map location. Also, the stat-system (the so-called ""Karma"" points) is kinda inflated, not all skill-trees are well structured, and many of the items or skills you acquire become obsolete quite fast as you get better ones. The game is not very difficult: It took me 15 hours to complete on Normal difficulty and I only failed and had to reload a couple of times. You can quick-save/load anytime with F5/F9.The plot itself is interesting and keeps you motivated to see what's next. Each time you think you're close to the ending, something more pops up, throwing you into a bigger plot! Role-playing is quite varied and there's usually multiple ways to progress in the story which, however, is fully linear. However, I played the game only once, so I am not sure if the consequences are really that different if you pick other dialogue options... Most of the characters are memorable and well developed but I think that the lack of voice-over kinda limits their profoundness. Finally, I like how the game borrows elements from classic books/games, e.g. Gibson's Neuromancer or the Fallout universe, and how it renders stereotype characters, e.g. the ""corrupt cop"", the ""badass waitress"", the ""taciturn bouncer"" etc. Well written!VerdictIn overall, SRR is a decent game, mostly recommend if you're into that theme (cyberpunk) and/or that game genre (story-rich RPG with tactical combat). There's not something really special about it, but it was surely worth my time! If I were to rate it, I'd put it around 70-80%. They say that the second game, Dragonfall, is much better than SRR, so I got high hopes for that one!			"

												Shadowrun is the iconic cyberpunk RPG franchise from the 80's. RPG fans might also remember GURPS which had a cyberpunk module, and also the Neuromancer novel was a hit at that time. But it was Shadowrun that was succesfully converted into videogames, with two different games on the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo that a lot of RPG fans seem to remember. This game is a homage to these two games, rebooting the electronic franchise in a memorable way.This game style is pretty old school. You wander around places talking to people, searching for clues, learning information and finding items, just like an adventure game. Occasionally you will have to fight, tactical RPG style. You have action points to spend and got to position the characters wisely. Nothing new here, but it just works. All the reading provide immersion and the fights feel quick enough not to bore you.You have a single character, which actually helps role playing. The kind of character you build will influence how you will play the game. There are some decisions that depend on what class you are playing, so it feels great to make a difference when your skills are needed. You control other characters in fights too, you can recruit people and some people stick with you for a bit while the story is being told.This new franchise is compatible with GNU/Linux systems, and it plays very well on my Intel HD3000 onboard graphics. Graphics are simple, but well done. It feels like a classic game, but so much easier to get into in comparison with the older siblings.I recommend this to anyone who is interested in cyberpunk and enjoys some immersion and story telling. RPG fans are going to have fun building a character, the system is interesting and fresh. I recommend reading about character building before playing, unless you enjoy learning the hard way that going full hybrid won't work well.			"

												A terrific game. I was a huge fan of Shadowrun in my youth during the 80's and enjoyed playing it table top. As a video game it is a really good immersive feel. I am not a huge fan of so much reading usually and would have enjoyed more voice acting but this was a fun game non the less.			"

												Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Dystopia, Quality writing, and turn-based isometric gameplay. In other words... it's a cross between Deus Ex and the old Fallout games (1/2). Neat!I heard that this was a game series that existed many years ago, but I had never heard of it before playing this. No matter, since I didn't need any extra backstory to understand what was going on here. And what I saw was quite good. :DTook about 10-12 hours to beat the main storyline, but you can also create your own campaigns. Many have done so, and you can find them on the workshop to add a little more to this game. There's also a DLC that i've yet to play, and i'll put a review of that separately when I do. Anyway, I love Deus Ex and Fallout - two of my favorite franchises of all time. So naturally I have much to like about this game. Good storytelling, good gameplay, and a wide variety of choice and replayability options. Plus mods and more content on the way.Have fun! I did. :3Edit: Played Dragonfall. It's even better than the main game is. If you get Shadowrun Returns and like it, then get Dragonfall too. It is worth it. ^_^			"

												A cyberpunk-themed old-school turn-based RPG? Color me excited!Shadowrun has great graphical asthetics and feel, it plays well and the written dialogue and story is fantastic. The turn-based combat may be the weakest portion of the game, it's rather basic but it isn't bad and does what it needs to do.If you're into this sort of genre then you will be sucked into this world.*Update*The Dragonfall DLC Campaign is HIGHLY recommended! Far better than Dead Man's Switch in terms of story and (imo) characters. Be sure to pick up both!			"

												A fun short game (beat it in 10 hours) but an overall disappointment.  The level up/stats system is laughable -- I played a troll who has high maximum stats thinking I'd have the pleasure of making a strong brute of a hero.  Alas, the campaign is so short you only gain enough experience (or karma in this case) to get slightly passed halfway.  Huge letdown.Also, when hiring mercenaries, you'd think they would be able to hack computers/open locks for you -- they cannot.  It all relies on your character's skill set.Being able to hire said mercenaries also allows you to get a taste for the different classes/races/weapons/tools and removes any sort of replayability.  The storyline is very linear.The in/out of combat system is finicky as well, and I had to reload more than a few times to fix.Not worth $16.  Thank you Humble Bundle.			"

												That's the stuff, chummer.Game has its flaws, it's short, it's linear. Funny thing is, it's not even using the full potential of what content Devs created (for instance etiquettes).I think Harebrained Schemes (wtf name right?) were too much confident into their mod editor and community.Since then, 10s of mods have been released, I didn't play any so far, so cannot discuss quality. Fact is, you can appreciate quality of a mod by a simple glance when it comes to gameplay/system/ui/textures modifications, but it's very hard to tell when mods are oriented into story-telling with a simple synopsis.BUT, despite all its downfalls, let it be clear: writing is top notch!Harebrained Schemes also showed that they are a very capable studio with DragonFall Director's cut (imo best game of 2014) and that they deserve support.Soundratck is neat, and couple of tracks are full gems (Memory, Double Cross, That's the stuff, Dark Alley...)Oui, oui, mon ami!

												I bought some donuts for a sidequest I didn't even know existed until I went and talked to a cop who wanted some donuts... This game is too linear.This game bored me to death. Read other reviews because I don't even want to think about all the things I really dislike about this game. I was looking for something akin to ""Arcanum"" but got some empty world game with buggy controls and pointless quests. Hacking is pointless. Everything seems pointless in this game because of how incredibly linear it is. I'd try to do my own thing, but that's often how I'd end up with quest items (like donuts) before I even knew the quest existed.			"

Posted: November 15, 2014
												Man, I really REALLY wanted to like this game...A big part of that is because I think the world of Shadowrun is an awesome setting for a game, I mean I've never played the tabletop game but I've heard loads about it (primarily from watching Counter Monkey) and I think the idea of mixing a Gibson-esque Cyberpunk setting with elements of more traditional western fantasy (Orks, Elves, Dragons, what have you) is a really cool concept. I'm one of those people who could never really get into games/movies/books about western medievil fantasy settings, they just always seemed kinda boring by design, seen one seen 'em all y'know? Skyrim is one of the only games with that sort of Tolkien-esque world that was able to hold my attention, and that was only because the Nordic stuff was able to overshadow it and make for a more interesting world (Snowy peaks > green fields, just sayin'). But Cyberpunk? I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE cyberpunk!I love the idea of speculating about  a darker future, how technology has changed us for better or for worse, the ethics and practicalities of cybernetics and artificial intelligence, it's just got so much more meat to it. And when you take all that AND THEN add magic and elves and♥♥♥♥♥♥ You've got the potential for some really interesting ideas and stories, and I'd absolutely love to see a game do this setting justice... but this is just not it.First, I'd like to disclaim this by clarifying that I am not entirely versed in the Shadowrun lore, I don't know how true to the books this game is, so I won't judge it one way or another in that respect. I will however say that had I not known anything at all about Shadowrun prior to playing this game I don't think I'd have gotten much from it. Things like the Sixth World and the Great Awakening are referenced but nobody ever explicitly explains what they are or how the dynamics of this world work. Why did magic come back? Where did it go? Where did all the elves, orks, and trolls come from? Who are S.T.A.R.S? What's a Doc-Wagon? None of these things are addressed, and while I understand that this is a game made for and by longtime Shadowrun fans, and as such there's going to be references that only long-time fans will necessarily understand, I get that, but It's not a good sign when I feel like I need to crack a players guide for the tabletop game just to understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, and that's how I felt while playing much of this game. Also, the writing in this game, or atleast the base campaign, is very... eh.I Mean it wasn't bad, it all makes sense, there were no glaring plot-holes or laughably bad exposition, but that's just the thing, it's very... okay. It's not what I'd call bad, but save a few stand out-moments it wasn't all that exceptional either. The idea of building a story around your dead friend hiring you to solve his murder from beyond the grave is an interesting idea but I've seen it done before, and far better. Also, while I definitely think that a noir-style crime drama would be the perfect framework to explore the world of Shadowrun, I just don't feel like the story presented lived up to the setting's potential. But again, this only refers to the Dead Man's Switch base campaign, I understand that many fan-made campaigns acted as a far better realizations of the Shadowrun setting, but I don't really think it's fair to include user-made content in a review like this.I think one of the major things that kills this game for me is the fact that it tries to be a throwback to old-school CRPGs, but it's completely linear, and doesn't give you the kind of freedom one would come to expect from a CRPG. There are very few optional missions or objectives to speak of, and while there are multiple ways to complete many of the objectives, much of the time it feels less like a choice, and more like a calculation (I recall one situation where a dialog choice asked me if I wanted to pay this guy 100 creds for what he knows or 50 creds. No speech check, no skills or disciplines involved, flat question of ""would you like to pay more money or less for the same information?""). The Dialogue trees in general just feel pretty cut and dry to me, very ""nice response/jerk response/witty response,"" much of the time, and it just comes off as boring to me. I do however think that going text only instead of recording some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥voice acting was definitely the right thing to do, in my mind CRPGs have always been about replicating the experience of reading a good book in the context of an interactive environment, and when a game like this adds unnecessary voice acting it sometimes kills the experience, at least for me, and since quite a bit of the actual written dialogue is pretty damn good despite the plot in which it takes place, I am glad they went this route.The turn-based combat is actually one aspect of this game that I thought was pretty good, I mean it's pretty much XCOM light but that's okay, it functions very well and doesn't feel out of place in the setting or genera. I do feel like melee weapons were made somewhat under-powered, which is disappointing to me as I decided to play a Street Samurai specializing in melee and shotguns. Also, this game seems to have some kind of percentage skewing problem in which you seemed to miss ""70% chance"" shots 80% of the time, but that might have just been my rotten luck. Other then that the combat seems to work just fine for what it is.Another aspect of this game that I found a very mixed bag is the aesthetic, the backgrounds for one thing look fantastic, they're all hand-drawn in the classic CRPG style, and they do the seemingly impossible task of making the aesthetic of a grimy, neon soaked, cyberpunk world look beautiful (all-be-it with a little too much blue-saturation for my tastes). The in-game models on the other hand... not so much. I understand, this game was kick-started, they were on a budget, and as someone who doesn't have a very beefy PC I am rather grateful that they didn't emphasize graphical fidelity and turn the game into a performance hog, but that said, I do think they could have put a little more polish into making the in-game models match the backgrounds a little better, as it stands they just kinda clash and it creates a very odd contrast, it just doesn't look very good.I have other criticisms I'd like to level at this game, the character customization was a little lacking for my tastes (especially the outfit choices), some of the character portraits look better then others, and cyberware is drastically underplayed (which is one of my favorite aspects of the cyberpunk setting, so that's especially disappointing to me), but at this point I'm nearing the level of nit-picking so I think it's about time to wrap this up. I feel like a total jerk right now, because this is a kickstarted game I'm talking about here, it's a miracle this game was even made at all, and as a budding Shadowrun fan myself I am glad that it exists and is introducing the setting to other people. However at the end of the day the mark of a good game is whether or not I feel truly engaged in it, feel self-driven in playing and enjoying it, and look forward to playing it some more as soon as I power it down, and Shdaowrun Returns just didn't do it for me.I have been informed that Dragonfall fixed many of the problems I had with Returns however, so I do intend to give that a go when I can, and I really hope that turns out to be true because Shadowrun deserves a game to truly do it justice, and this just ain't it.

			Does this kickstarter funded revival of a classic 16-bit RPG franchise meet expectations? Reviewed by Trent Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

 Kickstarter has proven itself to be an exciting tool for gamers disenchanted with the the games being pushed out be major publishers. Last year Kickstarter exploded with projects promising to revive classic gaming franchises and bring new releases that embrace classic gaming conventions. Shadowrun Returns is one of the first major kickstarter releases to come to market and it's success or failure to impress will inevitably shape gamers trust of the kickstarter. Based on a pen and paper RPG, two completely different Shadowrun titles were released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The shadowrun universe is a unique combination of high fantasy races like elves and dwarfs and a cyberpunk world. Shadowrun Returns offers an original campaign, turn based tactical combat and a robust editor that allows players to create their own campaign.Your created character has struggled after a shadowrun gone bad and is contacted by one of your old crew members from that run named Sam Watts. The catch is that Sam has been murdered and his message is pre recorded, in it, he offers you 100,00 nuyen if you are able to bring the person who killed him to justice. As it turns out, Sam has been slain by a notorious serial killer, the Emerald City Ripper. The quest to identify the ripper takes you through drug dens, shadowrunner bars, the National Transportation Safety Board, a mental hospital, a cult's worship center and into mega corp territory. The narrative is very noir inspired with its femme fatals, seedy locations and nihilistic denizens. The script is peppered with slang that is simultaneously ridiculous and enriching. This is especially important since Shadowrun Returns features no voice acting. The regulars of the Seamstress Union, your quest hub for much of the game, are usually up for a little chat and even the merchants are on the loquacious side, sharing their personal stories before hocking their wares. Oddly enough, most of the shadowrunners that accompany your character on missions are mute. There are a handful of optional tasks and even fewer optional missions to pad your coffers. It's ultimately a refreshing experience since your character and the supporting cast are fueled solely by their own personal gains and vendettas instead of high-minded, self aggrandizing world saving exploits.Tackling your missions involves navigating isometric maps, extracting information from the locals and of course engaging in turn based tactical combat. Exploring the sections of Seattle that host your missions isn't often rewarding. On occasion you will run across a grenade or a med kit for taking the trouble to look around before chatting with the next NPC that points your party in direction of the critical path. Fortunately, Shadowrun Returns often makes finding the way to your next objective engaging by asking you to so some puzzle solving, detective work and smooth talking. When the need to fight arises, combat starts immediately without any transition screens and props that litter the environment becomes all important cover. The turn based combat will have you analyzing the positioning of your units, managing action points and deciding which skills and spells to use. There are also elements in the environment to take advantage of, Riggers can send their drones through vents and Deckers can enter the Matrix to hack turrets, security cameras and swipe information to fence for funds. Turns in Shadowrun Returns are not governed by stats; there is simply a player phase and an enemy phase which makes streamlines planning. A large emphasis is on ranged combat since firearms are generally more powerful though melee attacks provide secondary effects like taking away a target's action points in addition to health. A wide range of buffs and debuffs can also swing the conditions on the battlefield in your favor.Where much of the difficulty in Shadowrun comes in is through the use of overwhelming numbers. Often enemy encounters are lopsided and several missions have you face down endless waves of enemies until a given task is complete. Careful planning and making use of the environment makes these missions more than manageable. In fact, on the whole, Shadowrun is a bit on the easy side if you build an offense based class. Instead of gaining levels, completing actions earns your character karma. Karma can be spent on stat increases that progressively become more expensive as they increase. In addition there are base stats that must be leveled to level a subset of stats that are associated with that particular stat. All of the other shadowrunners that your character hires are not customizable in any way. While this fits into the lore of Shadowrun, it can make the game more difficult if you choose to play as a specialized support character.The futuristic Seattle rendered in Shadowrun Returns is quintessential cyberpunk with hand painted interiors and cityscapes. The hand-painted aesthetic is very attractive and distinct and most of your surroundings are packed with details.  Most everything not associated with the Mega corporations are dingy and filthy and bathes in neon light. Unfortunately, some of the miliue can feel lifeless since there are few animated assets present. A few particle effects would have gone a long way toward making the streets of Seattle much less static. Characters are very minimalistic and their animations are modest. Detailed character portraits make up for this and do a commendable job communicating some personality. The music is handled by the composers of the original soundtracks for the Genesis and SNES games and as one would expect it has a large electronic influence. It's a catchy soundtrack that pays homage to it predecessor while properly aiding the tone of Returns.  Shadowrun Returns is one of several games that has to shoulder the heavy burden of gamers expectations from Kickstarter funded games and it has held up it's part of those expectations admirably. Harebrained Schemes has delivered several balancing patches and has offered excellent support for Shadowrun Returns and it's quality is quite exceptional. It's cyberpunk noir narrative is highly enjoyable with it's cast of characters motivated by very personal circumstances rather than the need for glory and heroism. Combat is simple but flexible, offering an appreciable degree of options for taking down foes. It's also a bit easy, linear and has a modest presentation but all of this is easily forgiven since it's price is a third of a tiple A game. Shadowrun Returns is an excellent example of what made classic RPGs special while reminding us how far the genre has come. Now, let's hope that Wasteland 2 and Broken Age also impress.			"

												Lacks any real depth or replay value like I was (realistically) hoping for. If you want a good Shadowrun game with replay value, play the Sega Genesis version, on an emulator of course. The game feels so ""look but don't touch"" with how linear it is and the lack of any real exploration that it should have been. Feels like a browser-based flash game and overall a REAL disappointment for people like myself that know how fascinating and fun the world of Shadowrun could and should be.			"

												A solid if streamlined RPG. THe biggest plus point for me was the story. It's well written and had enough depth to keep me keen to discover more.  Combat is straight forward enough and after a few fights you should have the basics mastered even if you have never used this type of turned based fighting before. You willl most often engage in combat as part of a group. Unlike tradidtionl RPG's where you meet characters and they tag along for as long as you need them Shadowrun returns takes a different approach. Most of the characters you encounter will not stick around for more than a quest ot two. They all have thier own agenda's and will not follow meekly in line behind you and your cause. To build up a ""party"" you hire companions from a list. This was a slight drawback for me, party characters did not feel like characters. They have zero dialouge and interaction with your character so feel more like pieces of gear rahter than actual people. All in all thou its a really enjoyable experience. a good 7/10 for my money.

												Fun but short. Fun but a little simplistic. Fun but a bit too limited. The key word here is ""fun"". There's a lot of criticisms you can hurl at this game, after all. 12 hours to complete the game from start to finish with quite a lot of reloading and a few pauzes included isn't all that much for an RPG. The world is location-based and the story is extremely linear with no choice of where to go. Interaction with the world is very low and even loot is unheard of. In short: people expecting a Baldur's Gate experience were extremely disapointed with this game and I can see why.BUT, despite all the short comings, the core gameplay is very solid. Combat feels right, the skill system feels almost perfect, the characters are fun, the story entertaining and the backdrops are beautifully drawn and crisp. What is in the game, is done really well - the game's main weakness is you constantly wishing it was more ... more interactive, more side quests, more freedom, etc.			"

												Took 17 hours to complete.I loved it!There is a LOT of reading. All dialogue, and this game has a lot of story content, is text based.Good for playing 5 min or 5 hours at a time.The combat is Xcom like, graphics and animations are less of a focus though.The world seems well developed, classes seem balanced enough. It's all turn based, which is great for me. There is nothing that happens that you need to respond to in any fixed amount of time. This means you can get up and get a drink in the middle of combat with no trouble, or during a dialogue sequence. You can save at almost any point as well. This helps when you don't know how long you are going to be able to play for.			"

												Even though I absolutely loved Shadowrun Returns, I can't just unconditionally recommend it. This is because you will only be able to properly enjoy this game if you like reading, since this game has a lot of text and no voice acting. But after a short period of getting used to it, it will feel like someone had combined a good book with a fun video game. However, just like a book, this game is very linear. Personally, I didn't really mind that, because I prefer a good, linear story over a crappy one with 30 different endings. It all comes down to personal preference, but if you're like me and don't need constant action to be entertained, this game might be a gem you have yet to discover.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a first installment of the Shadowrun Returns trilogy (followed by Dragonfall and concluded by Hong Kong). A kickstarter success, the project led by Jordan Weisman, the creator of the Shadowrun tabletop role-playing game met its funding goal of $400,000 within 28 hours. The game ultimately had gathered $1,895,772. The first installment in the series comes with one story campaign called “the dead man switch” - which takes about 12 hours to complete. The story itself consists of two distinctive parts: first 4 to 5 hours you're tracking down a serial killer, and the rest 7-8 hours you are fighting crazy doomsday cult. The story concludes with you stopping the invasion... of giant spiritual bugs representing ancient evil. Sigh.The combat is weak too- it is extremely slow, repetitive and plain stupid. The only saving grace is that no predetermined class approach guaranties a lot of freedom in character building (same goes for roleplaying as well). Honestly, the story and combat are pretty weak, but that's not the point. The point- SR R is a prologue, first act, exposition if you will, to one of the best game trilogies in recent years. It misses on story and combat, but it menages to create a feel, to add some context and to set a stage to the amazing second act (Dragonfall), and good third act (Hong Kong) So in conclusion- if you have some time to spare- start at the beginning, and play Shadowrun Returns first, before attempting Dragonfall or Hong Kong. If you don't- go for the Dragonfall and Hong Kong, you cant afford to miss them. They are THAT good. P. S. If you re playing Shadowrun Returns first, then lower your expectations and remember 2 simple things: firstly- its an introduction of the setting, and secondly- it gets better with second and third games in the series.P.P.S. While tracking down serial killer, you come across a suspicious and creepy man at the crime scene. He' s mumbling something about how he loves to strangle kittens and that his mother never loved him. ""Leave him"" says the game, we still have 10-12 hours to investigate these strange murders.10 out of 10, would investigate strange murders again.			"

												I reccommend this game, but only with one big asterisk next to it. This game is good... in potential.Dead Man's Switch is fun, but feels kinda short, and that's really all you get at the onset. The real good of this game is the fact that it's a way to both tell your own stories, run campaigns with numbers attached for others, or enjoy those campaigns that people toss up on the workshop or otherwise.The best part, to me, is the full ability customization. Rather than limiting you to the severity of most of the actual tabletops, this game does its own thing, more like the old console games back in the day, rather than duct taping itself to the tabletop rules like most tabletop video game adaptations. You wanna play an 'wared up ork street sammy and pick up a couple spells just for that special occasion? Go nuts. You wanna play a luddite mage and sneak in a few points to make yourself stupidly good with a sniper rifle? Have fun.Honestly, my only major complaint is that the availability of character customization options is incredibly limited. One face per race/gender combo, and your only real options are a selection of like 10 hairstyles and colors shared across all races, genders, and classes. And the troll looks like a spiky idiot at that. Top it off with the fact that armor only comes in one piece deals, and you're gonna be seeing a lot of a very blah character for a good long time.But if you can get around looking like the same jackass with a bad picture for the whole game, then you pick this♥♥♥♥♥♥up and play the hell out of it.(Note: I havent played Dragonfall yet, so this review doesnt include that. Maybe Dragonfall dispenses pure endorphins, idunno, it costs 15 bucks on its own on top of the game, it had better.)			"

												Ah Shadowrun.Being developed by some of the leading heads of the franchise you sure get that feeling when playing the game.Sure some things could have been better - the combat system/abilities/weapons could have been a bit more complex and imo far more of the stuff should have been taken over from the pen&paper system but graphics, sounds, dialogues and story all make up for that and just feel right when the playing the game - plus they provided a nice modding platform to statisfy different needs. :]The Dragonfall expansion is even better.(still yearning for a multiplayer mode here :p )			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun return to the venerable Shadowrun universe.  It has a healthy retro flair to it, both using a classic Shadowrun time period and an interface that would not be out of place in RPGs from the turn of the millenia.The included base campaign ""Dead Man’s Switch"" makes for a good entry point for those new to Shadowrun.  The treatment of the Shadowrun setting is excellent and is one of the high-points of the game.  Classic Shadowrun character archetypes are represented, a few familiar faces from previous Shadowrun stories make appearances, and the cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world is generally a joy to explore.  The writing is fittingly hardboiled, if sometimes a bit campy, for the neo-noir plot.  The soundtrack compliments the setting well and there are some very clever musical references to the classic Shadowrun game on the Super Nintendo.Regrettably, ""Dead Man’s Switch"" is a rather linear experience.  The writing style is engaging, yet the plot feels somewhat stock.  Most unfortunate, however, is the lack of balance for all character types; certain builds are less useful than others.  Hackers in particular seem to be short changed, as they rarely have opportunities to use their specialities.  Lastly, the game is a bit on the easier side, great for folks either new to the genre or people who are interested only in following the story, but it does include a scaleable difficulty for those who would rather their time in the shadows to be lived on a razor’s edge.Beyond the included campaign ""Dead Man’s Switch,"" Shadowrun Returns hosts a series of mod tools to allow for player created adventures and content.  As of this writing, there are already some very fun player created missions and campaigns available on the Steam Workshop.Overall, I really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns.  Though it has some shortcomings, I found them to be far outweighed by the games strengths.  It’s a game I can easily recommend, especially for fans of RPGs like Fallout, Neverwinter Nights, or the old Infinity Engine games.  And should you have an interest in discovering the world of Shadowrun this is a great place to start.			"

												My first experience with Shadowrun was the old genesis title. After that some friends got into shadowrun and G.U.R.P.S... along with alot of other table top games. Played a bit, had some fun... was fun while it lasted.Then I kept seeing news about 'new games in the shadowrun universe!' popping up, but never saw anything concrete. Then this game came along and I scoffed.Turn based rpg's... so oldschool. Nevermind the fact that we all loved those games... I assumed it wouldn't be any fun. It has the same general style of oldschool games (If you never played oldschool tactical RPGs... think somewhat like XCom).The different weapon styles allow for some interesting fighting, although honestly the later games are much better at this. Magic isn't overpowered or underpowered... and can be quite interesting in some situations. I had alot of fun playing a decker (hacking isn't half bad, but is much better in the followup games), and the story is interesting as well. Lets you feel just how hopeless life is in this universe.Buy it if you want a good read, and love noir films or style of story.			"

The writing isn't anything to really write home about but it was good enough to keep me interested and the game has its fair share of likable characters. The combat is also surprisingly fun. I usually dislike WRPG combat but SR's combat was the right kind of difficulty on Normal and it never really threw bullcr*p at you. The game isn't without its problems though, Deckers are absolutely useless aside from certain plot-dictated battles so you should never play as one or have one in your team unless the game tells you otherwise. I was rolling a Physical Adept and I definitely recommend them, they're great. From what 've read, the game didn't allow you to save in battles which I could definitely see being very frustrating but they fixed it so it’s no longer an issue.Overall SR is well worth the price and I'm really looking forward to playing Dragonfall because I hear it’s even better than the vanilla campaign.

												I bought this when it was on sale for $2.99, and would definitely recommend it at that price.I knew very little about the Shadowrun setting going into this game, and seeing fantasy and sci-fi blended together so seamlessly is one of the main reasons that I enjoyed it.The biggest complaint that I have (and the reason I wouldn't recommend paying $14.99) is that the main campaign feels a little like several smaller games stitched together -- several mechanics (such as ""decking"") are not available in all levels, characters float in and out of your party, and the the story takes a very weird turn about halfway through.

												If you ever played Pen & Paper Shadowrun, or better yet, the Super Nintendo and/or Sega Genesis Shadowrun games, this game is perfect for you. It's essentially a sequel of sorts to both games, and a revival of Shadowrun in video game RPG form. It feels like you have a GM running a PnP Shadowrun campaign for you from start to finish. Even if you don't know Shadowrun, but like The Matrix, Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic or Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi, and older Computer RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights or the like, then you'll probably love this game. I know I do! As a Kickstarter backer who paid 3 times what Steam asks for it, I'm more than happy with my purchase! Simply superb! Can't wait for the Berlin DLC, and more User-Generated Content.			"

												the good: excellent graphics and sets the shadowrun world ambiance well enough. Am biased tho, as I had played the rpg a handful of times, and enjoyed the setting. plus the rpg system was good. wish the game used those rules a bit more.the bad: gameplay wise: skills are boring, and redundant. eg. pistol, submachinegun and arguably shotgun are all inferior weapons to the assault rifle....so no reason to put points in anything but assault rifle. even the special abilities you unlock for the various skill paths are all so ineffective or simply, meh. Magic builds end up doing simply reskinned things that gun builds do. i.e. magic is nothing unique (apart from one or two utility spells). Same goes for drone rigging or even decking into the matrix. its all exactly the same as if you just created a gun build.the devs need to redo the skills trees and don't make shooting the same as spells the same as decking the same a rigging. its all too much the exact same experience.the deadman's switch story: its a decent story. i enjoyed it, the dialogue (even though it did not matter what you selected) and the npcs.conclusion: recommend to buy when on sale			"

												I played Shadowrun in the early 90's.  I played the pen and paper RPG religously.  I read the books, and to this day, the 2XS/House of the Sun series by Nigel Findley are two of my all time favorite books, period.  The SNES game was intrepid, a game that I still go to every now and then because it was so much fun even when you could speedrun the thing in less than 20 minutes.So I'll base my review of this game on why I bought it:  I bought it because it is Shadowrun.  In my opinion Shadowrun has only successfully been represented once in a video game, and that is the SNES iteration.  Why?  Because it has everything a good table of friends had when they pried open their books and began tallying up the details of their runs.  Your character, a (basically) faceless dude who is slumming after a hard-knocks life of violence and heartbreak, suddenly becomes the target of a major corporate plan that by the grace of whatever god might exist, he lives when he isn't supposed to live.  The 16 bit game has everything you'd expect, barring the limitations of a directional-pad and 8 buttons:  A ""matrix"" to hack, complete with I.C.E. to fight, optional data logs, and upgrades to the way you interface with computers scattered throughout the world.  Magic to weild, nifty guns to play with, ""random"" enemy encounters and a handful of bosses.  Environments ranging from the urban sprawl to sewers to looming corporate towers.  The 16-bit SNES Shadowrun satiated the pen and paper fan's thirst for real world recognition of a game that too often was overlooked in the shadows of Cyberpunk and D&D.  As a kid, I didn't know anyone who played Shadowrun who ever dabbled in other dice rolling games.  That's what set it apart, at least for me and my friends.  We didn't have to squeeze into the typical stereotype of pen and paper gaming.  We could walk into the hobby shops and have virtually anything at our disposal, and nobody could ""talk shop"" with us because all the conventions considered ""normal"" in other games just didn't apply to Shadowrun.  Games could last for weeks, and to me, Shadowrun was Risk while D&D looked like Candyland.  There was no comparison.  The lore, the possibilities in character development, there is not one single thing I can look back without remembering fondly, except for the fact that FASA handled this gem so poorly that it eventually killed it.  I am going to give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  I have not enjoyed it.  None of the charm I associate with Shadowrun exists in this game.  I am rating it high simply because another Shadowrun product was created and released, keeping the brand alive and fresh.  I'm rating it high because it has done so well, assumingly amongst people who are used to playing games that follow the same vein.  I'm rating it high because I love Shadowrun, but no, I don't like this game.  I'm sorry.Maybe it isn't for me, but I hope that the critical acclaim it's recieved will lead to more Shadowrun products, and yes, I will buy them all, and hope that one of them suits my individual tastes.  I don't have time anymore, nor do I have the same friends who would dedicated 8 hours of their evenings to sitting around a table arguing about that homeless guy we didn't heal who turned out to be a decker that could have helped us stall a squad of drones while we got shot up trying to escape an Orc brothel.  This game here, will sit on my massive backlog and maybe at some point I'll give it a shot, if not only to see Jake's face one more time.  Buy this game, support the love and heart that went into making it.  If you aren't me, you'll probably love it enough to play more than a couple hours. "

 TL:DR Shadowrun Returns is the name of a classic-style RPG, but it's really just a venue for telling stories in its long-dormant fantasy universe. What you're really getting when you buy it is a short but well-written tale of murder and conspiracy called The Dead Man's Switch, access to community-created content  and just enough of an isometric roleplaying game and turn-based tactical combat to get by. Pros: Great settingWell-told story Cons: Few real choicesDisposable mercs			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent game.  Even though there's a graphical interface and pretty pictures, it's an old-school, turn-based, text driven game.  There's a lot of reading to do, but that's not a negative.  Instead, the writing is very nicely done and your brain fills in the details we normally get with fancier graphics and super-duper cutscenes and voice acting.  It's really nice. There are several areas where the game falls down a bit:- Pacing:  about halfway through the story you start wondering if this is the last scene or not.  The story implies an ending, but doesn't get to it for a while.- Dialog choices:  adding more Charisma is supposed to open more dialog choices.  But, as far as I can see, there were only four or five places where those additional dialog choices existed.  Plus, I believe that there was only one type of extra dialog choice that was used more than once in the game.- Inability to progress:  because the story goes from one area to the next with no ability to go back or do other things, you can get to a point where you're stuck.  Maybe you need more money to hire a team or buy stuff.  If you don't have it, you're SOL -- there's no way to go off to earn it and come back.- Mission ambiguity:  when you're given a mission, you're told to buy a team to help you.  Yet, you don't know enough about the mission to know if it's purley physical or will involve decking.  So, you really don't know who to put on the team.  This is made a bit worse by the design choice of not assembling a permanent team that you develop and train.  With a permanant team, you could produce multi-talented people to cover all the gaps.- No sharing:  you can't move items from one character to another.  This is especially troublesome with things like med kits and resuscitation kits.  I ran into many cases where the character carrying those resuscitation  kits died and I could neither transfer one out to another character before-hand or walk over to the corpse and take one out of his pack afterwards.- Development tree:  some of the character developement tree doesn't seem to be of much use.  For instance, I played a Decker.  Theoretically, I should have focused on the Intelligence/Decking aspects of the tree.  Yet, Decking only happens in a few spots in the game.  Since the character you're playing is the single point of failure for the whole game (i.e., if he dies, the game is over -- whereas if a team mate dies, you can resuscitate him or carry on without), you're better off focusing on pure physicality and survivability and hiring the specialists as needed  (assuming you knew when they'd be needed).Of course, I've got to temper that by saying that all of that stuff is based on the sole developer-provided scenario.  There's another one in the Dragonfall DLC available here and there are oodles available for free in the Workshop.  So, with the proper writing, those issues could go away.  So, the game, especially considering it's a framework for other stories, is decent.			"

												I love tactical combat games, specially if they are turn-based, so this one (the first I played in the Shadowrun series _ I also got Dragonfall and Boston Lockdown on my library) seemed to be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it's subpar in terms of combat and graphics, and the lack of voice acting and controller support (this is always an unforgivable flaw) doesn't help either. So I was leaning on a non-recommendation for this one, but the character and party customization and, above all, the story redeem it. It's not very long (finished it in 21 hours), but this suits the story, which is not an epic, but more of a noir in a cyberpunk setting. Feels like an intro for a larger story, so I suggest buying it on sale. Hope the next installments are better (reviews for Dragonfall are largely favorable), because there's potential for great games, specially if the devs look up to the combat in the XCOM series, while keeping the focus on narrative instead of resource management.

												I bought this when it was on sale for $2.99, and would definitely recommend it at that price.I knew very little about the Shadowrun setting going into this game, and seeing fantasy and sci-fi blended together so seamlessly is one of the main reasons that I enjoyed it.The biggest complaint that I have (and the reason I wouldn't recommend paying $14.99) is that the main campaign feels a little like several smaller games stitched together -- several mechanics (such as ""decking"") are not available in all levels, characters float in and out of your party, and the the story takes a very weird turn about halfway through.

												Shadowrun returns is the first step in a series that just keeps on getting better and it is already pretty good.The unique setting paves the way for a plot that isnt chewed out and interesting to follow. It all feels very cyberpunky and having played the actual pen and paper I am fully satisfied with the translation of systems to a videogame. The characters in game are all unique but dont get explored a whole lot. Unlike later parts you dont really have a crew of people to run with that you get to know better throughout time, just some reccuring allies.Gameplaywise you spend the largest part of the game with turn based combat akin to the XCOM series. Another thing they have in common is a hyperunrealistic amount of 90% hit chance misses. If I hadnt done it all on normal difficulty that would have probably led to quite a few frustrated reloads. You have a very decently large amount of fighting styles to choose from, unlike in later parts you cant put a low priority on fighting and talk your way through things though.The soundtrack is the best in the series so far, though probably not worth buying a 10 dollar DLC for. Give it a listen on its own on youtube or something though, it is pretty cool.The graphics are far from top notch but you never zoom in closer than birds eye view so they still get the job done.All in all if you like the pen and paper or like cyberpunk with fantasy or simply a turn based combat game with decent story I would reccomend it even at full price. Dont expect to get more than 16 hours at the most out of it without modding though.			"

												Lovely art assets, decent writing effort. Story was unfortunately rather railroady and linear. Gameplay is a little sluggish but fairly diverse - unfortunately there's not a lot of reason to diversify beyond making sure to bring a decker on most runs, if you aren't one yourself. most magic, combat drones, summoned spirits, melee combat, all sorts of cool stuff, are about as effective as a gang of goons with guns. which is i guess a balancing effort to try to prevent some class/party composition from being singularly the best. the campaign may have a little replayability with different main character setups. the writers and level designers put in a decent amount of effort to make some of the charisma skills useful in a couple of instances, and there were a few times i cursed having chosen not to be a decker myself for the number of doors, safes, and datavaults that remained closed to me. and of course the possibility of simple bribes comes up on occasion, too. nothing had me more frustrated than going in on a stealth mission too broke to even bribe a humble janitor for info.the campaign is obviously written as a sort of intro to the setting and tutorial of functions, and blatantly hand-holds you a couple of times.matrix combat and hacking is unfortunately stale and boring compared to the irl combat in this game. this is partially a weakness in the shadowrun setting itself, i guess. i cant imagine how boring it must be for a roleplaying group sat around the table to wait for their party's hacker to do a mini-computer-dungeon on his own to enable the adventure to continue. thankfully the campaign levels are typically set up so that your other characters have goons to fight while the decker hacks.the mystery had me genuinely mystified and interested at first, but it kind of got solved in the middle leaving the end of the game to be a cleanup effort. there is a campaign editor/level maker function included which is cool, but not much has been made with it yet, and the interface is daunting to me myself.so yeah consider giving this thing a shot if you like shadowrun stuff.

Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's SwitchDrek or not?Shadowrun Returns has been out for awhile. I'm late to the party but figured I would leave a quick review for anyone that shows up after I did. In keeping with the spirit of today's digital world I will make this brief.GameplayShadowrun Returns is a top down, isometric view computer role playing game (CRPG). Story and dialogue are delivered through text (NFPWDLTR). Combat is tactical and turn based, incorporating gunplay, melee, and magic into a system that plays a bit like Xcom, or Wasteland 2. Combat is handled on a grid with an action point (AP) system. You move your character and any other runners (think mercenaries or other temporary party members) into and out of cover, shooting, swiping, using spells and or abilities to defeat your foes. There is more to it than this but for the sake of brevity I will leave the rest up to you to figure out. One key point to reiterate is that this is turn based. Each unit on the field, both friend and foe take a turn. They move/shoot/swing/cast/use an ability then on to the next unit. If you are going to enjoy this game you must be comfortable with this type of gameplay. This is NOT real time with pause (RTWP) like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.  This is NOT real time top down like Diablo or Sacred. I like all three types of gameplay but your mileage may vary. If you do not like turn based combat then do not buy the game, you won't enjoy it. If you you aren't the biggest fan of turn based but really enjoy RPG's and are interested in the Shadowrun setting then put the game on the easiest difficulty setting, plow through the encounters, and have fun building your character and playing through the fun, albeit linear story. StoryThis is a short (for an RPG) game. The central storyline involves you, a runner, a dead buddy, a murder mystery intertwined with a larger murder mystery intertwined with a larger mystery mystery. That's about as spoilery as I am going to get. The story is passable but it won't knock your socks off or anything. Progression through the story is quite linear, this can be good or bad depending on your mood. If you just want to play a short and straightforward RPG adventure then you will have a good time. If you are looking for something with a branching storyline featuring heavy choice and consequence (C&C) this won't do it for you.Dialogue and story play in tandem with your choice of character quite well however and the game throws ample skill and stat checks at you in dialogue throughout the game. This will provide you with possibilities for higher paying rewards, avoidance of combat (in some situations), chances to receive additional intel, and alternative solutions to some quests.Character Building SystemThe best part of the game in my opinion. I am biased on this as I really enjoy the Shadowrun universe. The blend of high tech and fantasy with cybernetics, hacking the matrix, and wielding magic, all co-existing in the same world is a strong draw for me.The skill based character system is very well done and you can make some really unique builds if you so desire. Once you get a feel for how the stats and abilities work my number one suggestion is to create a fully custom character. The templates provided throw points into stats where you won't need them. Create an idea for your character and try and specialize in two key areas while maintaining a sense of durability that shares a direct relationship with the difficulty you choose you tackle. The only negative in this regard, and it is significant, is the way the hired Shadowrunners have been built. It's almost like the developers either don't understand their own mechanics (unlikely) or just wanted to build a bunch of gimps for you adventure with. If I were to alter this module in any way the first thing I would do is rebuild the stat and ability allocations for all the hired mercs. ConclusionNot drek ...Introductory I think is the best descriptor here. The Dead Man's Switch (the primary story module for Shadowrun Returns) serves as an introduction. An introduction to the gameplay systems, the dialogue system, the storytelling style, and the editor for the game. It feels like an introduction for both the players and the developers and while it leaves plenty of room for improvement I still had a great time.I played from start to finish over the course of one long weekend. Steam says I clocked 15.9 hours.  I played a Human Decker/SMG/Toughguy. My ending stats were something like: (Body -7-, Quickness -7-, Ranged -7-, SMG -3-, Dodge-6-, Intelligence -7-, Decking -7-, Charisma -2-) My main character was always the most deadly in a fight and I could hack the matrix like an awesome nerd. I can definitely see myself playing this again just to run through the story with another build. I already have several character ideas.Recommended for:CRPG enthusiasts that enjoy isometric games with turn based combat and can look past the linear story. Think of it as the introductory module for a larger role playing experience in the Shadowrun universe as imagined by Harebrained Schemes.Not recommended for:Gamers not interested in having all of the story and dialogue in a game deliverd via text. Gamers looking for heavy C&C in the storyline and or branching storylines based on player agency. Gamers who do not enjoy RPG's. Provisional mega bonuses:The game comes with an editor. Make your own Shadowruns!The game runs great on older machines. As of this review I don't even have a video card in my rig and the game ran fine using only my Intel integrated graphics chipset.			"

I couldn't stop building new characters, trying new classes, new ways to beat the game. The level editor and the huge amount of UGC guarantees that you can't get tired of the game or if you ever do you can make your own story. It's a must have for everyone who is familiar with the Shadowrun universe and everyone who likes well thought, atmospheric turn-based RPGs.			"

												I really enjoyed playing the game, although it felt like there's a lot of systems that you can simply skip - for example, I found no use in putting points into Decking or getting most Cyberware, given the rare opportunities to actually use them, it's better to just use a hired gun. The complete lack of voice acting or animated cinematics even during critical portions of the story, such as, uh, the ending, lend to a bit of a low-budget feel. I also wish the game had gamepad support, or at least an option for larger text so I could have played it on my TV like the original back in the day; this is a complaint I could level at the majority of games on Steam, mind you. The game is really quite linear and though my time tracker shows over 25 hours played, much of that was spent on pause or idle, and the game feels kinda short overall. However, what's there is really good. I had lots of fun, and would recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of game, especially at a sale price. I'm looking forward to playing Dragonfall, as I've heard it's an improvement, though I don't expect voice acting there either.			"

For a text review, a modified script is provided below.Shadowrun Returns is a turn based isometric strategy game based in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. Accompanied by dialogue and progression mechanics similar to those found in RPGs, this indie title is a very unique start to a series that seems like it can only get better with more support.Shadowrun features a linear campaign with a highly engaging story that starts out simple and maybe just gets a little ridiculous by the end. But in a world of decking into the matrix, metahuman troll shamans summoning spirits made out of corpses, and drugs basically being entirely replaced by virtual experience chips that are eerily similar to video games? Maybe it's hard to judge when something actually becomes strange. There's plenty of dialogue to read, choices to make, and paths to explore that all come with rewards of additional money, karma, or maybe even just the opposite. The campaign lacks freedom of movement though due to its linear nature, but that's not really a con with this game. It works perfectly fine the way it is, it's just a shame the game is only about 10 hours long. Never fear if you want more content however, the game is fully equipped with modding support and plenty user-made missions and campaigns exist to lengthen your playtime. Some of them even allow you to import your character from the main campaign and continue to make him the epitome of badassedry.Shadowrun's gameplay is similar to other games such as Avernum and XCOM, but seems to borrow far more from XCOM in terms of the fact that you can still miss a lot with a 99% chance to hit your target. Honestly though, it's a lot of fun. The strategy elements will appeal to any fans of the turn based genre and the RPG elements of how the story progresses and how you equip and upgrade your character bring it an appeal to a whole 'nother market entirely. You see the game gives you Karma instead of levels or experience, and they are essentially skill points that you earn by completing objectives, and more of by sacrificing monetary rewards to do the 'right' thing. These skill points plus purchasing gear are entirely how you shape the efficiency of your character. My only complaint with how the gameplay actually works is  the movement. When you're out of turn based movement it is very obvious that the characters are still running around in turn mode since there is a constant pause like it's processing the start of a new turn every couple of seconds of running. And when you are moving, you are incapable of quick saving your game til at least one full second after you finish moving. This makes life for save-a-holics like myself a little inconvenient, but it makes it even more evident that they didn't bother making an actual real-time freeroam mode and just reskinned the turn-based movement. It's a shame, but it's no reason to be turned away from the game.A reason to to turned a way from Shadowrun would be that it suffers from a lot of bugs. In fact, if you have a bug and google it to get help, not only will you find plenty of persons with the same bug in the same place, but you'll find others who have a completely different bug in the same place as well! The steam version is notably the buggiest version of the game. It features extra bugs in any potential area and even features a game-breaking save-wiping bug that makes it so that if you want this game, I'd recommend NEVER buying it on steam. The GoG version being the least buggy that I've found and lacks any game-breaking bugs that I've found in 23 hours of playing it. If you're going to get this game, get it on GoG.The graphics of this game are understandably bad for today. The game was released almost four years ago and was a difficult project that even had to be kickstarted to get off the ground, and thankfully they put most of their effort into gameplay and story rather than making it a beauty to look at. The nitty gritty feeling of the graphics however really helps to immerse you into the scary world that is Shadowrun. So long as you can ignore occasional glitches such as shooting an SMG and seeing the bullets come from the opposite corner of the map and flying off to who knows where instead of coming out of the gun like they're supposed to, the graphics really shouldn't be a con.The soundtrack is something I'd like to describe as cyberpunk to the extreme. It definitely fits the setting and the sound effects are fine, but no standing ovation. The game however does lack any voice acting whatsoever which is good to note, because if you do not want to do a LOT of reading, then this game is not for you.Overall, Shadowrun Returns is a charming indie title so unique in every way I really don't think you should miss it. It gets an 8/10 from me. It was reaching for 9/10, but all the problems with bugs and certain flaws stomped it down a bit, making it just barely retain an 8/10. Is it worth the full price of $15? Only yes if you plan on downloading and playing a bunch of user-created storylines. The base game is too short to justify $15 however, being barely longer than the bare-bones campaigns findable in many AAA first person shooters these days. I definitely recommend buying this if you like strategy or experiencing new and unique settings, but buy it on sale unless you definitely plan on playing every single mod you can. Just do NOT buy it on steam unless you're ok with potentially dealing with having your save games wiped or a plethora of other steam-exclusive bugs that have been reported.			"

												After 11 hours I finished the game and it was a good ride. There are good things about the game and then there are things that could be (way) better. Let's start with the good things first:It certainly feels like a Shadowrun game. I've played the pen & paper RPG in the 90s and during the first minutes, the game gets the atmosphere right. It feels like the Seattle of 2050 that I had in my head (or at least very close to it). The artwork is well made and the soundtrack works nicely to support the setting.You can choose how to play your character. While the decking part is a bit underwhelming, the choice between weapons or magic is there and quite well balanced. There's a good amount of freedom how to build your character and while it doesn't have a big influence on the outcome of the game, it still gives the game some depth.Depth... that's the real problem with the game. The story is well written and while it does have a quite large number of twists, in the end it works well. The game is too linear though. There is exactly one optional 'Mr Johnson' run and that's simply not enough in a Shadowrun game. The game feels too much 'on rails' and while you can grab a few optional items for additional creds, there's almost no content you can miss out on. That in turn means there's almost no replay value except if you want to check out magic instead of weapons (or vice versa).I still recommend the game, because it does give you a good amount of content and especially if you like Cyberpunk. 15 € is too much for it though, so grab it in a sale (they are frequent enough). I'm looking forward to play Dragonfall and see if they added a bit more flesh ;)			"

												Please buy this game.Games like this are not released often enough, which is why I backed this on kickstarter a year ago.At the same time, it feels new-- glossier and more intuitive than I expected. Accessible, even.The writing is wry and pleasantly true-to-form for the canon/world of Shadowrun. NPCs are well-characterized without too much exposition, much like in a good tabletop game.Combat feels right, and very familiar to tabletop runners/fans of the SNES game. Multiple approaches to almost every situatoin, delightfully turn-based yet explosive/well-scripted enough to appeal to a newer set.Lastly, I want more games like this to come out. Need, even. Let's spend money on clever, exciting things(especially kickstarted things that were delivered on time and on budget). Vote with your dollars to tell indies and megapublishers both that this is the kind of game you'll buy.Please.			"

												Very nice game. I didn't expect it to be that good. Pluses:+ Visual style! + Interesting story. You investigate the murder of your friend. Of course, everything is not what it looks like.+ Character skills. There are lots of them. You have to be careful with what you choose as you can't revert it.+ Combat. I like turn-based combat system. Here it is a lot of fun. You have to think your strategy through very thoroughly.+ Great music!+ Memorable characters!There are a few minuses as well:- game is pretty linear which is bad for RPG. There are a few places where you can use your charisma skill and pass through without fighting, but that isn't enough. - No point in replaying the game.- It isn't really a minus for me, but the characters aren't voiced. So you have to read everything: dialogues, thoughts of your character. Some prefer to listen to all of that, so it is sort of a minus.All in all, I don't regret playing it. 8 out of 10!			"

												This game is good stuff. Why? Well, it isn't for everyone obviously, but the game is filled with enough variety and content (as well as has great people always making more stuff for it.) that it feels very very good. Also, depending on your class also means you get to choose how you want to approach things. Are you there to just kick down doors and give everyone a healthy bullet diet? You can! Want to have a lot of bots, enemy turrets, and other such things do that for you? You can!Also, delving deeper into things can lead you to decisions that you might have initially considered. Devil is in the details and all that. Overall, I would recommend this game, and its extra DLC stuff, cause it is done that well. Have fun, and happy running.			"

												I would recommend Shadowrun Returns to any RPG enthusiast.A Kickstarter success story, Shadowrun Returns is a classic cyberpunk RPG featuring elves, orks, and magic as well as cyberspace infiltrations.I spent over 25 hours unraveling SR's engaging, whodunit-style story, and was definitely hungry for more.Even though Harebrained Studios has since released Shadowrun: Dragonfall, Shadowrun Returns remains a solid RPG in its own right.Go buy Shadowrun Returns!

												In an Era where RPG's are filled with shallow mechanics, retardation in character urgency and plots that are as simple as offering  Oprah a piece of your sammich emerges Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall. For those who have been living under a rock I would like to ask 1)How much is the rent over there and 2)How have you not heard of shadowrun returns Dragonfall. Dragonfall is the expansion of the cyberpunk rpg that came out last year. I enjoyed the OC so much that it is probably my third favorite game of all time. The Dragonfall expansion has an ambition to expand on the wonderful world of shadowrun returns. I could write a long review but each time I look at vine videos I am reminded that society's current attention span is...hey a puppy. Basically I will write down some cliff notesWhat Does Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall Improve on?-Level Design-Choices and consenquences-Combat difficulty-Character Interaction-Character Development-Skillchecks-More Mage Class Urgency-More EquipmentWhat Does Harebrained schemes need to work on?-Response time of their game. My menu screen takes a while to respond to a click.-Adept class still needs improvement as it feels a bit lackluster.-Work on those Boss Fights.Final Verdict is Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall 9/10 would ban....sorry about that. 9/10 would play again which I will be doing today with a decker.

												""Shadowrun Returns"" does for the rich Shadowrun universe what ""Baldur's Gate"" did for the Forgotten Realms. Playing through this game was like playing through some of the classic SR adventures, with mysteries to solve, clues to follow, and all manner of unusual individuals to interact with. And firefights, of course. The noir atmosphere is great, and it's quite obvious from gameplay that the creators of the game were fans of the tabletop RPG: there are numerous references to characters and organizations from the gamebooks, some more relevant to the story than others. The music is great, the character creation was satisfyingly customizable: I was able to make a reasonable facsimile of my female Dwarf Decker from the tabletop game with the options present. And the fact that I've been able to play as a Decker and get through the first adventure on Normal difficulty is a testament to the fact that you can play any character type you like and do well. If you're a fan of the original tabletop RPG, I highly recommend ""Shadowrun Returns.""			"

												First off, I want to say that I'm glad someone is trying to revive Shadowrun and it's rich world setting. Unfrotunatly, this did not quite hit the mark.The game was too on the rails for me to enjoy. Shadowrun is an amazing world and you're not allowed to explore it. The stash system makes no sense and is a poor design choice. As far back as SNES, games have allowed you to automatically equip a new item you've purchased and sell your old one or keep it to be stored. Why do my new weapons go automatically to my stash? I purchased it because it was better than what I had currently. There's no excuse for this design to still exist in modern games.The only viable option for your character is Street Samurai as this game decided to keep the poor choices of old isometric games where the game is over if your character dies, even if there are ways to ressurect people. I chose Decker as my class and it was neutered from the awesome experience it should have been. I was squishy in combat and thus had to restart levels multiple times as the AI would target only me and end the fight quickly. I was not presented with an option to enter the matrix to hack things and it was relegated to an automatic dialogue option. I asked other and it doesn't get any better later in the game.I so badly wanted this game to be what Shadowrun deserves but I guess I have to keep waiting.			"

												Shadowrun is a game that has long been waiting for an RPG like this.While you buy this as a whole game, you get so much more.You get the interesting campaign which is around 12 hours long and will keep you engaged. Beyond that, you get the tools to create your own campaign and play other people's. Many games have this, so why does this game having it warrant anything?Well, as with any RPG based on a pen-and-paper game, there's a plethora of campaigns just waiting to be inserted into this game and a lot are already there. Not only do you get an excellent game in and of itself, you get all of the currently-released and upcoming campaigns that will inevitably come.			"

												As a point and click isometric / RPG tactics game veteran, I must say this game is fairly lame.TL;DR... It's Fallout / Fallout II light for the casuals... it's linear, it's mind numbingly boring and just not fun.For those of you that want a more in depth look as to why this is a polished turd, read on...It takes a whole lot of reading and engrossing yourself in this universe to really enjoy it. The entire game is played with a single button... yes, the left mouse button... so talk about a snooze fest. I found myself  controlling the camera movement with the W, A, S ,D, keys just to  break the monotony of only using the mouse to play.The game proceeds like this: You go through a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of dialog, learn some things, more plot holes are formed and you proceed clicking around walking (ever so slowly) around some linear rundown areas of a city. You talk to some more NPC's and choose some more inconsequential dialog options... Then you proceed to get in to a ""tactical"" fight... there's usually only one of these per chapter.I was interested in the game because it looked like a fun tactical RPG game and had stat / profession / skill selections like the original Fallout games but that's about where the similarities die... The dialog to combat ratio is just abysmal. Fallout found that perfect balance of never giving you too much unnecessary dialog / information... It was always just the right amount and then it was off to go shoot some people, even still, Fallout has much richer dialog, you almost crave more of it sometimes. Shadow Run is just the polar opposite... 90% of every chapter is all dialog with a single battle / boss encounter that lasts about 5 minutes, tops.The cyberpunk thing doesn't really do it for me either, a lot of the classes are rather convoluted and redundant... Highly unnecessary and only viable for small portions of the game to perhapes skip a few needless fights that end about as quickly as they start. The best all around class is the Street Samurai... so like you're a street thug with honor... kay... talk about a contradiction. :/I was never in to the Shadow Run lore so that might be why I'm not enjoying this as much, it all seems very familiar and boring. It's just another rip off of the Fantasy / Sci-Fi genre with a Cyberpunk coat of paint over the top... So you have your Trolls, Orcs, Humans, Dwarfs and Elves but they're all dressed in late 90's, pleather ridden esque garbs talking about jacking in to matrix's and carrying uzi's. *puke*If you find it on sale, go for it I guess... but be warned, it's incredibly drab over all... not very stimulating. As a word of advice, don't try to specalize in more than a couple traits because being a jack of all trades / well rounded toon is going to get you killed in the late game.			"

												Until recently, I was somewhat reluctant to recommend this game. I enjoyed Dead Man's Switch, but, like many people, found it to be more of an interactive novel (with tactical interludes) than a role playing game. Playing around with the editor has been a blast, but I know that this isn't for everyone, and neither is playing through User Generated Content (though there's some excellent stuff out there). After the launch of Dragonfall, however, I can post the positive review with confidence. Aside from implementing the much needed save-anywhere system, Dragonfall is a much more engaging campaign on so many levels. It's what Dead Man's Switch should have been, but wasn't. While the main hub is relatively small, you really do feel like the leader of a team of Shadowrunners, and are able to take on a variety of jobs, and complete them in the order that you wish. The jobs themselves, more importantly, feel a great deal more open, with tough choices and multiple objectives, including optional points of interest. The literally two side quests you got in DMS felt like afterthoughts (""oh crap, we forgot to put side quests in and the game launches in a week!""). Here, everything feels lovingly attended to. This is, perhaps, a major advantage of text based story telling. If you're inclined to pick up the relatively robust editor that comes along with the base game, you'll not that your storytelling capacity is only limited by your writing ability and your imagination (the scripting and map building aren't that hard to learn). If you've got the desire and the ability to write, you can craft beautiful and interesting adventures, whether side quest or main, to your heart's content. And that's what HBS has done this time around.In fact, the one thing that hasn't changed is the excellent writing. This isn't high end literature, but it's engaging and interesting all around. It draws you into the world and, in some cases, really captivates you. The charachters, especially your crew members, the fixer, and the occupants of your little slice of berlin, are memorable and interesting to a person. It's unfortunate that this had to be released as DLC. The base campaign had the writing down, but it didn't have the wow factor or the, well, interactivity. If only it had...The setting and the charachters of Dead Man's Switch could have really shone with a similar treatment.Still, better late than never.			"

												This reminds me of a time when good writing was still a priority in roleplaying games.  FASA's Shadowrun pen & paper games were among my all-time favourites back in the 1990s and this game captures the atmosphere and well-fleshed out characters of ""The Sixth World"" perfectly.The adventure is short but the toolset and mod community should provide more than enough justification for the asking price (especially during a Steam sale).If you're a fan of tactics-style RPGs or the cyber-punk genre, you really can't go wrong with this indie-gem.

												Nice throwback! 3/5I would like to first off say, I enjoyed this game a lot, but I did have some problems with it.  What happened to the rest of the world?  The original shadowrun games (I'm talking console not tabletop) had open worlds, free run of the cities, and clues you had to collect.  This is more of a Turn-based 3d scroller.  I felt led the entire time.  I want an open world to explore, shadowruns to do, cyberspace to hack, and random goons/lone star to take out for weapons armor and money.  The thing I loved most about shadowrun was the freedom to just turn it on and try to break into the nearest building and loot it, or mine some data in cyberspace for cash.  This point A to point B style was disappointing.  I don't want to be constantly following the storyline in order to do anything in the game.  I want the freedom to be a shadowrunner.  I'm just glad I still have my Sega and SNES if I want to play a real shadowrun game.			"

												This is good ol' classic Shadowrun, I have a bias, I love the Shadowrun backstory and myth. This game is primarily about two things: First you get a pretty decent campaign and the ability to create all the major Shadowrun character types, it's very story focused and is interlaced with combat sections. It's far more lightweight than most games. The other thing you get is a hell of a powerful editor and the strong likelyhood of an ever expanding pile of 'shadowruns' to go on as people make them. This isn't a game about extreme tactics and strategy, it's fairly deep but the combat isn't the main focus, it's all about the stories. If you liked the SNES version, this is very much like that, if you don't, you might stay away, at least see where folks take this game.			"

												Dragonfall (the DLC campaign) is a great RPG.  As in, Baldur's Gate 2 great, one of the best RPGs in years. Highly recommend if you're into the old BG, Planescape:Torment, Fallout style of turn based games. Seriously fun. Wasn't a fan of the Shadowrun universe but these games are a great introduction to it, loved the game and specially the DLC campaign, very much worth it.			"

												I do recommend this game. Warning though...This is an old school roleplaying game, set in a classic pen and paper RPG background, and it is focused on two features : nice writing/storytelling and nice turn by turn tactical combats. That's it.The two of them are great, especially the writing. You could say the art direction is somewhat strange but interesting, as every piece of level art is actually painted by hand. The mix of 2D and 3D works good enough.But good tactical combats, funny art and great writing doesn't exactly cut it. The hidden strengh of Shadowrun Returns lies in its Editor. The first campaign is actually a (very nice and long) showroom for the level editor. Very good content has already been made by the community and it is far from over. This is a cyberpunk-ish roleplaying game that keeps on giving.If you're not into User Generated Content and Steam workshop, you might want to wait until it gets cheaper. If you're into roleplaying games, if you know the shadowrun universe, or if you crave to create your own stories, just buy the damn game already!			"

												I vaguely remembered the pen and paper version of Shadowrun from my high school years. The game system has been around for some time and has a rich background. I downloaded Shadowrun Returns and enjoyed it thoroughly, bringing back memories of the pen and paper days. While the game itself has a limited use of skill sets, I found the combat enjoyable and the background story fun and different from the norm. Was also good enough that I purchsed the Dragonfall content. That pack utilized a broader range of skills overall, but seemed more focused on the decker class. The two games shine in dialog and content moreso than expansiveness. Both are thoroughly engrossing and have multi-play capabilities in terms of combat difficult settings and different character classes. For the price, it would be hard to beat the quality.			"

												A decent game. The plot meanders, but it's a pretty quick, fun little jaunt. The turn based combat is good, but the balance is iffie. It's not a Divinity: OS by any means, but it's well worth the 10 hours of your time to play it, provided you get it on a price that is comensurate. The worst part of the game is the inclusion of known degenerate Chris Kluwe as a non-playable character. I personally don't like the idea of child molesters being able to buy kickstarter characters in games, but what can you do?			"

												If you've heard rage about this game, don't worry; most of that is from people who severely underestimated the cost of video games development.  A $2 million Kickstarter campaign (which worked out to about $1.2 mil after Amazon and Kickstarter's cuts, which then also had to cover the physical rewards for the backers as well as the game) doesn't mean AAA quality - it means a shoestring budget.  Keep that in mind, and this is a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the Shadowrun universe.Set in the dystopian, cyberpunk future of 2050, in a world where magic and the races of fantasy have returned.  Unlike the last two good Shadowrun games (the FPS should only be considered a Shadowrun game in the context of how NOT to make a Shadowrun game) back on the SNES and Genesis, Returns hews more closely to the turn-based nature and feel of the original pen-and-paper game.  It doesn't exactly port over the ruleset - merely uses a whole new one inspired by the rulesets used by the PnP game's 2nd and 3rd editions.  It's a classless system, meaning you can spend your Karma (what the game calls XP) on whatever aspect of your character you want.  Think your AK-97-totting ork needs some skill with a blade for when the enemy gets up-close and personal?  No problem - just drop the Karma into the relevant stat when you have the chance.  What if you feel your chi-wielding Physical Adept needs a bit of extra ranged oomph but you don't want to spend the money on guns?  Sink some Karma into spellcasting and you can add some fireballs and lightning bolts to the mix.The game does provide a set of Archetypes to pick from during character creation, each one fitting one of six roles in the SR universe - the Street Samurai, who follows a code of honour but mostly focuses on combat and augmenting himself with a lot of cyberware; the Mage, who lashes out with powerful spells; the Decker, who uses his cyberdeck to hack into the Matrix (the internet's successor... no, no relation to the films; Shadowrun was using the term way back in the late '80s); the Shaman, who manipulates the energies of the natural world to aid his companions as well as calling up spirits to fight alongside them; the Rigger, who remote-controls a series of combat drones and the Physical Adept, who focuses his magic inward and make strikes with his fists or a blade more devastating.The Archetypes spend most of your starting Karma for you and (in the included campaign, Dead Man's Switch) set your starting gear.  If you want to spend all that starting Karma yourself, be prepared to start the game with a few guns (I think a pistol, an SMG and an assault rifle) and no spells/drones/cyberdeck/etc.  In addition to the archetypes, you also have five races, or metatypes as the game calls them, to choose from.  In the 2050s, humanity is now metahumanity and consists of humans, elves, dwarves, orks and trolls.Most of them are pretty much what you'd expect - elves are agile and smart, dwarves and tough and stubborn, orks can snap you in two like a dry twig, etc.  Trolls, though, can basically be seen as orks on steroids (an analogy that doesn't quite work as well when there could literally be orks taking steroids) - they're even bigger, even stronger and have bony growths on their skin that act like armour.  Each metatype's drawback is limits on how high certain stats can go - most can raise them to about 10 or 11, but trolls, for example, can't raise their Charisma above six.The combat has something of an XCOM feel to it, save that you can't rotate the camera.  HBS took some of the elements from XCOM Enemy Unknown that worked - the assumption that your team brought more than enough ammo for the job (infinite ammo, but needing to reload) and the high-low-cover system (though flanking doesn't give a bonus to critical hits, just makes them easier to hit).I'll get the negatives out of the way now - at the time I'm writing this, there is no manual save feature.  It only auto-saves on loading screens and there will be times when those are spaced far enough apart to be a pain.  Good news on this front - they're working on a manual save system that should be done at the same time as the first expansion, Dragonfall, but will be applied to the base game and campaign without you having to buy that.  That won't be til about January, though.  Secondly, the included campaign is rather short - tops out at about 12 hours or thereabouts and is rather linear.  Don't go into it expecting the freedom most other RPGs have; Dead Man's Switch is a very story-driven campaign and the events in it only cover a few days.  This next one I don't see as a problem, but there were a lot of people raging about it on the Steam forums after launch - the game has zero voice acting.  They couldn't afford it.  Yes, sadly; this means that you will have to read.  But for the added freedom this gave them in NPC dialogue, I have no problem with that.  There is also very little to actually interact with in the environments (or at least in Dead Man's Switch, this may not be the case in Dragonfall or some user-generated content) so they can feel rather empty at times.The graphics have an interesting, stylised look to them.  It was a big jarring for me at first (I'd binged a bit on the various 4th edition books during the Kickstarter campaign where most of the art's a bit more realistic) but eventually I came to enjoy it.  The character models aren't exactly high-grade, but the camera never really gets close enough for it to be annoying.  You'll be getting a better feel for a character's look from their portrait.  The overall character designs fit the SR universe, though; Detective McKluskly is a good example of this - they've taken an almost stereotypical design of a corrupt detective and turned him into an ork and it works.  Even with the lower-quality of the character models, they still found ways to add little details to them.  Jump over to Google and do a quick image search with ""Shadowrun Returns McKlusky"" and find an image of his character model.  You might notice a tattoo on one forearm.  It's never mentioned anywhere in the game, but that's a tattoo from the UCAS Marines - he's ex-military.This game does come with a full editor that is, relatively, user-friendly.  I say 'relatively' because any editor that involves more than placing terrain and hostile NPCs is going to be complex, no matter how you slice it.  But the coding side of this one is a lot simpler than any other I've seen - using If/Else statements and the like.  It takes some getting used to, but there are tutorials for it on the HBS youtube channel and there's bound to be plenty of fan-made tutorials out there by now.  Most of this game's life will come from the campaigns published on the Workshop, but like any game driven by fan-made content (ARMA, Elder Scrolls, even ol' Neverwinter Nights) it will be at least a year before that side of the game comes into its own.I'd say more about Dead Man's Switch itself, but most of the negatives I feel players could be warned about (or at least worth mentioning here) come with some serious spoilers.  These aren't massive ones, really just mention on why one NPC isn't as tough as the PnP game's books suggested.  What I will say is that it has some phenomenal writing that pulls you into the setting.  There are perhaps some things mentioned that may not mean anything to someone new to the setting, but HBS has a Shadowrun Primer on their website for free download that should help in that respect.  Regardless, they made great use of Shadowrun's iconic slang and the various setting elements (although that does mean anyone familiar with the setting may know what's coming once you start having to deal with the Universal Brotherhood).

												I played through the entire game in about a week, put about 20 hours into it. I've been playing games for quite a while and I have gotten to that point where few games make me want to came back again and again and be excited to come home from work so I can play it. While Shadowrun Returns didn't quite capture the feeling that I used to get it came pretty close and was a nice reminder of how gaming is supposed to feel. The main story was fun, I am looking forward to popping in a workshop campaign in a few weeks. Mechanics feel good, however with the single button comand style (only left clicks) I found that I made few miss clicks when I should not have but there is an option to change that. I look forward to playing an other class later on and with that in mind I would say that this game does have very good replay value. Take it from a biased gamer who you know nothing about, but for my two cents worth it was worth my 15 bucks.			"

												I bought this game having played Dragonfall (stand-alone) and was very disappointed. I expected going 'backward' from Dragonfall would miss out on some UI improvements and such but I was shocked at how short, basic and uninteresting Shadowrun Returns storyline was. The story was poor to say the least; I won't spoil it but I genuinely thought I was in the prologue or something until the 'final boss'... I completed this game in 11 hours, despite seeking all little side quests (it feels like there were none) and talking to everyone possible (much less than Dragonfall). I do not recommend buying this game today but STRONGLY recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which despite being a ""small standalone story"" is infinitely better, more interesting and took me over twice as long to complete. At only £2.20 in a sale it's arguably alright but still, knowing what I do now I'd have skipped the game completely.			"

												Great source material, execution has some flaws but overall a fun game.  A bit oversimplified IMO but that also makes it a friendly, unintimidating introduction to the genre.  The combat mechanics are a bit simplistic, especially for ranged weapons--I can't figure out why none of the newer squad based tactical RPGs like this have copied the excellent Jagged Alliance 2 'spend action points to improve aim' model, which is very flexible and intuitive.  If you haven't played that game, go buy it now, it's one of the all-time best in the genre and has aged extremely well.  The magic and drone aspects of Shadowrun combat are well implemented, so props to the developers for integrating everything so well.The story held my interest, though (spoilers)a deus ex machina sweeps in to help you with the final mission, which I found disruptive.  The writing itself is god-awful at times.  It could have used another couple proofreads (it's/its, comma usage) and stylistically it reads like decent internet fan fiction with some crap parts.  If you're going to do a text-heavy game like this, you'd better make damn sure you have the writing chops to do it.  Hire some damn writers, Bioware and Black Isle didn't seem to have this problem way back in the 1990s.Still, a fun ride overall, and the developers did a great job of capturing the universe.  I recommend playing it on 'Very Hard' which puts you on even footing with the enemy but plays more like you would expect 'Normal' or 'Hard' to.  Choose 'Hard' if you're new to this sort of game.			"

												I've loved Shadowrun for a long time. It was my first tabletop rpg, and it helped foster a love of the happy that is going strong today. For those who don't know, Shadowrun is a setting that takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk future. Corporations are more powerful than governments, and most people are either wretchedly poor or corperate wage slaves with no freedom. But there is a twist. As this dystopia began to develop, magic returned to the world, bringing with it Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls... and Dragons. Think Bladerunner meets Dragon Age. You play as shadowrunners, mercenary criminals who live off the grid and do jobs that are too dirty or difficult for the corporations. You are a theif, assasin, or bodygraud on any given day, operating in the shadows and outside the law. I've always thought that this would make a great setting for a video game, but Shadowrun hasn't had too many adaptations: and the ones we did get weren't great. But Harebrained Schemes thought they could deliver, and took to Kickstarter. And deliver they did. I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns, and the end product was worth the investment. It was a good turn base strategy rpg, along the lines of, say, Fallout, though the setting conjures up comparasions to Arcanum: of steamworks and magick obscura (also recomended). The combat was fun, the graphics looked excellent, and importantly to someone like me, the developers clearly understood Shadowrun, a sense that could not be gained from the poorly received X-box shooter of some years ago. But it was good game, if there were several issues that kept it from being great. A save system that didn't work well, and a story that was a little too linear and static for Shadowrun's traditional style. These issues were tempered by a promise of mission packs and expansions, and a robust editor for the community to create missions of their own. Now they've released the first of those mission packs, Dragonfall, and playing it convinced me to write this reveiw. Because where the original game faltered, Dragonfall soars. A rational save system is finally in, and there is more variety to the weapons, cyberware, and other combat options to make things a little more interesting. And, most importantly, the new campaign is exactly what shadowun should be. It's got interesting characters to talk to, both in your team and in the hub where you go in between missions. It's supports player agency, from the runs you choose to go on to the way you solve those runs. Runs themselves are interesting and often dynamic. Each one has signifigant choices, and I had to think hard about seveal of them. While I could have seen more room to roleplay, for the most part I never felt that my character wasnt' represented in the dialouge choices. And while I like the story of the main game, the story in Dragonfall is much better. It made me care about the characters and the situation far more than the orignal. But most of all, it feels like Shadowun. The runs played exactly like runs I might have written myself for the tabletop game, far more so than the first game. And the balence between story based missions and those just for case works much better than the previous as well. All in all, playing Dragonfall felt just like playing a real Shadowrun game. That is what I wanted when I kickstarted, and I will buy whatever DLC they release as long as they maintain that feeling. So, I heartily recomend Shadowrun Returns, but strongly recomend you buy Dragonfall too- in fact, you should probably start with it over the original games campaign, espeically if you are familier with the setting, but thats a personal choice. But is it right for those who don't know Shadowrun? I still think so. The setting is interesting enough to draw people in, and no previous knoweldge is needed for the actual gameplay, which is entertaining even without feeding into that Shadowrun feedback loop I have. That said, the Berlin Free State setting of the game might be a little bit bewildering, as the game doesn't explain all that much (That said, most shadowrun players probably don't know much about Berlin either - Me included- but at least with the background its easier to get up to speed). For those who don't know anything about Shadowrun, and are willing to put up with the weaker (but still good) story, starting with the first game's story might still be better as it is probly friendler to those who are going in blind. tldr: Shadowrun Returns is a good game, but Dragonfall is even better, doubly so for anyone who knows the setting or has played the tabletop game. If you were on the fence before, Dragonfall makes it a good bet.			"

												--UPDATED REVIEW--No doubt about it, Shadowrun Returns is a Shadowrun roleplaying game engine (built on Unity), not a game. The first campaign released was Dead Man's Swtich. The second campaign is Dragonfall. They are fully standalone campaigns and are really where you find the game of Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is not ""DLC"". It is, in fact, a more robust, more ambitious and (at least as I played it) twice-as-long campaign compared to its predecessor.This is really important to recognize, especially if you haven't played through Dead Man's Switch, or maybe you didn't like it. It's like playing a roleplaying campaign under two different GMs with two different encounter design styles and stories to tell. You definitely don't have to play Dead Man's Switch at all to enjoy Dragonfall.Since I played Dead Man's Switch, many things have been improved / patched. For instance, scripting in the game's dialog has allowed you to often call on your teammates' skills to help interject in a hacking (decking!) or knowledge based problem. It's not perfect, but it's much, much better. The save system is also now fully featured, which was my biggest complaint about Shadowrun Returns (save when you want, OMG!).I don't really like how little influence you have over your party's inventory, but I kinda like the narrative implication that they are in charge of themselves, and you're fully in charge of what characters get to come with you on your runs.The art style, the characters, the rules, the format, etc. they're all the same as you'd remember from Dead Man's Switch. Where Dragonfall shines uniquely is in providing an environment that is far more free than the campaign of its predecessor. I believe most computer roleplaying game fans will greatly prefer Dragonfall. There is a town hub where you are free to shop and pick up side quests, unlike the compact hideout in Dead Man's Switch. Many combat situations have multiple approaches compared to what Dead Man's Switch offered. The characters are more interesting, have more personality, are more plentiful (and more useful), and are better written than those in the prior campaign (reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 2). The story also goes from the small criminal raids of a simple shadowrunning team to the gigantic world-changing epic story that RPGs are famous for.That said, Dead Man's Switch is still a friendlier, smaller, and more digestible introduction to the Shadowrun world, so I really do recommend playing that campaign first if you're just diving in for the first time.I'd also like to add that in Dead Man's Switch I played a shotgun-toting, robot-driving hacker, which is basically my ideal cyberpunk character idea. I had a great time! I was originally a little underwhelmed with Dragonfall when I started as a melee fighter because it lacked the gimmicks of my prior loadout (but I'll be darned if I only play one archetype in an RPG). In fact, the lackluster start is what kept me from really even playing the game for 4 months. But in the end, I was really impressed with my troll, and he was just as important to my party as my prior character.So yes! If you like RPGs and good writing, play Dragonfall. DO IT!--ORIGINAL REVIEW--This is only the second Kickstarter game I've played. I'm pretty impressed with it, and it really is the kind of game that most publishers would never fund, so I'm excited to have had the opportunity to play it.  I've so far only finished the Dead Man's Switch campaign, so the following points are regarding that campaign only.Here's some bullet points:* The visuals are adequate but not compelling. The high-res handpainted isometric art is impressive for the skill required to execute it. It's retro without being pixillated or limited in palette. VFX are adequate.* Really cool music, though not enough of it. Never became obnoxious but I was blown away in the first couple hours, but heard basically the same music for the rest of the game. Adequate sound, but no voice acting, which would've pushed the reception of the game's narrative over the edge!* The story was really cool with some great twists, though it is linear. It's a lot like a great pen-and-paper campaign. You normally wouldn't replay something like that, so a surface-level appearance of choice and nonlinearity is enough, and as a result I found myself happy with the game. However, if you're looking for the story to change dramatically as a result of your choices, you will be disappointed. There are a few dialog options that will change based on your choices, but they are for flavor only. That's OK with me.* The gameplay is fun. I love turn-based RPG tactics, I just do. I love the positioning and the AOE attacks and managing action points. I like buffs and line-of-sight and overwatch. The game is fully featured in terms of the amount of relevant (and effecitve) skills and choices you have available. You are not locked into a class. Where the gameplay falls short is the dice rolling (like most direct tabletop RPG-to-videogame translations). I hate it when I have an 83% chance to hit a guy and miss twice in a row. Further, I hate when an enemy has a 21% chance to hit me, and it lands. I want my performance to be more predictable and tactical and less dependent on luck. Usually things play out like you'd expect, and so it's okay, but every time the odds are in your favor and you fail, you feel cheated. I hate that.I would be very comfortable recommending Shadowrun Returns except one thing: The abysmal save system. This game will only autosave when you go from one area to another. There is no other way to save than autosaving. Further, as the story and quests are linear, you can't just abuse the auto-save system by going back and forth between locations. The result is that whenever the designer decides that you'll be in one area for a really long time, it means you can't save that whole time. This is remarkably, and frequently, inconvenient. That said, as the game is turn based, most of the time you take are decisions you mull over. Your progress is the result of choices, not usually execution. So losing progress isn't so bad when you die, as you'll quickly be able to repeat your choices that you've already thought through. Still though, in this day and age in gaming, it's a pretty egregious oversight.That said, I would still recommend Shadowrun Returns if only for the wonderful and rare cyberpunk videogame setting, choice driven character systems, and tactical RPG combat.

												*This is a review for Dragonfall, the DLC to Shadowrun and not the original campaign*An absoulute gripping look into the cyberpunk universe and one of the most mesmorizing narratives I've seen this year. Everything Shadowrun's original campaign does, Dragonfall does it three times better. This is a case where you should buy the game, just for the dlc. Your party members (which you don't have in the original shadowrun campaign, thanks) all have a plethora of fascinating backstories and dialogue choices. The game takes place in Berlin which uses a completely unique politcal structure for government combined with beautiful enviroments that just make the game feel real, even though it's such a stylized version of a mystical future. The decsions you make later in the game are excruciatingly hard. Dragonfall doesn't treat you like an omnipotent god that makes all the right choices. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ world with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices to make and if you mess up too bad, everyone suffers for it. There was one choice in particular I had to stop playing for about 20 minutes to decide what I should even do. The gameplay is exactly the same as the original campaign or Xcom unknown so no real changes there. This is a game you need to play if your into old RPGs, well constructed plotlines and characters, and if your a fan of sci fi or cyberpunk, no exceptions if you meet any of these guide lines -Enjoy			"

												I am very happy with Shadowrun Returns. I think the game lives up to the hype. I am a passionate fan of the Super Nintendo Shadowrun game (which I've been playing for over twenty years!) and playing Shadowrun Returns feels like a homecoming. It is very reminiscent of the SNES game, but very contemporary and modern, of course.The combat and puzzles are of medium challenge (just right for me when I played on the game's easy level of difficulty) and the storytelling is good. The visual design and music are extremely well done. There is a well-balanced blend of exploring and fighting. I finished the game in about twenty-four hours of playing time, with only a couple of mission ""do overs."" A quicker and more skilled player might take about twenty hours to finish. I’d like the game to be longer, but that is hardly a legitimate complaint, merely a fond wish and a desire for more of a good thing. I noticed no flaws in the game other than a rash of minor typos about halfway through, mostly in dialogue windows. The only real problem I had was some serious lag in combat scenarios featuring about eight or more characters on screen, but my system, while of good quality, is not a gaming rig, and I'm running only the minimum 2GB of RAM the game recommends. The turn-based system employed in Shadowrun Returns made the lag easily tolerable.In my first play-through I found that playing my character with thoughtfulness and manners gained me lots of karma. The option to be a hardcore, coldblooded merc is always there, but I can't say how taking that tack affects the gameplay. My key to success in combat was always being smart with in-combat strategy. No matter what mistakes I made with equipping or tactics, or how my luck went when the fighting began, I was always able to overcome by making good strategic decisions.Thanks to everyone involved in making the game. Great job!			"

												The graphics are hipster retro, but the game world feels true to the cyberpunk genre - even with the addition of magic.  Once I got past the premise that allows magic, there is a lot to like from a story point of view. Thus, the edition of the game with the downloadable sound track and collection of background stories turns out to be a decent buy - but heed the warning . . . there be spoilers in the backstories.  The turn-based tactical combat portion of the game is a lot of fun, and is more varied than what is on offer from the XCOM revival game.  There are some negatives.  The check point based save games are pure suck, but not enough so to completely ruin the game. The leveling system may prove too limited to sustain really large community DLC projects, but that may be by design as the module that ships with the game is a little too short to justify the game's price on its own merits.  This is the most legitmate criticism of the game in my opinion.  There is just too little on offer for the price of the game.Put another way, the game design lends itself to modules that are more like short stories and less like full lengh novels.  Since the game only ships with one relatively short module, one does get the feeling that one has paid for full lengh novel and only received a short story in return.  This is also bad news if you would prefer to carry the same character through from module to module - this just doesn't seem possible as you would effectively need to start skill development over with each module. There are hacks around this limitation, but then play balance is shot to heck.Speaking of play balance, decking does not seem like a particularly viable solo class and the adept class is only marginally better.  If you want to play as a decker or an adept, try a multi-class design instead.  Longer modules might yield enough levels for the adpet class to be viable, but there is no such hope for the poor decker.  There were other balance issues that have been fixed in later patches. My impression is that the DLC community may not be large enough to produce enough quality DLC to even the ""value for dollar spent"" score.  However, I am not comfortable saying that community DLC won't get there . . . it just may take a very long time.  If you are a frugal gamer, check back in a year or so.			"

												I am a long standing fan of Shadowrun. I played it on Sega back in the day when it came out. Always loved the idea and the feel behind it. I've read the books, I've played the PnP game; heck, the first book I wrote was based in that universe. So it is no wonder I love this game. The freedom of choice and the nestalgic feel of what was once loved so dearly. Microcrap could have taken some inspiration from these guys. This is how Shadowrun is played. My only dream is to have a Co-Op Shadowrun game someday that is something like this, or maybe even FPS if that got it made.			"

												I played Shadowrun with a great group of friends back in the late eighties.  We were fortunate to have an awesome GM that could really develop a great and exciting story.  As I played through Shadowrun Returns and the DLC, Showdowrun: Dragonfall, I kept thinking back to the old days of paper, dice, beer and game sessions that would last well into the early morning hours.  Shadowrun Returns captures exactly what it was like in the old pen and paper days, minus the friends, unfortunately.  The world is rich and refreshingly different from other game settings.Combat can be exicting, but not very deep.  The are many character archetypes to play, but development of a character's skillset is sparse.  Those with little knowelege of the Shadowrun setting may also find themselves lost as to what is going on with the story.  The first adventure, The Dead Man's Switch, was a little slow for me to get into.  However, for those familar with the Seattle area will enjoy some of the local references and themes.  The second adventure, Dragonfall (a seperate DLC), was realy good and grabbed me right away.  It improved on many of the game mechanics, had more interesting characters, and had a more interesting story.Overall, the game was very good.  It isn't very expensive and provides many hours of play.  Shadowrun Returns has that old pen and paper feel to it, which I enjoy very much.  Give it a try, especially if it is on sale.			"

												Hello nostalgia, my old friend. The world of Shadowrun (a classic console title) returns in this updated crowdfunded version, and gives you two absolutely good reasons to slap down the nuyen for it.The first campaign that the game is packaged is Dead Man's Switch, a noir tale where you investigate a friend's demise, taking you from across an alternate Seattle as you uncover an intricate web of conspiracies. For good or ill, the game streamlines your progression, segmenting maps into pseudo-chapters, where you explore and investigate an area as much as you like, and then leave it completely, moving on to the next area. This is to the game's benefit as it does away with tedious backtracking and nook/cranny-exploration, keeping you in the thick of the plot.If you're not familiar with the genre of RPGs like Shadowrun, then know that this is not a loot-oriented game. Item/equipment acquisition is never random, always deliberate and often simply purchases from store NPCs. Instead, it is focuses on the (well-told) and the character, The primary method your character grows is through the development of skills. These skills are cheap to start (1 skillpoint for first blip), but become expensive to master (10 skillpoints for the 10th blip), so beginning players have plenty of room to experiment.However, there may be aspects you will dislike. Respecs are not available (unless you mess with the game code itself) so you may wind up getting skills that become obsolete or boring to you. Also, because this is a fixed campaign with no random encounters, certain types of skills will become more useful than others, so you may feel cheated in that department. In a sense, this is oldschool RPGing, before game devs were compelled to streamline and optimize the player experience. Also also, this being a fixed largely-linear campaign, playing through Dead Man's Switch around twice should show you everything it has to offer.The campaign itself is enjoyable and most certainly a worthy purchase, despite what I've listed previously. Mind you, all the compliments that I've paid to Shadowrun Returns so far? I count them all as Reason 1.Reason 2: This game is supported by the Steam Workshop, which means user-created content can multiply the amount of time and enjoyment you get out of Shadowrun Returns significantly. This does mean that the level of quality may diminish, but hell, now you could even make your own Shadowrun adventures if you have the time and stamina for it!I heartily recommend Shadowrun Returns for those players who enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay, strong storylines, and noir settings. And if you like the game as well, definitely consider looking at Shadowrun: Dragonfall, a second campaign currently offered as purchasable DLC!			"

												Nice throwback! 3/5I would like to first off say, I enjoyed this game a lot, but I did have some problems with it.  What happened to the rest of the world?  The original shadowrun games (I'm talking console not tabletop) had open worlds, free run of the cities, and clues you had to collect.  This is more of a Turn-based 3d scroller.  I felt led the entire time.  I want an open world to explore, shadowruns to do, cyberspace to hack, and random goons/lone star to take out for weapons armor and money.  The thing I loved most about shadowrun was the freedom to just turn it on and try to break into the nearest building and loot it, or mine some data in cyberspace for cash.  This point A to point B style was disappointing.  I don't want to be constantly following the storyline in order to do anything in the game.  I want the freedom to be a shadowrunner.  I'm just glad I still have my Sega and SNES if I want to play a real shadowrun game.			"

												This is good ol' classic Shadowrun, I have a bias, I love the Shadowrun backstory and myth. This game is primarily about two things: First you get a pretty decent campaign and the ability to create all the major Shadowrun character types, it's very story focused and is interlaced with combat sections. It's far more lightweight than most games. The other thing you get is a hell of a powerful editor and the strong likelyhood of an ever expanding pile of 'shadowruns' to go on as people make them. This isn't a game about extreme tactics and strategy, it's fairly deep but the combat isn't the main focus, it's all about the stories. If you liked the SNES version, this is very much like that, if you don't, you might stay away, at least see where folks take this game.			"

Also, because this is a fixed campaign with no random encounters, certain types of skills will become more useful than others, so you may feel cheated in that department. In a sense, this is oldschool RPGing, before game devs were compelled to streamline and optimize the player experience. Also also, this being a fixed largely-linear campaign, playing through Dead Man's Switch around twice should show you everything it has to offer.The campaign itself is enjoyable and most certainly a worthy purchase, despite what I've listed previously. Mind you, all the compliments that I've paid to Shadowrun Returns so far? I count them all as Reason 1.Reason 2: This game is supported by the Steam Workshop, which means user-created content can multiply the amount of time and enjoyment you get out of Shadowrun Returns significantly. This does mean that the level of quality may diminish, but hell, now you could even make your own Shadowrun adventures if you have the time and stamina for it!I heartily recommend Shadowrun Returns for those players who enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay, strong storylines, and noir settings. And if you like the game as well, definitely consider looking at Shadowrun: Dragonfall, a second campaign currently offered as purchasable DLC!			"

												I have loved the Shadowrun RPG for as long as I can remember. When I first heard about this game a couple of years before it was complete I screamed like a 16 year old girl. This caught no end of strange looks as I was in a Game store at a mall. Later when I have gotten the game and played it. It lived up to all of my expecations. I love the look and feel. And knowing its from the original creators gives me high hopes for the future.			"

												I picked this game up because of my love for the SNES Shadowrun. I have never had enough people locally to ever get into many tabletop games, but have always wanted to, but that is besides the point. There is a great deal of nostalgia all throughout this game so far, and something in particular that really catches my attention is that alot of the music is very much laced with the same old tunes from the SNES version. I am in absolute love, and woudl easily give this a 10/10, This review comes from the background of playing the game with dragonfall.			"

												I bought this game having played Dragonfall (stand-alone) and was very disappointed. I expected going 'backward' from Dragonfall would miss out on some UI improvements and such but I was shocked at how short, basic and uninteresting Shadowrun Returns storyline was. The story was poor to say the least; I won't spoil it but I genuinely thought I was in the prologue or something until the 'final boss'... I completed this game in 11 hours, despite seeking all little side quests (it feels like there were none) and talking to everyone possible (much less than Dragonfall). I do not recommend buying this game today but STRONGLY recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which despite being a ""small standalone story"" is infinitely better, more interesting and took me over twice as long to complete. At only £2.20 in a sale it's arguably alright but still, knowing what I do now I'd have skipped the game completely.			"

												Good old schoolish RPG with an editor. Somewhat simple with combat similar to XCOM: EU, but it works well enough. The biggest flaw is the checkpoint style save system, which only autosaves at the beginning of the level. I hope the devs will work on getting a proper save system in.The campaign that comes with the game, The Dead Man's Switch, is well-written, but linear and rather short. It should be noted that, much like NWN, this game should be bought and judged for the community created content and not just the official campaign. One might want to wait a little and see how the community creations will take off. Take a look at the Workshop before you buy.A must for a Shadowrun fan.

												Shadowrun Returns is a light tactical RPG focusing on story and pretty graphics. The game is fairly short (~10h), but just the right length to not overstay its welcome.The gameplay elements are fairly simple as far as Tactical RPGs go, and those looking for challenging and meaningful systems should look elsewhere. It is still entertaining though, and perfect for those looking for a more casual experience.The real meat of the game is the story, the setup and the writing. The plot is of a noir detective style with conspirations and social commentaries mixed in, well written, served by beautifully hand painted 2D graphics.The only complaint would be that such an interesting universe: a blend between Blade Runner and D&D, deserved a more traditional, long lasting, content rich RPG. As it is the game is highly enjoyable as a little tread, but it's missing momentum, exploration and more involving combat. Well worth on a Steam sale though.			"

												TL;DR, This is a good game with great writing, easy-to-understand mechanics that will still offer a challenge to those who want it, and while the main story that comes with the game is short, it has some decent replayability value with the character customization and is helped by the fact that there're plenty of community-made campaigns to try out. Oh yeah, this thing will also run well on most potatoes. If you like Baulder's Gate, the first two Fallouts, or like RPG or strategy games at all, try it out.I knew nothing about Shadowrun before playing this game other than it was a cyberpunk universe of some sort, and this game got me interested in the universe pretty quickly. It pulls classic fantasy stuff, like magicy fireballs, standard fantasy races, and even dragons and puts them into a cyberpunk setting in the near-future. While that sounds like a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥, it actually works really well.The game leaves you with a pretty open opportunity to make any sort of character that'll fit into the setting that you want. The only thing that is established is that you are/were a Shadowrunner (which are off-the-grid mercenaries, basically.) and you had like one guy you usd to run with that's at all relevent to the rest of the story. It makes me think of Fallout: New Vegas, and that's a good thing to be reminded of.When the first fight happens there's a page where you can read through all the rules of combat, and while that may seems overwhelming at first, you can honestly just read about Action Points, where everything is in the UI, and cover. Cover is important. From there, anyone who has decent cognitive function and has played a videogame before can figure it out as they go, because the game isn't going to punish you early for not quite knowing what you're doing yet.The greatest thing about the game is the story and writing. It's a well put together mystery that starts out seeming pretty simple, but get deeper and deeper as you go further into the rabbit hole. As for the writing, I continually noticed how good it was throughout the whole thing. Each loading screen, while they can take a long time at certain parts, has a well-written set of paragraphs to set the mood of the place you're about to go to. Each character is believable, many are likeable (my personal favorite is Mr. Kluwe), and all are well-written.The game is linear as opposed to open-world, but it works. It's structured like a tabletop RPG campaign, because that's what Shadowrun is/was. While I figured that out a ways in, it didn't feel restrictive like some linear stories are. That could just be a personal thing, but hey, this is about my experience with the game.One of the biggest problems with the game is that the main campaign is short, especially for a cRPG, which are usually quite long and expansive games. Shadowrun: Returns is meant to be, at least as far as I can tell, to be an engine from which to run your own campaigns, like how DMs in tabletops like D&D do, because, again,  that's what Shadowrun is/was. However, I have personnally yet to find a campaign from the workshop that I really like. After playing through Dead Man's Switch (the main campaign that comes with the game) all the community produced campaigns feels sub-par or mediocre. I suppose that should be expected when comparing something made by a professional development team to something made by one guy and is for free. Still, it does impact the staying power of the game.I got this on sale for 5 bucks a while back. As of this writing, it's like 80% off, at 3 dollars or something. It is definately worth that price. Overall, this is one of the most satisfying video game purchases I've made in a while. If you want an arbitrary number out of number rating, I'll give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a modern take on an old genre we haven't seen much of recently. You might be familiar with the world of Shadowrun. I wasn't before playing this. It's one of the coolest and most well realised fictions I've seen in a while. The writing here is impeccable and will likely make you wish there were more games set in this universe. There's no voice acting, so get ready to read, but I found the world so engaging it wasn't an issue.The combat has taken some ideas from old-school games and some from modern ones like XCOM. It works very well and has deep character trees and customisation options. With the exception of a massive difficulty ramp on the last mission, the combat is quite intriguing.The real strength of this game will likely be in whatever the modding community decides to do with it. The whole thing is just a module launcher similar to Neverwinter Nights. You could tell endless stories within this frame.			"

												Its a fun top down RPG in the line of stuff like Planescape: Torment, or NWN 1, although not quite as epic as Planescape, and not quite as polished as some big budget RPGs. The game is fun though, and the story gets pretty engaging, so for its price, I wouldn't pass it up. The shadowrun universe is straight from the tabletop, for better or for worse, it alternates between cheesy and wtf-awesome without much warning, which can be half the fun. If you like Cyberpunk or top down RPGs, its definately worth the summer sale prices.			"

												Have you been looking at it? Has it got your attention? Are you wondering whether or not this is worth twenty dollars? DO IT. XCOM: Enemy Unknown style combat meets a great RPG filled with a cast from metahumanity's worst to its finest, with enough snark to make a room filled with hard-boiled, collar-propped detectives shiver. To be fair, areas or 'levels' themselves are linear, but each offers different ways to get past trouble; clubbing your way through, persuading a bystander to pitch in or hacking your way into networks can all help out. The game's worth a good look at the very least.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical RPG based on the pen-and-paper game of the same name. It offers a unique universe and an intriguing combat system, and I found myself pleasantly surprised while playing it.Character CreationCharacter creation is rather tricky if you are new to the Shadowrun mechanics. You are permitted to select your gender, followed by your race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll), and an archetype if you wish - the archetype presets your skills for you and is recommended for beginner players.I played as an Elf, creating a custom archetype specialising in ranged weapons and Body (the stat that gives me more HP). Rather than gaining experience throughout the game, you get Karma (effectively stat points) to start and as you progress. You spend the Karma to advance in the skills of your choosing.Creating your avatar is fairly simple, with minimal options for appearance. Given that I spent most of the game fully zoomed out, this was rather irrelevant. You do not get to design any party members for this game. Instead, there are story-related party members assigned to you for certain missions, and you can hire others to fill the holes for each mission.CombatCombat is definitely a challenge. Everything is based on hidden “dice rolls” (or Random Number Generators), and directly affected by your stats. You get Action Points for each of your characters, which you can spend on movement, attacking, or using skills and items. Movement is critical, as you position your characters using the environment for cover and giving yourself the most advantageous location for attacking the enemy. Of course, the enemies move too, making each round require a new plan.Attacks are made with a weapon of your choice. Pistols, rifles, submachine guns, melee weapons, shotguns, and a magic missile attack are all made available to you for purchase, and you select/upgrade your weaponry to suit your character’s needs. You cannot, however, modify the weaponry of your companions.Spells are interesting, to be sure. Like weapons, they are purchased and equipped. Spells, as in most games, have a cooldown period. However, in Shadowrun they can be cast even while in cooldown - at the cost of your health. In a pinch, this can be a beneficial choice to make. At the wrong time, it could spell your demise. (See what I did there??)StoryThe story in this game is decent. The backdrop is set throughout the game, in a futuristic world where magic has made a resurgence into power. Called the Awakening, this resurgence has led to the appearance of metahumans (in varying forms - Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll), who are the target of prejudice as humanity remain the majority. Technology still plays a powerful role in this universe, with people being able to get cybernetic enhancements, bring drones into combat, or even hack into computers (which is referred to as Decking - and the internet, of course, is now the Matrix).

Also, there are a few moments where the writing quality just crumbles, forcing me to do a double take and breaking my immersion.

												Well, I have to say I'm glad to be able to change my thumbs-down review of Shadowrun Returns to thumbs up. The fix for save files has been working fine for me with some flaws, but you will decide for yourself if this suits you fine or you might get DRM-free version that appearantly doesn't have these problems... I've used several different solutions and my own experiments to come up with the fix that works.So, this is my story with Shadowrun. I saw a few promotional posters here and there. Nothing more. Then one day, a good buddy of mine gifts me Shadowrun Returns and Shadowun Dragonfall. I didn't touch any of these in a long time because my reviewing and gaming queue was really choke full. But one fateful night I decide to check out the playing order of Shadowrun games and I install this one. After creating my character, I've found myself in my smelly apartment wiith a dead friend asking for help. And I immediately fall in love. TOTALLY.Shadowrun universe is one of the best I've encountered in a long time. This clash of tech and fantasy was something I even dreamt of writing about myself (until I've realized it's been done before and better). When I've figured out there are BOOKS out there about Shadowrun world... I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants and figured out I'll die happy. You will be entering the strange cyberpunk retrofuturistic world filled with noir style crime mysteries, corporate thrillers and technology ruling the flesh. The storyline and game itself is fairly linear, but it made me care more about roleplaying - there's never a dull moment and nobody asks you to milk the cow (read: nonsensical sidequests) when you're in the middle of exciting main mission. That way you truly feel like you're doing something important. Battle system is similar to that one seen in XCom games (turn based combat), and RPG system is decent and effective, making you care how you distribute your Karma points.The only true problem I had with Shadowrun Returns on Steam is the fact that at certain point I've started having major problems with save files - to cut the story short, game stops recognizing your saves. By doing this, you will be able to play the game, but Steam time tracking will not work. If you're into tracking your time (as much as I am), you can always run a Steam edition of the game beside second one. I am playing on Windows 7 64bit. I am not responsible for any accidents or nuclear meltdowns caused by copying and pasting. BACK EVERYTHING UP.If you all of a sudden get greyed out CONTINUE button and you are not able to load your game, try this.1. Go to C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Harebrained Schemes\Shadowrun Returns\Saves and copy all the files. These are your save files. COPY THEM. 2. Go to your Steam folder. There, find the following folders \userdata\YOURPERSONALNR\234650 . Inside 234650 folder you will see two folders, one named Local, the other named remote. Back those up, just in case. You're bound to find some save files in these folders, but sometimes it's not the case. Now, paste AppData/Local... save files to both of these folders. If system asks you to overwrite, overwrite.3. Now, most people say you need to restart Steam and start it in admin mode. This may help you once, just as it helped me, but then you'll encounter greyed out buttons again. The way I made my saves work is that I ran my game directly by clicking Shadowrun.exe from \Steam\steamapps\common\Shadowrun Returns.Pros: your save games work.Cons: no Steam overlay, no time tracking.I would usually not lose this much time to figure things out, but Shadowrun is SO GOOD and when I heard Dragonfall and Hong Kong are even better... oh, happy times!!!

												I was a complete neophyte to the Shadowrun series when I first played Shadowrun Returns. I was looking for a strategy oriented RPG with a scenario that would keep me interested in playing the game, the futuristic setting was a bonus.The character's customization offers many ""carreer"" possibilities, whether you want to be a Street Samurai, blading and gunning through the streets of Neo-Seattle, a hacker or ""Decker"" and turn the situation to your advantage by jumping in the matrix and hacking your way through the top, or someone in touch with his inner self and the old spirits of nature, such as a shaman. Or maybe you would rather unleash your fury on the local gangs and punch whoever is stepping in your way. You could also combine any of the different skill trees to make your own and unique gameplay, but remember that a jack of all trades is a master of none...However, this is not why I am recommending this game. Because even if the gameplay and the overall aesthetic of the game are worth the price, the scenario and roleplaying aspect of Shadowrun Returns is, in my humgle opinion, what makes it an amazing game. It all starts off simple, and then escalates to a breathtaking scenario carried by well-written dialogues and a very peculiar ambiance (at least for a newcomer like me).In conclusion, if you're looking for a neofantasy roleplaying oriented strategy RPG, this is your game.

												A Sci-fi world with magic and dragons mixed in, what more do I need to say about this game? The setting is in the future, where an event called 'The Awakening' brought magic back into the world. Needless to say if you are a fan of the Shadowrun universe, get this game immediately. To new players who love a good RPG and are just getting into Shadowrun, I recommend getting this to start you off.shadowrun Returns's combat is reminiscent of XCOM, as it's turn based and every descision on the battlefield will mean death or getting your team alive. The many classes allow for you to make your character the way you want, but you can make your own class with the points you have, allowing for flexibility. If you want a deep engaging novel-like RPG experience with tons of text and dialogue to read through, get this game and its sequels. If the novel-sized texts aren't your thing, then combat will keep you invested.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical RPG based on the pen-and-paper game of the same name. It offers a unique universe and an intriguing combat system, and I found myself pleasantly surprised while playing it.Character CreationCharacter creation is rather tricky if you are new to the Shadowrun mechanics. You are permitted to select your gender, followed by your race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll), and an archetype if you wish - the archetype presets your skills for you and is recommended for beginner players.I played as an Elf, creating a custom archetype specialising in ranged weapons and Body (the stat that gives me more HP). Rather than gaining experience throughout the game, you get Karma (effectively stat points) to start and as you progress. You spend the Karma to advance in the skills of your choosing.Creating your avatar is fairly simple, with minimal options for appearance. Given that I spent most of the game fully zoomed out, this was rather irrelevant. You do not get to design any party members for this game. Instead, there are story-related party members assigned to you for certain missions, and you can hire others to fill the holes for each mission.CombatCombat is definitely a challenge. Everything is based on hidden “dice rolls” (or Random Number Generators), and directly affected by your stats. You get Action Points for each of your characters, which you can spend on movement, attacking, or using skills and items. Movement is critical, as you position your characters using the environment for cover and giving yourself the most advantageous location for attacking the enemy. Of course, the enemies move too, making each round require a new plan.Attacks are made with a weapon of your choice. Pistols, rifles, submachine guns, melee weapons, shotguns, and a magic missile attack are all made available to you for purchase, and you select/upgrade your weaponry to suit your character’s needs. You cannot, however, modify the weaponry of your companions.Spells are interesting, to be sure. Like weapons, they are purchased and equipped. Spells, as in most games, have a cooldown period. However, in Shadowrun they can be cast even while in cooldown - at the cost of your health. In a pinch, this can be a beneficial choice to make. At the wrong time, it could spell your demise. (See what I did there??)StoryThe story in this game is decent. The backdrop is set throughout the game, in a futuristic world where magic has made a resurgence into power. Called the Awakening, this resurgence has led to the appearance of metahumans (in varying forms - Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll), who are the target of prejudice as humanity remain the majority.

												So, the Shadowrun world is entirely new to me.  I never played the SNES Shadowrun game, and I definitely didn't know until recently that Shadowrun started out as a Dungeon and Dragons style table top game in the late 80's/early 90's.  Only a few minutes into the game, I could tell that this is a well developed universe, one that could be better appreciated by those who have been involved in the Shadowrun lore for years.  Not to say I'm not impressed.  Like I said, I'm completely new to this world.  But that's what makes this game immediately addicting.  It has it's own world and immediately pulls you right into it.  Yes, you can feel like a foreigner at first, but not for long.  The game starts when you receive a message from an old friend, Sam Watts, who pre-informs you of his death through a video message which is sent to you upon his death.  Your mission is to investigate who killed him and find out who this ""Ripper"" character is.  As you investigate Sam Watts murder, you get pulled more and more into the underground world of Shadowrun, discovering more of the secrets of Sam Watts, as well as the other characters you meet.For me, I enjoy a good RPG.  Typically, I have trouble getting into turn based RPGs anymore.  Despite that this game is turn based, there is a strategy element that gives it more depth.  You're not just attacking, healing, and casting magic.  You have to anticipate the movements of your enemies and use your surroundings to your advantage.  There is also a bit of a puzzle element, too, as you must search your surroundings and use items to get past certain areas.Shadowrun is a nice blend of fantasy with cyberpunk.  I wish I could have emersed myself in this universe before, but I feel fortunate that I can experience it for the first time.  So even if you are not already familiar with Shadowrun, I suggest downloading this game.  It will definitely keep you hooked for hours.			"

												It is hard to rate this game as a whole.  On one hand, I found the writing to be excellent.  Several twists, it kept me interested.  All the dialog choices are mostly just cosmetic though.  There is no real reactivity or plot branches based on your responses.  The combat is the weak point in my opinion.  It isn't very challenging and seems to get a bit repetitive.  Overall, I really did enjoy the game and it is well worth the money.  I bought the expansion as well.  It is better.  It has better writing and many quests have morally ambiguous choices to make at the end.  The combat is still weak, but enjoyable.  I recommend it.  It is well worth the asking price, even if not on sale.  Support the indies.  8/10			"

												I'm impressed with Shadowrun Returns. While the core adventure may seem brief to some (roughly 12 hours of continuous play), the ambience is reminiscent of the old pen-and-paper Shadowrun I played so long ago and adored. Furthemore, there seems to be a respectable, growing listing of user-built content and adventures, free to download here under Steam Workshop.  Most surprising to me is that SR runs smoothly at 1366x768 resolution on my old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop running Ubuntu 12.04, with only a mere integrated Intel GMA 4500MHD; Intel Core 2 Duo (2.0 GHz x 2), 2 Gb RAM DDR2 800Mhz. I almost didn't purchase SR because I thought my laptop couldn't handle it. I was pleasantly proven wrong.			"

												I want more games like this, and definitely more in the Shadowrun universe.Shadowrun. Do you know Shadowrun? ... I'm not a nerdified loremaster, and certainly not qualified to make absolute statements, but from what I know Shadowrun is one of the largest RPG-Fiction-Universes ever created. It started out as  a Pen & Paper roll playing game with a nice, not overly-complicated mechanic and, which is the important thing, a really really cool setting. The whole Shadowrun universe is awesomely extensive, there exist around 50 or such novels about it aswell. To put it short: it's kind of a combination of William Gibson's Cyberpunk (Neuromancer, Biochips, Cyberspace, Mona Lisa Overdrive ...) and J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy fiction (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings). So, it's some moderate Sci-Fi (no laser guns or energy shields) intermingled with magic fantasy (Elves, Dwarves, Orcs... and pretty much every other creature you can think of). Now, about the game... It's a turn based tactical combat game. The gameplay system is easy to grasp and usually doesn't eat as much time as other games with a similar gameplay concept sometimes do (the new X-Com for example). Graphics aren't breath-taking but entirely sufficient since most of the game really happens in the text based storytelling and interaction. Which get's me to the interesting part, the game's main story is really quite awesome, it's really been a while since I've seen a story as awesome as this one. The writing is entirely perfect, extremely immersive and complex, everything fits your characters race and gender, which in many other games is sadly neglected, and I've found like two typos in the whole game.The game's atmosphere is rather dark, slums, gang-criminality, ruthless megacorporations and political apathy give a perfect backdrop for the story.The game features an editor for custom campaign creation (there's a steam Workshop for it), which adds theoretically infinite replayability to it. Options for importing characters from campaign to campaign enable players to create characters with all-maxed out stats, if they so desire. Options for equipment progression are quite limited -> 'at-the-moment' <-. A pretty extensive add-on for the game (Shadowrun-Returns: Dragonfall) has been announced and is due to be released in early 2014. There is also an MMO Shadowrun game (Shadowrun-Online) in the tube, which I would recommend to check out aswell.(PS: If anyone is interested in reading any of the above mentioned novels by William Gibson and/or J.R.R. Tolkien I explicitly recommend getting original english language prints, as the translations I've read for books of both authors really missed out on a lot of things.)			"

Combat is very chance based, on the other hand, and provided you have enough invested in body, quickness, and dodge, you should survive the game with minimal use of healthkits and res-kits.  10 hours first playthrough tops, 3-6 for any follow-ups, infinite hours from community, some of it out-doing the original campaign.  Seriously don't expect to get by without body, quickness, and dodge.			"

												Initially I was hoping for something that resembled the 1993 SNES release under the same title, unfortunately  what you get was something that resembled the  SNES combat mechanics  but a lackluster storyline. I did enjoy the art, character development, and variety in combat, but really wished to just explore the world and complete missions not related to the general story. That being said, Shadowrun has a lot of untapped potential for the modding community wishing to polish this stone a bit more.  Definitely worth the price if you want a change of pace.			"

												As a fan of the pen and paper game for many years, and of top down rpgs like Baldur's Gate, I was very excited for this.  While the campaign was fairly short (around 12 hours) and linear, it really scratched the Shadowrun itch I have had ever since the FPS game was pretty bad.			"

												If you're a fan of the tabletop you should find at least a bit of pleasure out of this, if in nothing but the character creation. The included scenario is fun, but doesn't demand much replay, and while there is plenty of player generated content the basic premise can get old pretty fast. (Visit fixer, get qeust, kill baddies, return to fixer, repeat) Combined with the pretty hefty load times when going from zone to zone it can make the game drag. I'm still a fan of the franchise though, so fanboy as I am I'd still reccomend it.			"

												Picked this one up when it was on sale, as I was curious.Turned out to be a great decison! My review as follows:ProsVery slick graphic novel type style and artCyberpunk environment and decking is awesome! Adds a lot to the storyUse of drone combat is interestingGreat story, and you can see they put effort into the dialog choicesGood character development, you can see how different and unique each character isLots of text -- feels like a story that's interactive, good immersion for the playerSmooth, sensible combat model -- turn based (which I prefer), but never feels slow or clunkyFor some reason, the system won't save the rest of my review. Anyway, it was a fun game!8.0/10.0			"

												Shadowrun returns is a fairly good game but I might be biased as a fan of the franchise so to speak. There are many familiar things in this game for those who have played the pen and paper rpg.The game is fairly short in itself, but community created content can bring more bang for your buck so no worries. The dead man's switch is a pretty short and limited storyline, but I thought it had pretty good replayability value. The graphics and music are decent enough and the game worked pretty well for me. I had some minor problems with the attack animation of my main character being delayed in one place and it appears I'm not the only one. So some glitches still remain. Hopefully future patches will fix these.The setting is nice and the storytelling is pretty good. Overall I really enjoyed Shadowrun returns. I think this game deserves some serious thought for people who know the setting already but it might night be such a good purchase for others.			"

Posted: July 28, 2014
												This is a game where I wish there was a third option between ""recommend"" and ""not recommend"". But I guess I am engaged with the game enough to keep playing it, so I am going the ""recommend"" route.To begin with, this game is my introduction to the Shadowrun IP. I never played the tabletop RPG, nor any of the other related video games. And really, this particular blend of genres doesn't really do it for me. If you don't know, in the world of Shadowrun, magic and fantasy-type races typical in most fantasy (orcs, trolls, elves, dwarves) genres have ""re-awakened"" in a futuristic, cyberpunk setting. So basically, you've got elves casting spells alongside cyborgs hacking their way through cyberspace. For me, this is just a mashup that I don't find that intriguing, though I can see how some might think it's really cool. So then, what pulled me in to trying out this RPG with turn-based combat? I guess it was the beautiful visuals of the isometric maps. The game world is very pleasingly portrayed in great detail.Unfortunately, you can't interact with much in the game world except for certain areas (hotspots denoted by various icons) where you need to search for plot-specific items that you need to advance the story, or when you need to talk to someone, or open a door. And here I'll point out one of the minor technical gripes I have with this game. Sometimes when I try to click on one of these interaction icons (to open a door, for example) the game doesn't respond to the click. It seems like it happens when my character is moving from one point to another. If my character is in motion, then clicking on a ""open door icon"" isn't going to work most of the time until the character stops moving. Minor nuisance, I guess.The other thing I don't like about the game is the inventory system, which I find confusing.There is only so much stuff that you can carry and so you have a stash for anything you don't currently have equipped. However, when going on a mission, you usually have one or more other characters going with you and they each have their own inventories. However, sometimes in the game, it seems like these other characters have their own stashes, but it's not clear to me how to access their stashes. Furthermore, when you go to hire these other characters in your party, you have to commit to the team you've just hired and then embark on the mission. You can't hire your team and then go buy equipment for them. You have to by all the weapons, health packs, spells, fetishes, etc. BEFORE you hire your team but then, how are you going to know which gun, for example, will be most effective with which team member when you haven't hired your team yet to look at their stats. Even when I have tried to buy ahead of time for team roles I am going to hire, when I get to the ""loadout"" screen before embarking on a mission, I try to equip these things on various characters, and then either don't show up (presumably because the character isn't skilled enough to use the item) or they are incompatible with some other item that the character already has. But there is not enough information provided to the player to know what spells, items, etc are or are not compatible with which characters.Here's an example, I bought some grenades and when I tried to equip them on my shaman, I got this message that said that the item I was trying to quip was not compatible with the level 5 summon elemental spell the shaman already had equipped? Uh, why exactly? I have no idea.Not to harp on the inventory problem too much, but here is another example. My character is a decker (a hacker class) and I have leveled up to where I can use better decks(like a portable hacking keyboard or laptop) that hold more ESPs (Expert Systems Programs) and other programs to help me hack in cyberspace. But I have never been able to figure out how to get those programs that I buy from my stash INTO my deck. So I usually end up hacking in cyberspace without any of these useful aids.So other than the beautiful graphics, I have to say that the writing is pretty good in this game. The character dialog makes the characters have their own personalities, and their motivations are usually clear. The load times between ""areas"" of the game can feel long at times, but there is usually some good flavor text that gives you some setting and atmosphere for the area you are entering. The story is pretty engaging and starts out as a story about bringing your friend's murderer to justice, but through some twists and turns ends up in the familiar, ""save-the-world-from-some-evil-from-beyond"" territory.The turn-based combat is also pretty good and implements a cover system. You have plenty of options when it comes to fighting: melee (fists, bats, swords), ranged (pistols, machine guns, grenades), AoE attacks (some spells and grenades), and buffs and debuffs (in the form of spells or various drug-like substances). Shamans can summon elementals to fight for them, but at a risk. These summoned pets might decide to rebel against their masters and then you have one more enemy on the map to fight.So even though I have some gripes about this game, I guess overall I would recommend it for those who like isometric RPGs with turn-based combat. I am not sure if fans of Shadowrun will think this game does the IP justice or not, but to me it seems like they would like this game.UPDATED: So here's my final word after finishing ""Dead Man's Switch"". I bought the game for 5 bucks and it gave me 18 hours of basically good gameplay and a good story. But I have no desire to play it again which is a shame because usually with a good RPG, like Skyrim for example, I would want to play it through again trying out a different character which would allow me to experience the story again with a different play style. Also, I have no desire to try out the Dragonfall DLC nor any other player made content that is out there. I guess the game world didn't captivate me enough to make me want to live out other stories within it.			"

												Shadowrun Returns brings the Sixth World triumphantly back to the video game medium. While the setting has always enjoyed a cultish, global fanbase, this game offers strangers to it a chance not only to get a solid feel for its essence, but also to enjoy an all-around good game. The fruits of the Shadowrun Returns kickstarter have been sweet indeed, and new updates keep making them even sweeter. From veteran runners of the pen & paper or console shadows, to anyone looking to enjoy a nice indie game brought into being by the hopes, donations, and hard work of many -- I highly recommend this fun and celebrated game.

												Turn based tactical rpg by a somewhat inexperienced studio, i still enjoyed this one. Closest thing to  Shadowrun pen and paper so far with room to grow. Regarding the initial campaign many people consider it a mixed bag. Story was mostly well done, tone of the setting was excellent, character developement was good, though some skills such as decking not utilized to their full potential in this initial campaign. A bit short. Overall i enjoyed it for what it is. A decent first effort at bringing back e shadowrun rpg. An editor is included and community content is available at varying stages of finish. An expansion is on the near horizon that fixes the save system( from current checkpoint system to new anywhere save)  and ought to expand the gameplay and campaign linearity. Curious to see what gets built on this foundation.edit 6/16/14;  having played through the dragonfall expansion i felt the need to add that it is an improvement over the base game in most every way. such as party members able to use their own skills to make skill checks now, and improved cohesive story, and somewhat more open campaign. i highly recommend  checking out dragonfall as well, or at least the reviews of it. something to consider when purchasing this.

It also does you a favour and hides most of the complex RPG game mechanics.  Both the original adventure and the DLC Dragonfall are challenging.  Really challenging, frequently turning your whole party into catfood after one minor tactical mistake.Highly recomended for pen and paper RPG types looking for a good fix and for vetran shadowrunners of all ages.

												Shadowrun Returns is a beautiful re-launch of the Shadowrun universe on PC. It's predecessor on console while good, was a little rough around the edges, and I feel that Returns has really stepped up to the plate to make the playability more seamless to the gamer.The plot for this game is masterfully crafted leaving little or no detail not mentioned through the dialogues with characters or the descriptions. The gameplay feels very much like a session of tabletop as you wind your way through dialogue options and will then quickly become a turn based strategy when there are bullets to be fired.I whole-heartedly recommend this game to any fan out there of Sci-Fi, tabletop, Strategy/RPG games, or simply Shadowrun in general.

												A decent singleplayer RPG set in the Shadowrun universe. Do not expect the Genesis Shadowrun. This game is very linear and does not allow any real form of exploration or deviation from the story task at hand. Combat is FFT-esque and pretty fun. The campaign is designed to take a character from nothing to maxed out over a rather short period of time, so don't expect to build up your character over multiple user-made campaigns or anything like that. Worth $5 if it's on sale and you like Shadowrun.			"

Tons of skills, abilities, and weapon types to choose from allow for a good level of replayability, especially if you get the Dragonfall DLC (also recommended!) but there are some fun user-generated campaigns in the workshop too, though most still need some rounding out. Mix and match from weapon-focused skills like swords, thrown weapons like shurikens or grenades, pistols, rifles, and SMGs as well as magical abilities from fire and lighting to summoned spirits or chi attacks, or go with a more technological approach and use drone allies or hack computer, turret, and camera systems or even enter the digital Matrix to fight AI programs with your own.

												Shadowrun Returns is a science fantasy turn based tactical role-playing game developed and self-published by Harebrained Schemes. It takes place in the Shadowrun campaign setting from the science fantasy tabletop role-playing game. This is the first in the line of games that Harebrained Schemes done for Shadowrun. If you liked the Pencil and Paper RPGs  (Shadowrun, Cyberpunk 2020, Gurps Cyberpunk), cyberpunk themed games and playing turn-based single player campaign games, you might love this game.It has a game editor for making new missions that the community been using to improve it with and to extend the life of the game. Go through the Workshop and subscribe to the large selection of community made campaigns. It comes with the HBS campaign called The Dead Man's Switch.You play a character that can hire others to his team and do a mission.  You control the actions of each member of the team. While gameplay is mostly linear, some small amount of exploration is possible while completing objectives. The player can enter into dialogue with various characters, with different statistics and skills giving new dialogue options.See wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_Returns for more info and spoillers.for more info:

												An amazing throwback to the days of Jagged Alliance and Fallout 1&2. Top down isometric view, turn based combat, extremely well written dialogue choices and a great set of skills to customise. The main storyline is around 10 to 12 hours depending on your reading speed and difficulty. Some of the best writing I've seen in an RPG, with a built in editor with plenty of community created content to make almost unlimited play time. Very highly recommended, especially when you consider this isn't a £35 release. I'd still be extremely happy if this was a full price production.			"

												I have heard of Shadowrun, and I have played the roleplay game only a couple of times. My friends prefer Vampire or DnD. I played the game with no expectations other than it looked pretty, and I got it on sale. The game had very pretty backgrounds, but the sory was very linear. There were hardly any side missions, and you had to do them as soon as you got them. There was no exploring of the world, which would have been nice. I would have liked to get to know some of the people who were in my party besides Coyote.I liked the character customization part. The fighting style was tactics, which I usually do not like, but Shadowrun Returns did it well. Overall the game was fun, and Dragonfall is supposed to be much better, or at least that is what i have heard. "

												It's a faithful adaptation of the tabletop RPG into an isometric videogame, sort of in the style of the old Fallout/Fallout 2 RPG gameplay. Dead Man's Switch was the first campaign and has mucho retro nostalgia to it, Dragonfall is a more polished and classical weaving Shadowrun campaign. Both are well written. You get to make a shadowrunner of custom class/race/appearance and level them up in a slimmed-down version of the tabletop's character development rules. I made a pink haired troll martial artist named Princess Monster Truck and she fit right in there. Excellent game, good purchase,			"

												I loved this game. I bought it because I used to play the pen and paper rpg version of Shadowrun a long, long time ago (2nd edition, if that means anything to you), and got curious about Returns. It _is_ old school indeed, and it _is_ clumsy a bit here and there (though the patches have improved a great many things), but it definitely _is_ Shadowrun. So much so that playing this game made me want to play the pnp version as well again. I'm definitely looking forward to playing the second installment, Dragonfall, in the near future. Thank you, Harebrained Schemes. :)8.5 / 10			"

												I loved the original game on Sega many years ago. So i was thrilled to try this new game. It has some flaws, as it is short and very linear, no voice acting, checkpoints system. Also the matrix/decking mode is just the same turn-based combat with a different skin. Would love to see the original matrix combat. But it is still a little gem with interesting story, characters, nice combat system and visuals. And i've heard the Dragonfall DLC is even better and more refined (with more side quests and choices).UPDATE: Dragonfall DLC is just amazing. So much better plot and twists. A lot of hard choises to be made, better selection of side quests, a whole town region to live in, lots of interesting characters. And you can now save the game whenever you want :)			"

												The first section of this review is regarding the Dragonfall DLC campaign, as of originally writing this review, I had not touched the original Dead Man's Swtich campaign, so keep that in mind when reading. Theres a second section that covers Dead Man's Switch.DragonfallTo start, it's a good game. A really good one. It feels like a CRPG from over a decade ago, and I say that in the best way possible. It honestly feels like it could have been made by Troika, and I say that in both a good and bad way.What do I mean by ""both a good an a bad way""? Well, the game has some good writing, genuinely interesting characters, and a sold cobat system. The game is also buggy, but not so much that it's game breaking.When speaking of a the combat system, we're looking at a very XCOM esque sort of feel complete with grid-based movement and overwatch for helping to keep areas locked down. You'll likely often find yourself moving your characters from cover to cover while pushing forward and taking down enemies. The combat system works on a cooldown system for abilities, in which once an ability is used, it cannot be reused for X number of turns. All in all, the game actually offers satisfying tactical RPG experience complete with guns, magic, and swords. In terms of the bugs well, here's a few examples. At one point in the game I had a set of side objecties. Those objectives disappeared from my mission log, which from my expericne, shouldn't happen, but fortunately that did not prevent me from completing those side objectives and getting the payout from them. At another point in the game, a character I was talking to repeated dialogue from earlier on in the game when I spoke to her. It seemed clear that that piece of dialogue should not have been spoken, as it completely went against the more recent gdialogue I had just had with her (as in, literally seconds before). Also, not really a bug, but movement can be finickey if you want to move a charater to a tile behind another character, since the game will generally select the other character rather than move the one you wanted to move.Writing is... pretty subjective obviously, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really liked all of the characters, I found converstations interesting, I liked learning about the past of my companions, and I liked watching them grow as I continued to run with them. The chararacter aren't exactly super dynamic, as there'll never be huge changes  in their personality, but still, as you converse with them, you can tell they're growing, which is actually more than I can say for quite a few other titles in the genre. The game also offers a number of superficial choices, in that you can't actually alter the course of the story, but it will still give you feedback about the effects of your decisions in terms of the world around you, so while it doesn't change the storyline, it still feels like it has an impact. Aside from that, doing things one way over another may provide more karma (experience) or money.In any case, I bought the game on sale, so betwen the original title plus the Dragonfall DLC, I ended up spending around 15 USD, and it was most certainly worth that and more. That said, $30 might be a little steep if you're only interested in Dragonfall, as it's not actually all that long (longer than the original campaign from what I'm told, and just better all around), but then again, it might not be, because it really is good. I'll add to this review after running Dead Man's Switch I suppose, but bottom line is: Dragonfall is a fantastic campaign that's well worth paying for and playing.Dead Man's SwitchI might as well start by saying that yeah, it's pretty much worse than Dragonfall in every way possible, but still decent. The writing is Dead Man's Switch is far less compelling to be frank. The characters aren't as interesting, they never really appear to gorw, and you don't really interact with them, or even the world very much. It's a very much guided experience that sort of just shuffles you from level to level as the story unfolds. I feel that my most major problem with the storyline is that I find it pretty much impossible to make a connection to any of the characters since you don't really get to interact with them much. Honestly, I'd say that if you're going to get Shadowrun Returns, get it for Dragonfall and think of Dead Man's Switch as an extra campaign despite the fact that Dragonfall is DLC which you'll have to pay for. Dead Man's Switch is nothing to really write home about, so if you get the game, you should really get the DLC. If you're more interested in the user-generated content or the combat system, the base game still has that going for it of course.			"

												I love RPGs. But it is very rare for me to finish one. When I think about it, it is mostly because I rarely get really drawn to the story. I usually get bored halfway and leave. Shadowrun Returns is an exception. You start by building your character and the process on its own is so much fun. There are 5 archetypes to choose from and if I am correct, depending on which archetype you are playing, the story ends slightly differently. Once you start the game, you are almost immediately thrown into a battle which will give you a taste of what will come ahead. You have optional and mandatory challenges to finish. I suggest finishing them all. As a turn-based RPG, you are required to think and plan strategically in order to successfully lead your team in battles (a good team composition is important!) and unveil the story.  If you're looking for a fun game with a good story arc, this one is for you. I recommend getting it.			"

There's frequent swapping of combat and roleplay throughout, and many of the combat encounters feel special. The story itself was enjoyable, and I'll probably play through the campaign with a different build to see some of the other dialogue. Overall it was a great ride, and I'll probably pick up the expansion some time soon.			"

												For an indie company reviving a non-indie title, this game is very good.  The story is alright, the characters are interesting enough, but, in all honesty, if my gamemaster pulled half of the crap done in this game on me, I'd probably have punched them in the face.  In lower difficulties, the game is too easy for me, so I started playing on the highest difficulty.  The difference is night and day.  Enemies are consistently stronger than the player character and anyone they can recruit, you'll frequently miss shots that claim 80% or higher chances to hit, and the enemy will one-shot your characters if you aren't maxing out your body stat at every turn, which severely limits your ability to make an effective character you'll enjoy playing.  Overall this is a good game, but balancing is an issue at every turn.  Either things are consistently too easy, or too hard, with not anything in the way of a middle ground.			"

												Excellent tactical RPG with a strong focus on story. Tons of skills, abilities, and weapon types to choose from allow for a good level of replayability, especially if you get the Dragonfall DLC (also recommended!) but there are some fun user-generated campaigns in the workshop too, though most still need some rounding out. Mix and match from weapon-focused skills like swords, thrown weapons like shurikens or grenades, pistols, rifles, and SMGs as well as magical abilities from fire and lighting to summoned spirits or chi attacks, or go with a more technological approach and use drone allies or hack computer, turret, and camera systems or even enter the digital Matrix to fight AI programs with your own.

												If you're a fan of the tabletop you should find at least a bit of pleasure out of this, if in nothing but the character creation. The included scenario is fun, but doesn't demand much replay, and while there is plenty of player generated content the basic premise can get old pretty fast. (Visit fixer, get qeust, kill baddies, return to fixer, repeat) Combined with the pretty hefty load times when going from zone to zone it can make the game drag. I'm still a fan of the franchise though, so fanboy as I am I'd still reccomend it.			"

												Picked this one up when it was on sale, as I was curious.Turned out to be a great decison! My review as follows:ProsVery slick graphic novel type style and artCyberpunk environment and decking is awesome! Adds a lot to the storyUse of drone combat is interestingGreat story, and you can see they put effort into the dialog choicesGood character development, you can see how different and unique each character isLots of text -- feels like a story that's interactive, good immersion for the playerSmooth, sensible combat model -- turn based (which I prefer), but never feels slow or clunkyFor some reason, the system won't save the rest of my review. Anyway, it was a fun game!8.0/10.0			"

												All i can say is just wow! very solid turnbased rpg. Don't listen to all those people who keep bashing the game because this wasnt in the table top or that wasnt supposed to be able to... in the table top etc. Their right about one thing IT ISNT THE TABLE TOP VERSION! Instead this is a very enjoyable love letter to the series from a company thats put  a lot of time to making this feel like it could be in the shadow run universe. The character customization alone can  make or break the game for you, seeing how the focus was on gameplay and ability cuztomization rather then visual. But i gotta say i had so much fun with the mage and building my crew and the awesome story that id recommend it to anyonbe looking for a goood rpg, not and i repeat NOT to some one whos looking to see a visual version of the table top. p.s. the visual style of this game is mid blowing!

I did find the final antagonist a little bit underwhelming though but for a low budget game I can understand the few flaws. Once done I didn't feel like replaying through the story again.Can't wait to play Dragonfall, I hear it's more open than the original. If the gameplay improve on this one it should be good too.			"

												There are no words for how much I could recommend Shadowrun Returns. It brings back the excellent feel of old isometric view strategy RPGs like Fallout and Wasteland in a modern day, with the Sixth World taking you in and shaping you into a runner. Dead Man's Switch, the base campaign that comes with Shadowrun Returns is a good entrypoint into the Shadowrun world if you have never experienced it before. Unfortunately it lacks in a bit of my favorite aspect, Decking, but it makes up for it in an exciting, well paced story. The expansion, Dragonfall, takes what SR started in Dead Man's Switch and runs with it even further than it went before. Instead of being in the ever used area of Seattle (one that was used in both 16-bit consoles as well as DMS), it takes you to Germany to face off against an Elder Dragon. The best feature of SR is the Steam Workshop. The community has taken Shadowrun Returns and made their own campaigns, their own weapons, skills, anything you can possibly imagine being in the Sixth World. Just, go check it out.			"

												As a Seattle localite I found Shadowrun Returns to be something more than just a game. The atmosphere and art direction is something I know to be familiar; The dark undertones and ice-cold attitude of characters is a dead-on representation of the city I know, whether it be civilians, corporations, police or criminals... The story is immersive, the visual and auditory artwork is spectular and the RPG elements leave little to be desired. Overall Shadowrun Returns is a nearly perfect single player Cyberpunk RPG. In addition to the campaign the Shadowrun Editor provides more gamplay opportunities.			"

												Turn-based strategy games are having somewhat of a revival the past few years and Shadowrun is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who enjoys turn-based strategic combat. The original comes with one campaign, but to buy the game for the campaign is to miss it's true value: it comes with an editor that allows you to create your own campaigns and it's fairly simple to use. It ships with highly detailed documentation so even if you don't know how to use it out of the box, it only takes 5 minutes of reading the wiki until you're making your own game. When you buy this you're not just buying the box, but a community of game designers with dozens of excellent campaigns and stories to experience. Shadowrun is about immersing yourself in the dark world of a cyberpunk future. It relies heavily on storytelling and it does an excellent job. Expect a wonderful original story, a tool to craft your own, and an opportunity to be part of a community of brilliant writers who make even more campaigns for you to enjoy. With Shadowrun, what you're getting is a community.			"

												I bought this game pretty much on a hunch, a hunch that it would be something I would enjoy immensely, and I was right. As soon as I step into the Main Menu I came across a great tune which got me into the right mood. The character creation is overall pretty good in my honest opinion, having a set of difference races, classes and ettiquets to choose from and then the usual skill ""tree"". If you enjoy turn based combat games I'm positive that you'll enjoy this one, as soon as I got my first encounter it reminded me of the XCOM: EU and Omerta, mainly due to the cover system and because I've played those too fairly recently. The combat ranges from a variety of standard guns, hand to hand combat and spells to the deploying drones and summoning spirits to fight by your side, it also uses the standard chance to hit per attack with a somewhat medium variety of skills and abilities to use. The world is really well put together and the writing does a tremendous great job of putting you inside the game world where magic meets cutting edge tech and when the Earth is a total mess. As I said the writing is pretty good, atleast I thought so, and that made me enjoy this game much more than I was expecting to. I'm looking foward to the user created content and the upcoming DLC and I HIGHLY recommend this to any fan of classic party RPGs or turn based combat.			"

The game includes one campaign, but with Steamworks, there are hundreds of campaigns and worlds built by the community to explore.  I haven't tried the user made stories yet, but if they are anything even close to the main campaign, they should be excellent.  This game has it all, fun, strategy and replay value.  Buy it if you like to read a cool story and strategize through a challenging storyline.  Be ready to don your detective fedora too.			"

The original campaign is ok, but it's not stellar, i felt it needed improvements on a lot of areas (from level design to gameplay). The dragonfall expansion improved a lot of stuff, the characters are more interesting, and also the Berlin is really cool. This is for fans of mature rpgs with lots of choices (most of them aren't that easy), really cool lore and story and engaging gameplay. You can choose the race you want, the features you want, and build the character you like the most. You are given a lot of freedom.The workshop adds a lot to this game, you can find dozens of interesting campaigns, that will keep you hooked for many hours. "

												It's a breath of fresh air to see a serious RPG with real-life problems, even though the world has changed, there's no difference in how people act, and the way this is portrayed is absolutely amazing. Shadowrun Returns DMS and Dragonfall both made a great impression on me. I cared about the characters and what happened to them! But most of all, I must say the Karma system and the different skill paths make this game awesome. Sci-fi meets Fantasy is done right by harebrained schemes! I urge you to buy this game and experience it for yourself. Personally, I find the Decker class is my favorite, but do whatever you want (I'm thinking of trying out a mage or street samurai).

												I waited on the berlin expansion to review this game, and I definitely recommend it now.The original campaign, Dead Man's Switch, had a handful of problems at launch that had kept people from being as upbeat about it as they could, but many of those have also been fixed as of the expansion (Weapon balance, save system, bugs). Dead man's switch is a pretty cool campaign, and has a lot of nostalgic throwbacks to the SNES game. It's very Shadowrun Seattle (Megacorps, historic figures, gang control), and a bit short and linear, but still cool. I would give it a 8/10 or so.The Berlin expansion is the most hooked I've been by an RPG in a really long time. The writing is fantastic, the characters are cool, and the world is really fun. The combat isn't quite as polished as say, XCOM, but it's passable and doesn't detract in any way. The flux state (prior to the invasion and second Berlin wall going up) is well depicted, and you become very invested in the stories of everyone living in your block of the anarchists haven.There's much more freedom to approach things differently in the Berlin expansion, and you can take on side missions from the Berlin hub in the order you want, or even skip one or two if you want. It's also a bit longer than Dead man's switch, and features some new weapons. I would give Dragonfall a 9/10, easily.			"

												Whether you're familiar with the Shadowrun universe or not, this game is a blast. An intriguging, noir-ish story, excellent environments, and enjoyable tactical combat make this one a winner. It recalls the older, isometric CRPG's of days past, and if Shadowrun Returns is any indicator of how good upcoming projects such as Wasteland 2 and Project Eternity will turn out, then we are in for some good times as gamers. My only complaint about the game is the checkpoint system, which sometimes takes you back far enough where you have to repeat scenes of dialogue, but it's a small annoyance in what is an extremely cool game set in one of coolest universes you'll ever see in a video game.

Posted: October 9, 2014
												Okay, so I understand this game is based on a tabletop roleplaying module, which I think is critical to understanding what it is and isn't. The biggest successes of this game are when it adheres to those origins and carries them into the video game world, whereas its biggest failures are in the different limitations of those two things.The best thing about this game, by far, is the world/setting. It's unique, interesting, and just damn cool. For this reason, the game sort of gradually improves as you play through it and get to see more and more of the Powers That Be within the gameworld. If you find yourself an hour in and interested but not completely hooked, keep going. The ending is pretty cool because it raises so many other questions and hints at grander goings-on behind the curtain of the one story you're shown. I think more than anything this game was never intended as a standalone thing but rather as a platform for the creation of more campaigns, a digital version of the tabletop format. It works pretty well in that respect. I especially loved how the class system played into and reinforced the character of the setting. This may be the only Steam game I've played where I think I will definitely go try out some player-created content, as well.Some practical aspects of the game mechanics definitely need work, though. As a first time player, I rolled a Decker character, and this turned out to be a terrible mistake. There is absolutely no benefit to being a Decker: you only get to use your special abilities at all from halfway through the campaign, and even then there's always another Decker given to you whether you want/need them or not whenever you would have any opportunity to use that class's skills. Choosing which dialect your character is versed in also has minimal benefit unless you happen to choose the one that gives you more money.By far the biggest downfall of this game was its crippling linearity and limited choice. You cannot affect the story in any meaningful way or even dramatically change the way individual characters treat you. This would not be half as noticeable a flaw if the game wasn't rooted in the tabletop style, as I said before. Tabletop RPGs are entirely based on letting you do whatever you want and just collaboratively creating the story as you go along. A system in which a static, linear story is told with only minor superficial player choices is a really questionable design decision in that context.So, is the game worth it? I would definitely say yes. I liked it more the more I played it, and the end of each act kept expanding the scope of the conflict in a satisfying way. I thought the story was pretty good and served to highlight the setting in the right ways. I will probably play the sequel/expansion/DLC/whatever once I have nonzero moneydollars. You should just know what you're in for, I think.			"

												I had no preexisting investment in the Shadowrun universe before playing this game. It would be fair to call this an RPG-lite with a pretty compelling setting. Fans of the original Fallout games will find the AP-based combat system familiar and enjoyable, but the level of freedom (both in terms of direction of the plot, as well as freedom within an area) is not what you get from those games.For a budget priced game, though, it holds up. The game is better realized in the standalone Dragonfall expansion, though.			"

												If you're a fan of RPGs, Cyberpunk & Noir mixed together with some XCOM: Enemy Unknown tactical combat, then you can pretty much get it all in one package by buying this game. I've personally never played the first Shadowrun, but Returns has me intrigued with its awesome soundtrack of synth-electronic tunes and a few interesting characters. Like in true old-school fashion there's no voice acting, which when it comes down to it, is an afterthought anyway. Good voice acting & Bad voice acting can certainly affect the playability of the story, but If voice acting is a most then you'll find none of it here. This is a game for peeps who are looking for an old-fashioned RPG and I'd say it succeeds at that. Despite its flaws, such as the absence of a save feature in exchange for an auto-save function and rather short length; It's damn good!			"

Shadowrun Returns brings this back in full force. Great looking artistic graphics, very well written story and game play that is enjoyable. For me this is one of the best games i played all year. And if your new to the Shadowrun series(like me) then this is a good way to start, as each character has a rich story and you get to know pretty much everything about the world in the first hour or so.

												Welcome to a huge, dark world run by evil businessmen, naive rogue traders and freedom-fighting swashbucklers! Shadowrun Returns offers you a story worthy of its name, filled with sassy dialog, mob goons hunting you, monsters and magic. The gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable, along with pretty much all else in this game.A true gem for fans of cyberpunk, old school RPG's and, of course, Shadowrun.			"

												An excelent old-school style RPG set in the Shadowrun universe (cyberpunk + magic), complete with turn-based combat and an isometric perspective.I encountered a few difficulty spikes which could trip you up if you aren't careful, but nothing that a moderately prepared player can't cope with.A great use of the Shadowrun IP, and a worthy successor to the classic 16-bit games.

												Edit: Updated for the newest patch.Shadowrun returns tries *really hard* to be a great game. It's got a great history in tabletop roleplay, and the super nintendo shadowrun might be the most overlooked RPG of all time. The framework is definitely laid to make this one of the best retro gaming experiences of the last few years. Sadly, a lack of attention to detail often holds it back. Simple things, like healing kits in the store before the last fight, have been flat out overlooked or left out. It may be intentional, however there are enough times that it happens that it really feels like the game was slightly rushed. Another great example of this is the decking system. Decking itself is fun, if a bit tedious at times. However, there are 3 missions in the entire game that actually allow you to deck. And the times there are decking quests? One requires you to take an npc along as a sidekick (not bad, all things considered). The next decking mission? The npc *has to* do it, you don't even help. I realize there may be plot reasons, but where it ends up is that there's an entire skill tree that they literally only let you use twice. My first run was a decker, and I got through 3/4ths of the game before I got to actually use the skills I built for. Frustrating doesn't describe it. Another issue is how healing magic only heals the last attack to hit you. Mobs love throwing a big hit, then pinging you for 1 damage. This wouldn't even be an issue, except for the fact that you have limited medkits, and can't force your helpers to pick em up on the fly. Either you get them, or they go to your stash. This isn't an issue in combat mode, but you can't toggle combat mode manually, so if you're out of a fight? Hope you're the medic, because you're the one getting the health packs. Movement can be equally tricky, especially when it starts getting crowded. Misclicks, clicks in wrong places, moving instead of attacking (the worst of the bunch, as it's pretty easy to die if you're not behind cover) are commonplace if you're not careful. Add the ability to manually enter combat mode at any time (so npcs can pick stuff up), or inventory management on the fly, mixed with a bit of an easier way to move to a specific location in a crowd? A lot of my problems would immediately go away.Shadowrun combat is fun and engaging. There's a deep variety of skills and abilities that all influence the battle field in different ways. Mage-based spellcasting feels powerful, especially if you beef yourself up to be able to take a hit (you'll have to) and stand on a ley line. Rigging is a *blast*, if a bit frustrating as they only allow one of each drone type per tier. This means, if you want 2 attack drones? One's gonna suck a bit. Summoning, similarly, is a ton of fun and feels really powerful. They put quite a few free summoning points in the game, it's one of the few ways you can use the environment against your enemy. As for Adepts? They are a bit under-utilized, IMO. Right now they're heavily melee focused, and take a lot of finesse to get full use out of, because you're so skill-thin. Body for HP, Quickness because Dodge, Strength for melee attacks and the attack focus skill, Will for Chi Casting. Late bloomer doesn't describe them, even the supposedly super-awesome npc you pick up near the end isn't all that impressive. And, without spoilers, he's one of the strongest characters in the entire Shadowrun canon.The campaign's difficulty is incredibly well balanced. I was thrilled when even my biggest indestructible troll still had to take cover from time to time, because becoming fully immortal is impossible when your enemies have fully automatic machine guns. Some of the UGC (actually, most of it I've played to this point) doesn't have the same light touch, though, making swapping from the official campaign a pretty steep learning curve. The only real issue with the main campaign is length. It's incredibly short, especially for this style of game. Lots of people lament the fact that it's a fairly linear experience, but I personally enjoyed that. Not every game needs to be a sandbox, and Shadowrun Returns has a very distinct story to tell. Some may feel shoehorned, but I just enjoyed going along for the ride. The writing in the main campaign is *fantastic* and easily the strongest thing about it. They paid a lot of attention to detail, and really worked a lot of the flavor of the shadowrun world into their story. I *love* the big bad, as well. They definitely swung for the fences with the nemesis in dead man's switch. This is a great touch, since I know a lot of us pnp shadowrun players have fond memories of them. As well, major and well known players in the shadowrun universe make cameos, and some may even join your team. There's a great early nod to the snes shadowrun game that really set a great tone. This game pays obvious respect to what came before it. The fact that Jordan Weisman was responsible for this is very apparent in the plot and tone. Also, for those wanting a sandbox style adventure? Dragonfall is very much along those lines.The graphics, as well, are spot on. The game feels fun, and cartoony, and really captures the essence of the shadowrun universe. Hyperkinetic neon and chrome, with a touch of Tolkien fantasy, blend together oddly well. None of it feels out of place. My only qualms about the background art boil down to there not being enough of them, which becomes a problem with UGC as it all starts to look exactly the same. The sprites are also well designed, if a bit generic at times (I'm looking at you, every troll in the game), and the game wouldn't hurt for the option of using different faces/body types. The sound? Meh. The soundtrack is fun at first, but quickly gets repetitive. I tend to turn off the music and put on some industrial while I play, or other music suitable for shadowrun. After the first playthrough, or even the first few hours? You probably will too. UGC... It's the elephant in the room. UGC is a great idea in theory, and supposedly a high selling point for the game. The ability to create your own worlds, and play the worlds other people create, is *fantastic* on paper. And sometimes, it even works in execution. This is seeming to be the exception to the rule. UGC suffers from the same thing it does in most other games that feature it. It's uneven, balance is often lacking, the plots are frequently very weak, and... Well... It was made by the community, with all of the lack of polish that entails. There are a few *strong* exceptions to this rule, but it seems overall like the ones with the great plot lack any semblance of combat balance. As well, and as mentioned, the art assets get rather repetitive. A lot of the UGC just looks cut-and-paste, which is probably because they are. On the upside, sourcebooks from the original pen and paper game being fully converted into the game, and heavily fine tuned. Some of the creators have done a lot of work adding even more customization options, which is *amazing*. The major downfall to UGC is already becoming apparent post-Dragonfall, however. A few of the people responsible for large conversion kits or well known adventures have walked away, because the expansion completely broke their work. It's the same problem the UGC community of the first Neverwinter Nights faced, with every new expansion comes 10-20 hours of work to put your mods back together again.Overall, this game is fantastic. It's got some quirks, but Dragonfall cleaned up a lot of bugs or issues that were once holding it back. This is solid retro gaming. 8/10			"

												I'll get straight to the point:The Good: It's official campaign Dead Man's Switch is pretty good so to speak. The story it has justifies the linearity of the game's design as it's pretty much like reading an interactive book (like some of the older RPGs of the 90s). The game is practically friendly to almost any PC considering that it relies on the cyberpunk aesthetics to make the game look pretty. In terms of combat, it's basically a simplified version of Xcom: Enemy Unknown and if you like that game, you are going to be fairly familiar with how the game works. And even if you are done with the main campaign, there's still more to offer from the community itself through UGCs which can be downloaded through Steam directly or through the Shadowrun Nexus (especially if you own the DRM-free version on GOG) And by the time of this review (which is the same time as when the DLC Dragonfall first came out) you can actually save without relying on the autosave feature. The Bad: Due to the fact that the replayability of this game past Dead Man's Switch (and Dragonfall) is dependent on the UGC of the community, you will probably have to take your time to look for custom campaigns that are actually complete, let alone any good. Most of the complete ones are usually the shortest or the simplest of campaigns. In addition, the Dead Man's Switch campaign doesn't seem to give much options to have a players who want to play a Face or a Decker as they are either very few instances to begin with or doesn't truly payoff. I don't like the fact that I have to actually rely on hiring more runners for a particular mission and they feel restrictive in which you cannot give them suitable gear or even have them hold on to an medkit if your inventory is full. Also, there are certain dialog choices that are greyed out if you don't meet the required stats to qualify. I'd rather have them hidden to keep me surprised. On top of that, I know that the idea behind this game is to make the player the main protagonist, but the problem with that is that this is Shadowrun, and the reason you have a variety of runner archetypes in a team is because you can take advantage of what they are capable of inside and outside of combat. Instead, that variety is only restricted to combat and combat alone save of you being able to appoint a hired/companion decker to hack into the Matrix for you in case you are incapable of such a task.Overall: Shadowrun Returns has it's flaws but I like what Harebrained as treated it so far. It's not an amazing game and it's hardly going to be the ""best RPG EVAR!!!11!"" but if you appreciate a good cyberpunk story with a touch of magic with a potential for more to come whether by the devs themselves through DLC or by the Shadowrun community, then I'd say this is a very safe purchase.

												As a gamer constantly looking for as immersive as possible and varying different experiences, it felt as if I found a gold mine just for myself after 1 hour within Shadowrun Returns. The game runs as half tactic combat, half story. Both are very well made and entertaining, but where the game truly excells is the story. At first I was put off by the lack of voice in the game. Why are the pretty and detailed avatars with excessive and rich language representing the dialogue, entirely silent? I dig around options looking for volume slider, but there was none. Some minutes of gaming later I realized the person who wrote the story, descriptions, and dialogue lines is a pure genious. Reading your way into the world of Shadowrun is like reading a truly well written novel. I really really hope the person behind these texts continues the work in the next Shadowrun game. Thus, the game world is immersive, colourful, rich. There is zero point in spoiling the story, but it should suffice to say that it is very good and that♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down in unexpected extremely well written ways. The world of the game is not so big, but the way it is presented and through the richness of details you get a sense that it is huge, living, and real, and that there are so many more interesting ""♥♥♥♥♥♥going down"" kind of things going on besides your own story. Sahdowrun's RPG elements are not very deep but fun and engaging enough to encourage even several playthroughs. I would suggest Shadowrun Returns to anyone interested in a truly good story or immersive world, or those who like tactical combat. The game is truly bad♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I managed to pick this up on a steam sale a while back. My friend suggested I just pirate it because the game wouldn't be worth 15 euro. How wrong he was! I've just come off finishing this entire game in one sitting, and the reason for that is because the game is that good.The game comes with one campaign which is called 'dead man's switch'. This is the campaign the developpers made and is a very good showcase of what you can do in Shadowrun returns. The story sucks you in and the entire realistic atmosphere gives off a gritty blade runner feeling. You actually feel the grime that exists in the world and the parallels to our world are scarily frequent.The gameplay itself is a blast, you play the game using a self constructed avatar which you assign a 'class'. Which can be broken down into a fighter, monk, mage, summoner, hacker and trapper. The game then divides the points into the needed categories and from there you are free to specialise your character how you see fit. This gives you an insane amount of customisation as far as your character is concerned. Besides yourself you can hire help to go along on the runs (missions), you can preview their stats and items before picking them and during the mission you are free to control them as you see fit.The game also contains a lot of dialogue which helps to flesh out the living and breathing world. You sometimes get choices which you feel will have some impact later on along the line, sadly you generally don't see any effect from your choices besides alternate ways of attack something or something being worth more or being more expensive.I suggest anyone to atleast give shadowrun a try, the game is really fun, able to pull you into it's world and the challenge it provides is just right in my opinion. Despite in the last mission the two 'superior' characters being weaker then my own dwarf. ""Reality can be found in the shadows""			"

I played it after playing Dragonfall... [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]...so the reviews will look the same!Finished in about 13 hours, so I will talk very consciously about it. I didn't know it was an indie kickstarted project developed for smartphones and tablets in mind and this explains a lot of cons.First, I would like to talk about the gameplay. Having experience with a lot of RPGs and turn-based games I have been disappointed: percentages to hit seem to be flawed, covering system is ridiculous, inventory is caotic, some combo are overpowered (you'll instakill with rifles and relative stats at 8+), experience points are given not by killing enemies, your party doesn't upgrade, AI always attacks first (resolved in S:HK) and it' also dumb (you can wait for them at corners and instakill with overwatch), you are not given so many possibilities of attacking, you can't use your items outside of combat, you are not given the option of using your teamates abilities in the quests, you have a limited choice of weapons and upgrades, etc.Then, the story: the first hours were nice (I felt like in sci-fi crime scene) but when things started to became interesting... game ended. This is not the only con: 1) Dialogues are scripted, the choices you'll make DO NOT alter the game 2) Skills are useless for dialogues: even when you are given the choice to use them, they just provide a couple of more rows of text to read or just a 20% more money 3) *someone die, so we have to find the culprit* bla bla *turns out all the city is in danger* bla bla  *gear up and go final attack*.Graphics: from the screenshots it seems to be very powerful... it's not. Just colourful.The matrix puzzles are few and could be passed easily. Same as the envinroment puzzles: you just have to search a little around. There isn't enough attention to the gameplay.I enjoyed it? Yes and no. Yes because I like these type of games, no because X-Com, Civilizations, Fallout still stand on a higher level. I would call it a nice time waster. If you are looking for a solid game, you should look elsewhere. Dragonfall is better, but I hope they'll get even better in the next chapters.Best played with Keyboard & MouseRecommended Buy Price < 10$Score 6,5/10 "

												The world of Shadowrun Returns is based on the tabletop RPG Shadowrun. As such, the lore is well established and will certainly please many cyberpunk fans. When you purchase Shadowrun Returns, don't expect to be satisfied with ""Dead Man's Switch"", the campaign that comes pre-installed with it. No, you are buying this game in order to run user generated campaigns set in the world of Shadowrun. In my opinion, ""Dead Man's Switch"" is merely a way for the developers to show the capabilities of the game engine and how much you can do with the campaign editor. With that said, ""Dead Man's Switch"" is around 6 hours long and features a rather linear but interesting story. In this campaign, a fellow shadowrunner that you knew hires you to avenge him for a hundred thousand nuyen, through the use of a dead man's switch. You travel to Seattle in order to find the killer and get paid, but as luck would have it, it involves plenty of jumping through hoops. Once you complete the campaign, you'll find yourself wanting more and that can be easily solved through a quick browse in the Steam workshop.			"

												Some folks have noted that the core module ""Dead Man's Switch"" is short and the gameplay is limited. Those are both fair points, but when thought of as a weekend romp through a cyberpunk landscape, Shadowrun Returns is perfect. You're not bogged down learning in-depth combat systems or slogging through tutorials. The game gets off to a snappy start and doesn't stop. The writing is easily the best part in setting the tone even if the graphics won't blow you away. I wouldn't say the story is short so much as not cluttered with filler. Every step is meaningful and that's downright refreshing in an RPG nowdays despite shaving hours off of the game.			"

The end of the main story is just where the experience begins, though, because the community has already started creating some incredible content. This is to Shadowrun what Neverwinter Nights was to D&D, with new community modules cropping up everywhere to make the game much bigger than any single company could make. It'll just keep getting better as time goes on.This is a worthy Shadowrun game, recommended for everyone who loves party-based RPGs with turn-based tactical combat.			"

												This game is AMAZING! When I saw it, I saw it as another game like the classic Fallout 1 and 2, and yes I know this is a rebirth of the classic Shadowrun rpg series which was amazing! But this game brings it back in HD and visual graphics of our time and it is just fun. Fun is how I can describe this, it brings rpgs back, with indepth skill trees, where you cant unlock everything, so you have to choose what you need. No levels, as you get karma points to unlock your skill and stats, Its just lots of fun. The visuals are definately amazing and the whole steampunk motif is just amazing! Why arent there more games set in an ORIGINAL steampunk universe, that isnt a final fantasy game. If you guys want a Xmas present for yourself, get yourself Shadowrun Returns, it is just worth it. :) 5/5P.S. Did I also mention that all the fan made created content is free so as long as people are making their own stories set in the Shadowrun universe, we keep getting stories to play. :D			"

												Let me start out by saying that this is the first Shadowrun game that I have ever actually played. Yes I have tried the 1993 Shadowrun for the Super Nintendo but I could never get into it due to it's... Interesting controls (read point and click with a controller). But the game concept and the universe intrigued me, Over the years I forgot the name of it several times but would bring it up every few years and try to find the name of it and feel that they should remake it for the pc where it ultimately belonged. Well a few months ago was one such time that It popped into my head, I did a quick search for it and what did I find but a new Shadowrun being made for its proper platform (psst its the PC). I instantly fell in love with the style and everything I say was just the best thing I have ever seen.Flash forward to now where I have been given the ability to write this review and I am just stoked to be able to finally play a Shadowrun game without being hindered by a D-pad. Well I wasn't home when I got the Beta code but I had a 2 hour drive till I got home and then I had to download it and set it up. This just ate at me up inside but I managed to do it and when I first started it up I felt a chill as the dark and music (composed by Marshall Parker and Sam Powell from the 1993 SNES Shadowrun) started to play and the menu appeared.When you start a new game your greeted with a fairly standard character creation menu. You can select your gender, race and choose between several preconfigured or a custom skill sets for your character as well as select from one of several portraits and player models. The models look nice but are lacking the level of detail that you see with other games though this low detail level just feels right in the world, fitting in with the 2D environments. Each race has specific traits that are more prominent then others, these usually have higher starting values and higher max values. After choosing a character model and skill set you get to pick traits and spend your skill points on your starting stats. As soon as you are done creating your character you start in a modest apartment. After looking around the apartment for a while you get a call from an old friend and are sent into a flashback where you learn more about yourself and your friend but more importantly you get to experience the combat system for the first time.Shadowrun Returns is broken up into missions and uses an auto save feature that saves at the beginning of a mission. It uses a tactical combat system where you have your squad and each member has action points. Each action your characters take use action points and once they're gone then that character can't do anything till the next turn.This is customary for tactical games like this and even new people to this style of play should get used to it rather quickly. The combat system uses cover and line of site as a tactic and shows you how good the cover is and to what side you have cover on. This system isn't perfect as it doesn't always show that you're in cover and at times it's hard to tell if your line of site is broken simply due to the layout of the room and the camera angle.Shadowrun Returns comes with a full scenario editor that allows users to create whole new missions and stories and share them with the community. The editor has been out for many of the kickstarter backers for a while now so there is going to be plenty of user made content available. Someone is currently working on recreating the old SNES Shadowrun into Shadowrun Returns using the editor available here http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaigns/snes-shadowrun/mapsOverall I feel that the 2D backgrounds and the 3D character models mesh very well together and unlike in some games they feel right together. The story is excellent and you don't feel like it's being force fed down your gullet so you can play the game for the story or the game play or both. The main story is quite linier and it tends to feel like there's some handholding going on but you can choose to help someone or leave them to their own devices and save your own skin. I am not a master of table top RPG's but this feels like how I would imagine a table top RPG should be on a PC.Check out my video review on YouTube @

												I have been role playing 4th edition for a few years now and i have to say when i backed this and SR online i had really high hopes especially because of the people who were making it. i got to say SRO still needs alot of work but it is getting there.now SRR is a game to behold, the first one holds up well and as a game is good but lacked something i could not put my finger on. the customization is good even if it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up the skills making it possible to be just about anything you want to be.i understand that games have limits and as a player you want to be anything possible and since the SNES does allow you to be just about anything as well i will let that slide.Turn base combat works well with the amount of players you will be playing with and who you are up against and even if it might give you the impression that its slow paced the way it carries itself will feel very fluid and fast you will be scratching at the keys hoping that lost shotgun shell wont finish off one of your runners.Now let me get to Dragonfall, this game has it all and i am still so thrilled to be playing it, the runs feel like a typical milk run but it will always turn south and bad things become worse everytime. the plot devices for characters is rich and want you to keep looking for more even if they are side characters. this truely feels like a shadowrun game and it should be enjoyed to the fullest as a gamer and as a role player.the feel and atmosphere of SR is there and if you are a role player yourself deffently give it a go you wont be disapointed, but if you feel SRR isnt as its holding up to be then you must get dragonfall trust me!!!

												I was never one for isometric RPG's however I did a bit of research on this game and what attracted me the most was its setting. The gritty, dark, futuristic fantasy setting is portrayed quite well in the game in terms of its art style, environmental design and the text based descriptions of your encounters. By itself the default campaign can seem quite restricted. As though its trying to give you the illusion that your decisions impacts everything differently when its more than likely going to play out the same way. However I was still compelled to go on because I found the story somewhat interesting and simply enjoyed getting engrossed in the world Shadowrun Returns puts you in.  The combat itself is simple but it doesn't seem like it would get repetitive fast for me. What makes this game worth it for me though would be the wide array of user made content I see int he Steam workshop. Some of them seem well made and I intend to put more hours into them once I'm through the main campaign.			"

												The audiovisual ambiance, player character development, and combat mechanics are all the 'just about right' range, allowing for a game experience that is nuanced without being bogged down by too much complexity, but the thing you should play this game for is the story - the 'cyberpulp' writing brings the setting to life in a way that hearkens back to a time when a game's box art almost always fit the narrative better than it fit the in-game footage.

												For a  turn based, and thus slow paced, game this is a pretty solid buy (especially on sale). The original mission is kind of short but the Dragonfall DLC is longer and more enjoyable. Also, the DLCs which I am just starting to get into are prety solid. I'm a big fan of ond SNES style RPGs which is why I wanted to try this game, and I wasn't dissapointed.ONLY COMPLAINTThere isn't a lot of replay value in the main mission, and there are not a lot of weapons/spells/equipment choices to keep you coming back and trying new thins with the same character class. Once you've played through with a class, it kind of loses its novelty.			"

												Shadowrun is easily the best story-driven tactical turn-based adventure-combat game I've played since Fallout 2. The original campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is great, the second (Dragonfall) is fantastic, and the tons and tons of UGC campaigns available are full of gems that easily rival the official publications. I suggest trying out Nightmare Harvest for a great & funny story, and Shadowrun Ultimate for a semi-MMO player-driven ""work-your-way-up"" open world experience.			"

Where one of my runners gets knocked out a window but grapples his way back in maybe a floor or two lower. Did you guys play some new XCOM recently? can you imagine a decker across the street in another bulding maybe with a sniper and a squad fighting their way up to be in a cross fire another runner team on another mission. will it be enemy of my enemy or just another target.

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun and relatively simple cyberpunk rpg. The underlying systems have some weaknesses and punish character builds that don't specialize. However, the sense of adventure is great throughout and the game is the perfect length so as to not allow the combat mechanics to overstay their welcome. The editor is too complex for myself and possibly most people who were expecting something on the level of the original Neverwinter Nights, and this means that there won't be many well-made user generated campaigns which is a shame. The Dragonfall DLC campaign is even better than the base game.			"

The included editor makes a lot of new homemade material avaliable out there. And, of course, the Dragonfall mission is even better.All perfect for Shadowrun stuff fans and casual gamers, but perhaps not a big deal for hardcore gamers. I must say, I loved it at first sight!

												Overview:Pros:-	2D environments and portraits-	Interesting characters-	great writing-	refreshing setting-	diverse skill systemCons:-	3D effects-	linear story-	story goes a little off the rail in the final act-	endgame fights (enemies appear out of nowhere, required party members)RPGs are my favorite genre. Nevertheless I didn’t enjoy recent RPGs like I used to. Yes, they might have great graphics, good gameplay mechanics or a well-crafted skill system, but the one aspect I find them lacking is the storytelling. Shadowrun Returns is an exception.Before I start getting into the details, I have to say I watched several gameplay and review videos before I picked it up. To be honest – I wasn’t impressed. Even though the hand-crafted 2D environments are gorgeous and vivid, the character models as well as the visual effects are far from impressive. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot and I wasn’t disappointed.The Shadowrun universe combines Cyberpunk aspects with the return of magic and metahumans in a futuristic world. The player slips into the role of a shadowrunner, an operative who will steal, infiltrate, hack and kidnap for the right price. The protagonist has to deal with powerful corporations, corruption, mythical creatures and fellow shadowrunners to survive.When it comes to creating a character that is your own, Shadowrun excels. You can choose between five races you might find in a fantasy RPG (human, elf, dwarf, ork, troll), which feel quite fresh in this unfamiliar setting. Your character can choose from six pre-made classes:-	Street Samurai: become a gun-wielding or close-range killing machine-	Mage: Fireballs, buffs and Debuffs. The familiar choice.-	Decker: jack into the Matrix to fight security systems with your programs-	Rigger: use small drones to support your team or deal damage-	Shaman: use totems or summon spirits to defeat your enemies-	Adept: use magic to enhance your own abilities, making yourself a weaponFurthermore you can also start from scratch and spend Karma points and create your own experience. Technoshaman? Combat Decker? Everything is possible, as long as you don’t spread the Karma points too thin. Skill checks are quite common in dialogue options and spending some points in Charisma or Intelligence can be worthwhile.The inventory system is quite rudimentary. Characters wear an outfit and can carry up to three weapons. Everyone can carry up to six consumables and Magic users as well as Deckers have a spellbook with up to six slots. To further improve skills or stats, cyberware can be implanted. However this results in increased cooldowns for spells.The gameplay revolves around a team of up to 4 shadowrunners. During the majority of the game you can hire a team and choose them depending on your group dynamics. Or your cash on hand, since shadowrunners don’t work for free. The combat system is round-based and reminds of Fallout 1 & 2. Action points have to be spend wisely to move, attack or use consumables like medkits and grenades.You have to read! Where many games try to tell their stories with cutscenes and voice acting, Shadowrun Returns presents the story with superb writing. Whenever you travel to a new location or meet a character the situation is beautifully described before you have to worry about combat or dialogue choices. Combined with vibrant character portraits, the characters you encounter feel alive.The different races and classes offer replayability. My first playthrough (normal, Human Decker) took 9+ hours. Due to the familiarity with enemy placement and linear storyline, my second run (very hard, Dwarf Mage) took a little over five hours. I can see myself coming back to try out different classes, however for now I’m enjoying the Dragonfall DLC (very hard, Troll Adept).I would highly recommend this game to players who enjoy round-based RPGs, which concentrate on storytelling.

												A quick note - I've only played Dragonfall, and have not yet touched the original campaign.This was a really well-done narrative game, with a surprisingly fun tactical component, reminiscent of x-com (and the upcoming Wasteland 2).  While linear, the game did a stellar job of making it not feel linear.  The narrative was rather strong, and kept me interested the entirety of the way through.  The author's of the game clearly knew the setting well (as one would hope with the creator of the setting being on the team), and knew what elements worked well and wouldn't work well in the world.There are some caveots: there were some bugs which cropped up periodically, that if I hadn't been regularly saving would have forced me to restart the mission.  (On the other hand, at least this game would let you restart the mission without too much fuss).  There were some instances of some items dissapearing permanently if I didn't pick them up.  Another big issue is the lack of ability to change my party member's gear, or to even control them outside of combat.Overall, this is one of the strongest narrative games I have played in a long while.  Even some annoyances (and the inability to give weapons I find to party members is a big one for me) were unable to dissuade me from finishing the game.  I can't stop talking about this game to my friends, and perhaps you won't be able to either.			"

												With 54 hours of me playing the Core story, expansion pack, and community created content at time of writing, this defintiely deserves a recommendation from me. This is shadowrun. There's not really another good way to put it. Between the fun tactical gameplay, classless character creation, and honestly pretty good graphics, it's a fun and solid game in it's own right, but the community created content is the icing on the cake. The initial campaign sells the game slightly short, in my opinion. It's fun, but it goes a little out of it's way to be a showcase of all the different options available to characters and content creators. If you get the game, and like the mechanics, buy dragonfall. I've sunk over 12 hours into this expansion, and it's a wonderful, character driven journey in a living, responsive environment full of intertesting people. And I'm still a couple of missions from the end. Don't worry too much about the deluxe edition of the standard game, but the core game and Dragonfall are worth every penny.			"

												Okay. Have you played Shadowrun the tabletop RPG? Me neither. The closest i've ever gotten to playing Shadowrun before this game was the counterstrike ripoff on the Xbox 360 (not that it was bad or anything. They just went a very ""safe"" route with it).I had no idea what the setting was. What everything was called. Why in a cyberpunk futuristik setting where would be elves, Dwarfs and trolls. Did i learn anything about that in game? Nope! I did however find it online and i did get a bit intrested in the setting.""So we get that you like the setting of the game. Is it any good? Is it worth my 14 bucks? (Or something like that.))"" Yes, Absolutly. The game is pretty cheap and it has workshop support AKA you'll be old before you run out of content. The community makes content for this all the time and if you would so choose you could make your own pretty easily. They give you all the tools.The main story that comes with the game is a nice touch and it's a pretty decent story too! It's not bad at all but it isnt great. It's good not great. Just a bit of a fair warning on that front.The only thing i wish was in there was some sort of multiplayer. But that would be long and frikking annoying with all the slow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s going ""HMMMMMMM, i wonder if i should heal that guy over there that just took a katana to the face or if i should throw a ineffectual ball of magic at the baddie that use said katana. Let me think about if for 10 min. Calculating every possibility for every move i make for the next what should be 2 hours made 12 thanks to me!""But it doesnt have multiplayer anyway so no real rush. Besides the elitist ♥♥♥♥ers in the world would probably make the game unplayable anyway.SO is the game good? YES. Should you buy it? YUP! Will i go to make a snack after this? probably!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a good game that really just primes you for the DLC.  Dragonfall is a great story and far superior to the base game.  It's much longer and the story is less linear. You have NPC's that are more fleshed out as well as more options of how you want to play your character (good, evil, selfish, or a little of all of it).  I recommend the game. I'm sure we'll be seeing some really good community made campaigns as well.  This game will have a lot of replay value.  Pick it up!			"

Also whats nice is a lot of the storys can be completed in a weekend, (or a night of hardcore gaming). Again reminding me of the old days playing table top RPG's in the coffee shop or at a friends house. Maybe White Wolf Studios will see this and let someone make a proper Vampire the Masqurade game.

												At the time of this writing, Hairbrained Studios have only released ""Dead Man's Switch"" and ""Dragonfall"", with the latter a significantly stronger module than the former. Both are heavily combat-based, and while careful positioning and action choices can tilt battles in your favor, the RNG can make sure that even if you do everything right, your team can still be wiped in a couple rounds due to keyboard-smashing bad luck (in this respect, the combat is very similar to X-COM: Enemy Unknown). But if you're getting an RPG like this, you're hopefully getting it knowing that luck is part of the game.It's all very good fun, particularly on harder difficulties. Agonizing over how to build your character, whom to take on a mission, and how to position them each round should please old-school turn-based RPG purists. The story arcs and character depth are not really fantastic, but the game is built on going out and completing runs (usually by shooting/stabbing/blowing things up, with only occassional decking responsibilities).Definite recommend, particularly if you've played the pencil-and-paper version.

												Shadowrun: Returns and its Expansion/DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a turn-based tactical RPG game created by a studio called Harebrained Schemes out of Seattle, WA. The base game Shadowrun: Returns was released on Steam on July 25th, 2013, and the DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall was released on February 27th, 2014.For those not familiar with the Shadowrun universe, it is based on a cyber-punk futuristic planet Earth. It is the 2050’s. The world is run by enormous, greedy corporations who will stop at nothing to acquire power. The twist is that a few decades earlier (around our current modern-day) magic returned to our world. With it came elves, dwarves, trolls, ogres, and other magical creatures.Shadowrunners are for-hire mercenaries who will do just about any job as long as there is money to be made. Whether it is stealing secrets from a corporate rival, working as security to protect those secrets, or taking out individuals that stand in their way of power, they are hired by big corporations to do their “dirty work”. They work in the seedy underbelly of this corporate society and live and survive in the shadows.I discovered Shadowrun when I was browsing around Steam looking for something new to play. Dragonfall was pretty highly recommended, and after reading up a bit on it I thought it sounded like something I would enjoy. I started it up and decided to start from the beginning and play through the original campaign. I was immediately sucked in to the story. I just had to keep playing, if for no reason other than to find out how the story turned out!The story for each of the campaigns is probably the best feature of the game. I don’t think I’ve been this captivated by a video game’s story since Final Fantasy VII! Even though there are no video cut scenes and no voice overs, the story is told VERY well.The story is progressed by speaking with various NPCs in the game world. When you speak to them you are given a number of choices as to how you want to respond in the conversation. There are a few places in the game where the dialogue options you choose will change the sequence of events to complete the mission. There isn’t a LOT of these places, but they are there. Also some dialogue options may not be available to you because of certain conditions. For example, if your Strength stat is high you may be able to bully that gang leader into giving you the key you need to progress. But, if you lack strength and are more intelligent, you may have to use brains over brawn to get what you need. There is also a feature called “Etiquette”. The game describes etiquette as “knowing how to behave in various social situations”. In-game this means you will get certain dialogue options based on what etiquette you choose when you create your character. In the example above, if my character has the “Gang” etiquette I may have a dialogue option when talking to the gang leader that will open up different options for completing the mission.Character progression is pretty straight-forward. When you create your character there are a few class archetypes that you can choose from. This gives you a basic set of skills to start from. As you progress you will acquire more skill points that you can spend on any skill you want. If you want to spend your skill points to be a shotgun-wielding mage you can, or if you want to specialize in being an uber “Decker” (Shadowrun’s version of a computer hacker) you can do that too. While skill points come pretty easy, it’s still a good idea to specialize in one or two areas. The campaign isn’t long enough for you to get enough skill points to max out everything.The skills were all pretty well explained right in game. All of your teammates and other Shadowrunners that you can hire all have their own set of skills and abilities. So if you are a shotgun-wielding mage you can hire a teammate that has the hacking skills you need for a mission. I kind of like this system. It lets you build your character however you like and then you can complement your skills with those of the shadowrunners you run with.From the very beginning I felt like the game environment and the atmosphere were very well done. I felt like I was running around in the movie Blade Runner! Everything was futuristic, yet familiar. The characters I interacted with and their portraits definitely captured the cyberpunk feel. Each character you encounter has their own personality and they are very unique. I thought the music was great too, even if there wasn’t a lot of variety. I thought it fit well with the theme of the game.The tactical combat style is what attracted me to the game in the first place. I found the combat to be a lot of fun, and in some places it was VERY challenging. For most missions you have your player character and three other Shadowrunners to make up your team.When you are walking around the map everything is in real time. But, as soon as combat starts, it switches to turn-based tactical mode. Every member of your team has a set number of “Action Points” (AP) that you can spend each turn. Firing your weapon or using a special ability may cost an AP point. Moving to a different location with better cover may cost another. Casting that healing spell or reloading your rifle will cost another. This is where the tactical part comes in. You have to decide what you want each member of your team to do each round. Do you want to focus fire and finish off one enemy at a time, or do you spread out and burn them all down at once? You also have to be careful that you don’t leave yourself pinned down somewhere without enough AP to use that medkit to keep you alive in the fight. Once you spend all your AP for that turn, the computer will play the turn of your enemies. Once they are done it is your turn to spend your AP again. Add in that each weapon type has a different range and friendly-fire can be hazardous to your teammates, it makes combat VERY interesting.The Good, The Bad, and the UglyAs a whole I very much enjoyed Shadworun: Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The story lines for BOTH campaigns are among the best I’ve ever seen in a video game. The first campaign is a BIT slow to start but it’s only so at the beginning. Combat is a lot of fun and can be pretty challenging at times. There were a few missions I had to play through a couple of different times with different strategies before I was victorious.I really enjoyed the skill system as well. It was easy to understand and easy to use. I didn’t feel like I needed to go online and read hundreds of forum posts to learn what the best build for my character would be. I could just pick a couple of skills I wanted to learn that were fun for me and go with it and be successful.The only bad worth mentioning is the length of the campaigns. My total play time on Steam is 48 hours, and that was running all the way through both campaigns. I’m sure I’m a lot slower that a lot of other people. However, considering the inexpensive price of the game and the fact that there is a lot of player generated content on the Steam Workshop, there is a lot of replayability here. Hopefully they will also be releasing more DLC in the future.About the only “ugly” I can say about the game is a couple of buggy missions I encountered. In one mission there was an event that didn’t trigger properly and I was unable to continue because a door would not unlock. I had to replay that mission one or two times before it finally triggered properly and I could advance.Also, some earlier reviews criticized Shadowrun: Returns’ save system. At release you could only save at certain checkpoints. This is no longer the case. I’m not sure if it was with the release of Dragonfall or if it was before that, but they changed the game so you can now save anywhere.See my original review at http://www.mistervertigo.net "

												Simply a-freaking-mazing.Shadowrun Returns is my first venture into this universe, and after a ten hour campaign, I'm completely obsessed. If you are also new, but a little wary about dropping the money for this title, allow me to explain a little about the game...SR is an isometric-style Rpg, set in a future-fantasy universe, where elves and dwarves wield shotguns and cast spells. Starting up the default campaign, Dead Man Switch, you create a character. Race, class and appearance are all up to you. Then, the developer, Harebrained Schemes drops you into a well-written and thoughtfully crafted story, presented in a text-based format - no voice acting here, and I think it's better for it, but that's personal preference. Dialog options are different depending on how you build your character and elicit different responses from NPCs, with charisma allowing you to sweet-talk, and etiquettes let you rub elbows with the many groups that populate Seattle.You play a Shadowrunner, a type of mercenary, doing the dirty-work of multi-billion dollar corporations and aristocrats for cash. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the recent Xcom: Enemy Unknown. If you didn't like that, chances are you won't like this. Every turn, each combatant is given a certain number of moves, from moving to shooting and using items. It's very tactical and you could wind up dead if you don't think before you click. Several jobs you undertake have you bringing other Runners on to watch your back and take a cut of the pay, so you're almost never alone.I found no hick-ups in the gameplay during my play-through. The specials and items are balanced well, meaning death is often the fault of the player's ill preparation. The game is fair, which is about all a gamer could ask for. Also available are game editors, allowing anyone to write their own stories and scenarios for others to enjoy. I haven't been able to try any out because there currently seems to be a bug that causes the ugc to be downloaded to the wrong files, making them difficult to locate.Shadowrun Returns is a gem that I'm glad was funded. It's not for everyone, but if it sounds like it's up your alley, I urge you to pick it up. "

												Shadowrun is easily the best story-driven tactical turn-based adventure-combat game I've played since Fallout 2. The original campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is great, the second (Dragonfall) is fantastic, and the tons and tons of UGC campaigns available are full of gems that easily rival the official publications. I suggest trying out Nightmare Harvest for a great & funny story, and Shadowrun Ultimate for a semi-MMO player-driven ""work-your-way-up"" open world experience.			"

												Lives up to the classic I played years ago. Not as improved as it could be, very dated if your comparing it to open world and procedurally generated. Even look back to Diablo or fallout tatics it is still a bit clunky. I am really hoping for a building assault, muti floor action. Where one of my runners gets knocked out a window but grapples his way back in maybe a floor or two lower. Did you guys play some new XCOM recently? can you imagine a decker across the street in another bulding maybe with a sniper and a squad fighting their way up to be in a cross fire another runner team on another mission. will it be enemy of my enemy or just another target.

												Shadowrun Returns is a fun and relatively simple cyberpunk rpg. The underlying systems have some weaknesses and punish character builds that don't specialize. However, the sense of adventure is great throughout and the game is the perfect length so as to not allow the combat mechanics to overstay their welcome. The editor is too complex for myself and possibly most people who were expecting something on the level of the original Neverwinter Nights, and this means that there won't be many well-made user generated campaigns which is a shame. The Dragonfall DLC campaign is even better than the base game.			"

												Shadowrun Returs is a good game, and the GNU/Linux port is nicely done. If you like the Shadowrun world stuff perhaps you'll find it a bit limited, but in my opinion it's quite accurate. The included editor makes a lot of new homemade material avaliable out there. And, of course, the Dragonfall mission is even better.All perfect for Shadowrun stuff fans and casual gamers, but perhaps not a big deal for hardcore gamers. I must say, I loved it at first sight!

												Shadowrun Returns was a pretty entertaining game, but Dragonfall takes it to another level. There are combat systems out there in the world of turn-based strategy games which are more sophisticated or ""deeper"" than Shadowrun 4.0's ruleset (as implemented here, anyway), but very few, if any, that are written as well as Dragonfall. In keeping with the original game, the combat is designed to be fast and exciting, but streamlined so that it doesn't get in the way of storytelling. Combat also isn't the end-all, be-all of accomplishing goals in Dragonfall. There are plenty of ways to deck or leverage your way out of a situation without entering combat mode, and they are just as satisfying--this isn't Warhammer 40K or Battletech, after all. Rather, it's a table-top RPG campaign that someone digitized, and it's pretty awesome.			"

												This is an OK game at a low price point. There's nothing particularly good about it aside from the art, music, and source material. It doesn't offer a deep RPG experience. Actually, it doesn't offer a shallow RPG experience. It doesn't offer very deep strategy, though it utilizes a simplified version of what you see in the new X-com (which is itself, a very dumbed down version of the Heroclix table-top game system). Hacking, or ""decking"" rather is just a fairly tedious reskin of the vanilla combat. There are almost no choices to make so the whole thing plays out like a point and click adventure sans puzzles. When the game came out a lot of the defenders shouted about the great user generated content that would come out. I've yet to see it. The engine itself is too limited to really facilitate much better. I know it seems like I'm ragging on it pretty hard but despite all this I can't say that I disliked my time with it... just don't prepare yourself for much. With the right mindset it's a pretty fun one-off adventure.			"

It's not trying to be pretty or sell to console gamers. It's isometric, turn based, point-buy item-buy and whatnot, without having to fight with 20 year old Windows installers.Hoping for more DLC stories!			"

The script is well-crafted, and the story unfolds in a somewhat liner but enjoyable way. The combat is a genuinely fun, turn based system akin to a D&D system, but with rules based on the Shadowlands tabletop game. It is worth the $15 dollars charged for it. I generally don't like indie games, but a few have stood out to me, Bastion is one of them, Brothers Tale of Two Sons, and Shadowrun has definately entered this elite group for me.			"

												Picked this up on offer this Bank Holiday weekend and have really enjoyed it. I have yet to explore the additional content (which looks really good) so this refers only to the main campaign 'Dead Man's Switch'. I enjoyed the Shadowrun universe, the characters were almost consistently interesting, the dialogue options fun and there was enough variety on offer to warrant two or three play-throughs (well, almost three, more on that later). In fact, this game has inspired me to learn more about Shadowrun - a marketing success, for sure!Character creation allows for a lot of customisation, either from one of the standard templates or free-form (the latter allows some creative combinations once you've got the hang of the gameplay mechancis). While there is a lot of replayability in character classes (you'll have a different experience as an Adept than as a Decker, for instance) it struck me that my playthrough as a decker (who can hack into the 'Matrix' and fight additional combat scenarios within computer programmes) allowed greater access to content and secrets. A shame as I did feel the game was sort of pushing me to play as a decker, and while this is an interesting and challenging character class, it limits your access to combat and magic specialisations.My main criticisms are that even a year after release I kept encountering bugs - including a major game-breaking bug that meant I could not finish a level. In short, it simply would not end combat or allow me to initiate dialogue at one point, even when the combat was over and dialogue bubbles were above people's heads. This was a pain and recurred again even after a level restart. Other criticisms were niggling and broke the immersion rather than the game - playing as a troll, for instance, didn't change dialogue options to a playthrough as a human or as an elf - which was a shame (bar one person calling me a racist name) and I'd loved to have used the in-game mechanic of building your own gang to go on more than just main plot missions. A couple of side missions could have helped me diversify my character build, get some better equipment and feel more prepared to take on the end of game boss on the hardest difficulty.The game itself is focused on a single short story (took me about 8 hours the first time, 5-6 after that) which felt more like an introduction to the universe than a standalone game, which is an odd design decision, but it did mean I finished the game eager for more - rather than with a 'more traditional rpg' like Baldur's Gate where I tend to get fed up well before the finale. While this focus meant a satisfying resolution to the compelling storyline, it also meant there were no side missions, no additional content and limited opportunities for exploration. While additional content looks to rectify this, most involve creating new characters, so those I created for Dead Man's Switch won't be coming with me.tl;dr - Great, immersive, colourful and engaging game that I'd rate 3.5-4/5. This score would be higher if the game was longer, featured greater variety outside combat, had opportunities for exploration and a few more side missions and didn't have game breaking bugs this long after release!

												""Great game, great story, huge potential - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED""Awesome story, well written, almost like a graphic novel. Took me all the way to the end, for someone who had little patience for this type of strategy games this one really got me to follow through.Graphic isn't not at next gen level, but a well designed strategy game does not need to be as detailed as say the new XCOM.The mechanics of this game DOES felt like XCOM to me however, so you liked the new XCOM you will like this game! In my opinion XCOM in comparison felt a lot more like fights after fights and not enough story components.The game comes with its own level editor which gives the player community the power to build new stories and campaigns.This game can also be played on a MAC, but imho the game experience was better on the PC.

												This was one of those games that was incredibly fun to play and it was worth every penny, but you also saw how much more there could be simply due to how well everything else worked. Simply more of exactly what you saw to allow deeper progressions, more missions, more.... You saw incredible buildings that were never used, etc... I highly recommend the game, certainly. Buy it. I just like it enough, and the pieces all seem to be there, to know that time may have prevented this from being completely fleshed out. I await more!!!			"

												Bloody awesome RPG and a bloody awesome RPG. I don't regret spending a single cent on it. Basically it's a bit like a cross between Blade Runner and Lord of the Rings. You play a Shadowrunner, a bounty hunter who does difficult and risky jobs in a near-future world where magic has returned to the Earth, cyber-augmentation is very real, and meta-humans like elves and orks walk among us. Truly cool in every aspect, no?			"

												I am enjoying this game very much. It has a great story, and well crafted mechanics.  More than anything it feels like a series of old-school rpg sessions with minitures. My one comment is that it is at heart (IMHO) a tablet game. I am constantly aware of how much more I want the game to do and be.  That doesn't detract from what it is.   And it gives me high hopes for what the company is working on now.  If you like the genre and want to play an rpg on a tablet, it is a great game!  Otherwise, quirky fun and a good diversion for several hours.			"

												Almost a perfect title.First off, the focus on the editor and the ""module"" approach to the campaign made me think of neverwinter nights (the first one). The fact that the game focused on being highly expandable and customizable made me more forgiving of the campaign's shortcomings.That being said, the game's pretty good, but still lacking. Some of it in terms of interface, some in terms of design (gameplay). Please note, I played on normal difficulty. The storyline is quaint, the visuals are detailed, and flow overall is smooth and enjoyable.1) With all the awesome artwork, the protagonist visuals were extremely boring, whatever look I had in mind for my hero was nowhere to be found in the portrait collection. I just gave up in the end and went with a whatever-approach.2) The chapter oriented campaign moves the story along nicely, but the linearity(sp?) of the game was disappointing, if you didn't manage your resources well, it's gone. This includes karma (xp).3) Moving around when there's no (immediate) combat in combat mode is a chore.4) Too many illusionary dialogue choices. Great, but acknowledging it was also an acknowledgement of it's extremely linear gameplay design (like combat, progression, resource allocation and game balance).Ultimately, I think if they fixed a few things, this title would have a been a true A+, and fans would be clamoring for a sequel like crazy. Unfortunately, in it's current state, it's a great experiment to the throwback that is the shadowrun RPG, but that's all.Maybe some mods would've helped, but the online presence for the game wasn't really there like other games neither. Hopefully they'll come out with some improvements in due time, if not a sequel.			"

												Well, where do I begin? I'll start by saying the developers really did the Shadowrun name a lot of justice with this release. Basically a party-based tactical RPG set in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. It really nails that futuristic, dystopian vibe I look for in this type of story. The gameplay is very enjoyable and you'll have a lot of fun leveling up your character in the main campaign. The options for character development and customization are pretty solid.My only complaint is - the main campaign is too short. Sure, you can get Dragonfall (the expansion) for another $15, and that is much bigger than the original campaign... but the stock capaign just sort of disappointed me. I also felt like it was a bit too linear. I was expecting a LOT more side-missions and stuff like that to help me develop my character before the endgame. I wouldn't let that deter you from buying the game, but I would set aside a little extra money for that expansion - first.Some would argue that the Workshop has player-made campaigns in case you get bored with the one that comes with the game, but I find it tedious sifting through mountains of crap to find a decent player-made campaign. Most of them suffer from the ""Oh here's part 1....part 2.... part 3... And you have to download them all seperately.. oh but im not done with part 4, and I quit working on it cause I got bored.."" It's just annoying. Same thing as most any game that comes with a toolkit... most of the player developed content is half-arsed.Anyway, I don't want the review to sound too negative because I actually did really enjoy the 20+ hours I've spent with Shadowrun Returns, and I'd recommend it to my friends - As long as they can afford to buy Dragonfall with it.

Everything I was ambivalent about with DMS was rectified and improved.If you were on the fence after playing DMS then rest assured, Dragonfall is awesome and blows DMS out of the water. This is more than just game mechanics and tweaks. The story telling is better, conversation options are vastly improved, missions are more varied, NPCs are more than just mission givers and your squad mates have personality and history to uncover as you get closer to them.In short I love this game and can't wait for future releases.

												If you're into the shadowrun universe and played the tabletop/SNES game then you'll mostly enjoy this. It's good, but like the SNES game it's different than the tabletop, which is to be expected since they're different mediums of entertainment. The mechanics are mostly solid, but your experience can be largely determend by which build you decide to start with. If you choose shaman your going to feel useless as all hell; largely the same with decker. They try to make those too more rewarding by giving special dialogue options based on charisma, biotech knolwedge, and intellect, but they're few and far between with combat being the larger focus. Speaking of combat, it's almost as brutal as it is in the tabletop's, but only for enemies. You'll find that you and your teamates are super beefy. I played a mage and with decent positioning and my heal spell I largely never dipped below half HP with crappy body and strength. So, in that sense it's a bit easy. However, it tries to compensate for this by screwing with your dice on hit chances. I can't conferm this, but the only decernable differences between the difficulty settings seemed to be the HP of enemies, how much damage they dealt, and how much the game blatantly lies to you about hit chance. I'm not kidding, I've had people standing point blank with a shotgun miss three 95% chance to hits more than once. I might just be paranoid, it might just be bad programming, but that sort of thing defeintly seems to happen more than it should on the harder difficulties. Anyway, the story is pretty ""pink mohawk"" as is to be expected from a Shadowrun game, but the writing and character dialogue is actually fairly above average. Despite it's downsides and such it's still pretty good. Everything about the combat other than what I mentioned is either fine or good, and there are a lot of other dialogue options and some cool things you can do out of combat to make your life easier. There's also a fair bit of level exploration, and it functions a bit like an isometric point and click adventure game when you're not bashing skulls.Yeah, that's about it.			"

												Stephenson meets Tolkien in the world of Shadowrun, and it works surprisingly well. I wasn't massively familiar with the PnP RPG roots of Shadowrun before I bought the game, but having completed the Dead Man's Switch campaign, I'd definitely like to know a lot more about it. Cyberpunk dwarves and elves might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you can buy into the principle, there's a lot of depth to be found in the game lore and the mechanics of the game. The character classes are distinct enough to make the game replayable (though making sure you have three levels put into Rifle is pretty much compulsory if you want to get the best out of the combat) and the setting is well realised and nicely polished. One thing it's not is a cyberpunk Baldur's Gate, as the story does run on rails (and is easily dispensed with in around 10-12 hours), so there's no sense that you can just make your way in the world on your own and just discover what there is out there, but that said, the characters are nicely written (I especially like Coyote, Cherry Bomb, Harlequin and Dresden) and easy to invest emotionally in. Definitely worth picking up if you fancy a little old school isometric RPG action, and the mod scene should keep the game fresh for a long time to come.			"

												Shadowrun Returns (7/10)Just played through the main campaign (Dead man's Switch). Never got into the whole P&P shadowrun thing before, but snapped this and the DLC up during the Steam summer sale, and have to say overall I'm rather impressed, albeit I wasn't expecting much. Although it heavily treads the usual Cyberpunk tropes, the mix of races adds something to matters and although I generally relied on hacking and hardware to push through the storyline the magical aspects enhanced the experience to some degree. Play wise it's not long. I took a fancy to playing it yesterday early afternoon and wrapped it up earlier this morning, with a good nights sleep in between (10 hours tops by my reckoning). My main criticism of the principal campaign would really be the near linearity of it. You're basically pushed from pillar to post with very little in the way of deviation or side quests and that pacing felt off given in large part that the beginning of the campaign is an investigation. I wanted to be able to explore Seattle, but the opportunity never really arises versus being pulled by the main narrative.The game also suffers a bit when it comes to equipment. The upgrade path essentially consists of buying a better X versus any degree of customization and although there are various chem tonics you can take to temporarily boost a characters abilities I never felt the need to sacrifice an equipment slot for one, versus using it to carry a med pack instead. The combat is very much in the mould of X-Com, but for reasons unexplained even when all the enemies in a level have been defeated you're often seemingly forced to continue to use the point system to get around, which can get rather tedious at times, though thankfully the levels aren't generally too sprawling. In large part I didn't find the combat too troubling on normal, though towards the end the enemy difficulty does ramp up (a resultant of the narrative) and a bit more thought is required in order to effectively combat some of the threats. Where the game shines most is in the writing, which manages to give you some flexibility in terms of how you 'play' your character tonally. Although I suspect your choices likely don't have any impact in terms of options, it's nice to have that flexibility.			"

												After much debate, well, not really, but I did wait a decent amount of time to play this title:  Shadow Run – Returns (http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/), I gave it shot.  It’s about 15 hours’ worth of content and there doesn’t appear to be much in the way of quality DLC atm.   From a cost perspective, a dollar per hour of game play with a great story is money well spent.  It has a Fall Out 1 feel as it is turn-based, there are walls of text to read, and you can be a troll hacker that is more charismatic than an ancient vampire, with a data jack in his head.  In short, if you want a game that doesn’t demand too much of your PC or your time, and gives you a decent story to fall in love with, this game is for you.			"

Your mind-hole will implode at the sight of the glorious deaths of those who oppose you. Your life will be consumed after hours and hours of play, both content that was player-made and published by the creators. You will enjoy the many nods to the books from over the years, and the massive content and replayability of this game. You buy this game and it is really worth the dollars spent on it. The game lets you step into the role of any type of player you want, whether you use the premade ""bases"" for a character, or just make your very own, and put a twist to the classic role of a shaman, street Samurai, or Decker. You can approach situations through many different ways. You will enjoy this game.			"

												Cyberpunk is a genre as much built on the atmosphere as it is on the technology. Everyone has that formative memory of the giant advertisements and smog-belching smokestacks in Blade Runner, Some games make the mistake of keeping the slums out of the cyberpunk, but Shadowrun Returns has the formula down just right: ""high tech, low life."" The game is a fun return to an earlier era for me, given my experience with the tabletop game - but the experience is fluid and accurate, reminding me of so many times spent around a table being suspicious about your Fixer or the latest contact you made.The gameplay can be somewhat halting and awkward at times - a concession to make in order to accommodate the system itself, of course - but it doesn't diminish the enjoyment of this authentic cyberpunk game. Combat is strategic, if somewhat sparse on detail, and emphasises the differences in roles within the party itself. The decking is sadly quite anaemic compared to the tabletop world, a blue-gridlines re-creation of the combat systems, with Agents standing in for Spirits, and spells replaced with Decker attacks. Nonetheless, it rounds out the flavour of the game well.If you're looking for an engaging Cyberpunk story, with a dash of magic and plenty of political intrigue and conspiracy, I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns.

												It's been a while since I last played a classic, turn-based RPG - and when I say a while, I mean the likes of Forgotten Isles. So picking up this game was quite refreshing for me since most titles nowadays are all high energy ball-busting action. It would also be right to say that I don't have past references to any other Shadowrun titles, so my impressions here are purely stand-alone.Putting it simply - I'm quite impressed. Let me get to some of the simple points that make this title a gem:Writing: The narrative is well written albeit some ""street"" language that sometimes sticks out badly. The sights and sounds (as though these were not enough) of apocalyptic Seattle is well supported by transition build ups and some witty dialogue.Role-playing Mechanics: The game mechanics builds its own simple character customization. You only really get to build your main protagonist via a simple characteristics points system. You simply have to progress through the story to earn your points and design a character from a set number of characteristics. The game builds on several archetypes but does not restrict a player into any cookie-cutter format. (Check out the Nephilim Network to get some quirky combination inspirations.)Setting: Explore an apocalyptic Seattle teeming with classic RPG lore races, armed to the teeth with Guns, Cybernetics and Magic. Timelessness is often a great appeal to any story, and this title just has the right mix.Art and Music: While being somewhat leaning towards cartoon-like, the world of Shadowrun Returns is beautifully crafted. The city sprawls are rich in detail. On the one hand you will be running around streets blaring with neon signs and shop fronts. But on another, you get to traverse dark alleys, dimly lit halls of medical facilities and cult complexes to uncover the mystery that drives the campaign. This is supported by pulses of techno music transitioning into eerie fantasy sequences. Of course the game is not without its faults. While dialogue and the story telling are well written, character focus seems to be lacking since most often than not you will be running around the sprawl with game-generated Shadow Runners. True, there are some key NPCs that you get to interact with but the times can be very short and too far in between for such a short campaign. Inventory system may need a bit of a re-work but nothing too major to murder the experience. I've read some concerns about saving games but I've hardly found it an issue - so maybe they have fixed this one already. My only suggestion really right now is you might want to try starting a game at a much higher difficulty level. I'm currently running with a Decker at the moment in Normal setting, and it seems like a cake walk - what more if you go for the more heavy hitting classes? By no means is the game perfect - it has a few rough edges but it definitely delivers the merchandise well. If you feel like slowing down a bit, go out of the usual, this read & click title might do the thing for you.			"

												If you liked the table top game, or any table top game... then buy this game.  The graphics are...ok... the gameplay is good... but the story is fantastic.  It felt simultaneously home grown and professionally constructed. I felt like I was at a table game, participating in one of the mostl finely constructed stories I had ever played.  It starts small, with a seemingly inocuous event and ends huge.  The story is a work of art.  And speaking of works of art...  The mod tool is one as well.  Included is a single tool with which to build your own stories. It's powerful, easy (enough) to use, the tutorial videos are great, and it includes tons of assets. All in all it's really smart.  Which is going to be my final review for this game.  Shadow Run: Returns... Smart.			"

												Okay I started playing at 8 pm and stopped at 3 am playing it without pause. Not because i wanted to, but because I am so tired right now. This game is in one word: awesome! If you played the pen and paper rpg you will recognize that the rulesystem is quite different to it. Its more dumbed down. But this is not bad. Actually its a question of gamedesign. And works quite good. This game lacks so many things. No voice acting no thrilling graphic style (all graphics are handdrawn). But this game has one thing i have missed in so many games the last couple of months. The just another mission effect. I couldn't stop playing.The story is great. The writting is compelling (and there is a lot of text since there is no voice acting what so ever). It inherits the spirit of the first 2 Shadowrun rulesets. Version 1 and 2 maybe 3 with all its coolness and glory. If you ever liked the old Shadowrun, buy this masterpiece.			"

												This game is absolutely great from top to bottom. The main game is a well written and well paced piece of murder mystery cyberpunk action, made with great writing and interesting characters. The writing is so good, in fact, that even characters that show up just once or twice feel really memorable. The graphic style and musical design are top notch and really help make the experience into a cohesive whole. The gameplay is a solid tactical RPG experience that's fun to play, if a bit on the easy side more often than not. The few downsides to the game start with the lack of manual saving. The game automatically saves at checkpoints (probably to prevent save scumming like some other tactical games) which can sometimes be frustrating. The locked angle camera usually is okay, but there are times where it's a problem. Some people will call a 12 hour, very linear main campaign a problem too, but I personally think that it's better to have 12 high-quality hours than 20-25 with lots of filler. So it's not perfect, but it's damned well done. And the inclusion of an editor means that in the end we'll hopefully see a lot more great content from the community.			"

												I marathoned this game. It is fantastic. It reminds me of Infinity Engine games like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, only the combat is much easier to wrap your head around. The setting is cyberpunk (William Gibson and Neal Stephenson specifically) mixxed with high fantasy. The module that is included in the game is a fun story, but don't be surprised if you call out plot points well before they happen. I've only played through it once, but my class choice (decker) seemed pretty useless in most situations. I am hoping Harebrained Scheme puts out a few more modules of their own.There is a module creator and it looks like the community has put out quite a bit of content on their own. I'm looking forward to sinking a few hours investigating that over the weekend.			"

												While I like this game a lot, others may not, depending on what they're expecting.If you are expecting any edition of the tabletop role-playing game, or the Genesis or SNES console games, you will be disappointed.  Shadowrun: Returns plays something like a simplified version of tabletop rules that never actually existed.I liked the plot, combat, and music.Opinions on the plot vary widely.  If you have an aversion to reading, this game is not for you.  Almost all of the plot is delivered via screens of text upon entering an area, or text dialogs.  There is no voiceover.  Some people complain of purple prose, or that it seems to have been written by someone that is immature, but the writing is superior to that in most video games, including most other RPGs.  I personally do not perceive any of these problems, and have never seen examples cited.Screenshots do not do the combat system justice.  Some of the interface is only displayed when it is relevant.  For example, the action point cost of movement, and the effectiveness of cover, only appear when you prepare to move, and when cover exists in the area you mouseover.  The combat system is relatively simple (which is reflected in the user interface), but like Chess, can be quite difficult.  The difficulty is selectable at character creation, so if you find the game too easy or hard you can adjust it.  Since almost all RPGs are combat-heavy, it's important that it not be mindless and repetitive.The music is hard to describe.  It is not ambient.  You will notice it.  I especially like the theme on the title screen.I didn't like some things about Shadowrun: Returns.It is very linear, and most decisions will not affect the ending.The gameplay in the matrix is very similar to meatspace.  It's not so much that the gameplay in the matrix is bad as it doesn't feel different enough.The game only saves on area transition.  If you have to stop playing, or die, unexpectedly, you can lose quite a bit of progress.			"

												If you're new to Shadowrun, like me, and not sure whether it's worth buying, the questions is: do you like detective fiction? Because that's exactly what SR is. That means you have to read a lot.Another thing to consider is visual simplicity. Shadowrun Returns looks good, but don't expect much on that side. It won't show you stunning cutscenes or SFX. It'll describe all that in a text box instead. Yeah, just like in 90's.So if these things don't scare you, give it a try and maybe in half an hour or so you'll be completely immersed.			"

												Shadowrun has always been a great universe. It is a real shame that it doesn't get as much attention as tradition D&D universe. So this game is much needed break from you're typical RPG. The storyline in the main campaign is pretty good but not super orginal or great. It  did kept my attention enough that I played it for over 8 on the first day I got it. It has some flaws though that may take away from the enjoy of the game. First it is a very linear game, you don't get much chance to roam around. Even more sad then that is you never really use some the advanced skills like Decking at all really. The second issue is it lack of a save anywhere feature. Even though I played the whole in nearly one sitting it was a difficult to play it through only  been able to set checkpoints. This limits the replay value because most of us, myself included normally cannot play a game without being dragged back into the real world at random times. Doing some parts of the game more then once because of fairly spaced out checkpoints wasn't so bad. It did however give the game a limited time to play or to replay without having a large amount to play it. The promise of new updates on the way and the steam workshop makeup for some of the flaws so I would recemmmend this for any RPG fan looking for a new take on the typical RPG.			"

												A pleasant surprise. I picked up Shadowrun Returns a few years ago,  just coming off an XCOM-high and jumped the instant I heard ""XCOM-style combat"". Found plenty to stay for. The neat, if linear, story, highly customizable playstyles, and some very unique character designs/portraits.I do have a few gripes, one of which is the inability to rotate the camera, which made combat a bit of a hassel. This is understandable, though, given the hand-drawn backgrounds. Other wise, not bad. Get it cheap, finish it in a afternoon.			"

												Awesome game, and Dragonfall corrects most of the problems that the base game had. Dead Man's Switch campaign was a little flat, and lacked much in the way of 'side quests' or choices on how to make the story (and thus, your character's story) develop. Dragonfall offers the option to have a 'good' guy or a 'bad guy' type character, depending on the mission options you take and the manner in which you solve the missions.Dragonfall also fixes a few mechanical shortflls in the base game, including adding in a 'save anywhere' option. It does seem that the game lags a bit more after Dragonfall is installed, but I would imagine that there will be fixes forthcoming for this issue. Harebrained Schemes has really nailed it with Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall.Can't wait for the next installment!			"

												A ""Must Have"" Indie game; arguably the best cyberpunk videogame of the decade.    Shadowrun Returns & Dragonfall are excellent tributes to William Gibson's Sprawl.  Reminiscent of timeless classics such as Deus Ex, and Planescape: Torment.Included is a powerful game editor that we fans use to modify, edit and even create entirely separate cyberpunk stories of our own.  The Workshop is full of potential and already has an active community, many of which are avid readers and writers devoted to tell their story.Shadowrun Returns is an ambitious project funded through Kickstarter and HBS has delivered.  The atmosphere, writing, and music are extremely high artistic quality, and shows fans that HBS has ""The Heart,"" and talent to make immersive campaigns and anthologies.Buy Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall now!

												For years now I've considered old-school isometric genres to be 'my' genre. That is to say, the one that strictly caters to my sensibilities as a player. I discovered them well after their golden age, and since this wave of kickstarted CRPGs began I've been eagerly awaiting their results.As the first one out of the gate from this batch, Shadowrun Returns does not disappoint. If you're like me and you've been aching for a deep and immersive roleplaying experience and actual agency when it comes to solving problems, this game is a steal at $20. Excellent writing, beautiful environments, and a fantastic soundtrack all tied together with engaging combat and character progression.The campaign will take you about 15 hours to run through, and there's sadly little in the way of extended diversions, and the game is rather linear in how it progresses. There's not much of a sense of an 'open world' that one would expect from this genre, but even still the world itself is one of the most well-realized and vibrant ones I've seen in a long time.They've got another campaign on the way, and you're going to see plenty of gameplay content coming out of the steam workshop, so I can guarantee you'll have your money's worth in actual meaty game.If you like RPGs at all you owe it to yourself to grab this game and play through it.

												Finished Shadowrun returns last Monday.From my blog: http://www.dyle.org/blog/?p=233Played fully on Linux with Steam (native, no Windows Emulation).You play a character in the Shadowrun universe which is on the hunt to bring down a friend’s murderer. Time is around 2057 but due to the Awakening, the world is filled with science fiction high tech and fantasy elements alike. You have genetic modification, cyberplants and hacking warfare along with elves, orcs, dwarfes and trolls hurling magic bolts. A rich and fascinating universe.… you have to work trough yourself. The game can be summed up by the phrase “too less”. At first there is too less background for the setting, the story. You just start off creating a character, like an orc, with cybernetic implants. Yep, no explanation to this. If you want to find out more about the Shadowrun world you have to look elsewhere but not the game.Then there is too less RPG. Seldom you find something useful to pick up and equip. Also stats and skills are presented in a very sober way in a plain matrix. No introduction, no nothing. All at once, on page. Also you likely will spend points on attributes and skills you don’t need in future. Sorry, there is no turning back.Then there is too less adventure. The story is nice, but you got not real decisions to make. The storyline is very linear. There are some side-quests, but guess: too less.Then there is too less of a challenge. At the first two thirds of the game. I pimped my elf with quickness and assault rifles and the game was no real match at “normal” level. Strategic fighting is nice and … easy. Yeah, the games picks up some pace in the last third and starts to get harder. This is were the fun really sets in. But up to then it is playing a nice story …And someone always has the idea of something missing. Something’s missing at the RPG, at the adventure, at the combat game, at the grafics, animations.E.g. Harlequin is one of the coolest elves I’ve come along in playing games, but when he wields his sword he is animated as if someone had stiffed a broomstick right along his “back”. The in-game representation is missing the charisma and style this elf has in dialogues.Finally the save game mechanics are just bonkers. Actually you just can save at the start of a level, better: the game (hopefully) autosaves at this stage. Making a wrong decision at the end of a level requires to replay to whole level again.The pro: once you’ve delved into the universe the plot is great to play and the dialogs are really nice written, the combat is fun after all. It remains a nice game. Hopefully they fix this bad savegame mechanics and give more universe background information in the DLCs and patches to come.			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ Various builds that change how you play+ Rewarding, challenging combat+ Clever puzzles+ Bug-free+ The game ends on exactly the right noteCons:- Game is a bit short; campaign lasts roughly 20 hours if you do everything- Relatively low replay value- Straightforward campaign; for the most part, you stay on a single track through the main campaign, with only a couple chances for sidequests- Charisma/Etiquettes*- Specializing is required.  Jack of All Trades type characters don't do well.Overall: Shadowrun Returns is fun.  You get to hire a crew and go do odd jobs as a mercenary in a futuristic dystopia.  The tone and music fits, the game gives you just enough money to get by and forces you to spend wisely, and the storyline is fast paced and fun.  The game is short, and there's not many chances for optional sidequests, but in spite of that the overall experience is still great.  If you're a fan of tactical isometric roleplaying games, this is a solid choice.Bottom Line: A wild ride from start to finish, with fun characters, rewarding combat, and enjoyable gameplay.  A little short and straightforward, but well done in spite of this.  Worth the price.* The charisma system in game works by giving you various ""etiquettes"" which will open up conversation options if you know them.  Some etiquettes are extremely useful, others are entirely pointless.  Consult a guide when choosing which etiquettes to learn.			"

												I really enjoyed the game.  The goods:  Excellent combat sequences, neat class/race selections, incredible scenes, interesting story (very bladerunner-esk).  The bads:  it was too story/rpg heavy and there wasn't any free play/roam ability.  If this were a fifty dollar game I wouldn't buy it but for 15 bucks its well worth it.			"

												Excellent RPG with a griping story. I'm not going to post spoilers but the storyline is nice. The gaming system makes me wish the game runs on forever. The turn-based combat is exactly what I like, combined with the nearly limitless combination of magic and technolgies, it is ubercool...A few things to improve on though. One is to make the game screen rotatable so that the hidden corners can be seen. Secondly, it will be great if we can train up more than one character for the story, molding two or more characters to our liking instead of just hiring mercenaries to fill up the party with the main character.

												A cool RPG looking back to the good old days of legendary isometric games like Fallout 1 & 2 - but Shadowrun Returns suffer from modern stupification in aspects of linearity and complexity. Another game that would go from 7/10 to 9/10 by dropping all the mobile device/console porting crap and instead focusing on making a solid complex game for players that use a keyboard and mouse input... The interface is quite clunky but does it's job kind of ok, but simple things like the lack of a proper inventory management on quests and weird vendor buy/sell dialogue makes me MAD!The main story module ""Dead mans switch"" is extremely linear and side quests are few. As an RPG heavily focused on combat it still has a solid story and memorable characters, all dialogue being text based makes for a huge variety in dialogue options that is sadly not always used to create a more complex story. Things like the stat based etiquette system works nicely but could really be more developed and used often. The artwork is beautiful with a hand drawn style and there are lots and lots of small details everywhere.Best thing in the game is the epic awesome soundtrack - easily one of the very best in the gaming world and on the same high level as HL2 + episodes OST. From dark ambient synthetic themes to adrenaline pumping beats with grinding guitars when in combat to blip-blop digital jazz when hacking into the Matrix it is for me the main component for immerion in this game. The track ""Double Cross"" is freakkin awesome!The game has a heavy focus on combat but it does IMO not match up to the tactical sandbox complexity in Fallout Tactics, despite things like magic, cyberware and a broad array of special attacks. Combat still is good and fun, sometimes very challenging on higher difficulty, and it is refreshing with a return to turn based combat that rewards planning ahead and managing your APs instead of just button-mashing QTE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Highly recommended, if you get the deluxe version with the OST ;)			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an adaptation of the classic cyberpunk tabletop pen and paper RPG. Set in an alternative history future where magic has returned to the world, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orks live side by side with humans in dense urban cities, and corporations are a law unto themselves; the game centers around the segment of humanity who makes their living in the shadows, the runners. Hacker, mercenary, detective, sorcerer, where there is a job that needs doing, there will be someone willing to get paid to do it.The game itself is a single player, turn-based strategy RPG, utilizing 3/4 isometric perspective with 3D character models set against sprite based backgrounds. The sprite backgrounds are static and well done, while the character designs are somewhat poorly textured with resolution below that which the majority of modern systems could easily handle; belying the limited budget the company had to work with. Gameplay takes the form of point and click interaction with the world map and carries over directly into combat, utilizing the same environments. Combat is somewhat klunky, as there are problems with the interaction of the courser and corners of the movement field.The game itself is, however, merely a platform. It is in reality intended for players to build and share their own Shadowrun campaigns, and the full game editor comes included with the base game as well as a professionally developed campaign. Thanks to Steam Works, player campaigns are free, though professionally developed campaigns will be sold as DLC as they become available. Sadly there is no multiplayer option what-so-ever, crippling one of the intregral elements of the pen-and-paper game.Overall, the game's campaign will run you around 12 hours, and is a good buy if you can get it on sale, for any enthusiast of turn-based strategy RPGs.

												I absolutely love this game. Although it lacks in the free roaming aspect that many RPG’s do well in the story is extremely immersive and the characters are interesting and at times frustrating. The old-school isometric view lends itself well to Shadowrun and the lighting when in urban areas sets a great tone for the dark cyber punk world the game is set in.  The character creation isn’t quite deep enough in regards to ascetics but more than makes up for this in the skill tree and I found myself fiddling with the skills for ages whilst envisioning what kind of cyber punk badass I was going to be. The combat is turn based which I found very refreshing, as I am a massive fan of turn based strategy games, and I found the whole process of finding cover and blasting the enemy very entertaining. To sum up if you’re not a fan of deep story driven games with lots of text and long spells between the action then this game isn’t for you, although I would recommend anyone to embark on this story……you won’t be sorry.

												A great game, lovingly recreated to resemble the old super nintendo game I used to love.  The turn based gameplay works really well and the karma system for levelling up gives limited scope so decisions must be made carefully, rather than having a fully levelled up character before too long.  Dead Mans Switch felt linear and the responses felt as though they didn't really change the game outcome much, however the expansion, Dragonfall, addresses many issues including the ability to save anywhere.  Dragonfall is a much more honed Shadowrun campaign in my opinion and deserves an applause for the production team who clearly thought hard about the game story and characters.  A triumph.			"

												Overall, I would give this game a 9/10. Everything is fantastic, and I cannot wait to play Dragonfall someday and also play player-created campaigns. I am also inspired to pick up the paper and pen version of Shadowrun, as well as Shadowrun Online. It's just that Dead Man's Switch became quite disappointing. Just take it out, or give the players more freedom, and everything here would be stellar.*****Now for ***SPOILERS*** Kind of.*****I have not played Dragonfall, so this review is of the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch. I really enjoy pretty much every aspect of this game--the environment, combat, characters, atmosphere, etc.--except for the main story. Despite getting very interested in the storyline after the first few lines were presented to me, almost all of my excitement was lost when the Ripper was revealed. I was having fun treating DMS as a murder mystery; I was carefully examining everything and trying to figure out who the Ripper could be--I even had some evidence to support who I thought could be the Ripper--but the game pretty much points a huge sign at the real suspect from the moment they are introduced, and this is overwhelmingly disappointing. The other side of the story after the reveal doesn't even make much sense.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy rpg which functions similar to the X-Com or UFO series games, set in the Shadowrun universe. Pros: *Nice Artstyle*Simple yet effective combat and skill system, allows you to more or less build your ""class"" by picking which stats and skills you want to learn.*Lands the Shadowrun Universe pretty wellCons:*Very short playthrough (core game, not the Shadowrun: Dragonfall expansion)*This game is very easy on ""normal"". I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.Overall: 7/10Fun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.I would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.			"

Running into combat like a berserker was quite satisfying too, but  most of the time I would end up taking a lot of damage.  It was a little annoying not being able to get all the little secrets that require decking skills, but I managed just fine without the extra stuff.Pro:  Lots of community contentLots of class/race options and tons of ways to build a character, and lots of spells/skillsWell-executed turn-based combat with a cover system akin to X-COMGreat story that pulls you into the world of Shadowrun (very text-heavy, enjoyable for those who like to read)Con:The RNG seems off sometimes (e.g. a 90% chance to hit might fail three times in a row)The story is very linear, and there isn't a new-game+ option "

												Shadowrun returns was a kickstarter project that gained traction rather fast, although like most kickstarters this was due to nostalgia. This game stands on its own extremely well.Shadowrun returns is a cyberpunk fantasy tactical rpg, which in retrospective sounds absurd but its an idea that works really well and is amplified by the impressive dungeons and dragons art style.Typical for an RPG you level up with points gained from battles but what you put your points into in this case either help you or hinder you.Upgrades are apart of the experience and have a tradeoff mechanic, sacrificing one thing to gain something else, but comes into play later in the game.During my time with the game the battles were more interesting than the story and in an rpg story should be just as important as the rest of the game.The game stands on its own legs and is a good experience for someone who enjoys strategic rpg games and/or cyberpunk settingsRating: 8.5/10			"

												A tale of two halves.The first half is a basic-yet-intriguing cyberpunk XCOM-lite game. The second is a tedious, monotonous, dragged-out affair that completely spoils everything and made me very glad it was only $2.50 when I picked it up.PROS-Crisp art style that lends itself fairly well to the setting-Some interesting characters (kind of)-The music is decent the first time around-Neat outfits-It's less than ten hours....CONS-Environments/levels are 99% static and lifeless-The dialogue/script is wildly inconsistent in terms of style, going from grandiose to vernacular at will. It's like two or three different guys were writing without consulting the design document. Then at the end they were just like ""♥♥♥♥ it, too hard to redo all this work""-After a couple hours, the music grates-Combat is far too simple to be enjoyable for long-Lack of cool loot/drops-Exceedingly linear-Most characters are neat at first but then it becomes obvious there's no depth-The narrative takes a wild shift in the second half, and it's not for the betterment of the game-The second half is only more difficult because gobs of enemies are thrown at you, rather than anything clever or original-Puzzles can all be solved by holding down Alt to see what few things are interactive-Terrible ending that made me uninstall immediately after closing the game-Along with the tonal shifts, most of the scant humor isn't funny, and the cyberpunk/Shadowrun terms were used in a tryharding manner rather than making sense or adding atmosphere-Lots of typos and generally-lazy writing-Decking is uselessly dullOverall it's a game that starts out strong and finishes way after boredom sets in. The combat is stale with little-to-no tactical depth, and level design is so narrow-sighted and basic that I can't help but think these guys are out of their league. And this is from someone who views cyberpunk as the best genre in all of media.			"

												Like every game, this isn't for everyone. The default campaign is short (took me slightly north of 10 hours without skipping sidequests), it has a check point system instead of save anywhere (getting changed in Berlin DLC, unsure if being ptached in to cover default game too), lack of lootable corpses, and no voice acting. If none of that bothers you, it's worth a look. The story isn't bad, and there's a lot of dialog.My main complaints are as an RPG, it's kind of lacking content. The campaign is very linear, not a lot of tactical depth to combat, no ability to customize anything except a handful of consumables on party members, nearly all hired runners lack any personality, and reactivity is pretty sparse (i.e. special dialog for race/gender is rare). However, where this game will really shine is future content. It shipped with an ugly but powerful editor that allows modders to fix certain things (more open world questing and lootable bodies for starters). The Berlin DLC is also planned to be more open ended.Overall, a shallow but solid default campaign. The best of this game will come to the surface in the coming months.			"

												Back in my SNES days, Shadowrun was by far my favourite game.  These days, that's the only game that really sticks in my mind when I think back to playing that console.  Over the years I have tracked where the game was going.  Horrified that Microsoft bought the rights, but thought maybe they'll do something good with it.  Nope.  2007, I saw it was just another first-person shooter, not tied to the Shadowrun universe, I sadly concluded there was no chance of ever seeing another Shadowrun game like the one on SNES.  Guess I'll have to install a SNES emulator and play the original (never got around to it).Then I was cruising around Google Play last week, when Shadowrun Returns showed up on my recommended list.  OHHHH.... darn.  No tablet.  Yet.  But tis on Steam, and it works on Linux.  REJOICE!  I tried it for a few hours and so far it's looking great.  I played both the Dead Man's Switch campaign provided by Harebrained Schemes, and a story someone is putting together to replicate the SNES version.Thanks Microsoft for giving the game's rights back to Jordan Weisman!  Thanks Jordan and HBS for bringing back the world of Shadowrun to our screens!  Thanks  Kickstarter for the campaign to fund HBS' development.  Thanks all who provided funding!  Had I known the campaign existed last year, I would've contributed for sure.			"

												What to say about this game?.Hmmm..Just finished the damn thing...I started playing friday afternoon. It's now sunday 1 AM. I didn't do any other thing the whole weekend. That's how addicted you become to the storyline, and playability of this game.It very similar to fallout ( the first one ), all isometric views, and despite some critics, i liked the graphics a lot. The ambients are wonderful, the conversations are well-thought, and you do feel you're in some crazy society, all the way through. The gameplay is extremely simple, but you've got a miriad of choices along the way. Most of ( if not all ) of the puzzles have several different ways to be solved, depending on how you build your character, or your gaming style.You can hack stuff, use your charms and talk your way, shoot it, sneak it, however you want.From a troll bouncer that's as polite and philosophical as ever, to a psychotic ugly elf, you're gonna get surprised by this game. Very very nice.			"

												I've played this game for ten hours before I eventually got too frustrated and uninstalled.What I thought when I first encountered it was a misstep, (the lack of any save/load game feature), turned into a death knell -- you WILL reach moments in the game, where despite your best planning you are left in the worst condition you could be and are unable to continue.In a typical RPG, you would restore to an autosave or a quicksave or otherwise from somewhere earlier on and roll the dice again, presumably to try and get a better result from a combat sequence -- you'd be free to because a regular game recognises the mutability of each instance of combat and provides you that opportunity. That is NOT the case in this game: if you get to the penultimate area of a mission with no health, dead team members, or no supplies, you must either run through the situation over and over from their awkwardly placed checkpoints, or start the entire mission over again from BEFORE you initiated it. This includes talking to all the NPCs, watching unskippable cinematics, recruting new team members, purchasing supplies, levelling up, and travelling to the mission area. Depending on how much preparation you require, you may spend more time in preliminary prepping than actually playing the game, going over the same (admittedly clever and consistent) dialogue, losing its significance each time.This surely seems like an issue that one shouldn't harp on, but consider how elemental even a rudimentary save system is to any RPG you've ever played, and then remove it. How many opportunities are there to say that it was a universally good choice? In this game, the absence is so notable that it almost renders the game worthless.As for the positives, the game is set in the legendary Shadowrun universe, fully realised in video game form! The writing is quite often witty and on point. There is a potential for infinite content with the open authoring tools.It's worth buying if you think you can deal with the big drawback, but it is a big one.			"

												I really enjoy the fact that Shadowrun is back.  I played Shadowrun on the SNES and the Sega, and always hoped that we would get another chance at this game. Most of the UGC is really cool, combat is fun I think that the turn based style works quite well for the game. The DLC so far has been fun but at times it feels like the DLC is geared more towards a decker.  While this is not a down side; it does lead to some hard choices, still no matter what I am having a blast with it.  I'd say if you haven't played the orginal games, or the Tabletop RPG you should give this game a chance. If you have played the orginal games or the RPG, get it! I'm hoping that we get more DLC for this game and I look forward to what UGC comes out for it. Minor beefs are some of the essence costs and we don't see much in the ways of Betaware or Delta grade cyberware, of course this could change as time passes.			"

												If you're a Shadowrun fan, or at least have some experience with the old SNES and/or Genesis games (the 2006 Xbox one doesn't count), this is worth picking up. Shadowrun Returns plays like XCOM with more RPG elements and without the punishing difficulty that is a hallmark of that series. The story is full of references and inside jokes that will render fans of the series nostalgic, but even if you're new to the series, important concepts and characters are explained at least adequately enough for the story to make sense. My one complaint is that the story, which is fairly short, is extremely linear and offers virtually no sidequesting. However, this game is meant to be just one ""campaign"" in the Shadowrun setting, and the real replay value lies in the editor, which allows players to create their own adventures and share them with the world. Despite its linearity and lack of meaningful choices for the player to make, I say buying it is justified by its low price tag. I hope this game helps give the Shadowrun setting more publicity, because it's definitely unique and worth investigating.			"

												Great game! I've never reviewed one before, but I think this a real hidden gem. The graphics are lush and immersive, player creation is simple but very detailed. The abilities, classes, and combat are very true to the paper and pencil Shadowrun RPG (which is great). NPC dialog and dialog response options are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. They really went all out with this one, even more impressive because it was made by a realtively small developer (I'm going to look for more games from Harbrained after playing this).Best feature of all though, great TURN-BASED rpg combat. Reminiscent of some of the best rpgs ever made, but with gorgeous graphics thrown in. I would recommend the Dragonfall scenario too, just because this game is so good, one story isn't enough!Also, I got the core game on sale for just $5, literally best five dollars I've ever spent!The dev team really hit it out of the park on this one, I'll be looking for more of your games and any future kickstarters you do, please keep up the amazing work!

												Shadowrun Returns is a surprisingly addictive isometric cyberpunk RPG. The combat has enough tactical depth to keep you on your toes, but the real strength to this game is the story. The dialogue between characters is both interesting and meaningful, often making use of slang specific to the Shadowrun universe which aids immersion. The game does feel quite linear at times and conversational options are often inconsequential, but it doesn't detract from the experience thanks to engaging storyline. I'm genuinely surprised at the quality of the game, especially when consideration is given to the asking price. I think anyone looking for a modern take on old-school RPG'ing would be wise to try Shadowrun.Note: ignore the playtime, my shadowrunning was done offline.			"

												I've never played the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, those aren't my bag. I did love the Shadowrun game on SNES that I played as a kid. This game brings a good blend of nostaglia for that previous title in a similar, but updated look, but it definitely also takes advantage of lessons learned in gaming in the intervening years. Combat in both the real world and while dekking is intuitive and easy to grasp. There are a number of skill tree options to monkey with, but not so many as to require a spreadsheet. Overall I found the game to be a satisfying experience, not terribly difficult, but that's not what I was looking for here anyway. Good times, definitely worth picking up if you enjoyed the old SNES game or the trailer to this one appeals to you.			"

												The Dead Man's Switch(DMS) campaign is forgettable and is only notable for having an annoying enemy that can only be killed with a cumbersome mechanic. There are a handful of interesting interactions during DMS but overall its honestly not worth playing through and can be easily skipped.Dragonfall(DF), on the other hand, is awesome and is filled with characters and scenarios that are as imaginative, well written,  and worth exploring as some of the best RPGs that I have ever played. DF additionally contains a much better structure than DMS, by that I mean rather than having a linear quest with hardly any side branches that you undertake with some flavorless NPCs, DF tasks you with a central goal and allows you to lead a team of fairly unique characters along a questline that has scores of opportunity to explore more of the world of Shadowrun. I enjoyed the vast majority of my time with DF, save for the hacking bits (called decking in this universe), and some later game fights with some annoyingly powerful enemies. Altough, I wholeheartedly recommend DF, Its a shame that you have to buy both to play DF but since thats the case I would advise that you buy the campaigns at a reduced cost and skip DMS.			"

What I can say is that I like both campaigns, but Dragonfall is the better out of the two (more cyberware, more options, bigger campaign in my opinion).After having finished Dragonfall, I can say that Dead Man's Switch was lacking a bit, and I most likely won't play it again. However, I would find myself playing Dragonfall again.So what I did not like was the lack of cyberware and game options, but the campaign was great. You should definitely play Dead Man's Switch before Dragonfall. I am hoping another DLC will come out soon. Another thing I did not like was that there were not any Mr. Johnsons, like there were in the Sega Genesis version. That, alongside a taxi system should be implemented in the next DLC (after Dragonfall).			"

This one campaign is included with the game and it is rather on the short side and linear BUT there are a few really good Workshop campaigns available for free and Dragonfall DLC, which I understand is much broader.And there's also the editor, so you can make your own characters, maps, missions and campaigns if you want.

												I didn't play the original Shadowrun back in the early nineties, so the game gets no retro love in this review. Shadowrun returns is a average cyberpunk and magic theme RPG. The main defect in the game is the vacuity of the gameworld comprised of the different interconnected areas. The game basically gives you only plot items to interact and the city locations are small. True to the ""pocket world"" RPG approach the plot is your average RPG pipeline stuff. Shadowrun Returns also lacks the intricate background stories for NPCs that most RPGs have, but this aspect of team interaction is added in the Dragonfall DLC. Dragonfall also does everything a little bit better, passing of as a relatively good RPG. It takes maybe 15-18 hours to complete Dragonfall if you're a completionist and about 20h for the main game. Since there's lots of combat, which is not that great, the game in my opinion is somwhat lacking in replay value. Though the end game of Dragonfall does play differently depending on few key choices, you're not inclined to mow through the same combat laden missions again.			"

The writing is well done and oozes the blend of noir, sci-fi, and fantasy that makes up the Shadowrun universe. The game play is very reminiscent of Fallout 2 or XCOM and centered around squad based tactical combat.			"

If not, you should, the game is steeped in the atmosphere and world that many of us have loved for so long. Not only that, but the game is a fun, well written strategic rpg that moves at a good pace and harkens to games of old (especially the old SNES game). If you have no particular affinity for Shadowrun, it looks to potentially grow infinitely over time with an included scenario development kit, so it will be well worth picking up on sale down the line.

Even if you have never played the SNES game, Genesis game, or the table top game, it's well worth your time and money. I never expected this game to be this good. The battle system is wonderful; if you've ever played a tactical RPG before, you'll be right at home. There are several classes to choose from, and all of them have their own special perks. The karma point system (leveling up) is pretty standard, and it's not very complicated. All in all, this game is the complete package for anyone who loves RPGs. Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on it.			"

												Excellent game.  Great story and pretty sweet turn based combat.  Really felt like an old school RPG. The combat is not as intense as XCOM, but it's still fun and distributing stats to your character is great too.  Only thing is you are in charge of only one character and hire others to fill out your squad, which is okay but sometimes I wished I was able to assign stats to the characters on my team.  I did not encounter any bugs.  If it was a book it would be one of those ""I could not put it down"" type books			"

												There are two camps that come to my mind. Those that enjoy being 'told' a story and those that enjoy 'telling' the story. If you are one who resides mostly in the camp of the former, then I tell you this:""Wait""There is absolutly no urgency in your purchase of this game, not yet anyway. The Shadowrun community needs to bolster its numbers with creative individuals, and get into crafting trinkets and stories. This game is an excellent tool to tell stories, and with the back-drop of cyber-punk in a world of magic, dragons, and elves one has many resources to craft tales of epic adventures.Now to those of the second camp, get your butts in here! We need more content, and the only way to ensure this is for you to help us in creating it. In due time, this will grow to be something absolutly amazing. Till then, if you do choose to purchase this now, 'Dead man switch' will be the first thing you will get to play through. It is a good introduction to the posibilities you as a story teller will be able to create.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an excellent, engrossing, and enjoyable tactical RPG. It does come highly recommended; sort of.When the game originally released, it came with the default campaign known as ""Dead Man's Switch"". It's enjoyable, with some memorable characters, but there were complaints about it being too linear with too much focus on straight gunplay. Now obviously, that is still available. There's also tons of mods for custom campaigns. There was a DLC for this game, called ""Dragonfall"", which was superior to the base game in almost every way. Now in order to get that, you need to purchase ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut"". Buying this title here will not grant you access to Dragonfall anymore, sadly. I personally recommend both titles, but at this point it would be best to wait for this title to go on sale, and pick up the seperate Dragonfall game ASAP.			"

												Cyberlike, tatical strategy, turn-based rpg. A lot of great things about this game however, there are a lot of flaws as well. The graphics are nice. The artwork is fantastic. The story is interesting. Shadowruns is a great series!Not to mention, the game editor produced some amazing community content.I especially love that it's compatible with my tablet pc. You don't need a keyboard to play. As a result, I spent my long subway rides progressing with the story which was a great way to pass time. However... this game is extremely linear. There are dialogue choices, but most of the time.. They don't matter. Most, if not all, dialogues end the same.Most importantly, the gameplay is extremely linear. There's not much exploration and the paths are clearly laid out for you. Adding to that, there are very very little side quests to actually do. There are just optional objectives that give you extra karma or help a little with the main quest. A little bit about the combat: Because it's turn-based, it takes a while for each battle. There's no way to speed up the process so battles often take longer than you'd expect. Adding on top of that, You can only save out of combat - Be prepared to finish or don't start it at all. Tldr;+ Interesting story+ Can be fun, depending on your own preferences+ Great time-passer+ Amazing artwork+ Great community content- Linear gameplay & plot- Linear dialogue - Slow combatDespite it all, Shadowrun Returns is a great place to introduce yourself and start the video game series. The sequels are a huge improvement as well. I recommend that you play it!			"

												Great game for fans of old school RPG at a great price. If you've read Neuromancer; and loved it, if you've spent countless hours playing Baldur's Gate or older Fallout titles; and couldn't tear yourself away from them, this is a game for you.And once you're done with original campaign, quality user generated content awaits you on Steam Workshop and 3rd party sites like Shadowrun Nexus. Modders are so ambitious that they are recreating whole Shadowrun sourcebooks. So, come on, join us in the shadows, chummer.Shadowrun Dragonfall: I know they are marketing this as merely DLC, but DLC this is not. It is a full blown, old fashioned expansion pack. Dragonfall packs a bigger campaign, set in the anarchy ridden Berlin of 2054, otherwise known as the Flux State.HBS has listened to fans and addressed all the major issues from the original game. Saving your game anywhere? Check! More interesting companions with actual personalities and backstory? Yes, sir! Side missions? Of course! This time around you are not led by the hand. You get a hub, certain Berlin neighborhood, where you can choose your missions, even reject them if Mr. Johnson offering it isn't on the level. You can chat with the (meta)humans living there. Solve their problems. Learn of their past, and they all have some very shady skeletons in the closet. Let's face it, only people running from something come to the F-State...and corporations. But the latter are a different story altogether. Runs themselves have been improved considerably. There are multiple solutions to every problem and some tough choices to be made in practically every one. Enemy encounters have been improved. Combat is more enjoyable, overall. Non-combat skills feature more prominently. Skills and etiquette checks are very frequent. You can go in guns, fists, blades and magic blazing. But you can also do things covertly. It's all up to you.Writing in this game is great. Story takes hold of you, is full of twist and turns, and won't let you go 'till the end. By that time, you'll crave more. Speaking of length, you'll get at least twenty hours out of the game. Even more, if you play on harder difficulties, want to speak to everyone and see everything.Dragonfall is the definitive reason to pick up the original game. If you're into old school RPGs, cyberpunk, and value a good story, you won't be disappointed with this game.			"

												Well i grew up playing the SNES game Shadow Runners and It was a title that I was quite fond of. I saw this game on steam one day and I thought taking a chance on a purchase was a no brainer...I'm glad I did.While it is not an official sequal to the SNES classic the story does continue on in the same shadowrun world. The story is a little cliche' you play a shadow runner avenging the death of your friend. I don't want to give away too much of the plot as the campaign is quite small and unfortunately linear however the story and gameplay do create an enjoyable experience. There are many different character classes. Some specialise in close or ranged combat. Others specialise in magic and summoning. There is also a decker class that specializes in breaking into computers and invading cyberspace. You get a choice of how you would like to play the game based on Karma (attribute points) to apply to your skills. Party Combat itself is fun although not difficult just requires basic tactical common sense.Overall I have really enjoyed the experience and recommend this game 100% when its on sale. Thanks to the steam workshop there is some replayability however the main story is only worth one playthrough. I hear the other Shadowrun games on steam are even better so I am excited to try!			"

												Definitely nostalgic of the original Shadowrun on SNES.  An epic 'SQUEE' could probably be heard down the block when Jake Armitage crawled off of the slab in his cameo.  In any case, the turn based combat leaves a little bit to be desired from the original but all in all is actually fairly well thought out.  Positioning for cover, positioning behind enemies gives a melee boost, shotgun spread, etc.I've always been a HUGE fan of cyberpunk games that follow the whole, 'end of days' type feel.  World populated by multimillion dollar corporations that make the decisions now, street gangs that control most of the slums, implanted datajacks to interface with computers.  This one definitely hit me in my nostalgia bone, but with an updated twist.Bravo... bravo!			"

												Okay. Have you played Shadowrun the tabletop RPG? Me neither. The closest i've ever gotten to playing Shadowrun before this game was the counterstrike ripoff on the Xbox 360 (not that it was bad or anything. They just went a very ""safe"" route with it).I had no idea what the setting was. What everything was called. Why in a cyberpunk futuristik setting where would be elves, Dwarfs and trolls. Did i learn anything about that in game? Nope! I did however find it online and i did get a bit intrested in the setting.""So we get that you like the setting of the game. Is it any good? Is it worth my 14 bucks? (Or something like that.))"" Yes, Absolutly. The game is pretty cheap and it has workshop support AKA you'll be old before you run out of content. The community makes content for this all the time and if you would so choose you could make your own pretty easily. They give you all the tools.The main story that comes with the game is a nice touch and it's a pretty decent story too! It's not bad at all but it isnt great. It's good not great. Just a bit of a fair warning on that front.The only thing i wish was in there was some sort of multiplayer. But that would be long and frikking annoying with all the slow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s going ""HMMMMMMM, i wonder if i should heal that guy over there that just took a katana to the face or if i should throw a ineffectual ball of magic at the baddie that use said katana. Let me think about if for 10 min. Calculating every possibility for every move i make for the next what should be 2 hours made 12 thanks to me!""But it doesnt have multiplayer anyway so no real rush. Besides the elitist ♥♥♥♥ers in the world would probably make the game unplayable anyway.SO is the game good? YES. Should you buy it? YUP! Will i go to make a snack after this? probably!			"

												An intersting story and flexible, easy to pick up combat has made this a fun flash back to top down RPGs with a modern flair and style. The mix 3d models and carefully crafted art also give each scene its own unique illustrated feel. Definitely a must for RPG fans.			"

Pros The Cyberpunk-meets-Fantasy-Magic set in the real-world near-future aesthetic is great. The way the stats are balanced leaves the class-race combos open, and encourages exploration of different options/layouts. I just wish there was a way to respecc. Maybe there is later in the game. I love the tactical, turn-based combat.Cons The single angle of the camera gets a little annoying in combat; e.g. if you've got an ally standing directly beneath/infront of an enemy, you can accidentally target your ally because their hitbox overlaps the enemy's. If I could rotate the camera to a different angle, that'd solve my biggest gripe with the game The first campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is interesting, but rather slow-paced. Haven't tried the expansion campgain or any of the user generated content yet.All in all, it's a fun tactical, turn-based, text-driven RPG. The character creation options are pretty robust -- not so much in terms of appearances, but in terms of class selection and creation. It's easy to start out with one of the game's premade archetypes and expand out into other disciplines as you get the feel for the game, or to just stick with a single discipline. I don't know how well either works comparatively because I haven't played long enough. The story of the first campaign moves a little slow; they do a good job of tying the tutorial stuff into the story without breaking immersion, but that's kind of what slows it down.			"

												At the time of this writing, Hairbrained Studios have only released ""Dead Man's Switch"" and ""Dragonfall"", with the latter a significantly stronger module than the former. Both are heavily combat-based, and while careful positioning and action choices can tilt battles in your favor, the RNG can make sure that even if you do everything right, your team can still be wiped in a couple rounds due to keyboard-smashing bad luck (in this respect, the combat is very similar to X-COM: Enemy Unknown). But if you're getting an RPG like this, you're hopefully getting it knowing that luck is part of the game.It's all very good fun, particularly on harder difficulties. Agonizing over how to build your character, whom to take on a mission, and how to position them each round should please old-school turn-based RPG purists. The story arcs and character depth are not really fantastic, but the game is built on going out and completing runs (usually by shooting/stabbing/blowing things up, with only occassional decking responsibilities).Definite recommend, particularly if you've played the pencil-and-paper version.

												Shadowrun: Returns and its Expansion/DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a turn-based tactical RPG game created by a studio called Harebrained Schemes out of Seattle, WA. The base game Shadowrun: Returns was released on Steam on July 25th, 2013, and the DLC Shadowrun: Dragonfall was released on February 27th, 2014.For those not familiar with the Shadowrun universe, it is based on a cyber-punk futuristic planet Earth. It is the 2050’s. The world is run by enormous, greedy corporations who will stop at nothing to acquire power. The twist is that a few decades earlier (around our current modern-day) magic returned to our world. With it came elves, dwarves, trolls, ogres, and other magical creatures.Shadowrunners are for-hire mercenaries who will do just about any job as long as there is money to be made. Whether it is stealing secrets from a corporate rival, working as security to protect those secrets, or taking out individuals that stand in their way of power, they are hired by big corporations to do their “dirty work”. They work in the seedy underbelly of this corporate society and live and survive in the shadows.I discovered Shadowrun when I was browsing around Steam looking for something new to play. Dragonfall was pretty highly recommended, and after reading up a bit on it I thought it sounded like something I would enjoy. I started it up and decided to start from the beginning and play through the original campaign. I was immediately sucked in to the story. I just had to keep playing, if for no reason other than to find out how the story turned out!The story for each of the campaigns is probably the best feature of the game. I don’t think I’ve been this captivated by a video game’s story since Final Fantasy VII! Even though there are no video cut scenes and no voice overs, the story is told VERY well.The story is progressed by speaking with various NPCs in the game world. When you speak to them you are given a number of choices as to how you want to respond in the conversation. There are a few places in the game where the dialogue options you choose will change the sequence of events to complete the mission. There isn’t a LOT of these places, but they are there. Also some dialogue options may not be available to you because of certain conditions. For example, if your Strength stat is high you may be able to bully that gang leader into giving you the key you need to progress. But, if you lack strength and are more intelligent, you may have to use brains over brawn to get what you need. There is also a feature called “Etiquette”. The game describes etiquette as “knowing how to behave in various social situations”. In-game this means you will get certain dialogue options based on what etiquette you choose when you create your character. In the example above, if my character has the “Gang” etiquette I may have a dialogue option when talking to the gang leader that will open up different options for completing the mission.Character progression is pretty straight-forward. When you create your character there are a few class archetypes that you can choose from. This gives you a basic set of skills to start from. As you progress you will acquire more skill points that you can spend on any skill you want. If you want to spend your skill points to be a shotgun-wielding mage you can, or if you want to specialize in being an uber “Decker” (Shadowrun’s version of a computer hacker) you can do that too. While skill points come pretty easy, it’s still a good idea to specialize in one or two areas. The campaign isn’t long enough for you to get enough skill points to max out everything.The skills were all pretty well explained right in game. All of your teammates and other Shadowrunners that you can hire all have their own set of skills and abilities. So if you are a shotgun-wielding mage you can hire a teammate that has the hacking skills you need for a mission. I kind of like this system. It lets you build your character however you like and then you can complement your skills with those of the shadowrunners you run with.From the very beginning I felt like the game environment and the atmosphere were very well done. I felt like I was running around in the movie Blade Runner! Everything was futuristic, yet familiar. The characters I interacted with and their portraits definitely captured the cyberpunk feel. Each character you encounter has their own personality and they are very unique. I thought the music was great too, even if there wasn’t a lot of variety. I thought it fit well with the theme of the game.The tactical combat style is what attracted me to the game in the first place. I found the combat to be a lot of fun, and in some places it was VERY challenging. For most missions you have your player character and three other Shadowrunners to make up your team.When you are walking around the map everything is in real time. But, as soon as combat starts, it switches to turn-based tactical mode. Every member of your team has a set number of “Action Points” (AP) that you can spend each turn. Firing your weapon or using a special ability may cost an AP point. Moving to a different location with better cover may cost another. Casting that healing spell or reloading your rifle will cost another. This is where the tactical part comes in. You have to decide what you want each member of your team to do each round. Do you want to focus fire and finish off one enemy at a time, or do you spread out and burn them all down at once? You also have to be careful that you don’t leave yourself pinned down somewhere without enough AP to use that medkit to keep you alive in the fight. Once you spend all your AP for that turn, the computer will play the turn of your enemies. Once they are done it is your turn to spend your AP again. Add in that each weapon type has a different range and friendly-fire can be hazardous to your teammates, it makes combat VERY interesting.The Good, The Bad, and the UglyAs a whole I very much enjoyed Shadworun: Returns and Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The story lines for BOTH campaigns are among the best I’ve ever seen in a video game. The first campaign is a BIT slow to start but it’s only so at the beginning. Combat is a lot of fun and can be pretty challenging at times. There were a few missions I had to play through a couple of different times with different strategies before I was victorious.I really enjoyed the skill system as well. It was easy to understand and easy to use. I didn’t feel like I needed to go online and read hundreds of forum posts to learn what the best build for my character would be. I could just pick a couple of skills I wanted to learn that were fun for me and go with it and be successful.The only bad worth mentioning is the length of the campaigns. My total play time on Steam is 48 hours, and that was running all the way through both campaigns. I’m sure I’m a lot slower that a lot of other people. However, considering the inexpensive price of the game and the fact that there is a lot of player generated content on the Steam Workshop, there is a lot of replayability here. Hopefully they will also be releasing more DLC in the future.About the only “ugly” I can say about the game is a couple of buggy missions I encountered. In one mission there was an event that didn’t trigger properly and I was unable to continue because a door would not unlock. I had to replay that mission one or two times before it finally triggered properly and I could advance.Also, some earlier reviews criticized Shadowrun: Returns’ save system. At release you could only save at certain checkpoints. This is no longer the case. I’m not sure if it was with the release of Dragonfall or if it was before that, but they changed the game so you can now save anywhere.See my original review at http://www.mistervertigo.net "

												Simply a-freaking-mazing.Shadowrun Returns is my first venture into this universe, and after a ten hour campaign, I'm completely obsessed. If you are also new, but a little wary about dropping the money for this title, allow me to explain a little about the game...SR is an isometric-style Rpg, set in a future-fantasy universe, where elves and dwarves wield shotguns and cast spells. Starting up the default campaign, Dead Man Switch, you create a character. Race, class and appearance are all up to you. Then, the developer, Harebrained Schemes drops you into a well-written and thoughtfully crafted story, presented in a text-based format - no voice acting here, and I think it's better for it, but that's personal preference. Dialog options are different depending on how you build your character and elicit different responses from NPCs, with charisma allowing you to sweet-talk, and etiquettes let you rub elbows with the many groups that populate Seattle.You play a Shadowrunner, a type of mercenary, doing the dirty-work of multi-billion dollar corporations and aristocrats for cash. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the recent Xcom: Enemy Unknown. If you didn't like that, chances are you won't like this. Every turn, each combatant is given a certain number of moves, from moving to shooting and using items. It's very tactical and you could wind up dead if you don't think before you click. Several jobs you undertake have you bringing other Runners on to watch your back and take a cut of the pay, so you're almost never alone.I found no hick-ups in the gameplay during my play-through. The specials and items are balanced well, meaning death is often the fault of the player's ill preparation. The game is fair, which is about all a gamer could ask for. Also available are game editors, allowing anyone to write their own stories and scenarios for others to enjoy. I haven't been able to try any out because there currently seems to be a bug that causes the ugc to be downloaded to the wrong files, making them difficult to locate.Shadowrun Returns is a gem that I'm glad was funded. It's not for everyone, but if it sounds like it's up your alley, I urge you to pick it up. "

												Shadowrun Returns is a game for those who enjoy old-school RPG's. Dragonfall DLC is a must have.The games strengths are in good writing, rich world history and all in all beautiful artwork.The world is beautifully detailed whether you're in the streets of Redmond Barrens, a luxurious corporate headquarter or busy market hub in Germany. I might not be the biggest fan of the ""cartoony"" style the designers went ahead with but all in all it works. The portrait artwork is also beautifully done.Dialogue and text is descriptive and good all through the games, lack of voice is the proper way to do an rpg when you have good writers.While there are many things in the game that could have been done better, far better even, I cannot think of any major  flaws or issues in design. Base game delivers an okay story and gameplay although it's lacking in many ways I still managed to get some 12 hours of gameplay from it and did not feel bad about getting the game but I did feel like it could have been done better and certainly it could have been bigger.Dragonfall DLC is a whole different story however. In fact, I would say that Dragonfall is -the- reason to buy Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall provides you with a more classic Shadowrun feel, the storyline is excellent, the permanent companions have personalities and plenty of dialogue in and out of missions and even the local npc's are always worth talking to. Dragonfall features more of the actual Shadowrun gigs, the game is full of choices to make, plot twists to uncover and provides far richer experience for all types of characters as all types of skills have more uses.The Dragonfall DLC provided me with additional 18-20 hours of gameplay, far more than the base game does.Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall dlc's only major problem is that it leaves me wanting for more. So much more.. I want a bigger game with more content!Harebrained Schemes has a great basis set up, hopefully they will continue in the path of Dragonfall as it is obviously doing so many things right.			"

												I never played Shadowrun when it was on the NES or whatever else it was on. I joined the world with Shadowrun Returns and I have to say its a good place to start. It opens up a lot of doors, and even some windows, to a whole new world of science and magic. The controls feel clunky sometimes, but its by no means game breaking. Its turn table based combat, good guys go first more often then not, and then the bad guys. You get to make your own character from various races and classes. You don't have to stick to class you pick at creation though. You can be a mage with some intense decking skills, or a rigger who knows some summoning. They don't force you to stick to a class. Just be careful, as the game often hints 'A Jack of all trades is a master of none.'You play as a Shadowrunner, a gun for hire in the streets. You've fallen on some hard times and seem to be thinking more about your future then your past, till you get a call from a old contact. A guy you used to run with, Sam. He's been killed recently and set up a 'dead mans switch' in his brain to send you a message when he finally kicks the bucket. Well, someone kicked his bucket for him and you need to travel to Seattle and find out who did it. There are some serious twists and turns as you dig deeper into this world, trying to uncover who did it.Dragonfall is leap and bounds ahead of Dead mans Switch. The graphics feel tighter, but there is no real change. Some of the sounds and combat has been tweaked a bit and the save anywhere anytime button is a lifesaver. The supporting characters feel a lot more real, and can be interacted with anytime. They have backgrounds and lives, and aren't afarid to give you a piece of their minds if they think your doing something wrong.In the newest 'dlc' you get a whole new campgain, set up for a new character but thanks to some dedicated players you can import your character over to this save file to run the DLC. Your out on a run with long time friend Monica and her crew in Berlin. Its a simple job, a smash and grab type. However things aren't always as they seem... Monica ends up dead and you and the crew end up fleeing for your lives. With Monica dead there is a seat to be filled in the community where she lived, and her crew wants revenge. Will you be the vengeful angel and the savior all in one package?			"

												Shadowrun. I picked up the Pen and Paper RPG when I was younger. Sadly it took years before finding a group to play it. Luckly around my University years I found a decent group of people and we are gaming since than. I am an hardcore fan so probably my Review could be a bit biased. Frist of all I strongly suggest to read a bit before gaming. Just the ""Primer"" which is a small guide\introduction to the World of Shadowrun available from the site Shadowrun Universe (official site for all things related to Shadowrun). Once you have the Primer you can have a good idea of what to expect from the Setting. I know that at a frist glance it looks strange maybe even too much but trust me it is awesome. The more you will dig the better it will get, specially if you start to read the various RPG manuals and novels. If you liked the setting buy this game. The basic Campaign included in Shadowrun Returns is a classic. If you never rped or played Shadowrun (I am mostly referring to SNES and GENESIS Games) this is a wonderfull start. The narration is set in 2050s which is a very cool period for Shadowrun (keep in mind that in the current RP Setting the time is around 2075) and it is based on some of the hottest plots of that period. The game is a basic Turn Based Combat with RP elements in the form of dialogues where the various options depends on which skill you have. Back when it was just published the Game lacked few things like save anywhere option. Luckly this was fixed up in the 1st DLC Dragonfall. Dragonfall is even better than the basic game. The Devs listened to us Players and fixed few things and I dare to say even took inspiration from some of UGC - User generated Content (More of this later). Dragonfall can look a bit boring at the start with the logic of ""Do a Run, get back and run again"" (Run is a work, a mission in Shadowrun) but the Narration, the Plot goes always up till its end. In Dragonfall I was not impressed by the first Runs but nearby the end I could not stop to see how this Story was going to end. The only negative side of both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall is that you can not manage your NPCs. You can select who can help you in a Run but you do not have any kind of control on their Skills and how they improve. Probably this will be fixed in future DLCs. If the basic game and the DLC are not enough there are UGCs. Shadowrun Community is very active and Devs select from time to time some UCG to play just to show up how much it is good. There are a lot of good Artist out there who are working on big UCG like remakes of SNES and Genesis Shadowrun Games. I strongly suggest to take a loot at ""Shadowrun Unlimited"". I hope all of this makes sense. In any case, if you start to play and dig into the Shadows of Shadowrun remember: ""Shoot straight, conserve your ammo and never make a deal with a Dragon"".			"

												Ive been fan of the Shadowrun ever since i first played on the Genesis and Snes and was glad to see a new iteration of it come out. The game still follows all of it rules and has a great look and story that fits the Shadowrun world great.While I still do recommend the game to fans of the Shadowrun world, it does have some really bad bugs / glitches still and wouldnt recommend it unless you love the shadowrun series.Fans of the first two fallout games might find some interest in this title as well since the combat sytem is set up very similar,although a  buggy (almost feels incomplete) version of it.Just an example of a few combat bugs to give people an idea of what thier getting into.A bug for shamans where when you summon a spirit which will cause the combat system to break and not be able to use or select any of characters during youre turn and basicly forcing you to forfeit the rest of your turn which will most likely cause a death of one of your runners.Another bug is where and enemy attacking you will shoot you through walls while you not only cannot shoot because of line sight issue and wont be able to even see the enemy untill you run around the wall.A bug where when you try to heal your drone out of combat it will say immune not heal your drone and use a repair kit.So I would say a good game for the price if your a fan of the series but if not I would probaly skip over this one.

												Really a big fan of turn-based RPGs since Fallout and Fallout 2 as well as a fan of the pencil and paper, table-top RPG game. The description and reviews are fairly accurate. The thing that really hooked me was when the game was approaching a foreseeable ending and then took a left turn at Crazy Street. Totally surprised me in a good way and extended the gameplay by a couple of hours. Looking forward to replaying as a different spec character to see if there are any other twists that I missed. After that, it's some serious contemplation on whether to buy the DLC or venture off into the user created material that seems to be free of charge. All in all, a fun, solid game with unexplored aspects awaiting.			"

												Great game! I've never reviewed one before, but I think this a real hidden gem. The graphics are lush and immersive, player creation is simple but very detailed. The abilities, classes, and combat are very true to the paper and pencil Shadowrun RPG (which is great). NPC dialog and dialog response options are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. They really went all out with this one, even more impressive because it was made by a realtively small developer (I'm going to look for more games from Harbrained after playing this).Best feature of all though, great TURN-BASED rpg combat. Reminiscent of some of the best rpgs ever made, but with gorgeous graphics thrown in. I would recommend the Dragonfall scenario too, just because this game is so good, one story isn't enough!Also, I got the core game on sale for just $5, literally best five dollars I've ever spent!The dev team really hit it out of the park on this one, I'll be looking for more of your games and any future kickstarters you do, please keep up the amazing work!

All present and accounted for.I'm not all the way through Dragonfall yet, but so far, it feels like a full-fledged game in the same sense that Shadowrun Returns is.

												Refreshing single-player RPG experience. The game looks clean & sharp. There's not a lot of hand-holding (I finished the game without learning a LOT of the functionality - thankfully I went through on 'easy'), but that also means that there's no intrusive tutorial.  There could've been more, sure... but what is there is pretty darn solid and compelling. I finished in 2 sittings (first one lasting 8 hours). This game has a lot of potential for player-made content (my next stop is the workshop to see what is out there). Overall a very direct and clear-cut experience. Enjoyed it quite a bit.			"

												Exactly what I wanted from a Shadowrun game. I only wish the official content and DLC were longer. There are some really good mod missions that are very fun. My only complaint is that you can't take your original character through dragonfall, but based on the dragonfall story it makes sense.			"

												Excellent game. Turn-based combat really evokes the Tabletop feel that gives a veteran Shadowrunner warm fuzzy feelings.Dead Man's Switch is a great jaunt into the Shadowrun world, if a bit weighted towards a combat-monkey. Not a lot here for Deckers and Mages. That being said...Dragonfall absolutely makes up for this, with many mission possibilities limited to only Deckers, Riggers and Mages. Welcome to the Flux, chummer.			"

												Well,this game may be little simlistic in game mechanics, thin in side quests and second half of story is yet-another-hero-saves-the-world, but in the way of decriptive an literal writing there are some glimpses of classics like Planetscape Torment (of course PT is much more poetic than Shadowrun). Also there is lot of stuffs you can buy, and stats to level in. Frequent changes of your companions help keep fights variability on decent level. Afterall game has solid atmosphere, nice stylized graphics - and its fun. I have buoght it in summer sale an now i am going for Shadowrun:Dragonfall.			"

												OK, I've been playing for a couple hours, and I was hesitant to buy this game because of the reviews. But I like Shadowrun lore and ambiance, so I gave it a shot. I played Shadowrun when it came out for SNES.Now: I would cathegorize this game as an ""interaction novel"". Most of the players wanted a sandbox or at least some freedom, but this is no game for that. This game tells a story where you are involved in. There are some RPG aspects like leveling and building your character, but that is not the core of the game (I think).If you are looking for a short sci-fi story you can play, then go ahead, I recommend this game. If you are a Shadowrun stories fan, then you should give it a try too. If you are looking for an action game, a sandbox or a game where you can choose where to go, then this is not a game for you. It has click adventure parts, it has tactical turn-based parts, but the core is the story. Some player have said the story is sh$%#"". For me it is working, so far.CheersEdit: If you are looking for turn based strategy game or you are not into Shadowrun lore, go for XCOM: enemy unknown and within			"

												Welcome to Seattle.  Whether you are a human, ork, troll, elf or dwarf; gather up your PDA, DataJack and other 90s-future techology.  Emerse yourself in the dystopia world of megacorps and shadowrunners.  Forget about Starbucks.  Put on your Doc Martins, flannel shirt and the dusty old Pearl Jam CD.  Prepare your hacking, rigging, magic or samaurai skills.  Start your adventure with a Dead Man's Switch.Very nice ambiance of retro-future.  Excellent turn-based RPG.

												Worth buying for the writing alone. Its dialogue and prose are clean and razor sharp, like something from a William Gibson novel.It does have its shortcomings:- The combat can be repetitve. It doesn't feel like they got the most out of the engine. - The player character models are due for a revamp. Compared to Glory in Dragonfall, the standard characters look a bit awkward.- It's hard to know which class to play. I've found myself starting over sevral times because I didn't like my character choice.If you can look past these flaws, Shadowrun Returns will reward you with a solid story, interesting characters and spotless branching dialogue. Not since the golden age of CRPGs has a game felt so much like a great piece of literature. GET IT.			"

												ahhhhhh, sitting back with a glass of 15 year glenlivet and a pipe in your man chair. It's hard to find a more refreshing and manlier past time....oh wait, what is this? Cyberpunk infused with a refreshing take on fantasy? In an Isometric rpg using hand crafted maps with a unique art style? I have a game to play, enough of this manly lounging about!tl;dr;  Overall 7/10. Worth the cash if your gaming plate is empty and, you want a fun rpg with decent story telling and stunning, unique, art direction and  visuals to sit back and relax with.-hardcore rpgs fans will find the Dev's campaigns lacking rpg-ness in areas-those who want the best parts of the campign will have to pay $30 for the toolset and dragonfall -it missed its calling -> it needs networking/co-op support so it can be used as a pnp campaign tool for shadowrunners. In my opinion, with these expansions added on this tool would be hands down the best way to run a pnp shadowrun campaign with friends.Shadowrun plays as a mix between old school isometric rpgs such as baldurs gate and uses a combat system similar to the new Xcom by Firaxis. Unfortunatey though the first campagin is...lacking. While a fun play through and introduction to the universe, it is necessary to buy the dragonfall campaign to truly see what this framework is capable of. However, hardcore Isometric rpg fans will find this game lacking. Side quests are few and far between, you have no control over how your npc companions (depending upon the campaign by harebrained) level up, and a general lack of freedom in what should be a more open world experience. However, the game is primarily designed for being a tool that players use to build their own campaigns. Sadly though, this shouldn't have to be a substitute for harebrain's lack of campaign building talent. The game also needs co-op, just hear me out. This is turn based game, based upon a pen a paper rpg, with focus on building a single character for a player with full stats/""classes"", with tools to build your own campaigns and maps. While entertaining to experience in single player, and as cool as the build your own rpg framework is, it missed its calling. This is a tool that could be expanded to actually run a pen and paper campaigns! There are things like roll20.net but lets be honest, the visual tools and dice support are lacking for odd ball rpgs like Shadowrun (huge lack of cyberpunk visuals like tiles/characters/creatures and a lot of custom equation building required to get it running properly). Adding networking/co-op would allow a savvy dm to build their own maps/campaigns and run a pnp rpg with visual support and a set rule framework for combat! (seriously, the art direction is gorgeous and no need to worry about that ""one player"" cheating their stats or rule loop holes).Overall, for the price ($30 if you buy all the dev built campaigns) it's worth the money. The 2 campaign  stories are fun, the lenghts of the stories are good, the changes in Dragonfall are proof that harebrained is listening to the community to improve upon their stories, tool upgrades, and improving rpg elements in their own work. There are a few bugs/optimizations that need to be sorted out but, I also need to upgrade my pc (really badly) so I'd like to hear how those with beefier rigs hold up. (I'm pretty sure the issues I ran into were due to the HD graphics straining my rig at high resolutions).			"

												This game, this game is one of the few titles I can name that truly inspires my mind to delve depths unimaginable the setting is superb, the lore rich and thick and let's not forget the beautiful controls and gameplay all in all I would say this title is one of my absolute favorites, but let's talk about why.First off the setting is one of the, if not the most beautifully crafted settings to grace the games industry the world feels alive and full of character and emotion as though it is dripping pure atmosphere and spawning true intrigue this is because it is built off of an amazing title already being part of the deep and wonderful world of Shadowrun making it one of the best modern iterations of a classic game series I have ever had the pleasure to step into.Now let's saunter on over to the lore of the game, which is built upon the original Pen and Paper title and the superb yet confusing NES and Genesis title, not to spoil anything too major but the entire world has been changed massively by an event called the awakening and yea, you know what just go read up on everything else.The gameplay is another area I want to cover as the game plays like an Turn Based Roleplaying Game, now the game comes with one preinstalled mission which is actually quite huge but there are a lot of player made missions on sites like NexusMods and even on the workshop itself add on the beautiful levelling system which stops you becoming extremely over powered early and you have fantastic gameplay.But I don't think the game is one hundred percent perfect, the preinstalled story called Dead Mans Switch, unfortunately feels undercooked and doesn't pull off the gritty superb story I expected in short your friend is killed and he hires you post death to find and kill the drek that killed him, I'm not gonna spoil anything but I thought the end villain was weak and uninteresting when they could've done something great with an established character from the beginning.I also shouldn't forget the DLC Dragonfall which in and of itself adds much more to the world and is it's own excellent piece of content adding new characters and more awesome story development.to test my new scoring system I give this 4 stars or a That's Grand LadLook forward to more reviews that hopefully don't sound too pretentious or crap "

My one comment is that it is at heart (IMHO) a tablet game. I am constantly aware of how much more I want the game to do and be.  That doesn't detract from what it is.   And it gives me high hopes for what the company is working on now.  If you like the genre and want to play an rpg on a tablet, it is a great game!

												Almost a perfect title.First off, the focus on the editor and the ""module"" approach to the campaign made me think of neverwinter nights (the first one). The fact that the game focused on being highly expandable and customizable made me more forgiving of the campaign's shortcomings.That being said, the game's pretty good, but still lacking. Some of it in terms of interface, some in terms of design (gameplay). Please note, I played on normal difficulty. The storyline is quaint, the visuals are detailed, and flow overall is smooth and enjoyable.1) With all the awesome artwork, the protagonist visuals were extremely boring, whatever look I had in mind for my hero was nowhere to be found in the portrait collection. I just gave up in the end and went with a whatever-approach.2) The chapter oriented campaign moves the story along nicely, but the linearity(sp?) of the game was disappointing, if you didn't manage your resources well, it's gone. This includes karma (xp).3) Moving around when there's no (immediate) combat in combat mode is a chore.4) Too many illusionary dialogue choices. Great, but acknowledging it was also an acknowledgement of it's extremely linear gameplay design (like combat, progression, resource allocation and game balance).Ultimately, I think if they fixed a few things, this title would have a been a true A+, and fans would be clamoring for a sequel like crazy. Unfortunately, in it's current state, it's a great experiment to the throwback that is the shadowrun RPG, but that's all.Maybe some mods would've helped, but the online presence for the game wasn't really there like other games neither. Hopefully they'll come out with some improvements in due time, if not a sequel.			"

												Well, where do I begin? I'll start by saying the developers really did the Shadowrun name a lot of justice with this release. Basically a party-based tactical RPG set in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. It really nails that futuristic, dystopian vibe I look for in this type of story. The gameplay is very enjoyable and you'll have a lot of fun leveling up your character in the main campaign. The options for character development and customization are pretty solid.My only complaint is - the main campaign is too short. Sure, you can get Dragonfall (the expansion) for another $15, and that is much bigger than the original campaign... but the stock capaign just sort of disappointed me. I also felt like it was a bit too linear. I was expecting a LOT more side-missions and stuff like that to help me develop my character before the endgame. I wouldn't let that deter you from buying the game, but I would set aside a little extra money for that expansion - first.Some would argue that the Workshop has player-made campaigns in case you get bored with the one that comes with the game, but I find it tedious sifting through mountains of crap to find a decent player-made campaign. Most of them suffer from the ""Oh here's part 1....part 2.... part 3... And you have to download them all seperately.. oh but im not done with part 4, and I quit working on it cause I got bored.."" It's just annoying. Same thing as most any game that comes with a toolkit... most of the player developed content is half-arsed.Anyway, I don't want the review to sound too negative because I actually did really enjoy the 20+ hours I've spent with Shadowrun Returns, and I'd recommend it to my friends - As long as they can afford to buy Dragonfall with it.

Possibly higher. I had a deliberately less than optimal build for RP reasons (I wanted to max out Charisma) and didn't find the game too tough.			"

												This is a game that could have been so much more. I love the setting and I think that for the most part they did a great job creating the world. However while it looks great it often feels like a set rather than a living city. Every place you go plays out more or less the same. Click the 2 or 3 people with talk symbols over their head, look for the 1 or 2 items that you can click on the map somewhere, fight a few guys, leave area. I like the world, I want to be able to go around and explore it and have a reason to do so. Even if it is just flavor text like ""You see a grimy computer terminal, you can tell it has been well used"" for example. I want to be able to go around and look at everything and just explore. The world graphics are great for the most part. There are a few things that really take me out of it like the quick loop of papers blowing in the wind over and over. The birds that fly off when you walk by are great though. My biggest gripe with the graphics is that the characters rarely look anything like their super awesome avatar pictures. I see a big orc character and when I walk up to him his avatar picture is of a skinny orc. The avatar picture I made for my guy is very thin but his character model is chunky with a way different head. Just pulls me out of the story. I like the story and I like the characters. It was well written and kept me interested. Even the loading screen text telling me about the place I was heading was great. I do wish that there was less travel here travel there though. I just get interested in an area and nope off to the next place. Maybe if rather than quick traveling everywhere there were inbetween areas with optional side stuff to do then all the traveling around would feel more cohesive. I have not played the official DLC mission yet so maybe they fixed some of my problems with it. Despite the problems, I do recommend the game if for nothing else other than the story and great setting. I really hope we get something more expansive in this universe someday though.  "

Did you ever wish you could just walk around punching people? Then you want to play this game, because you can do all of that here. Inset your mind into computers. Use your mind to control machines.... that shoot people with you? Did i mention walking around as a 7'+ troll punching people?Buy this game.			"

												If you're looking for a gritty turn-based strategy game in a similar vein to that of XCOM or Omerta, then this is your game. It's set in a dystopian future, the game merges fantasy races into a human world with a cyberpunk setting. The plot has you constantly moving from action to action in what starts out as a simple detective story, but quickly changes gear into a much deeper, darker plot.The game is fun. I recommend it and rate it 8/10.			"

												The story, definitely. Plenty of twists and turns. I daily kept coming back to play the game. I was saddened that I finished it in 13 hrs+ but I'm definitely getting dragonfall? the expansion. And then there's a Steam Workshop for this game! The guns for this turn based rpg do so make a satisfying boom, at least for me. I was also really pleased that I could customize my character the way I wanted. I started as a non magical street samurai but I got enough points over the course of the game to specialize in another skillset as well. You can go into spellcasting, summoning, cyberdecking or drone rigging. If it isn't obvious by now, I like this game.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a game I find hard to give excessive praise, but it's a game that I also find hard to dislike. When it comes down to it, it's a completely solid game, even if it's shallow. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and feel fully satisfied with the experience, and I didn't have any trouble playing all the way through. There are certainly some notable flaws, however.Let's start with the story, since this game relies heavily on it's writing to motivate the player. The writing and characterization is good, I felt very absorbed in the universe, but the story itself is fairly lacking. It's a shame as well, it starts out great. You got a murder mystery with a lot of interesting faces dying to be talked to, with a few twists and turns here and there. The problem is that it just doesn't developed. It feels extremely rushed. The characters are lovable and relatable to the very end, but I started skipping through dialogue that dealt with the actual plot about 2/3rds through the game. It escalates in a comical direction, with an extremely weak and one-dimensional villian. It's extremely predictable, and just plain boring. The last stretch is so typical and lackluster that I had little to no investment in the actual plight, I just wanted to see if the characters would drop some more interesting backstory about themselves. It gave me closure, but it's not memorable at all. It's just too bad, the beginning was really good, but the plot started going so fast in such a linear direction that it forgot to flesh itself out, leaving some questions unanswered and plot points underdeveloped. It got the job done, but I was hoping for more.Where the game really shines are the characters and their own personal issues. Almost all the staple characters have their own personal motives and vendettas, and I was interested in all their stories. I enjoyed going back to base and talking to every single one of them that were willing to open their mouths. The game does a fantastic job of setting up this belonging feeling, that you're part of this organization of runners. Although, as I stated before, as the game escalates it leaves behind this deep characterization in order to fawn over its own hilariously absurd and out-of-place world-threatening dilemma.The combat is serviceable. It's ultimately shallow and linear, there isn't a lot of variation or depth, and there are some balance issues. But it's still fun, you get to characterize some characters simply by their fighting styles. It's too easy as well, but not game-ruiningly so. It's fun, if you really like X-COM-like turn based combat, you'll probably enjoy it if you can stand it being a tad shallow.The game is overall fun, I would recommend it. It doesn't really have any offending flaws, it just doesn't quite reach the large potential it could've. It's not particularly memorable, but it's enjoyable. I would wait for a sale, but when the price is suitable to you, I'd say to go for it just to get immersed in the world.			"

												A good old school RPG with tactical battle. True (as much as it can) to the univers of Shadowrun (cyperpunk). Sadly the game is very short - which mean not a lot of different skills & weapons, and it don't take full oportunity of the wonder that is the matrix.To really enjoy the game, you're going to have to use the mods and campaigns created by other players - or create them yourself !In short : good game, worth it's price (especially if you play mods), but the main campaign fail to use the game mechanisms to its fullest.

												The game story and mechanics seems rushed however, the graphics were quite nice and a little too ""fluffy"" for this style of game.  The music, not a fan, it still lingers in my head after the game crashes or I die and have to go back to that base to redo many lost hours of gameplay.  I HATE HAVING TO DO THINGS TWICE BECASE OF CHEAP DEATHS!  Cheap deaths are understandable as they make you re-strategize...but it wouldn't of been so bad EXCEPT not being able to save whenever you want was very annyoing.  The game did have tense moments mostly because I was afraid to die because I didn't to have to replay the entire mission.  The game seemed to have a tutorial guided aspect...go here and click this.One thing I did like, irrigardless what I stated above, was the story.  I found it interesting and kept playing to see what was going to come next.  The added dark humor was relavent to its style and I enjoyed it.			"

I purchased this to determine whether I would be interested in buying the 5th edition tabletop RPG book in preparation for Gen Con 2014 in August.

Not necessarily something as expansive as Skyrim or Gothic 3 but it just feels like you're being led from one room to the next and occasionally there are some puzzles to solve or people to fight. It is fun, and the DLC improves it a lot which is why I recommend it. Just would have liked more.			"

The main story is a bit linear but there is a lot of potential here!Edit: Dragonfall is a huge improvement in terms of storytelling and mechanics.  I recommend it even more and what I said in my original review was true.  The game is now becoming what it set out to be.  Tons of user generated content plus the new campaign makes this a must play if you like Shadowrun, Cyberpunk, or Tactical RPGs in general.

												The game is not perfect. There are some real problems with it, but, despite that, I'd still recommend it to anyone who's thinking of giving it a chance. Gameplay is linear and there are some inherent flaws in the design, for instance the tendency of attacks to roll Missed despite your actual stats. If I did a count, I'm fairly sure the number of times the characters missed surpass the times they actually land a hit. It got ridiculous to the point that I'd get misses 3 times in a row at point blank range. This makes for very frustrating play especially at the endgame portion. There's also an impression of unbalanced design considering that certain builds came off more useful than others. Party members builds seem to have no impact either outside of battles and a certain plot mission. I could have a decker in my party but not be able to do any side decking other than what was neccesary to move the game forward, it made party build up rather pointless and lackluster. On the upside, it's rather well-written and the characters in-game are rather engaging and interesting. I'm not too familiar with the Shadowrun tabletop but I am a fan of the setting. You can see much effort has gone into the game and the end result is rather polished. The game is, overall, a good effort from an indie developer and while not great, is a decent experience and has lots of potential for the future.			"

The GoodFor me the biggest best part about this game is that it's Shadowrun, and I love Shadowrun.  And I mean this is actual, proper SR too, not like some of the dribble that's carried the SR name in the past.  It's made by some of the folks who created SR in the first place, and it definitely shows by how deeply entwined with the actual lore it is.  If you like - or, like me, love - SR, you owe it to yourself to get this game.But that's not all!  The writing is top notch, with great characters and a great story with lots of neat twists and turns.  The art is beautiful, making the game look like a painting come to life.  And the turn-based tactical combat - while not exactly original - is very well-executed and fun to play.Further, it's set up so you can make your own campaigns, which is pretty dang cool in my book.The BadThough I understood pretty much everything that was going on in the story, understanding almost every reference and technical term that came flying my way, I'm not entirely certain it would be nearly as accessible for anyone who doesn't already know the SR rulebooks forwards and backwards or is at least somewhat familiar with the setting.  This may be a foundless fear, but I figure I should mention it just in case.Character stats were greatly simplified from the original systems, and even compared to at least one of the previous SR video games, which I do understand to a degree.  But I feel they may have simplified a little bit too much, and would have welcomed a little more depth.  That may be just me being a rules lawyer, tho'.OverallIf my comments above don't speak plainly enough for themselves, I don't really have much bad to say about this game, but I fully realize that that might simply be my own pro-Shadowrun bias.  The game does have its faults, and I do wish it had a bit more depth than it does, but overall I feel that its pros far outweigh its cons, so I feel very confident in recommending it to folks.  And if you can, play the SNES and Genesis games first!			"

												I'm new to the franchise but I love anything with a TTRPG feel. I haven't finished the game yet. It's hard not to compare this to Fallout 2. I think if you enjoyed that game you'll like this.Pros:+great writing, a joy to read+satisfying gun sounds imho+great art/character designs, armor not so much+allows class mixing based on skills+every class has something useful. it's worth it putting something into magic just to have access to the basic healing spell or charisma to avoid conflict+Good soundtrack that can get stuck in your headMeh:*kind of have to look up a lot of stuff *I play fairly frugally but still struggle with money. I probably hire too many mercenaries though but I have very little money for consumables after upgrading weapons and armor.*scalable difficulty in options menu*no voice acting*from a lore perspective, they really crammed as many tropey things [things overused in fiction] in as possible (hacking/cyberpunk, spirits, zombies, high fantasy races, magic, ninjas, etc.). It doesn't take anything away from the experience though. I'm nitpicking.Cons:-decking/matrix stuff doesn't show up until half-way through; essentially making a class fairly useless until then (and where I am currently, since). I recommend mixing it with another class. EDIT: I've since beat the game. Roughly 3/4 through, Decking becomes very useful in taking over turrets. Basically every class has the option of adding a key tactical option a some point in the campaign.-not much lore available in-game-VERY linear for an RPG but has a good amount of length for the $4 I spent on it.-some character(s) forced on you for missions aren't nearly as good as hired mercenaries. *cough* Coyote *cought* How can you miss that many time in a row at point blank with a fragging shotgun?!.... *cough* excuse me...

												I've never played the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, those aren't my bag. I did love the Shadowrun game on SNES that I played as a kid. This game brings a good blend of nostaglia for that previous title in a similar, but updated look, but it definitely also takes advantage of lessons learned in gaming in the intervening years. Combat in both the real world and while dekking is intuitive and easy to grasp. There are a number of skill tree options to monkey with, but not so many as to require a spreadsheet. Overall I found the game to be a satisfying experience, not terribly difficult, but that's not what I was looking for here anyway. Good times, definitely worth picking up if you enjoyed the old SNES game or the trailer to this one appeals to you.			"

												The Dead Man's Switch(DMS) campaign is forgettable and is only notable for having an annoying enemy that can only be killed with a cumbersome mechanic. There are a handful of interesting interactions during DMS but overall its honestly not worth playing through and can be easily skipped.Dragonfall(DF), on the other hand, is awesome and is filled with characters and scenarios that are as imaginative, well written,  and worth exploring as some of the best RPGs that I have ever played. DF additionally contains a much better structure than DMS, by that I mean rather than having a linear quest with hardly any side branches that you undertake with some flavorless NPCs, DF tasks you with a central goal and allows you to lead a team of fairly unique characters along a questline that has scores of opportunity to explore more of the world of Shadowrun. I enjoyed the vast majority of my time with DF, save for the hacking bits (called decking in this universe), and some later game fights with some annoyingly powerful enemies. Altough, I wholeheartedly recommend DF, Its a shame that you have to buy both to play DF but since thats the case I would advise that you buy the campaigns at a reduced cost and skip DMS.			"

												A fine game, however...There are many differences between a video game RPG and a tabletop RPG run by a GM. A video game RPG we expect certain conventions: random battles to raise XP, walking around a fixed location until we're ready to proceed with the story, and freedom to explore the entire world to a certain point.In a tabletop RPG, it's almost the opposite: random battles are tedious and most battles are relevant to the plot in some way, you're expected to keep to a timetable to follow the plot, and you probably won't revisit areas you've already visited except for a 'safe house' or two.What we have here is a video game RPG that acts like, plays like, and runs like a tabletop RPG! There are no random battles, and world exploration is very limited. Side quests are (generally) done immediately when you get them or not at all. There are no obvious good/bad dialogue choices that alter an unseen scale that judges your 'morality'. What we instead have is a very intriguing, atmosphere-driven game with a tightly-focused plot and tactical combat which feels very tabletop-ish.I enjoy Shadowrun, but I've also played the tabletop RPG and enjoy the setting. A person who buys this expecting something like a Bioware rpg or Skyrim is going to be very disappointed. But if you're willing to give it a chance, the atmosphere and writing will immerse you easily.And there's a game editor. So you can probably make your own game, if you think you could do better.			"

												Ah Shadowrun, I'll start off by saying this: If you're into the Shadowrun universe and games like UFO: XCOM, then chances are that you'll really like Shadowrun returns.That said, I do have some issues with the game. First and foremost, the music gets grading and tiresome fast. I've played the game for 9 hours and I had to turn the music off, they were clearly aiming for a dark electronic ambience and they do achieve it, but there are simply not enough tunes and a few of them simply sound too much alike.A second point that I feel must be made, is the fact that the game has cut a lot of corners when making the jump from pen & paper to video game. Shadowrun has always aimed for high realism, but this requires a lot of rules and a lot of depth. I understand that they had to cut a lot of these rules because otherwise nobody would've been able to play the game without 2 hours of tutorial, if not more.Third point, there are some issues when trying to select certain points to move to in the grid, so I suggest activating the double-click feature, which ends the miss clicks.Fourth point, the save system blows balls. The game will auto-save whenever you enter a new scene, but you are unable to manually save, this means that if you fail, you have to start all over from the very beginning of the scene, this can be especially tiresome if the encounter is 30 minutes long or you just leveled up before you died.Fifth point is mostly mechanical, but I still feel  it should be mentioned. There's an issue with scripted events that can ♥♥♥♥ you over; I'll try to explain it: When you move a character through a door and towards cover, the character will stop because and a little dialogue will play. Afterwards your character will be stuck where the dialogue started and if you're out of actions for said character, this can lead to them recieving a lead sandwich. Couple this with the fact that you're unnable to resurrect your main character if his HP hits zero and you can get rather frustrated. This wouldn't be half bad, but when you can resurrect side characters after they hit zero HP it just seems rather silly.And finally always remember:Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

												If you liked Xcom and Strategy this is for you. Although it only saves at the begining of the area it makes the game tougher and makes you think hard about your next move. Also with the user generated content from Backers of the Kickstater it has lots of replayability and hopefully more things will be added in the future.			"

												After much debate, well, not really, but I did wait a decent amount of time to play this title:  Shadow Run – Returns (http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650/), I gave it shot.  It’s about 15 hours’ worth of content and there doesn’t appear to be much in the way of quality DLC atm.   From a cost perspective, a dollar per hour of game play with a great story is money well spent.  It has a Fall Out 1 feel as it is turn-based, there are walls of text to read, and you can be a troll hacker that is more charismatic than an ancient vampire, with a data jack in his head.  In short, if you want a game that doesn’t demand too much of your PC or your time, and gives you a decent story to fall in love with, this game is for you.			"

												This game is legendary, I mean seriously, LEGEN-♥♥♥♥ING-DARY. The first campaign you have access to is deep, intense, and a whole butt-load of gore, you play this game, and you are guarenteed to enjoy this RPG to the max. Your mind-hole will implode at the sight of the glorious deaths of those who oppose you. Your life will be consumed after hours and hours of play, both content that was player-made and published by the creators. You will enjoy the many nods to the books from over the years, and the massive content and replayability of this game. You buy this game and it is really worth the dollars spent on it. The game lets you step into the role of any type of player you want, whether you use the premade ""bases"" for a character, or just make your very own, and put a twist to the classic role of a shaman, street Samurai, or Decker. You can approach situations through many different ways. You will enjoy this game.			"

												Cyberpunk is a genre as much built on the atmosphere as it is on the technology. Everyone has that formative memory of the giant advertisements and smog-belching smokestacks in Blade Runner, Some games make the mistake of keeping the slums out of the cyberpunk, but Shadowrun Returns has the formula down just right: ""high tech, low life."" The game is a fun return to an earlier era for me, given my experience with the tabletop game - but the experience is fluid and accurate, reminding me of so many times spent around a table being suspicious about your Fixer or the latest contact you made.The gameplay can be somewhat halting and awkward at times - a concession to make in order to accommodate the system itself, of course - but it doesn't diminish the enjoyment of this authentic cyberpunk game. Combat is strategic, if somewhat sparse on detail, and emphasises the differences in roles within the party itself. The decking is sadly quite anaemic compared to the tabletop world, a blue-gridlines re-creation of the combat systems, with Agents standing in for Spirits, and spells replaced with Decker attacks. Nonetheless, it rounds out the flavour of the game well.If you're looking for an engaging Cyberpunk story, with a dash of magic and plenty of political intrigue and conspiracy, I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns.

												It's been a while since I last played a classic, turn-based RPG - and when I say a while, I mean the likes of Forgotten Isles. So picking up this game was quite refreshing for me since most titles nowadays are all high energy ball-busting action. It would also be right to say that I don't have past references to any other Shadowrun titles, so my impressions here are purely stand-alone.Putting it simply - I'm quite impressed. Let me get to some of the simple points that make this title a gem:Writing: The narrative is well written albeit some ""street"" language that sometimes sticks out badly. The sights and sounds (as though these were not enough) of apocalyptic Seattle is well supported by transition build ups and some witty dialogue.Role-playing Mechanics: The game mechanics builds its own simple character customization. You only really get to build your main protagonist via a simple characteristics points system. You simply have to progress through the story to earn your points and design a character from a set number of characteristics. The game builds on several archetypes but does not restrict a player into any cookie-cutter format. (Check out the Nephilim Network to get some quirky combination inspirations.)Setting: Explore an apocalyptic Seattle teeming with classic RPG lore races, armed to the teeth with Guns, Cybernetics and Magic. Timelessness is often a great appeal to any story, and this title just has the right mix.Art and Music: While being somewhat leaning towards cartoon-like, the world of Shadowrun Returns is beautifully crafted. The city sprawls are rich in detail. On the one hand you will be running around streets blaring with neon signs and shop fronts. But on another, you get to traverse dark alleys, dimly lit halls of medical facilities and cult complexes to uncover the mystery that drives the campaign. This is supported by pulses of techno music transitioning into eerie fantasy sequences. Of course the game is not without its faults. While dialogue and the story telling are well written, character focus seems to be lacking since most often than not you will be running around the sprawl with game-generated Shadow Runners. True, there are some key NPCs that you get to interact with but the times can be very short and too far in between for such a short campaign. Inventory system may need a bit of a re-work but nothing too major to murder the experience. I've read some concerns about saving games but I've hardly found it an issue - so maybe they have fixed this one already. My only suggestion really right now is you might want to try starting a game at a much higher difficulty level. I'm currently running with a Decker at the moment in Normal setting, and it seems like a cake walk - what more if you go for the more heavy hitting classes? By no means is the game perfect - it has a few rough edges but it definitely delivers the merchandise well. If you feel like slowing down a bit, go out of the usual, this read & click title might do the thing for you.			"

												If you liked the table top game, or any table top game... then buy this game.  The graphics are...ok... the gameplay is good... but the story is fantastic.  It felt simultaneously home grown and professionally constructed. I felt like I was at a table game, participating in one of the mostl finely constructed stories I had ever played.  It starts small, with a seemingly inocuous event and ends huge.  The story is a work of art.  And speaking of works of art...  The mod tool is one as well.  Included is a single tool with which to build your own stories. It's powerful, easy (enough) to use, the tutorial videos are great, and it includes tons of assets. All in all it's really smart.  Which is going to be my final review for this game.  Shadow Run: Returns... Smart.			"

												Shadowrun. I picked up the Pen and Paper RPG when I was younger. Sadly it took years before finding a group to play it. Luckly around my University years I found a decent group of people and we are gaming since than. I am an hardcore fan so probably my Review could be a bit biased. Frist of all I strongly suggest to read a bit before gaming. Just the ""Primer"" which is a small guide\introduction to the World of Shadowrun available from the site Shadowrun Universe (official site for all things related to Shadowrun). Once you have the Primer you can have a good idea of what to expect from the Setting. I know that at a frist glance it looks strange maybe even too much but trust me it is awesome. The more you will dig the better it will get, specially if you start to read the various RPG manuals and novels. If you liked the setting buy this game. The basic Campaign included in Shadowrun Returns is a classic. If you never rped or played Shadowrun (I am mostly referring to SNES and GENESIS Games) this is a wonderfull start. The narration is set in 2050s which is a very cool period for Shadowrun (keep in mind that in the current RP Setting the time is around 2075) and it is based on some of the hottest plots of that period. The game is a basic Turn Based Combat with RP elements in the form of dialogues where the various options depends on which skill you have. Back when it was just published the Game lacked few things like save anywhere option. Luckly this was fixed up in the 1st DLC Dragonfall. Dragonfall is even better than the basic game. The Devs listened to us Players and fixed few things and I dare to say even took inspiration from some of UGC - User generated Content (More of this later). Dragonfall can look a bit boring at the start with the logic of ""Do a Run, get back and run again"" (Run is a work, a mission in Shadowrun) but the Narration, the Plot goes always up till its end. In Dragonfall I was not impressed by the first Runs but nearby the end I could not stop to see how this Story was going to end. The only negative side of both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall is that you can not manage your NPCs. You can select who can help you in a Run but you do not have any kind of control on their Skills and how they improve. Probably this will be fixed in future DLCs. If the basic game and the DLC are not enough there are UGCs. Shadowrun Community is very active and Devs select from time to time some UCG to play just to show up how much it is good. There are a lot of good Artist out there who are working on big UCG like remakes of SNES and Genesis Shadowrun Games. I strongly suggest to take a loot at ""Shadowrun Unlimited"". I hope all of this makes sense. In any case, if you start to play and dig into the Shadows of Shadowrun remember: ""Shoot straight, conserve your ammo and never make a deal with a Dragon"".			"

												Ive been fan of the Shadowrun ever since i first played on the Genesis and Snes and was glad to see a new iteration of it come out. The game still follows all of it rules and has a great look and story that fits the Shadowrun world great.While I still do recommend the game to fans of the Shadowrun world, it does have some really bad bugs / glitches still and wouldnt recommend it unless you love the shadowrun series.Fans of the first two fallout games might find some interest in this title as well since the combat sytem is set up very similar,although a  buggy (almost feels incomplete) version of it.Just an example of a few combat bugs to give people an idea of what thier getting into.A bug for shamans where when you summon a spirit which will cause the combat system to break and not be able to use or select any of characters during youre turn and basicly forcing you to forfeit the rest of your turn which will most likely cause a death of one of your runners.Another bug is where and enemy attacking you will shoot you through walls while you not only cannot shoot because of line sight issue and wont be able to even see the enemy untill you run around the wall.A bug where when you try to heal your drone out of combat it will say immune not heal your drone and use a repair kit.So I would say a good game for the price if your a fan of the series but if not I would probaly skip over this one.

												Really a big fan of turn-based RPGs since Fallout and Fallout 2 as well as a fan of the pencil and paper, table-top RPG game. The description and reviews are fairly accurate. The thing that really hooked me was when the game was approaching a foreseeable ending and then took a left turn at Crazy Street. Totally surprised me in a good way and extended the gameplay by a couple of hours. Looking forward to replaying as a different spec character to see if there are any other twists that I missed. After that, it's some serious contemplation on whether to buy the DLC or venture off into the user created material that seems to be free of charge. All in all, a fun, solid game with unexplored aspects awaiting.			"

												Shadowrun Returns lives somewhere between a point-and-click adventure and a tactical RPG like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but the lack of voice acting and completely linear plotline makes everything seem unfinished. However, once you accept the forced march through story, it's actually pretty well-written and the combat is fun. Just expect everything to be a dime short of a dollar--this game has all the hallmarks of a project that ran out of money too soon. However, since this game is modular and easily modded (http://www.nexusmods.com/shadowrunreturns), it may improve over time.The first story module that comes with the game, Dead Man's Switch, is not quite as interesting as the first DLC module: Dragonfall.TL;DR: If you enjoy turn-based, three-quarter RPGs such as Fallout 2 and Baldur's Gate 2, you may enjoy this one, especially if it's in the $5-10 range.

												I've never even heard of the Shadowrun universe before I got this game. But, it is definitely one of the better indie games around, and it really brings back memories of great games like Planescape Torment, Fallout, Baldurs Gate etc (Triple A titles in their day). But, since I'm not a ""Shadowrun fan"" I have no idea how close this game is to the Pen and Paper version. What I can tell you is that whatever is in the game, works nicely in my opinion.Warning - it's not ""3D"" in the sense that you can't rotate camera around. It really plays like the old games mentioned above - 1 fixed perspective only. What you can do is zoom in and out, that's it. The main campaign is pretty interesting, and a minor plot twist (ok I didn't see it coming), but the best thing about this is that there is an EDITOR included! That means users are free to create and share (or ""mod"") this game. I am sure, in time, the mods will rival that of Skyrim :) "

												The base game is decent; the DLC is very good. Base game introduces you to all the game mechanics and is a good if not particularly deep game. The DLC on the other hand has a great plot that lends credibilty to the various runs your crew goes on, some great twists and turns, er, and also has some battles that are (potentially) cruelly unfair, awful, and frustrating.I just had trouble with the one battle, but I read that others had trouble with one or two others. I expect that it depends on play style and the party you bring. The battles often have some sort of interesting twist or surprise that makes them really interesting, but depending on your party and playstyle the same twist can make it very frustrating instead. Maybe the occasional rage quit is the price you pay for the cool surprises. :)In summary:  a) strongly recommended, worth buying just to play the DLC, and b) AUGH. AUGH AUGH AUGH. AUGH MMMWAAAH! AUGH! DIE! DIE! DIE! KILL! WHY AM I DOING THIS TO MYSELF? ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN??? OK calm down, let's try it again.Four stars. A generally great game and totally worth your money. Expect 1 (and possibly 2  or 3 depending on what party you bring) really unfair battles in the DLC. :)  No, really, it's a little frustrating, but you care because it's good. Just buy it.			"

												This is a great game!Sadly the AI is weak, but I always liked the SR-setting and this game puts some effort that you can ""feel"" the world arround you.The Dead Mans Switch is the less good, but it shows great the bug-plague, that harrasses the world of Shadowrun.Dragonfall is one of the best rpg-campaigns I played for long. Of course your actions don't really change the storyline, but I allway liked interactive books, and thats it.The whole game is a little bit of anachronistic I think, but it does not loose by that. In my humble opinion this is even better, because this way they told two beautiful stories and created a game that does give Shadowrun the tactical feeling I allways felt wenn playing on the table.So I hope there will be som AI-fixes for the higher difficulties.

												I have really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns! It is well written, both the original story (Dead Man's Switch) and the DLC (Dragonfall) were very enjoyable adventures. The graphics are nice and the combat is engaging.I thought the price was very reasonable for all that you received. On top of this there is an active community adding new content. If you like Shadowrun the RPG, or a mix of modern and magic and turn-based games then I whole-heartedly reccomend this game.			"

												Ok so i had never heard of shadowrun, not the Table game, books or the Vid-games, but got intrested when i saw the game show up on the store slider page and reading the description about the sci fi, cyberpunk, fantasy mix and seeing i had the funds sitting in the wallet thought i might aswell give it a go. I loved the setting & story the diffrent ways you can play depending on the characters and abilitys you choose to specilise with to get through the game, the first story 'deadman's swtich' was enjoyable but on replay i did notice what other people mentioned how there wasent much exploreing or side quests branching from the main plot as it throws you down the main story but all the same was enjoyable. the second story thats out however was a massive imrpovement 'Dragonfall' you're responcible for a whole area of people each character has their individual storys, there's many sidequests that branch off the main plot, and the choices you make can effect various details through the later game.In short i thought this game was great! and has replay value though mainly with the 'dragonfall' campaign, the graphics aint the most amazeing thing but i couldent care less!, i preffer games that are enjoyable, have good story & content. I strongly recomend this game to any rpg fans & anyone who enjoys good storylines in sci fi settings. :)			"

And here it is, in a lovely isometric strategy game.The writing is golden, just as FASA's source material always has been. The world is a lovely shade of dire, where everyone is likely to put a manabolt in your back and every terminal could fry your gourd with some Black IC. And HareBrained Schemes was nice enough to toss in a level editor, just in case you feel froggy enough to make your own tales.			"

												I am a huge rpg-geek, and for me story and the connection to ones character is one of the most important keys to a good game. I usually also is a so called graphic ♥♥♥♥♥, I have issues playing games if the graphics don't blow me away. This made me hesitant to buy Shadowrun Retuns, since I've had issues playing the early FallOut games (and they are great in all other aspects I love in a game). But I gave Shadowrun Returns a chance, and boy am I glad I did! It is a great old rpg with amazing atmosphere and the right amount of twist, reveals and epic to pull the player in. The graphics didn't bother me at all, the combat isn't to annyoing nor taking away from the story and it runs smooth. I reccomend it it to anybody wanting to play a nice cyberpunk rpg!			"

												If you're a fan of noir-style stories with twists and turns, tactical turn-based combat, or a fan of the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, this is probably a solid game for you. Played through ""Dead Man's Switch"" in about 10 hours. Good balance of exploration, dialogue, and combat. There were some things missing, though; the act of hiring teammates was cool, but you never interacted with them, which kind of sucked (some parts in the game led me to believe that it was originally there, but was cut). I also felt like my dialogue choices meant nothing to the outcome of the game, which pretty much goes against how tabletop RPGs work. Also, I think the Dragonfall DLC should be free, but I suppose I'm against paid DLC in general. Should you pay full price for this game? Yeah, I guess so. I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Shadowrun for me is filled with fond memories of tabletop gaming, and lazy weekends with people too clever by half for their own good. Thankfullly, that core is there, and the story they bundle with it is solid. The problem however, lies with the overall brevity of the content given. There are remarkable storytellers out there who have written, and continue to write stories in the setting, [Do browse the UGC for the game!] but the package as a whole for the average gamer may be a little underwhelming. Mechanically, the pieces are functional, and the experience in terms of actual gameplay is solid enough, but the pace of action and the lack of diversity in its approach may not seem the divine ambrosia to all. X-Com would be a fair parallel to make for the way the gameplay unfolds in action sequences. Character development allows for specilization, and divesification both, but can feel stiflingly slow compared to the glut of typical loot-and-shoot games. For players who like the idea of being able to poke a few buttons thoughtlessly, toss another point into ""strength"" and move on to the next fight, the system may prove unsatisfying. For players who constantly look at old saves and think ""What if I tried it with _____ build?"" the depth of variety allowed is a welcome change of pace.Graphically, there is a sense of ""days gone by"", I personally found myself filled with nostalgia for the classics. The atmosphere is there, in all its dirty, decayed charm, and the experience as a whole is such that no single part of the presentation is a jarring disconnect from the rest. At its core, it holds true to the experiences I remember as a tabletop gamer. I enjoyed and continue to enjoy it and do not regret the purchase.			"

												The first campaign, Dead Man's Switch, is pretty linear and predictable, but it serves as a basic introduction to the Shadowrun universe, with a lot of famous characters and locations.Dragonfall is a much, much better campaign, with a little bit of non-linearity and choices of outcomes.It's a very fun tactical turn based shooter, with a pretty reasonable point-based character generation system.The only downside is that matrix combat is boring and repetitive, and takes up a huge chunk of a lot of runs.

												A fine game, however...There are many differences between a video game RPG and a tabletop RPG run by a GM. A video game RPG we expect certain conventions: random battles to raise XP, walking around a fixed location until we're ready to proceed with the story, and freedom to explore the entire world to a certain point.In a tabletop RPG, it's almost the opposite: random battles are tedious and most battles are relevant to the plot in some way, you're expected to keep to a timetable to follow the plot, and you probably won't revisit areas you've already visited except for a 'safe house' or two.What we have here is a video game RPG that acts like, plays like, and runs like a tabletop RPG! There are no random battles, and world exploration is very limited. Side quests are (generally) done immediately when you get them or not at all. There are no obvious good/bad dialogue choices that alter an unseen scale that judges your 'morality'. What we instead have is a very intriguing, atmosphere-driven game with a tightly-focused plot and tactical combat which feels very tabletop-ish.I enjoy Shadowrun, but I've also played the tabletop RPG and enjoy the setting. A person who buys this expecting something like a Bioware rpg or Skyrim is going to be very disappointed. But if you're willing to give it a chance, the atmosphere and writing will immerse you easily.And there's a game editor. So you can probably make your own game, if you think you could do better.			"

												Ah Shadowrun, I'll start off by saying this: If you're into the Shadowrun universe and games like UFO: XCOM, then chances are that you'll really like Shadowrun returns.That said, I do have some issues with the game. First and foremost, the music gets grading and tiresome fast. I've played the game for 9 hours and I had to turn the music off, they were clearly aiming for a dark electronic ambience and they do achieve it, but there are simply not enough tunes and a few of them simply sound too much alike.A second point that I feel must be made, is the fact that the game has cut a lot of corners when making the jump from pen & paper to video game. Shadowrun has always aimed for high realism, but this requires a lot of rules and a lot of depth. I understand that they had to cut a lot of these rules because otherwise nobody would've been able to play the game without 2 hours of tutorial, if not more.Third point, there are some issues when trying to select certain points to move to in the grid, so I suggest activating the double-click feature, which ends the miss clicks.Fourth point, the save system blows balls. The game will auto-save whenever you enter a new scene, but you are unable to manually save, this means that if you fail, you have to start all over from the very beginning of the scene, this can be especially tiresome if the encounter is 30 minutes long or you just leveled up before you died.Fifth point is mostly mechanical, but I still feel  it should be mentioned. There's an issue with scripted events that can ♥♥♥♥ you over; I'll try to explain it: When you move a character through a door and towards cover, the character will stop because and a little dialogue will play. Afterwards your character will be stuck where the dialogue started and if you're out of actions for said character, this can lead to them recieving a lead sandwich. Couple this with the fact that you're unnable to resurrect your main character if his HP hits zero and you can get rather frustrated. This wouldn't be half bad, but when you can resurrect side characters after they hit zero HP it just seems rather silly.And finally always remember:Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

												First, an explaination: When you buy SHADOWRUN RETURNS, you get one campaign - ""Deadman's Trigger."" It's a solid introduction to the gameplay and story world. There's one additional campaign for sale from the studio - ""Dragonfall,"" which also adds some new items and gameplay functionality. Additionally, the game comes with a campaign editor, allowing you to create your own or download campaigns from others on Steam Workshop.In terms of gameplay, SR is basically a glorified point-and-click adventure, with XCOM-style turn-based combat added in. The combat is just solid enough to feel worthwhile, but otherwise this is the kind of game that lives or dies on the quality of the writing. Thankfully, both campaigns present some of the best character development and story writing I've seen in a videogame. Is it high-literature? No, but it's incredibly solid pulp-fiction and well worth the price of admission.			"

												Cyberpunk is a genre as much built on the atmosphere as it is on the technology. Everyone has that formative memory of the giant advertisements and smog-belching smokestacks in Blade Runner, Some games make the mistake of keeping the slums out of the cyberpunk, but Shadowrun Returns has the formula down just right: ""high tech, low life."" The game is a fun return to an earlier era for me, given my experience with the tabletop game - but the experience is fluid and accurate, reminding me of so many times spent around a table being suspicious about your Fixer or the latest contact you made.The gameplay can be somewhat halting and awkward at times - a concession to make in order to accommodate the system itself, of course - but it doesn't diminish the enjoyment of this authentic cyberpunk game. Combat is strategic, if somewhat sparse on detail, and emphasises the differences in roles within the party itself. The decking is sadly quite anaemic compared to the tabletop world, a blue-gridlines re-creation of the combat systems, with Agents standing in for Spirits, and spells replaced with Decker attacks. Nonetheless, it rounds out the flavour of the game well.If you're looking for an engaging Cyberpunk story, with a dash of magic and plenty of political intrigue and conspiracy, I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns.

It felt simultaneously home grown and professionally constructed. I felt like I was at a table game, participating in one of the mostl finely constructed stories I had ever played.  It starts small, with a seemingly inocuous event and ends huge.  The story is a work of art.  And speaking of works of art...  The mod tool is one as well.  Included is a single tool with which to build your own stories. It's powerful, easy (enough) to use, the tutorial videos are great, and it includes tons of assets. All in all it's really smart.

Even with 6 character archetypes to choose from, there is still an immense amount of customization that allows you to find your own playstyle.  Hats off to the dev team for a well polished, enjoyable experience with plenty of new features that still pulls off a nice tip of the hat to the old SNES classic.  This game is a must play.			"

												The classic 80s-90s vision of the cyberpunk future of the Shadowrun world is done serious justice by this game.  The art style and game mechanics and story all do a great job of pulling you into it even though there is no voice acting (prepare for a lot of reading).The turn based combat is slow paced but satisfying.  The character skill and equipment system is pretty robust.  So, there's definately room for replay variety but it would probably be boring to play through more than a couple times.  If you're a veteran of turn based combat games, I would suggest playing on a high difficulty.  I played the default normal setting and for the most part, combat was way too easy.All in all a pretty lesurely game and a bit nostalgic.  Keeping in mind how SR is setup more as a gaming platfom with systems in place for users to create their own stories and content, the lack of niceties like voice acting, variety of music and so on is forgivable.  This was definately worth the $4.99 I paid for it on Steam sale.			"

												It's not particularly elegant, nor is it going to bring in any fans who aren't already down with Shadowrun...but damn if this isn't what all of us fans have been waiting for.  An honest, interesting, and close look at the Shadowrun universe and the tools to tell our own stories and make our own content.  Amazing work from Harebrained.  For the price, I can't see why you wouldn't at least try it.			"

												The core campaign here, Dead Man's Switch, is awful.  It serves as an introduction to the mechanics and, to a much lesser extent, the setting of Shadowrun.  The DLC/expansion Dragonfall, however, is absolutely fantastic, and is completely unrelated to the core campaign.  It's one of the better written RPGs I've ever played.  The characters are great, the story is interesting, the decisions are difficult, and although the ""epilogue"" is a little weak, the overall ending was solid.  I heartily recommend Dragonfall to any RPG enthusiast and especially to anyone who has ever been curious to explore the Shadowrun setting.			"

												Overall great game! The fighting style is pretty close to that of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which is a win. The game requires a lot of reading to really get through the story and the decisions you make don't really seem to affect the outcomes any, which leads to a bit of a linear game. It is a great story and fun combat all around.			"

How they weave the storyline with only text and even though your choices don't hold any weight on how the story will unfold it all seems so natural.Recommended for players looking for guided story telling. In truth the game is very linear but that's okay in my book. The combat isn't as good as XCom of which it seems so similiar. A little unpolished but again the whole graphical style. Love the cyberpunk cross mythical world theme. Looking forward to playing more.			"

												I have finished both Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's Switch and Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall. What I can say is that I like both campaigns, but Dragonfall is the better out of the two (more cyberware, more options, bigger campaign in my opinion).After having finished Dragonfall, I can say that Dead Man's Switch was lacking a bit, and I most likely won't play it again. However, I would find myself playing Dragonfall again.So what I did not like was the lack of cyberware and game options, but the campaign was great. You should definitely play Dead Man's Switch before Dragonfall. I am hoping another DLC will come out soon. Another thing I did not like was that there were not any Mr. Johnsons, like there were in the Sega Genesis version. That, alongside a taxi system should be implemented in the next DLC (after Dragonfall).			"

												An RPG turn based tactical game about mercenaries in a world where cyberpunk and fantasy meet. If that sounds like fun, well try this game.The original campaign Dead man's switch is a noirish tale where you start at trying to find out who murdered your friend but you end up saving Seattle...as usually things go. This one campaign is included with the game and it is rather on the short side and linear BUT there are a few really good Workshop campaigns available for free and Dragonfall DLC, which I understand is much broader.And there's also the editor, so you can make your own characters, maps, missions and campaigns if you want.

So what do you  get in the game? Character building, Many choices that don't impact the story but the gameplay, silent charcters (To roleplay better?), A catchy background music and lore that don't make sense if you are not well wersed. (Tho they are as a sidenote in the game and not relevent for the game itself) This is a kickstarted game based on nostalgia and i (Who did not kickstared it and havent even heard of shadowrun before) got hooked.

Fascinating world, interesting characters, tactical enough combat, intriguing story. Would buy again.Edit after 12 hours into it: still loving it. It's a linear story, but there's enough illusion of choice that it doesn't feel linear. Protips:1. Do not give your hired shadowrunners anything cool because they keep it after the mission is over! 2. Don't bother with hiring a dedicated decker. The story so far has dropped a free pro-decker in my lap each time I've really needed one.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is so damn likable that it's easy to overlook how mediocre it can be. The user interface is cumbersome and frequently doesn't let you do what you'd expect it would. It's janky in the way that you remember crusty old PC games used to be, except it's not charming by today's standards. The default campaign: Dead Man's Switch is unflinchingly linear and the game has some odd hitching issues. But it's ****ing cyberpunk! Despite the fact that the story goes off the rails in a rather magnificent way, Shadowrun Returns stays true to the Gibson-esque tone that you want from a cyberpunk RPG and more to the point, a sequel to the original Shadowrun. The writing is what you want from a Shadowrun game. The combat is ersatz-XCOM Enemy Unknown. I'd have a hard time calling Shadowrun Returns great, but if you're as starved as I am for its specific brand of dystopia, it's a decent fix.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a game I find hard to give excessive praise, but it's a game that I also find hard to dislike. When it comes down to it, it's a completely solid game, even if it's shallow. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and feel fully satisfied with the experience, and I didn't have any trouble playing all the way through. There are certainly some notable flaws, however.Let's start with the story, since this game relies heavily on it's writing to motivate the player. The writing and characterization is good, I felt very absorbed in the universe, but the story itself is fairly lacking. It's a shame as well, it starts out great. You got a murder mystery with a lot of interesting faces dying to be talked to, with a few twists and turns here and there. The problem is that it just doesn't developed. It feels extremely rushed. The characters are lovable and relatable to the very end, but I started skipping through dialogue that dealt with the actual plot about 2/3rds through the game. It escalates in a comical direction, with an extremely weak and one-dimensional villian. It's extremely predictable, and just plain boring. The last stretch is so typical and lackluster that I had little to no investment in the actual plight, I just wanted to see if the characters would drop some more interesting backstory about themselves. It gave me closure, but it's not memorable at all. It's just too bad, the beginning was really good, but the plot started going so fast in such a linear direction that it forgot to flesh itself out, leaving some questions unanswered and plot points underdeveloped. It got the job done, but I was hoping for more.Where the game really shines are the characters and their own personal issues. Almost all the staple characters have their own personal motives and vendettas, and I was interested in all their stories. I enjoyed going back to base and talking to every single one of them that were willing to open their mouths. The game does a fantastic job of setting up this belonging feeling, that you're part of this organization of runners. Although, as I stated before, as the game escalates it leaves behind this deep characterization in order to fawn over its own hilariously absurd and out-of-place world-threatening dilemma.The combat is serviceable. It's ultimately shallow and linear, there isn't a lot of variation or depth, and there are some balance issues. But it's still fun, you get to characterize some characters simply by their fighting styles. It's too easy as well, but not game-ruiningly so. It's fun, if you really like X-COM-like turn based combat, you'll probably enjoy it if you can stand it being a tad shallow.The game is overall fun, I would recommend it. It doesn't really have any offending flaws, it just doesn't quite reach the large potential it could've. It's not particularly memorable, but it's enjoyable. I would wait for a sale, but when the price is suitable to you, I'd say to go for it just to get immersed in the world.			"

												I'm done with ""Dead Man's Switch"" and a few missions into ""Dragonfall.""tl,dr: Don't buy the game unless you buy Dragonfall with it.The combat is a bit simple, though turning up the difficulty helps immensely to provide a more engaging, complicated experience. It certainly doesn't feel like the fluidity one finds in a real tabletop game session, but then, to expect that from a computer game is usually folly.The heart, and meat, of the game is, rather, in its dialogue and world. For clarity, don't expect voice acting and animated cutscenes. It's more in the mein of the aging RPGs like Baldur's Gate, but even less frilly. Characters are rendered convincingly, and with their own authorial voices. The writing never worse than ""pretty good.""But where Dead Man's Switch (the base campaign) never gets far above pretty good, and maintains a dreary linearity at all times, Dragonfall excels. Dragonfall's characters and story are much more believably written, the world more flavorful, and the story less full of deus ex machina windfalls.Where Dead Man's Switch feels like a saturday morning cartoon, Dragonfall is more like a well-written, high-budget film. I might watch both, but you can be sure I'd much rather watch the latter.			"

												Hoy Chummers.Shadowrun Returns takes you through a solid introduction to the cyberpunk world of shadowrun where classic fantasy, (sword and sorcery) meets cyber enhanced super soldiers.  When I first saw that this game was going to be done I was afraid another company was going to screw it up the way Microsoft did when they failed making another game trying to use the Shadowrun name.    Thankfully this is not the case.  The first story deadman switch is a good solid introduction to the world of being a gun for hire.  While the story is largly liniar the additional content added by players adds vast replayability to the original quest and provides a huge amount of additional content. Dragonfall adds several more hours and more options for play as well.  Another thing that has been nice is that many of the bugs that are/were in this have been fixed.  So many products are released to die where this game has been continually updated to ensure problems when found are solved.  For RPG fans or those who remember playing one of the many table top cyberpunk games,  this is a great game worth every penny.			"

I love this game. They totally nailed it. Been on a break for awhile and I am looking forward to getting lost again in all the Workshop content which was pretty limited when I logged most of my hours. I paid nearly full price for the game and the Dragonfall expansion and regret nothing!			"

Pros The Cyberpunk-meets-Fantasy-Magic set in the real-world near-future aesthetic is great. The way the stats are balanced leaves the class-race combos open, and encourages exploration of different options/layouts. I just wish there was a way to respecc. Maybe there is later in the game. I love the tactical, turn-based combat.Cons The single angle of the camera gets a little annoying in combat; e.g. if you've got an ally standing directly beneath/infront of an enemy, you can accidentally target your ally because their hitbox overlaps the enemy's. If I could rotate the camera to a different angle, that'd solve my biggest gripe with the game The first campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is interesting, but rather slow-paced. Haven't tried the expansion campgain or any of the user generated content yet.All in all, it's a fun tactical, turn-based, text-driven RPG. The character creation options are pretty robust -- not so much in terms of appearances, but in terms of class selection and creation. It's easy to start out with one of the game's premade archetypes and expand out into other disciplines as you get the feel for the game, or to just stick with a single discipline. I don't know how well either works comparatively because I haven't played long enough. The story of the first campaign moves a little slow; they do a good job of tying the tutorial stuff into the story without breaking immersion, but that's kind of what slows it down.			"

												I am a big fan of table top RPGs but I was never into Shadowrun. I think Shadowrun returns is an excellent game in that it not only made me interested in trying Shadowrun the table top setting, but it was also an isometric view RPG when there have been so few. Games like Baulder's gate kick♥♥♥♥♥but so few are made. Shadowrun Returns not only delivered but offered a great price and the option for unlimited new content. I would recommend that the world become more open ended and that dialogue choices have more impact on the gameplay. Without those the game feels like a rail-road with no real consequences and that harms emersion. The good outweighs the bad and if this is just a start I can't wait to see what happens next. I will be paying attention to these guys for a while :)			"

After starting the game I realized there was a little lack of backstory and a bit of a learning curve, but after playing about 10 minutes I got a real grasp of it.  I started a new character (a more basic street samauri instead of Rigger.  I've played this game for a few days and have to say I love it! It's simple but rich.  The game plays and has the quality of the Baldurs Gate Series.  Get it, enjoy it, thank me!			"

I usually also is a so called graphic ♥♥♥♥♥, I have issues playing games if the graphics don't blow me away. This made me hesitant to buy Shadowrun Retuns, since I've had issues playing the early FallOut games (and they are great in all other aspects I love in a game). But I gave Shadowrun Returns a chance, and boy am I glad I did! It is a great old rpg with amazing atmosphere and the right amount of twist, reveals and epic to pull the player in. The graphics didn't bother me at all, the combat isn't to annyoing nor taking away from the story and it runs smooth. I reccomend it it to anybody wanting to play a nice cyberpunk rpg!			"

												If you're a fan of noir-style stories with twists and turns, tactical turn-based combat, or a fan of the Shadowrun tabletop RPG, this is probably a solid game for you. Played through ""Dead Man's Switch"" in about 10 hours. Good balance of exploration, dialogue, and combat. There were some things missing, though; the act of hiring teammates was cool, but you never interacted with them, which kind of sucked (some parts in the game led me to believe that it was originally there, but was cut). I also felt like my dialogue choices meant nothing to the outcome of the game, which pretty much goes against how tabletop RPGs work. Also, I think the Dragonfall DLC should be free, but I suppose I'm against paid DLC in general. Should you pay full price for this game? Yeah, I guess so. I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Shadowrun for me is filled with fond memories of tabletop gaming, and lazy weekends with people too clever by half for their own good. Thankfullly, that core is there, and the story they bundle with it is solid. The problem however, lies with the overall brevity of the content given. There are remarkable storytellers out there who have written, and continue to write stories in the setting, [Do browse the UGC for the game!] but the package as a whole for the average gamer may be a little underwhelming. Mechanically, the pieces are functional, and the experience in terms of actual gameplay is solid enough, but the pace of action and the lack of diversity in its approach may not seem the divine ambrosia to all. X-Com would be a fair parallel to make for the way the gameplay unfolds in action sequences. Character development allows for specilization, and divesification both, but can feel stiflingly slow compared to the glut of typical loot-and-shoot games. For players who like the idea of being able to poke a few buttons thoughtlessly, toss another point into ""strength"" and move on to the next fight, the system may prove unsatisfying. For players who constantly look at old saves and think ""What if I tried it with _____ build?"" the depth of variety allowed is a welcome change of pace.Graphically, there is a sense of ""days gone by"", I personally found myself filled with nostalgia for the classics. The atmosphere is there, in all its dirty, decayed charm, and the experience as a whole is such that no single part of the presentation is a jarring disconnect from the rest. At its core, it holds true to the experiences I remember as a tabletop gamer. I enjoyed and continue to enjoy it and do not regret the purchase.			"

												Shadowrun. I picked up the Pen and Paper RPG when I was younger. Sadly it took years before finding a group to play it. Luckly around my University years I found a decent group of people and we are gaming since than. I am an hardcore fan so probably my Review could be a bit biased. Frist of all I strongly suggest to read a bit before gaming. Just the ""Primer"" which is a small guide\introduction to the World of Shadowrun available from the site Shadowrun Universe (official site for all things related to Shadowrun). Once you have the Primer you can have a good idea of what to expect from the Setting. I know that at a frist glance it looks strange maybe even too much but trust me it is awesome. The more you will dig the better it will get, specially if you start to read the various RPG manuals and novels. If you liked the setting buy this game. The basic Campaign included in Shadowrun Returns is a classic. If you never rped or played Shadowrun (I am mostly referring to SNES and GENESIS Games) this is a wonderfull start. The narration is set in 2050s which is a very cool period for Shadowrun (keep in mind that in the current RP Setting the time is around 2075) and it is based on some of the hottest plots of that period. The game is a basic Turn Based Combat with RP elements in the form of dialogues where the various options depends on which skill you have. Back when it was just published the Game lacked few things like save anywhere option. Luckly this was fixed up in the 1st DLC Dragonfall. Dragonfall is even better than the basic game. The Devs listened to us Players and fixed few things and I dare to say even took inspiration from some of UGC - User generated Content (More of this later). Dragonfall can look a bit boring at the start with the logic of ""Do a Run, get back and run again"" (Run is a work, a mission in Shadowrun) but the Narration, the Plot goes always up till its end. In Dragonfall I was not impressed by the first Runs but nearby the end I could not stop to see how this Story was going to end. The only negative side of both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall is that you can not manage your NPCs. You can select who can help you in a Run but you do not have any kind of control on their Skills and how they improve. Probably this will be fixed in future DLCs. If the basic game and the DLC are not enough there are UGCs. Shadowrun Community is very active and Devs select from time to time some UCG to play just to show up how much it is good. There are a lot of good Artist out there who are working on big UCG like remakes of SNES and Genesis Shadowrun Games. I strongly suggest to take a loot at ""Shadowrun Unlimited"". I hope all of this makes sense. In any case, if you start to play and dig into the Shadows of Shadowrun remember: ""Shoot straight, conserve your ammo and never make a deal with a Dragon"".			"

												Ive been fan of the Shadowrun ever since i first played on the Genesis and Snes and was glad to see a new iteration of it come out. The game still follows all of it rules and has a great look and story that fits the Shadowrun world great.While I still do recommend the game to fans of the Shadowrun world, it does have some really bad bugs / glitches still and wouldnt recommend it unless you love the shadowrun series.Fans of the first two fallout games might find some interest in this title as well since the combat sytem is set up very similar,although a  buggy (almost feels incomplete) version of it.Just an example of a few combat bugs to give people an idea of what thier getting into.A bug for shamans where when you summon a spirit which will cause the combat system to break and not be able to use or select any of characters during youre turn and basicly forcing you to forfeit the rest of your turn which will most likely cause a death of one of your runners.Another bug is where and enemy attacking you will shoot you through walls while you not only cannot shoot because of line sight issue and wont be able to even see the enemy untill you run around the wall.A bug where when you try to heal your drone out of combat it will say immune not heal your drone and use a repair kit.So I would say a good game for the price if your a fan of the series but if not I would probaly skip over this one.

The thing that really hooked me was when the game was approaching a foreseeable ending and then took a left turn at Crazy Street. Totally surprised me in a good way and extended the gameplay by a couple of hours. Looking forward to replaying as a different spec character to see if there are any other twists that I missed. After that, it's some serious contemplation on whether to buy the DLC or venture off into the user created material that seems to be free of charge.

Each of the characters feel like people and even the slang used in the game that's unique to the world is easy to understand, even for someone who has never came into contact with it before.The artwork for the game is superb.  The game combines 3-D and 2-D elements in the form of painted portraits for most NPCs and the 3-D element of game play.  The world itself isn't very interactable, but it isn't necessary.The game play can get very static very fast, especially with combat.  Once you figure out that the AI is going to react certain ways and the trick to not getting your face blown off, it can get dull quickly.  It's absolutely worth finishing the game, however, as the story is fantastic.If you're a fan of Baulder's Gate, this game will remind you of it in its play style.			"

												Some 18 years removed from the cult following success of the arcade style, cartridge era rpg shadowrun games.  This title puts a new face on a Gen-X classic.  Not to say it is a remake, although it does incorporate some of the characters i.e. Jake and a few others.  This (Dead mans switch) is a brand new story set a few years after the events we played out back in the mid-1990's.  The graphics may not be state of the art and the over all game play is somewhat cell phone app lvl.  However it is LOADS of fun.  Highly addictive and the replay value is surprisingly high although I personally feel that they could have spent a bit more time on programming the sub-missions instead of over-dramatizing the whole wanna-be detective angle which is already well implied.  To sum up.  This is Shadowrun the way it was MEANT to be as a video game.  Not great.  Nor is it trying to be anything more than advertised.  If you want to run the shadows instead of just reading about it in yet another dusty but well written novel.  Then here is your interactive 'BTL' of choice.  True nuff!Jim Lost4daze1 @Yahoo.com "

												A unique and original combination of fantasy and sci-fi, Shadowrun Returns is an RPG with solid turn-based combat system, interesting setting and story, and a complex but easy to learn levelling system, using 'karma' to upgrade certain abilities. Though the game campaign is pretty linear, and there is only one campaign, there are lots of different player-made missions available to get through the workshop. Worth getting if you're into cRPGs and stuff			"

												Another recommendation for Dragonfall. The second campaign is placed in the flux state berlin. The setting in the ADL is way better for ""world shattering"" Campaign than Seattle and unleashes a great storyarc with countless additional information about the world of shadowrun. A great problem of shadowrun (pen and paper) is the world, which is always feeling the same way, even with all the options it has to offer. Berlin (ingame) is compensating this a bit but not much. It looks interesting and is more open than seattle. Still, it's far way from a open world. Harebrained Schemes your storytelling is already great and enough over the top, I would love if you start bringig more features to your game. More settings, more skills, more options. So please start hiring more programmers and more artist to create a deeper ruleset and more gameworld.At least, this is a recommendation! Go buy it, if you like cyberpunk, Shadowrun or a good written story. If you are not close with reading books or text in general, buy it for a good cause and just don't play it, there is no voice acting in this game for a reason!			"

												Shadowrun returns is a much-anticipated return to from for the often-maligned Shadowrun videogame series.  After the absurdly bad adaption as a first-person shooter under Microsoft's ageis, this game returns to the series' roots as a delightfully atmospheric adventure game.  Tactical turn-based squad combat is blended deliciously with punchy storytelling in the vibrant if dark and gritty 6th World.Really, I can't recommend this game any more highly.  Everything from the music, to the art, to the writing was nigh perfect.  As someone with over two decades of experience with the setting, getting to see stories well told in it was heartening, especially when familiar characters get to cameo.A solid purchase, with no regrets.

I started a new character (a more basic street samauri instead of Rigger.  I've played this game for a few days and have to say I love it! It's simple but rich.

Was an immensely enjoyable experience although I have to say that it was a bit too short :( and the expansion is pricey! If you were a big BG fan and loved picking up side quests, there aren't that many in this game unfortunately.It's a click heavy game and the mouse interface isn't as responsive as it should be but I think they're going to fix this in a new patch.Another great thing about the game is that it comes with a custom content editor. If you love RPGs with guns, magic, great graphics and good writing, this game is definitely for you.			"

												An outstanding RPG, particularly in the expansion campaign.  Old-school, to be sure, but the environment feels lived-in, the characters entertaining.  The dialogue trees allow for you to really get into the persona of your runner.  The combat is an interesting puzzle, but, as befits a shadowrunner, avoiding combat, or searching through the environment can be yet more engaging.  It already has a few excellent user-generated shadowruns (though, like anything that allows fan creation, there's drek out there as well), and the editor should allow for yet more in the future.  Strongly recommend.			"

												Highly reccomended, especially if you remember the paper n' pencil, SNES or Genesis games.  Turn based combat, but the use of cover makes for good strategy.  AI tends to target the player, and it's one of those 'if the player goes down you lose, regardless if someone could save said player' which is a stupid bit of design that's been accepted as industry standard.WARNING:  This is NOT a hand-holder, you CAN screw your build, and grinding is NOT an option.  Cash is scarce.  You must build practically, specializing in three areas:  Offence, primary role (this may be the same thing) and Survivability.  Think Fallout 1 & 2:  You can't do everything.  Thankfully, most of the time you can hire the help to do it for you.There's a few bugs here and there, and the system could use a bit of polish.  Firearms specialists feel a bit overpowered compared to mages, but make no mistake:  magic is invaluable and you'll always want at least one magic user of some sort.  Hires in Dead Man's Switch seem to have been built before the system was tested.Note that you won't likely to be able to recreate any characters from the paper and pencil game; the system just isn't the same.  Street Sam's can't have Wired Reflexes AND Dermal Plating for example, and the Wired Reflexes don't give extra AP passively like they did in previous editions.  Drain is replaced with cooldown (although casting from hitpoints remains an option).Once you get the hang of the system however, it's well worth it.  Strong builds are rewarding, and certain builds allow soloing runs on Normal, but you'll never get so powerful you can afford to get cocky.Fans of the console adaptions will be pleased, as there's plenty of shout-outs.  Highly replayable as well, due to the number of ways to solve situations depending on your build.ADDITIONAL EDIT:  I cannot recommend the Dragonfall DLC highly enough!  It includes several improvments in game design and having experience from the first game shows.  While Dead Man's Switch is definitely a love letter to the SNES/Genesis games, Dragonfall adds more depth to the characters and feels more like a true RPG with the ability to talk to a regular set of runners inbetween runs.  It is also a vastly more satisfying experience and well worth its price because it's basically a separate game entirely.			"

												Shadowrun is cyberpunk meets fantasy, all mashed together with the kitchen sink thrown in. Character classes include shamans (clerics), street samurai (fighters, melee or gun-based), mages, adepts (magical martial arts fighters), deckers (computer hackers) and riggers (who control drone robots). Player character races include humans, orcs, trolls (extra large orcs), elves and dwarves.The world includes lots of fantasy monsters from spirits and giant scorpions to great dragons, and also plenty of security personnel itching to die at your hands.Decking (computer hacking), and the way computers and the Internet work in general, doesn't make any sense at all. But this is totally consistent with the Cyberpunk genre, which was generally written by people with no real computer knowledge. Inside Cyberspace, you battle ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures) and even Black ICE (ICE that can kill you in real life).I've played through the original plot of Shadowrun Returns (Deadman's Switch) and also Dragonfall. I thought that both games had really engaging stories, and were generally well-paced, had good dialogue and interesting characters. The scenes and themes fit well with a cyberpunk ""high tech, low life"" motif.Dead Man's Switch was very linear, with little more than dialog choices (nice answer, neutral answer, mean answer). Playing it is a lot like reading a good book that has interactive fight scenes and some inventory management.Dragonfall was less linear, with some limited ability for the player to make world-changing choices. The important decisions are all made more toward the end of the game, though. This may annoy you, or you may like it because it gives you the chance to load your game and try a different ending with only 5 minutes more investment. Also, Dragonfall has much more lively NPCs, which makes for a game that feels a bit more social and less isolating.That having been said, it's great that the stories are good, but 90% of your time in the game will be spent in fights. Almost all of the skills that you increase with experience (which Shadowrun calls ""karma"") are combat skills, although they have some limited utility in conversation (especially Charisma). All the equipment is combat or quest related.In Shadowrun, the fighting is turn-based, with each character on a side getting a turn (with 2 or 3 Action Points) before the next side gets to act. The huge array of options can be overwhelming, especially at first. Fighting takes place in a large variety of locales and against a wide variety of foes. Sometimes your opponents get a surprise turn against you, which can be very annoying if your main character is squishy (has few HPs), as you see the entire enemy team attack your character (who is not under cover) before you get to act. I was once killed outright this way without even having a chance to react. Fortunately, I had an item that automatically resuscitated me.The fighting in Shadowrun Returns can get pretty repetitive fairly quickly, though. Once I figured out the ideal strategy (see next paragraph), it was just a question of repeating the same operations every fight. The same strategy works every fight. The only variation is a bit of difference in tactical positioning depending on how the enemy is approaching you and the layout of cover. Take cover, buff your main damage dealers, and kill your opponents. If your opponents bunch up use grenades and area effect spells against them. Rince and repeat.SPOILER WARNING the best strategy is to take a mage and buy spells that do area effect damage or reduce AP. In a 1v1 duel you can easily steal all of your opponent's AP and just damage them every turn without ever being hurt. Other viable options include a rifle/shotgun specialist or a high-Intelligence decker/rigger. The melee characters are particularly underpowered. Use shamans as support to boost your main damage dealers with AP, HP and accuracy. SPOILER WARNING ENDThe game is a bit buggy. I frequently have trouble with character equipment, where items will switch in or out of my backpack spontaneously, or I'll see different items when in combat or out of combat. I've had rare situations where I click on a HUD button and my character moves on the map instead--wasting a turn. I encountered no critical bugs that crashed the game or prevented story completion, however.There are some usability issues. There doesn't seem to be any way to manage drone equipment. It can be awkward to manage objects found in the world, since only the character accessing the container can pick up the item, and outside of combat you only have control over your main character. The game often requires extra unecessary clicks, like when using abilities that can only be used on yourself, you're still forced to click on your sprite to self-select.Overall, I consider this game worth buying and playing, especially if you're a fan of computer role-playing games.

												Incredible game.  Takes me back to the good ol' days of Shadowrun.  I played the the Genesis & SNES game to death back in the day.  As well as the pencil & paper game for many years.  This is probably as close as you will get to re-living those days in a modern game.If you love Shadowrun, this is a MUST PLAY.			"

												Very good RPG, the combat is similar to Fire Emblem, and is probably the game with the combat closest to XCOM: EU. The combat isn't as deep as it is in either games, very story focused, lots of dialogue to read. If you don't mind having to read a lot of dialogue (It's comparable to some old cRPG's with the amount), then it's definitely for you. Also, lots of references to places in Washington state if you're from there.			"

												Generally fun, and close to the original paper-based RPG. Only two concerns: a) no tutorial in Dragonfall, which meant initially it was difficult to know what to do, b) no way to swap items between your PC and team-mate NPCs. Your speech choices generally are irrelevant, apart from in a few specific cases. Still, fun, and around 20hrs for a single player play-through, minus a couple of missions.			"

												It's good. Plays well but I wish there was more well crafted content. There are a few nice campaigns on the workshop, as well as an open world one that is different with each playthrough, slightly... I haven't tried the official dlc for it but if you like old games like Baulder's gate or any of those sort of isometric rpgs or if you want to try making your own content for the game, then this is a great choice. It has a pretty nice custom campaign maker included and links directly with the workshop.Even just the campaign that comes with it by the devs is a good play, albeit sort of short.I hope we get more people making content and campaigns for it in the workshop.

												Shadowrun Returns runs very well on Linux, does not crash suddenly, graphics render well, I've had no problems running it.I wouldn't call the writing in this game ""spectacular”, but certainly you can tell they cared about the story and the dialogues. Although your choices in dialogues don't really alter the game very much, and sometimes not even the NPC's response, the game text is not a default, vague writing just to fill in dialogues. There is a common universe and plot going around and it's not a common sci-fi cliche. There is some depth to the story and that is noticeable, but it is not very developed: the writing and dialogues don't alter the outcome of the game very much.If you are crazy about graphics, I wouldn't exactly recommended, but if you like graphics as in Bastion, you might be satisfied. Textures are mostly still, and you move through a fixed-camera map which you can pan with the mouse. Graphics are pretty, they don't look outdated at all, but they are not intended to be realistic.In this default campaign, trying to let as little spoilers as possible, you will try to discover something. This process is full of dialogues and there is a story behind it, but when it boils down to it, you are just following what the game directs you to do. You don't actually understand what you are getting from dialogues and put the pieces together: the pieces are put together for you. If you are looking for a game that makes you think, probably not the best choice. This is an action game.Shadowrun Returns provides you with a fair amount of character customization as you gain ""karma"", the game's word for experience. Doing many things, from picking things from the ground to killing enemies, will earn you karma. You can spend that to increase your stats and earn skills in the process. The race you pick is crucial to this, and that's good: races are not a mere aesthetic choice, rather, they set the limit for how much you will be able to invest in a certain stat.Overall, if you like turn-based combat, don't care too much for cartoonish graphics and likes reading the dialogues and understanding the story, give it a try during sales, as it's the case right now. I wouldn't buy it for the original price tag, but the game is nice and very enjoyable, certainly worth my time.			"

The colorful and slightly cutesy visuals had put me off from this as I expect cyberpunk to be gritty, not technicolor, but the world and writing was excellent for the most part (occasionally it strayed too far into ""teen-cool"" territory, but not often) and the setting as interesting as it's ever been. A big plus for the music design, the ambience and sci-fi vibes really enhanced the experience.Mechanics wise the game is simple, but it's the story - and the stories to come - that hooked me. Good stuff.			"

												Shadowrun Returns really embodies what Shadowrun is all about (unlike that horrific multiplayer debacle that was released not so long ago, ack!). The responses for your character in dialogue are varied enough to make it feel like you can actually roleplay a little (which is what a real RPG is, a game you can roleplay). It flows nicely and really makes me think back to all those Pen and Paper sessions.I honestly didn't experience much in the way of bugs. And now that saving anywhere has been added it is pretty close to Shadowrun Perfection.I've only had a chance to play Dead Man's Switch so far and I found the story and characters interesting and engaging. And it was pretty cool to see some recognizable faces from the books in the game.Combat seems to flow pretty smoothly. I played a decker, they're my favorite archetype in P&P so I had to. I was pleased with the amount of time I got to spend in the Matrix and the way it was integrated into the gameplay so that it didn't detract from the game for the folks in the real world. I also noticed a lot of opportunities for people who prefer the other archetypes  to shine and I like the way the game noticed little things like my character's gender and race.All in all I would most definately recommend this game. It really IS Shadowrun and I love it. Great job guys!! If you are a fan of Shadowrun or cyberpunk then you should definately check this out.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a classic RPG combined with modern gameplay elements but it's focus clearly lies on storytelling and immersion. It aims to create a believable world based around the popular Shadowrun pen&paper ruleset and in that it succeeds. It took me around 16h to complete the main campaign most of which was reading dialogues similar in structure to that of games like Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment. On pure gameplay and mechanics it lacks however although you will love the combat system if you liked X-Com: Enemy Unknown.But if you really want a good game buy this and get the DLC ""Dragonfall"". It beats the maingame astronomically. While the maingame focuses purely on the main character Dragonfall introduces persistent team members for the first time that develop relationships between them and yourself over time. They even managed to create a richer and more dense story around the awakening of the Dragons with lots of plot twists and filled with morale decisions where there is simply no clear right or wrong. And when you are finished with both campaignsthere is always the workshop to come back to where you'll find a huge number of player created adventures. Shadowrun Returns has the potential to keep you engaged for several years as, so far, the devs are constantly working on new content for the game but even more so the community. Currently a number of the best modders for the game are working together on a massive scale campaign. So even if the next piece of DLC is not that great, there is still something to be looking forward to.In short words this game is best described as a mixture of Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, X-Com and Fallout. That all combined with it's active modding community easily makes Shadowrun Returns the best ""C""RPG of this time.It's on sale until the May 5th, so grab it. It's a steal.			"

												Solid Turned-Based RPG.I found the overall game to be solid.  Well written, enjoyable storyline wrapped with some great mechanics.  Complaints about a very linear campaign are accurate.  However, considering the price and solid execution, I feel that is more than forgiveable.  This isn't an RPG with lots of side content or derivative bits to distract you from the main story.  As mentioned, at $15 or even $20, I think that the offering is more than fair.  My only complaints are that while polished, the story and gameplay are forgettable.  The game is entertaining enough to pull you through the campaign but not memorable enough to bring you back for nostalgic purposes.  On the contrary, it will probably give you a craving for some older classics such as Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment or Fallout.			"

												This expansion for Shadowrun Returns (by Hare-Brained Schemes) evokes the old-school grand scope of classic Bioware RPGs.  More than just an expansion campaign, Dragonfall improves on the original engine in many ways, and responds directly to many complaints about the original.  Even better, it translates those improvements (like a new save system) to the original campaign as well, so folks new to the series entirely can enjoy the improved engine from the start.  The result is an improved product all around, and a memorable and enjoyable RPG set in one of the most fun alternate universes ever created.  An excellent set of custom creation tools add to the potential life of the game, as the mod community may well produce some masterpieces of their own, down the line.			"

												If you're a fan of the old-school turn-based games, you'll enjoy this one.  If you're a fan of coorporate run futuristic dystopias, you'll enjoy this game.  If you're a fan of the table-top game that this is based on, you'll enjoy this game.The strongest point of this game is it's story.  The writing is fantastic and the world is immersive.  Walking into this world knowing almost nothing about it, the game gives you plenty of story to build off of.  Each of the characters feel like people and even the slang used in the game that's unique to the world is easy to understand, even for someone who has never came into contact with it before.The artwork for the game is superb.  The game combines 3-D and 2-D elements in the form of painted portraits for most NPCs and the 3-D element of game play.  The world itself isn't very interactable, but it isn't necessary.The game play can get very static very fast, especially with combat.  Once you figure out that the AI is going to react certain ways and the trick to not getting your face blown off, it can get dull quickly.  It's absolutely worth finishing the game, however, as the story is fantastic.If you're a fan of Baulder's Gate, this game will remind you of it in its play style.			"

												I never played the original Shadowrun (SNES and Sega Genesis, apparently), but after playing Shadowrun Returns, I'm going to find it.Shadowrun Returns is one of the few games in the ""RPG"" category that is, in fact, a Role-Playing Game. Unlike Dungeon Siege, Diablo, BioWare Game or Final Fantasy, Shadowrun actually requires you to interact with NPCs and the manner of those interactions actually impacts the game. Imagine that. So many games claim that NPC interactions affect outcomes, but this is the first game I've played in a while (not including the Elder Scrolls/Fallout 3 sub-genre) in which that's actually true.Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign) has a little bit of important dialogue, but Dragonfall (the first DLC campaign) is LOADED with character development and NPCs that actually behave differently depending on how you treat them.But the beauty of Shadowrun Returns isn't the official campaigns. It's the editor, and the integration with Steam Workshop. I've not actually used the editor yet, but judging from the vast range of quality in the user-created content, it must be pretty easy to use. On the one hand, that means a LOT of just pure garbage content. On the other hand, it means that learning how to use the editor isn't a stumbling block for somebody who's got a great story to tell.So while the original campaign is really quite good (I mean really, really good. It's one of the few campaigns of any game that I'm perfectly happy replaying several times in a row), Dragonfall really showcases what the game's engine is capable of.If you've ever played the old Fallout games (Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics), this is a lot like those. If you haven't played those, think of it as turn-based, squad-based Diablo, with almost no emphasis on gear. There is an equipment treadmill, but it's not very involved. More along the lines of Mass Effect 2.There are three or four pistols (for example), and you buy the most expensive one you can afford. So while there IS a reason to make more money and get the better stuff, it's not the need that it is in other games (Diablo, for example). Sorry to keep making the comparison to Diablo, but that's the other game I've been playing most recently.Shadowrun Returns is also one of the few games I've played that knows how to use a touchscreen. Most games work ""well enough,"" but SR has a touchscreen mode that makes it function beautifully. And by ""beautifully,"" I mean that the PC version plays just as well on my Dell touchscreen as the Android version plays on my Samsung Note 2.I don't know if anyone but me cares about that, but with the increasing prevalence of Windows 8, I figure it's worth mentioning.I know I'm making a big deal about Dragonfall, and I mean to. It's an excellent campaign, and is actually (in my opinion) worth the price of a full expansion pack, as opposed to the increasingly-common 2-dollar DLC. But I suppose I should really talk more about Dead Man's Switch. It's an engaging mystery with great characters. It doesn't have the meaningful dialogues and character developmnet of Dragonfall, but I was immediately taken with both Dresden and Kluwe. They're not ""important"" characters, but the fact that placeholder roles are filled with well-fleshed and well-written characters is just indicative of the attention to detail paid by the devs. It's a well-polished introduction to the world of Shadowrun.

												Okay, I finally have to write a little something after playing the Dragonfall DLC.First off, to quickly go over Shadowrun Returns:  Let me preface this by saying I am a kickstarter backer.  Back when SRR popped up on Kickstarter, I immediately jumped on board.  I'd been craving the old-school SR like the ones on Genesis and SNES which I played when I was hardly into my teens, and everything in the KS pitch sold me that this would bring it back to those days.  When SRR finally released and I played through it, I came out satisfied.  It has a solid and deep story, good combat (which has since been balanced and improved), fairly simple puzzles, and yes..it had some flaws like no manual saves (again, resolved since then), but it didn't really bug me that much.  Most of all, they made choice matter.And then along comes Shadowrun: Dragonfall.   Dragonfall absolutely oozes greatness.  There's insane depth of characters and the world, down to the smallest details, even in conversations with side characters like Simmy Kim and reading the Shadowland BBS.  It's a very rare thing where a game captures me so well that I sit and read every single piece of text I come across (and there's so much to read in this series).  I especially appreciated the design in this DLC of having the quest hub, but more importantly, there were so many more rich side quests throughout the campaign than in the base game.  They also upped the design on the puzzle elements a bit which I appreciated (the original campaign's were generally way too straightforward).  But enough of a wall of text, let's break things down:Story: Phenomenal.  Aside from the depth of lore in this world, the story of this campaign alone was so great.  Just when you     think you've got things figured out, something throws you for a loop.  You face lots of decisions that test your morals, many of which mostly seem to test just how close to ""the line"" you're willing to step, or if it's even a question for you.Characters: Great.  This time around, you've got a dedicated crew.  Sure, you could hire runners to go along with you, but the crew is where it's at.  They've got deep stories and I loved every bit of exploring them.  The SRR Dead Man Switch campaign had people occasionally joining you, like Coyote, but those companions pale in comparison to the attention given to the crew of Dragonfall.  I cared about my crew.  Hell, I felt bad that I always had to leave one member behind on my runs having only room for a team of 4.  I felt like I was neglecting them most of the game and that they were going to confront me about it at some point.Combat: Solid.  I played on hard difficulty, and essentially did the same rifle-focused street samurai build I did in SRR.  I found it much more balanced, and there were several missions with some real tension as the fights raged on.  The Matrix served a good purpose as well; it felt much more key to this campaign than the first.Graphics: Beautiful.  They already established this with SRR, they just painted a whole new world for Dragonfall's Berlin setting, and it's gorgeous.So that's it in a nutshell.Final verdict: Worth buying?  Abso-freakin-lutely.  This is an rpg not to be missed. "

												The game is enjoyable but plays like reading a book.  There are almost no side quests or options other than the straight through story.  Combat is simple and the matrix is simply combat in a differnet setting.  Don't buy it if you are looking for something deep but it makes for a weekend of fun.  I have hopes for more depth in Workshop offerings and future releases and will be happy to explore the offering in the future.			"

												I bought this game during the summer sale a few days ago and paid $3.74 for it. It's easily worth 10 bucks to me. Having just finished my first play through on normal difficulty as an Elf Decker of the base game (Dead Man's Switch), I figured I'd share my thoughts on it: Very solid shadowrun feel to it in many respectsThe cityscape looked how i envisioned it would.  The Matrix, magic, cyberware, and other things were there as well. It was missing the shadowrunning feel to it though honestly.  Instead of it being a single Johnson or a series of Johnsons giving you missions, it focused on a single mission which kept getting more complex as it went along until it was concluded... which leads to one of the things I was not impressed with (mentioned below).Solid combat systemIt's a Turn based Action Point system alternating between you/your team and enemies going.  This is a deviation from the combat system of the Shadowrun Tabletop, but was still solid and required some strategy.Solid story lineI played 6 straight hours my first time sitting down with it and the only reason I stopped is because I realized I had fallen asleep in my chair for 4 hours and had to get up to go to work.  It wasn't a thrill a minute action story, but it was a good solid line that progressed evenly and kept me interested ehough to see what happened next. It didn't feel like it was too long, but didn't feel like it was quite long enough. Maybe 1 more scene to the game would have been perfect for length.Awesome envisioning of the MatrixThe implementation of the matrix was close to how I'd envisioned it from the 3rd and 4th edition Shadowrun game books. It was fast and sleek looking, although I wish there were more of it and a little more customization capability of your Avatar in it. (It would have been nice to have the genesis version with random systems and a Johnson that could give side quests?... which would also fix one of my  previously alluded to complaints about the game.)My cons:Maps are very limited/restrictedThe maps were small and basically there was nowhere to go outside of your target destination. You entered and moved from insertion point to objective building. Everything else was blocked off.money generation felt like it is limitedOutside of the main story line which basically rewarded you for clicking on/finding everything or metered infusions of money as the story line progressed... there was no way to earn money to upgrade your gear.  Through most of the game it felt like I was being forced to pick having a team to run with and mediocre gear and little to no cyberware upgrades or get the cyberware and best gear to go it alone.Missing the Johnsons and the basic premise of the shadowrun gameThe fact that there were no Johnsons to take runs from in the game was frustrating as it is a big part of being a shadowrunner.  Although when you look at the storyline of the game, it is more of a single run  instead of living the full life of a shadowrunner so maybe the lack of Johnsons and side runs isn’t actually missing from the game, but it would have helped to make some money to buy better tech.Overall, I’d say the game is a gem for anyone who likes the shadowrun universe but would fall flat for anyone that’s just a gamer.

												The story isn't that miraculous itself but the well written dialogue keeps it together. Couple of times I glitched out and had to reload or restart. Constantly missing even with 92% accuracy tends to be annoying. You don't get to enjoy the character levels very much since the game pretty much gives you the credits screen when a skill tree starts to look like it's going to be maxed.  Even with these little buggers its a great package of turn-based combat and character development. Also great soundtrack.			"

												An essential game for all fans of cyberpunk, sci-fi and fantasy, cRPGs or PnP, and turn-based gaming.  Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's Switch is the first turn-based game I've played in what must be a decade and I'm thoroughly enjoying every moment of it, and I hear the Dragonfall campaign is even better and apparently much longer. The DMS campaign's story is tight, although linear, but the beautiful and lush art combines with the rich fictional world of the Shadowrun universe to make the world come alive, and serves as an excellent introduction into the world of cyberpunk. The editor ensures a steady stream of excellent player-made campaigns too, so if you have any inclination to try this game out you very likely won't regret it and will feel stupid for not trying it out sooner, if you're anything like me.

												Shadowrun is a long running series, starting in 1993 as a Nintendo action adventure game, it literally blew minds with its diverse story telling. It had everything; connecting your brain to the internet, street mages, mafia trolls, crazy ex-girlfriends. the game was later adapted into a paperback rpg that has had a relatively strong run. ( its in its 5th edition.)Shadowrun Returns; Deadmans switch and its superior, Dragonfall, takes place in 2070, about 10- 20 years after the events of original. Deadmens switch is an adventure through the city of Seattle, fighting through deadly cultist plots and drek crazy doctors you manage to avenge your old partner’s death. While dragonfall is and intricate story about investigating a mysterious force in berlin while your attempt to battle forces that would appose the flux state. I belive the game play is quite sharp for a turn based game, delivering multple layers of complexty with its various custom class archtypes (rigger, adept, shaman, samurai, mage, decker, ect) you can play a muscle mage, or a shooty hacker, or any combination there of. next there's the multiple layers of customization, from bio mods to specll selection you have a large library to chose from. I've thoroughly enojoyed my adventures in the dark, an impatienly await the coming additions.			"

												I've played this game for ten hours before I eventually got too frustrated and uninstalled.What I thought when I first encountered it was a misstep, (the lack of any save/load game feature), turned into a death knell -- you WILL reach moments in the game, where despite your best planning you are left in the worst condition you could be and are unable to continue.In a typical RPG, you would restore to an autosave or a quicksave or otherwise from somewhere earlier on and roll the dice again, presumably to try and get a better result from a combat sequence -- you'd be free to because a regular game recognises the mutability of each instance of combat and provides you that opportunity. That is NOT the case in this game: if you get to the penultimate area of a mission with no health, dead team members, or no supplies, you must either run through the situation over and over from their awkwardly placed checkpoints, or start the entire mission over again from BEFORE you initiated it. This includes talking to all the NPCs, watching unskippable cinematics, recruting new team members, purchasing supplies, levelling up, and travelling to the mission area. Depending on how much preparation you require, you may spend more time in preliminary prepping than actually playing the game, going over the same (admittedly clever and consistent) dialogue, losing its significance each time.This surely seems like an issue that one shouldn't harp on, but consider how elemental even a rudimentary save system is to any RPG you've ever played, and then remove it. How many opportunities are there to say that it was a universally good choice? In this game, the absence is so notable that it almost renders the game worthless.As for the positives, the game is set in the legendary Shadowrun universe, fully realised in video game form! The writing is quite often witty and on point. There is a potential for infinite content with the open authoring tools.It's worth buying if you think you can deal with the big drawback, but it is a big one.			"

												Back in my SNES days, Shadowrun was by far my favourite game.  These days, that's the only game that really sticks in my mind when I think back to playing that console.  Over the years I have tracked where the game was going.  Horrified that Microsoft bought the rights, but thought maybe they'll do something good with it.  Nope.  2007, I saw it was just another first-person shooter, not tied to the Shadowrun universe, I sadly concluded there was no chance of ever seeing another Shadowrun game like the one on SNES.  Guess I'll have to install a SNES emulator and play the original (never got around to it).Then I was cruising around Google Play last week, when Shadowrun Returns showed up on my recommended list.  OHHHH.... darn.  No tablet.  Yet.  But tis on Steam, and it works on Linux.  REJOICE!  I tried it for a few hours and so far it's looking great.  I played both the Dead Man's Switch campaign provided by Harebrained Schemes, and a story someone is putting together to replicate the SNES version.Thanks Microsoft for giving the game's rights back to Jordan Weisman!  Thanks Jordan and HBS for bringing back the world of Shadowrun to our screens!  Thanks  Kickstarter for the campaign to fund HBS' development.  Thanks all who provided funding!  Had I known the campaign existed last year, I would've contributed for sure.			"

That's how addicted you become to the storyline, and playability of this game.It very similar to fallout ( the first one ), all isometric views, and despite some critics, i liked the graphics a lot. The ambients are wonderful, the conversations are well-thought, and you do feel you're in some crazy society, all the way through. The gameplay is extremely simple, but you've got a miriad of choices along the way. Most of ( if not all ) of the puzzles have several different ways to be solved, depending on how you build your character, or your gaming style.You can hack stuff, use your charms and talk your way, shoot it, sneak it, however you want.From a troll bouncer that's as polite and philosophical as ever, to a psychotic ugly elf, you're gonna get surprised by this game. Very very nice.			"

												I really enjoy the fact that Shadowrun is back.  I played Shadowrun on the SNES and the Sega, and always hoped that we would get another chance at this game. Most of the UGC is really cool, combat is fun I think that the turn based style works quite well for the game. The DLC so far has been fun but at times it feels like the DLC is geared more towards a decker.  While this is not a down side; it does lead to some hard choices, still no matter what I am having a blast with it.  I'd say if you haven't played the orginal games, or the Tabletop RPG you should give this game a chance. If you have played the orginal games or the RPG, get it! I'm hoping that we get more DLC for this game and I look forward to what UGC comes out for it. Minor beefs are some of the essence costs and we don't see much in the ways of Betaware or Delta grade cyberware, of course this could change as time passes.			"

This new DLC/Campaign is a great place to start because it's a bigger, fuller, better realized game.  As far as RPGs go, this is a modern classic.  There are well-developed side-kicks, side-quests, and yes, side-arms (guns and cybernetic arms...lol? sorry.)  The characters and environment have that Baldur's Gate feel, not visually but in that they seem like people/places worth interracting with and even saving. I'm only about 6-7 hours in but it's worth recommending already.			"

												The original shadowrun for Sega was one of my favorate games of all time, and certainly my favorate cyberpunk game.  The amount of detail in world creation, plotline, and character development made the original game playable multiple times.Over a decade later, I was thrilled to see a sequel.  I found that the writing and plotlines were as original and immersive as the previous original.  Some things had changed, the graphics were slightly more detailed, the combat system different, and the world much smaller and more linear.  But the essence of the game, the style, and much more was enough to make the game a great experience.I was slightly disappointed at the small size of the game compared to the original, but have since discovered there will be additional content added.  Shadowrun Returns is certainly a great start, and I look forward to new content.			"

												Shadowrun Returns offers an enjoyable walk through a cyberpunk story, which grows larger than is really sensible.  This is a linear tale, presented in the form of the original Baulder's Gate games.  Players of games in this style may be left wanting from the gameplay.  Although the player has control over team mates in combat the player has no control over their skill point allocation and may only manage their own player in this way.  Further, there is not much variety to speak of in the combat.  I'm also warned by friends to not bother chosing to play a Decker (hacker class) one's self, as there is little opprotunity for the player to make use of this class's specialities.  Likewise, there are some conversational bonues in the Charisma attribute that can ignored altogether (I think I only saw ""Academic"" as a possible response category once).  I'd recommend this one for anyone itching for a Shadowrun experience, but with reservations.  I am hoping that Shadowrun: Dragonfall offers more depth in the gameplay.  I also just remembered that this was a Kickstarter project.  Great work from that perspective.  Here's hoping future installments keep up with the excellent story-telling and also satisfy more in the gameplay.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is to Shadowrun pen-and-paper RPG as Neverwinter Nights is to Dungeons & Dragons.  That is, it is a perfect videogame GUI for single player adventures.  It is finely and lovingly crafted by the creators of the origional, so you can also count on a faithful game (unlike the Xbox 360 shooter).  It also has tools for creating adventures of your own, and the user-generated content has a thriving community hub.  I hope they make expansions for this game forever, and am personally going to do my part.  I woud recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I don't have enough play time at this moment but Shadowrun Returns immediately takes me back to playing older strategy tactical games I grew up with such as Front Mission 3, Warcraft 3, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Gangsters 1/2 to name a few. The type of gameplay pulled me in by its job system, character customization, special powerups, and a turn based battle system. I take my time during battles, deciding my next move, and sometimes starting over. I don't like to rush. It's not very often I get excited over these games but when I do, it turns into my favorite game and a classic for me at least.I am not very good at recommending games. I play what I like. If anyone is a fan of strategy games, giving orders on the frontlines, and preparing their characters for battle, I think it would be great to add to the collection and memories.			"

												I was always more Cyberpunk than Shadowrun growing up. It always seemed grittier, more serious. Then a while back I started getting interested in Shadowrun as a nostalga thing. So I tried Shadowrun Returns.The game taught me that I was wrong in underestimating the Shadowrun setting. Very very wrong. The campaigns that ship with the game and the Dragonfall expansion are fun. Linear, yes, but no more so than many other games. And there is an active and highly productive community churning out some seriously good campaigns.If you like turn based games, and you like the setting, I cannot recommend this enough. And once you're done with the ""official"" campaigns, spend some time in the workshop. You won't regret it.			"

I started a new character (a more basic street samauri instead of Rigger.  I've played this game for a few days and have to say I love it! It's simple but rich.

												Shadowrun Returns runs very well on Linux, does not crash suddenly, graphics render well, I've had no problems running it.I wouldn't call the writing in this game ""spectacular”, but certainly you can tell they cared about the story and the dialogues. Although your choices in dialogues don't really alter the game very much, and sometimes not even the NPC's response, the game text is not a default, vague writing just to fill in dialogues. There is a common universe and plot going around and it's not a common sci-fi cliche. There is some depth to the story and that is noticeable, but it is not very developed: the writing and dialogues don't alter the outcome of the game very much.If you are crazy about graphics, I wouldn't exactly recommended, but if you like graphics as in Bastion, you might be satisfied. Textures are mostly still, and you move through a fixed-camera map which you can pan with the mouse. Graphics are pretty, they don't look outdated at all, but they are not intended to be realistic.In this default campaign, trying to let as little spoilers as possible, you will try to discover something. This process is full of dialogues and there is a story behind it, but when it boils down to it, you are just following what the game directs you to do. You don't actually understand what you are getting from dialogues and put the pieces together: the pieces are put together for you. If you are looking for a game that makes you think, probably not the best choice. This is an action game.Shadowrun Returns provides you with a fair amount of character customization as you gain ""karma"", the game's word for experience. Doing many things, from picking things from the ground to killing enemies, will earn you karma. You can spend that to increase your stats and earn skills in the process. The race you pick is crucial to this, and that's good: races are not a mere aesthetic choice, rather, they set the limit for how much you will be able to invest in a certain stat.Overall, if you like turn-based combat, don't care too much for cartoonish graphics and likes reading the dialogues and understanding the story, give it a try during sales, as it's the case right now. I wouldn't buy it for the original price tag, but the game is nice and very enjoyable, certainly worth my time.			"

												I recommend this only if it's on sale. Dragonfall I found more enjoyable than the base campaign, but it's still linear and short; given that user content comprises most of the gametime this release has to offer, I also only recommend it if it's on sale.When you purchase this, you are purchasing a clumsy game engine with a short, linear example campaign. I only narrowly gave this thumbs up, because of the fact that most of the game's potential comes from user-generated content, which is made by people who will not not be seeing any of the money you pay. The engine itself is clumsy because it takes a lot of fiddling to make it immersive; doors cannot be closed again once open, by default; you have to set each one up to do so, etc. Places that look navigable are sometimes not. There is a lack of cover in places where there sems like there should be.In short the product feels rushed, and most of the potential comes from people that are willing to work (for free)/adapt the tools released, rather than from the developers. Worth it if under 5$.			"

												Bottom line: If you like turn based combat and this game is on sale for 5-10$, go for it.Fun Factor: 70-73/100Game Time:  Around 30-45 hours.  I left the game on a few different nights, so chalk up 16-30 hours of Steam's ""recorded play time"" being from that.Mediocre turn based strategy that really didn't bring anything new to the genre.  The setting for the game is neat, it takes place in Seattle/Berlin and there has been a resurgence of magic use, different sub types of humans(Orcs, Elves, etc.), all blended with future technologies.  The stories are fun but mostly but are mostly predictable, leaving you with no real sense of wonder.  The dialog tried it's best, but it probably reads as poorly as this review, hah.  The combat isn't anything to get too excited about either, as it's basically dice rolling for accuracy of success and damage. Even at the highest difficulty setting, I didn't find myself all that challenged, which may be a blessing to those who just want to breeze through the game.  The inability to customize characters outside your main character is pretty lame and rather off putting at times.  I wanted to customize my own Shadowrunner hit squad...  I do recommend checking it out, but it certainly isn't one you need to get to right away.			"

Fascinating world, interesting characters, tactical enough combat, intriguing story. Would buy again.Edit after 12 hours into it: still loving it. It's a linear story, but there's enough illusion of choice that it doesn't feel linear. Protips:1. Do not give your hired shadowrunners anything cool because they keep it after the mission is over! 2. Don't bother with hiring a dedicated decker. The story so far has dropped a free pro-decker in my lap each time I've really needed one.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is so damn likable that it's easy to overlook how mediocre it can be. The user interface is cumbersome and frequently doesn't let you do what you'd expect it would. It's janky in the way that you remember crusty old PC games used to be, except it's not charming by today's standards. The default campaign: Dead Man's Switch is unflinchingly linear and the game has some odd hitching issues. But it's ****ing cyberpunk! Despite the fact that the story goes off the rails in a rather magnificent way, Shadowrun Returns stays true to the Gibson-esque tone that you want from a cyberpunk RPG and more to the point, a sequel to the original Shadowrun. The writing is what you want from a Shadowrun game. The combat is ersatz-XCOM Enemy Unknown. I'd have a hard time calling Shadowrun Returns great, but if you're as starved as I am for its specific brand of dystopia, it's a decent fix.			"

They did such great work if actually making your teammates and even the NPC's themselves feel alive. They all have their own personality, their own demons, their own wants and wishes. Really grade A writing on their part. I have not felt such a strong connection to characters in a video since Final Fantasy 7. I am really conservative when it comes to giving out ratings, but seriously...10/10. Combat is great, character development is great, dialog, sound, plot...just everything about this game is near perfection.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is set in a fantastic, cyberpunk, distopian earth, where mega-coorporations are running the show, drug dealers roam the streets, and mercenary adventurers, called ""shadowrunners"" take on dangerous work for the highest bidder. On top of everything else, magic has returned to the world, which puts a novel spin on the whole cyberpunk setup.This game has a brilliant atmosphere, captivating from the start, pulling you into the dirty streets of a blade-runner-ish seattle, and putting you into the skin of a shadow runner. Shadowrun returns features a great story, with lots of twists and reminds me of the Torment due to its emphasis on dialogue, rather than battles. On the downside it's very linear, with only a couple of occasional options for side-quests. But this is not necessarily that bad, because it focuses on the plot and tells the story without infinite distractions and pointless errants.Highly recomended for RPG fans who are not aversed to exploring a futuristic, cyberpunk world, very similar to the worlds of Gibson's ""the neuromancer"", or Stephenson's ""snowcrash"" but still very unique in its own right.

Was an immensely enjoyable experience although I have to say that it was a bit too short :( and the expansion is pricey! If you were a big BG fan and loved picking up side quests, there aren't that many in this game unfortunately.It's a click heavy game and the mouse interface isn't as responsive as it should be but I think they're going to fix this in a new patch.Another great thing about the game is that it comes with a custom content editor.

												I've been playing nonstop since I bought this game and I still haven't gotten tired of it. The ability to make your own modules has made the game have an almost infinite replayability factor. Although you dont NEED to know anything about Shadowrun to enjoy this game, having prior knowledge makes Shadowrun Returns that much more enjoyable. If you've got a weekend to kill then I'd reccomend picking this up and play till you drop.			"

												If there's one thing I can say that I find missing from this game, it's the ability to throw more money at the designers (custom content and original campaigns, balancing and design philosophy, enjoyable music and memorable characters - all things this game has in spades)If this game is telling of the rest of their work I hope to see many, many more products from this company.If you enjoy the genre (Cyberpunk, RPGs or turn based strategies) and\or are a fan of dark futuristic settings and beautifully developped worlds you really should give this game (and possibly the  ""Pen and Paper"" original) a try.

												This  kickstarter gem is under appreciated by the RPG community. It´s got great atmosphere, cool characters, well written dialogue and original storytelling, making up for it´s somewhat shallow gameplay and ""light"" RPG mechanics. Not even considering the SNES original, if you are a fan of games like Xcom, Fallout 1 & 2 or Arcanum you should pick this one up. It may not match the complexity of these titles, but it nails the same retro feel, for which it deserves a lot of credit and your time.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a great game.Think Lord of the Rings meets the Matrix for the setting : orks, elves, trolls, dwarves and regular humans dwell in the shadow of mega-corps, facing the many perils of a cyber-punk low-life. They fight, charm or oustsmart their way around the many dangers of this world with guns, cybertech and magic. The general setting is vibrant and offers a great potential for many stories.The official first campaign is good, but the excellency comes from the User Generated Contents, some of which are better than the original game. Shadowrun's online community offers a lot of different storylines that make this game virtually immortal : play as an elf shaman, a troll bruiser, a dwarven mage, an ork street samurai or a human cyber pirate (or any combination of them, or a character of your own design), assemble your team of runners and advance through the myriad of high-quality mods. Each character has its advantages and drawbacks, so a balanced team is often the best option, though sometimes brute force, magic or technological capacity can make the difference.On the gameplay, it is rather intuitive : 50% RPG, 50% turn-by-turn tactical fighting (à la X-Com) with varyinng proportions depending on the mod.Some ""classes"" are better suited to some roles than others but the progression system allows you to create your own build : do you want your shaman to have proficiency in firearms ?  Do you prefer him to be a pure spellcaster and go mage/shaman ? Do you want him to be extra-tough ? Do prefer to concentrate on invocations and shamanic support spells ? Do you want to sacrifice some of your spellcasting capabilities in favour of cyberware ? All builds are possible and all of them work, with various advantages and drawbacks !The different races help for the feel of the game but have ultimately little impact gameplay-wise apart at the very begining or at the very end of a campaign. Choosing to be a tough troll or a gracefull elf will give you some minor changes in starting stats and a different ultimate potential, but for most of the game the different races don't really matter.Overall, this great game is made awesome thanks to the online community (most of which is here on Steam).

												I started playing the game with zero expectations and no prior knowledge about the series, and came out pleasantly surprised. Shadowrun Returns' story is rich and well-written; The fusion of fantasy race archetypes and the cyberpunk backdrop is perfectly done. The story never gets dull, and the writing does an excellent job of linking together the events to form a smooth and cohesive experience.My only gripe with the game is the somewhat unpolished cursor targetting system. There were instances where I couldn't place my character on a specific spot because an enemy sprite is blocking the spot. There was one game breaking bug where an elevator icon would go dark after moving your characters to the next area, save for one. Aside from these, the game is incredibly fun to play, and comes highly recommended.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is pretty damn awesome, but the DLC, Dragonfall is literally like x1000 times better. They did such great work if actually making your teammates and even the NPC's themselves feel alive. They all have their own personality, their own demons, their own wants and wishes. Really grade A writing on their part. I have not felt such a strong connection to characters in a video since Final Fantasy 7. I am really conservative when it comes to giving out ratings, but seriously...10/10. Combat is great, character development is great, dialog, sound, plot...just everything about this game is near perfection.			"

												Its hard for me to put into words just how great this game is, I honestly can't sing enough of its praises to be truthful. The entire game is rich and full of atmosphere, really setting the mood for the setting it is placed in. The game had me firmly in its grasp the entire time I played it and not once did it let me go, never breaking character or form in a way that jarred me out of the experience.The game's character creation is really straight forward and easy to understand and especially flexible, so if you find yourself dislikeing the path you set yourself on but happen to like another class as long as you do so early enough you can more or less cross class and still be rather effective!The game is turn based so if that's your stick hop right on in! It's challenging, but not in the punishing way.  I've never had something in the game bad happen to me that was anything less than poor performance on my part. It's never made me feel like I've been cheated out of a win or into a death. Only that I made a stupid move and ended up dead or lossing the battle becuase I failed a requirement.Every character I ran into was full of life and unique in their own right, I've never met someone in the game I've even actively disliked! Well, save some of the villians and that was only in the sense of. ""Jeez, what a♥♥♥♥♥♥"" Rather than the usual, ""Ugh what a cliched loser."" The only real complaint I have in the area is that you dont really get to associate much with the some of the npcs. By that I mean become real tight friends with them. Ie: Lets say I stroll along and help out vendor A or give him something he wants. While it's acknowledged that I've done right for him verbally, they dont really give you any discounts or anything. Heck other than really asking them about their past and getting to be chummy with them you don't really get to interact with them much outside of that, save with the exception of like: Coyote. None of the npcs really give you any discounts and the like. Though if your playing the game right you wont really need the money to be honest. Though I suppose in the end its only really a minor set back if even one at all, considering that they were very three-d and interactive characters. It was a significant step up from all the two-d card board characters that you get for npcs a lot lately. I could actually feel and even would go so far as to say, loved going back to talk to them on a regular basis.Another thing I loved was the fact that I had all sorts of ways to solve any problem I ran into, each class had its own unique way to solve or deal with things that they ran into. Especially out of combat and I rarely ran into a problem that I couldn't solve in muliple ways myself. I'm going to stop here because I'm more or less fan girl rambling at this point, but seriously if you've got the spare cash to shell out for this game. Do it, it is well worth the price, I've frankly had significantly less fun on sixty dollar games. For fourteen ninty nine this game is a total steal. I can't believe I how lucky I got on the flash sale back with this, I almost feel half  guilty for getting it as low as I did.But long story short, the game is great, damn great if you wanna get down to it. I only hope that they pump out more dlc for this. All the content I've played so far is a massive explosion of awesome. Any of you guys still on the edge for trying it just give in. Trust me its worth that price and that much more if you can afford it.			"

												Enjoyable story and gameplayAfter having the game for a little over 9 months, I've finally beaten the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch, of Shadowrun Returns (2013).It didn't take this long to beat it because the game wasn't enjoyable, but rather because the machine I had until a few months ago wasn't ideal for gaming, so it wasn't until the last three months that I really got into this.The game itself has a robust story, as one would hope from a Shadowrun game. The game isn't particularly difficult, as I found myself only losing two characters over the course of the ~11 hours of time I put inWith a robust editor and community, I expect I'll be able to come back to Shadowrun Returns again and again over the years, for continued enjoyment.I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns, and give it a 5 of 5 stars.

I've only gotten to play the first provided storyline (haven't even tapped into the DLC or the additional stories you can add to your game) but from what I've played, here what you can expect. Am Immersive world, tense fights, strategies for every situation or playstyle and probably some of the best writing I've seen in video gaming (this is 18 years of playing these - I've seen a lot of writing)My suggestion: If this is on sale, GET IT!!!

												Shadowrun Returns may not attract everyone, especially younger more modern players, but those who remember the hayday of classic PC Rpgs like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale, etc. will fall in love with this title. It may not be as advanced as the previously mentioned games but it is one of the closest experiences one can get to a true table top pen and paper experience like Pathfinder, D&D and real Shadowrun that one can get. It feels mostly like you are playing through a novel. Dialogue and responses to said dialogue is all read. There are no voice overs. The story and characters are clever and the turn based combat is simple yet just advanced enough to be engaging and fun. Leveling up your character is a blast with alot of options for play style.Though Shadowrun Returns is not the most advanced or elaborate RPG out there it is still an insanely fun experience, especially for pen and paper fans or classic PC rpg fans. I for one am looking forward to when i am able to pick up the expansion ""Shadowfall"".			"

												It was a pretty cool game. My favorite aspect was just the atmosphere. I'm into that techy almost post-apocalyptic feel. Everything was edgy and I really felt I had to rely on my wits and street knowledge. However I was really confused about the classes and karma upgrades. I felt like I needed to take some time to sit down and go through each section to understand what upgrades were good to get or worthless for my character. Another issue was probably the fact that you'd have a big advantage being a decker. A bunch of quests had only special decker options. Since I wasn't playing as a decker, I could almost never take those options. In general a lot of character development felt a bit off and weighed to one or two specific classes. I might try some of the workshop stories and see how those go, but all in all, I had a lot of fun, but it just stopped abruptly.			"

												This game totally rocks!!  It's a little old, and if you're looking for graphics and cosmetics, go elsewhere, cause those are things you won't find here.  But it has everything else.  Lots of interactivity, like you just don't find:  a lot of the decisions you make for how you say things are just your own flair, don't make a difference, but decisions you make in game impact things early on and forward.  Some of these decisions, naturally, Shadowrun being a logical universe, require you to be able to do it-- so if you don't have the skill in question high enough, it's not an option-- but not to worry, there are more than two ways to skin a cat sometimes, and there's pretty much always going to be more than one.  Sometimes, that involves creativity- like buying coffee if you figure out a solution for a street junkie who wants more money than you (may) have, even if you talk him down in price (though you might have enough) but is too out of it to be able to get down to the cafe for himself, so, insert errand, you pay less than you would have doing it straightforwardly-- though it's the future, and real coffee is still pretty pricey (for coffee).  You get money multiple ways for different things, including of course selling loot-- but so far in my playing the game there's more of an emphasis on selling mission items, specifically software you stole, and by completing jobs and/or tasks.  Tasks:  this is also how you level up.  In this game, trust me from the start, you *really* want to explore the world around you.  There are people to interact with you, and as often as not, the things they want from you can give you a karma point.  You don't know what will give you karma points, but it's not hard enough to figure out looking around and seeing things you can help people with helps.  Karma would seem an odd name for the resource for levelling, but it's actually not, because you can do things like get a junkie help-- which you hear more about later if you do.  Again, you can pick how you go about getting her to get help, too:   do you play it higher-than-thou, at least that's how I see it, do you talk logic to her, do you scare her-- you might have to do two of those at least, actually, but I only played through once.  Just on the earlier point.   But back to karma.  You get karma for beating mission objectives, which again do not just come up without chatting, looking into things and such, clicking on things to figure out what's going on in the world around you-- if interactivity does not appeal to you, this is not the game for you; it is not simply fighting.  If it does, it's more complicated than I make it sound in experience, because there are so many different things to interact with... it would be hard to categorize.  *Ahem!*  You explore, you complete tasks, you get karma....... and you level up!!  Leveling up takes up a lot of karma, and there's a whole lot to level up, so you have to pick and choose, but a lot of it you're just going to forget about anyway, because your character isn't specialized in hacking- oh you included that?  S/he is a super crappy fighter then, at least as far as I've gotten, but okay, that's what you get when you want to hack computers instead of being a gunslinger.  I kinda didn't like the extensive use of spell-like systems in this game to start with, but now that I've gotten more used to it, I just want to go all out when I have the credits and buy like everything and use it all.   The spell-systems are different, though they don't all get called that (there are three of them) and they're not as out of place as you may be thinking.  If you read about the game, bear in mind, there are guns and computers and hackers, but there are also trolls and ogres and dragons.  Just sayin'.   Oh.... the dragons are bad*** and you literally don't mess with them.  Taking down a dragon takes an army, not a small unit, generally speaking, and in this futuristic society the dragons wiped out large bodies of people before getting taken out... not all of them have been.   All of this is in the lifetime-recent past of the living, some of it having started *it's true* since after the game came out, presumably, but at any rate also before 2014, which is when I'm writing this.  Man, I've spent a fortune it seems on MMOs that I got sick of.... this game cost me under $5 while on sale and I can't get enough of it so far.  I'll get tired of it, too, but I'm definitely looking for another game for nothing again when I get tired of it... graphics aren't bad for being old and cheap budget, and I like reading the text better than listening, but oh, there is a lot of reading, did I say that?  lol... you have to read the conversations, no voice acting... it's all low-budget... just straight-up good creativity is what makes it such an awesome game.  Modding community too, though I haven't tried their work yet, no reason-- still playing through my first campaign.   So I highly recommend this game.... it should run on your computer if it's not a fossil, though I could be wrong, and I apologize if so.... this is the first review I've written for Steam, and the game definitely deserved some ""credits.""  Universe is scifi, if you missed that part, looks a lot cheesier than it is.  Lots of effects and ways to acheive them, grenades for instance that do different things, robots that do different things-- you have seriously limitied inventory, but you've got a killer size stash, so the limit is on missions (you can keep as much as you like, there's nothing there specifiying an inventory limit on your stash.)To tell the truth, there are still things I haven't figured out how to do in game yet, or if there's a way to do them (I'm pretty sure I level my own team too, but I don't know how-- or even how to switch out their gear) but there's a help me section I've been having way too much of a blast to wade through lmao.... I don't have the credits right now to buy Igger a new gun anyway lol.  You have time after every mission involving fighting to wander around town and do more missives that are just interaction and figuring stuff out (nothing requiring a high IQ, don't worry-- just be curious, that'll get you more than far enough), during which time you can stock up on supplies, sell stuff, tip a dancer, that kind of thing... have a cup of soykaf!  Woo-hoo! lololol.... World:  Well-drawn.  It's like reading a good book, really.  There's stuff happening, nothing boring, lots, and I mean lots, of drama, nevermind you're a cold-hearted professional cutthroat, you care about sentiment because everybody does in reality and so therefore do you.  You may be bad***, and your team too, but you all care.... I'm only a little way in but I play this game for interacting with a world in more ways than one, with real results (albeit it's a game xD), and not so much so for adrenaline rushes or combat.  Gear is great-- not just armor and weapons, but lots of other stuff too.  You can replace limbs with robotic parts, use different-purpose grenades (including shrapnel xD), use medkits and trauma kits (the latter bring you back to life from a near-death encounter, but you don't have much inventory-- just 7 slots-- so it's not like this makes everything peachy.).. lots else Anyway, the characters are all different, it's not like your team consists of the same 5 people, per se, though your party expands in time- they all have personalities, and they don't all feel exactly the same toward you, and while most of them follow your leadership as far as I've gotten, there are differences that come up-- after something adverse, one of them wants to share alcohol with you (which gives you a choice-- do I drink in this game?  there are more than just two answers).  Naturally there are limits to how much impact you have on storlyine six times in a single conversation, don't get me wrong-- but usually, if I think about it, so's life.  -noroom			"

												I never played the table top or the MMO shooter no one else seems to have played either, but Shadowrun Returns hits all the important bits for a western RPG: flexible charecter progression, a plot that raises the stakes as you progress, comrades of drinking age, and a fun enviroment that doesn't need hundreds of codex entries to explain what the hell all is going on. Its good tactical fun for a reasonable price: beating the game won't make you sad to leave the charecters, but it will feel like you came from somewhere and did something. If that's not you cup of tea, go find a game where the protagonist has three love intrests he doesn't even notice in between beating up spiders and panther bear robots in his quest to slay god. I'm sure that is much better time spent...			"

												I highly recommend the Dragonfall update to Shadowrun Returns.  If you're not a Shadowrun fanatic and passed on the first offering, that's good. This new DLC/Campaign is a great place to start because it's a bigger, fuller, better realized game.  As far as RPGs go, this is a modern classic.  There are well-developed side-kicks, side-quests, and yes, side-arms (guns and cybernetic arms...lol? sorry.)  The characters and environment have that Baldur's Gate feel, not visually but in that they seem like people/places worth interracting with and even saving. I'm only about 6-7 hours in but it's worth recommending already.			"

It has a fantastic combat system, an immersive story, and some cracking dialogue, not to mention the setting itself being something to truly marvel at.

												Even if you're not totally familiar with the universe, if you're looking for a great tactical RPG to knock out in a few days? This is perfect. The whole thing is like having one big tasty snack that leaves you wanting more. But that's sort of the downside. It may not give you enough to entirely satisfy you. Which is better than feeling like it's one trudge, but you still wish for more. The user created levels and junk you can download are okay, but don't really match up to the same quality as the main campaign. That's just my opinion though. And it may not be quite that replayable, or at least not as much as you'd want it to be. Say you decide to be a Street Samurai. This means you probably wont be decking any computers. And while you'll come across a few situations where it'll help, all it really does is save you some time. Same for speech options. They're rare, and don't really offer any change in the conversation.But in the end, I'd still reccomend it. It still has a great short story to tell and a rich atmosphere. I'd say plan on buying the DLC rather than relying on the user created content to get your additional fix, though. At least until some of the more major projects are legitimately finished.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is not in itself a game. It is a platform that supports the creation and play of Adventures, both developer and community created. ""Dead Man's Switch"" is the initial campaign that you get at purchase and is a well constructed adventure. It has almost all the things you might expect to see and hear in a shadow run adventure. The combat is a xcom esque entertaining and at times very challenging. The characters are interested and likeable. The leveling system is more or less an intuitive waterfall setup. Attributes unlock skills, and skills unlock specializations i.e. Quickness[1] -> marksmen[1] -> rifles[1]. Though the game could do better on conveyance in general. Most important though is the adventure is fun and the game mechanics are solid.I do have minor grips with some of the unanswered mechanics issues and other game play short comings. But before that I can safely say that if you are a fan of shadowrun or have ever enjoyed playing the paper and pen or older SENS games you will enjoy this one.** My final recommendation: If you like Shadowrun you will like Shadowrun Returns - Dead Man's Switch **Now If you are interested in an runners ranting here are some of my misgivings about the game.-Characters should be persisten between adventures. Starting a new character every adventure is a little disheartening. (This being between Dead Man's Switch and dragonfall)-Send to stash: sending things to your stash doesn't seem to send said items to your stash.-Hit Chance: a legendary marksmen shouldn't consistently miss from half a room away just because the target is behind a half cover desk.-The lack of stealth is a real bummer, coupled with that is the lack of ability to use your etiquettes to aid in undercover stealth sections.-The absence of a local net on runs to disarm alarms, disrupt communication, shut off lights, lock doors, est. Mostly the disarming alarms before they go off bit.-Magic is also very spartan in comparison to the physical combat skills and interactions. You can summon spirits at predetermined locations-Having to run into an enemy or ambush to trigger combat mode is very disconcerting. The ability to freely toggle combat mode would have been greatly appreciated. -Riggers: Not being able to pilot drones outside of combat is a bit of a disservice to the rigger characters. As setup is a key part to the rigger play style. "

Shadowrun Returns retains the feel of a table-top RPG kind of campain, due to its origins. Dragonfall is a broader and deeper campain compared to Dead Man's Switch, where choices matter more, dialog has more branches, and the world feels bigger. And let's not forget how well Berlin lends itself to cyberpunk !If you're hesitating on getting the game or the Berlin DLC, I say go for it.			"

												Wow, the Dragonfall campaign really changed my opinion on this game. I didn't really enjoy Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign), it felt forced, linear, barren and dull. All that coupled with the game's inherent limitations and plenty of bugs, left a bad taste in my mouth. I do enjoy tactical combat and ""old-school"" RPGs, but I was about to give up on Shadowrun Returns.Then came Dragonfall. Still pretty much linear (though you notice it less this time around), still riddled with bugs (take old bugs out, put new bugs in, the development process kinda goes that way) and still with more or less the same annoying game limitations... yet it manages to outshine all these drawbacks with a helluva good story, enjoyable NPCs and character interaction, ambiguous moral choices that you can actually care about, challenging and entertaining combat and several new ways to do old things, including new tech and spells, plenty of skill checks (which also meant that no matter how good you got, you were never going to get the full information on everything, which is a good thing in my opinion). It's a huge leap up from Dead Man's Switch and has redeemed Shadowrun Returns in my eyes. Highly Recommended.I hope SR continues to give us content comparable in quality to Dragonfall, so that we can all put that Dead Man's Switch nonsense behind us. l found out bitterly what this game couldn't do when I played through Dead Man's Switch. But I just now found out what this game CAN do after I played through Dragonfall. And that is: BE ENTERTAINING!			"

												While shadowrun returns entrance andventure Dead Mans switch is certainly entertaining, the add-on Dragonfall is the one that really has a more inmersive feel in the Setting and a far improved storyline and characters, mi critique is basically that I would have liked to have more options to equip my team a little bit more but that is a minor nitpick I look forward to what Harebrained schemes may come up with next maybe rigged Vehicles and a new exotic location (Aztlan ?).

I've been enjoying this game a lot in short doses, I'm kind of using it as a primer for when Wasteland 2 is officially released. But it's a solid kickstarter game that I've heard has improvements made on it Dragonfall.

												This  kickstarter gem is under appreciated by the RPG community.

Not even considering the SNES original, if you are a fan of games like Xcom, Fallout 1 & 2 or Arcanum you should pick this one up. It may not match the complexity of these titles, but it nails the same retro feel, for which it deserves a lot of credit and your time.			"

Some technical issues to do with saving and combat from version 1.0 have been fixed. You actually go on Shadowrun runs, and there are a surprising number of moral choices that make you think.My only complaint is the game feels a bit like work near the end, but worth it.			"

												I finally got around to playing this game. Picture the gameplay of XCOM: Enemies Unknown mixed with a book roleplaying game. AKA Shadowrun. I've roleplayed a lot, although never Shadowrun. But it feels like a nice little adventure. I'd say the game lasts about 12-15 hours. It gets a little slow paced though, it's very text heavy. If it was voice acted I think that would add a lot to it, but I don't fault it for that. When you do get into combat, it plays almost exactly like XCOM. You get action points, 2 to begin with and you can either move or do an action like fight with those points during your turn. It's all turn based strategy on a grid. Overall I didn't find the combat to be very difficult, you hire a team before each mission to go with you but I played a Street Samurai and I was basically bread for combat.That leads me to the character creation, I picked a Street Samurai as I mentioned, but you can pick from quite a variety of characters to begin with and tweak them as you play with Karma points. Like leveling up in the book RPG's. These various character choices lead to different dialogue choices and even options on the battlefield. So there is definitely variety and replayability here.Speaking on replayability, this game also opens itself up to player stories and mods. You can download and create your own or others stories/adventures. So the game really has no end. It is certainly worth full price, but even better if you get it on sale. I would definitely recommend this game to any Cyberpunk style enthusiasts. If you liked XCOM you will like this combat system. Only gripe is all the reading. It makes me sleepy, but I pressed on and finished the main campaign and really enjoyed it.			"

												Its hard for me to put into words just how great this game is, I honestly can't sing enough of its praises to be truthful. The entire game is rich and full of atmosphere, really setting the mood for the setting it is placed in. The game had me firmly in its grasp the entire time I played it and not once did it let me go, never breaking character or form in a way that jarred me out of the experience.The game's character creation is really straight forward and easy to understand and especially flexible, so if you find yourself dislikeing the path you set yourself on but happen to like another class as long as you do so early enough you can more or less cross class and still be rather effective!The game is turn based so if that's your stick hop right on in! It's challenging, but not in the punishing way.  I've never had something in the game bad happen to me that was anything less than poor performance on my part. It's never made me feel like I've been cheated out of a win or into a death. Only that I made a stupid move and ended up dead or lossing the battle becuase I failed a requirement.Every character I ran into was full of life and unique in their own right, I've never met someone in the game I've even actively disliked! Well, save some of the villians and that was only in the sense of. ""Jeez, what a♥♥♥♥♥♥"" Rather than the usual, ""Ugh what a cliched loser."" The only real complaint I have in the area is that you dont really get to associate much with the some of the npcs. By that I mean become real tight friends with them. Ie: Lets say I stroll along and help out vendor A or give him something he wants. While it's acknowledged that I've done right for him verbally, they dont really give you any discounts or anything. Heck other than really asking them about their past and getting to be chummy with them you don't really get to interact with them much outside of that, save with the exception of like: Coyote. None of the npcs really give you any discounts and the like. Though if your playing the game right you wont really need the money to be honest. Though I suppose in the end its only really a minor set back if even one at all, considering that they were very three-d and interactive characters. It was a significant step up from all the two-d card board characters that you get for npcs a lot lately. I could actually feel and even would go so far as to say, loved going back to talk to them on a regular basis.Another thing I loved was the fact that I had all sorts of ways to solve any problem I ran into, each class had its own unique way to solve or deal with things that they ran into. Especially out of combat and I rarely ran into a problem that I couldn't solve in muliple ways myself. I'm going to stop here because I'm more or less fan girl rambling at this point, but seriously if you've got the spare cash to shell out for this game. Do it, it is well worth the price, I've frankly had significantly less fun on sixty dollar games. For fourteen ninty nine this game is a total steal. I can't believe I how lucky I got on the flash sale back with this, I almost feel half  guilty for getting it as low as I did.But long story short, the game is great, damn great if you wanna get down to it. I only hope that they pump out more dlc for this. All the content I've played so far is a massive explosion of awesome. Any of you guys still on the edge for trying it just give in. Trust me its worth that price and that much more if you can afford it.			"

If shelling out extra for DLC isnt something you're willin to do, the game is pretty mediocre and like 7 hours long. Unless it goes for super cheap during a sale I'd say give it a pass.

												If you've ever played 2nd Edition Shadowrun this is a huge nostalgia trip - if you haven't it's still damn fun.The majority of the game plays out like an old-school text-based RPG like Fallout (no voice actors required) and will have you investigating the death of an old friend through a variety of standard 2050s Seattle backdrops.Combat, when it happens, is very similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Each character has a set number of action points that they can use each turn to move, shoot, cast spells, control drones, etc. Normal difficulty shouldn't pose much of a threat (I think I've been killed twice) so once you have the mechanics of it down I'd suggest playing through on Hard or better.Slight spoiler for the main story: make sure you put some points into Shotguns.

												I recommend this only if it's on sale. Dragonfall I found more enjoyable than the base campaign, but it's still linear and short; given that user content comprises most of the gametime this release has to offer, I also only recommend it if it's on sale.When you purchase this, you are purchasing a clumsy game engine with a short, linear example campaign. I only narrowly gave this thumbs up, because of the fact that most of the game's potential comes from user-generated content, which is made by people who will not not be seeing any of the money you pay. The engine itself is clumsy because it takes a lot of fiddling to make it immersive; doors cannot be closed again once open, by default; you have to set each one up to do so, etc. Places that look navigable are sometimes not. There is a lack of cover in places where there sems like there should be.In short the product feels rushed, and most of the potential comes from people that are willing to work (for free)/adapt the tools released, rather than from the developers. Worth it if under 5$.			"

												Bottom line: If you like turn based combat and this game is on sale for 5-10$, go for it.Fun Factor: 70-73/100Game Time:  Around 30-45 hours.  I left the game on a few different nights, so chalk up 16-30 hours of Steam's ""recorded play time"" being from that.Mediocre turn based strategy that really didn't bring anything new to the genre.  The setting for the game is neat, it takes place in Seattle/Berlin and there has been a resurgence of magic use, different sub types of humans(Orcs, Elves, etc.), all blended with future technologies.  The stories are fun but mostly but are mostly predictable, leaving you with no real sense of wonder.  The dialog tried it's best, but it probably reads as poorly as this review, hah.  The combat isn't anything to get too excited about either, as it's basically dice rolling for accuracy of success and damage. Even at the highest difficulty setting, I didn't find myself all that challenged, which may be a blessing to those who just want to breeze through the game.  The inability to customize characters outside your main character is pretty lame and rather off putting at times.  I wanted to customize my own Shadowrunner hit squad...  I do recommend checking it out, but it certainly isn't one you need to get to right away.			"

												If you love the universe of Shadowrun and have been longing for a return to it, you've probably already bought this. If not, you should, the game is steeped in the atmosphere and world that many of us have loved for so long. Not only that, but the game is a fun, well written strategic rpg that moves at a good pace and harkens to games of old (especially the old SNES game). If you have no particular affinity for Shadowrun, it looks to potentially grow infinitely over time with an included scenario development kit, so it will be well worth picking up on sale down the line.

												Wow, where do I even begin? This is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Even if you have never played the SNES game, Genesis game, or the table top game, it's well worth your time and money. I never expected this game to be this good. The battle system is wonderful; if you've ever played a tactical RPG before, you'll be right at home. There are several classes to choose from, and all of them have their own special perks. The karma point system (leveling up) is pretty standard, and it's not very complicated. All in all, this game is the complete package for anyone who loves RPGs. Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on it.			"

												Great game... not quite like the original on SNES but still good gameplay. The story would have been better with voice actors, but it does not deter from the experience much. It is not too long which means that you can play this in between all the other hectic things in life. It is definitely easier than the SNES version (which is a good thing).			"

												Excellent game.  Great story and pretty sweet turn based combat.  Really felt like an old school RPG. The combat is not as intense as XCOM, but it's still fun and distributing stats to your character is great too.  Only thing is you are in charge of only one character and hire others to fill out your squad, which is okay but sometimes I wished I was able to assign stats to the characters on my team.  I did not encounter any bugs.  If it was a book it would be one of those ""I could not put it down"" type books			"

												This has been an interesting experience! Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.The skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here ) My two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..Pros:+ Beautiful Skill system+ Fun Gameplay+ Enjoyable storyCons:- Too Linear (for an RPG)- Very few side quests - Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!All in all did i fully enjoy this game? Yes Could i have enjoyed it EVEN more ? DEFINITELY YES Do i recommend it? well yes if you are an RPG fan you will enjoy this for what it offers. But maybe try and get it on a Sale as i did			"

												I just finished ""Dead Man's Switch"" of Shadowrun Returns and I really enjoyed it. Just a heads up before my review, the main reason I purchased this game is because I used to play the table top version of Shadowrun back in highschool. Just the product's name brings back great memories and my review (and enjoyment of the game) of course is partially biased due to this background. Here is a quick review for those interested in the title:What is ""Dead Man's Switch""?Think of Shadowrun Returns as the client, and DMS as the story you plug into it. There is also a DLC that I've purchased but not started yet that is another story for Shadowrun Returns. I'm hoping they will continue to support this product! Game Mechanics:Smooth, easy to learn, and well done. The game plays like the first Fallouts or the Baldur's Gate series as an overhead tactical turn-based gameplay. With that said you do not need any prior experience with this type of game to enjoy Shadowrun Returns. The menu, UI, and rpg elements are all straight forward. The only thing that bothered me about the combat UI was reloading my rifle, however I'm sure there was a hotkey I could've used. Story vs. Action:The biggest compliant I saw on my own research of this game prior to purchase was the amount of dialog. The team that created this game obviously aimed to reproduce a table-top setting that focused primarily on storytelling, not combat. There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

												This ain't your nephew's Dragon Age 2 or Witcher. Instead of going for needless voice-overs and cheesy cutscenes, this game aims purely for great dialogue - in written form. For the uninformed, dialogue in written form is a tradition which had been going on for many, many centuries.What you're getting here is an Old School western RPG, very reminiscent of the first two Fallout games. It shares two of their biggest strengths - great writing and interesting setting. The biggest detriment is that the gameplay here follows an extremely linear plot. That wouldn't be so bad, if the game also didn't feel so short. It's absolutely adequate for the price you're paying, but you can't help but feel like there's something missing when you arrive at the end. However, that may just be, again, because of the very, very good writing.Despite the fact that barely any dialogue choices and actions has a greater impact on the story, this game inspires one to play through it again with different characters and mindsets - just to read all the NPCs' reactions to all the dialogue choices. I can't stress that point enough. Some people notice the difference between 'okay' writing and great writing, and some think of AAA titles as high art.DRAGONFALL DLC:Dragonfall, in two words: Pretty amazing. For me, what really makes Dragonfall stand out in comparison with the original campaign, is the difference in plot structure.For one thing, the game is much less linear. There are several missions to do in the middle section of the game; these can be done in any order you want, and it's entirely possible to skip one (maybe even two) of those missions.Another major improvement is the fact that companions stick with you and are there to talk to after every mission. There are more than enough of these permanent companions hanging around that you never have the need fore hired companions. The original campaign had a great variety of interesting characters who would accompany you for a mission or two; here, they stick around and have new dialogue after every major mission. There's character development, and in the end, there's even closure.Which brings me to the ending. Bluntly put, it's really, really good - enough to be a major point in this review. While the original campaign left you no choice in the end and the feeling of closure was kinda missing, Dragonfall delivers both in the end, and it does so very, very excellently, too. You are not only given a very meaningful choice which has the potency to shape the future of the setting, but the consequences of that choice are also portrayed adequately. After the end of the game, you are given one more chance to talk to every NPC of the main hub, every one of your companions and even new NPCs, depending on your choice. There's closure for every character and your choice is possibly being questioned in some of the best dialogue of the game. But, lastly, the best thing about this DLC is that it delivers more of the old. Shadowrun shines when you get to interact with strong characters and are given absolutely free reign - the first Harlequin dialogue from the original campaign comes to mind - and there is much of that, here.

I got through both the Core Campaign(Dead Man's Switch) and the Dragonfall campaign, plus a few highly recommended fan-made campaigns, so I could get a feel of what I could do with the Editor. Dragonfall Campaign is REALLY good by the by. This editor is just maddening with the amount of stuff you can put into it. Completely free to write whatever, answers the players can choose from, map, tile, and prop placement. You can get damn creative with it. Whether you want to just run campaigns(Which you can get from Nexusmods or Steam Workshop easily enough), or create them, this Hobbit recommends this game.			"

												Shadowrun Returns original campaign:This is a very nice Shadowrun based game, with a good story and gameplay. However, it is a short game and as soon as you learn how to optimize the character skills (and the enemies AI failures...) it is an easy game, even in the very hard mode. Also, it is an extremely linear game, not giving you any options besides the main track of the story. Still, it is a great game and I strongly recommend it to shadowrun lovers, such as myself.Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall:This expansion package brings a very interesting and amusing story line. Definetively worth playing if you liked Shadowrun Returns original campaign. Note that it is not a continuation of the original campaing - you cannot bring your old character into this new campaign - altough some small references can be seem during the game. It is worth mentioning that this campaign is a little longer than Shadowrun Returns original campaign, but still a very linear game. Moreover, the dificulty level is higher than in the original campaign.			"

												I was always more Cyberpunk than Shadowrun growing up. It always seemed grittier, more serious. Then a while back I started getting interested in Shadowrun as a nostalga thing. So I tried Shadowrun Returns.The game taught me that I was wrong in underestimating the Shadowrun setting. Very very wrong. The campaigns that ship with the game and the Dragonfall expansion are fun. Linear, yes, but no more so than many other games. And there is an active and highly productive community churning out some seriously good campaigns.If you like turn based games, and you like the setting, I cannot recommend this enough. And once you're done with the ""official"" campaigns, spend some time in the workshop. You won't regret it.			"

												Even if you're not totally familiar with the universe, if you're looking for a great tactical RPG to knock out in a few days? This is perfect. The whole thing is like having one big tasty snack that leaves you wanting more. But that's sort of the downside. It may not give you enough to entirely satisfy you. Which is better than feeling like it's one trudge, but you still wish for more. The user created levels and junk you can download are okay, but don't really match up to the same quality as the main campaign. That's just my opinion though. And it may not be quite that replayable, or at least not as much as you'd want it to be. Say you decide to be a Street Samurai. This means you probably wont be decking any computers. And while you'll come across a few situations where it'll help, all it really does is save you some time. Same for speech options. They're rare, and don't really offer any change in the conversation.But in the end, I'd still reccomend it. It still has a great short story to tell and a rich atmosphere. I'd say plan on buying the DLC rather than relying on the user created content to get your additional fix, though. At least until some of the more major projects are legitimately finished.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is not in itself a game. It is a platform that supports the creation and play of Adventures, both developer and community created. ""Dead Man's Switch"" is the initial campaign that you get at purchase and is a well constructed adventure. It has almost all the things you might expect to see and hear in a shadow run adventure. The combat is a xcom esque entertaining and at times very challenging. The characters are interested and likeable. The leveling system is more or less an intuitive waterfall setup. Attributes unlock skills, and skills unlock specializations i.e. Quickness[1] -> marksmen[1] -> rifles[1]. Though the game could do better on conveyance in general. Most important though is the adventure is fun and the game mechanics are solid.I do have minor grips with some of the unanswered mechanics issues and other game play short comings. But before that I can safely say that if you are a fan of shadowrun or have ever enjoyed playing the paper and pen or older SENS games you will enjoy this one.** My final recommendation: If you like Shadowrun you will like Shadowrun Returns - Dead Man's Switch **Now If you are interested in an runners ranting here are some of my misgivings about the game.-Characters should be persisten between adventures. Starting a new character every adventure is a little disheartening. (This being between Dead Man's Switch and dragonfall)-Send to stash: sending things to your stash doesn't seem to send said items to your stash.-Hit Chance: a legendary marksmen shouldn't consistently miss from half a room away just because the target is behind a half cover desk.-The lack of stealth is a real bummer, coupled with that is the lack of ability to use your etiquettes to aid in undercover stealth sections.-The absence of a local net on runs to disarm alarms, disrupt communication, shut off lights, lock doors, est. Mostly the disarming alarms before they go off bit.-Magic is also very spartan in comparison to the physical combat skills and interactions. You can summon spirits at predetermined locations-Having to run into an enemy or ambush to trigger combat mode is very disconcerting. The ability to freely toggle combat mode would have been greatly appreciated. -Riggers: Not being able to pilot drones outside of combat is a bit of a disservice to the rigger characters. As setup is a key part to the rigger play style. "

												I recommend this only if it's on sale. Dragonfall I found more enjoyable than the base campaign, but it's still linear and short; given that user content comprises most of the gametime this release has to offer, I also only recommend it if it's on sale.When you purchase this, you are purchasing a clumsy game engine with a short, linear example campaign. I only narrowly gave this thumbs up, because of the fact that most of the game's potential comes from user-generated content, which is made by people who will not not be seeing any of the money you pay. The engine itself is clumsy because it takes a lot of fiddling to make it immersive; doors cannot be closed again once open, by default; you have to set each one up to do so, etc. Places that look navigable are sometimes not. There is a lack of cover in places where there sems like there should be.In short the product feels rushed, and most of the potential comes from people that are willing to work (for free)/adapt the tools released, rather than from the developers. Worth it if under 5$.			"

The setting for the game is neat, it takes place in Seattle/Berlin and there has been a resurgence of magic use, different sub types of humans(Orcs, Elves, etc.), all blended with future technologies.  The stories are fun but mostly but are mostly predictable, leaving you with no real sense of wonder.  The dialog tried it's best, but it probably reads as poorly as this review, hah.  The combat isn't anything to get too excited about either, as it's basically dice rolling for accuracy of success and damage. Even at the highest difficulty setting, I didn't find myself all that challenged, which may be a blessing to those who just want to breeze through the game.  The inability to customize characters outside your main character is pretty lame and rather off putting at times.  I wanted to customize my own Shadowrunner hit squad...  I do recommend checking it out, but it certainly isn't one you need to get to right away.			"

												Very good game. The same can be said for Dragonfall DLC. If you are just a fan of RPG's and are not bent on fantasy, although Shadowrun has elements of that as well, then you should get this. I hear there is a ""final cut"" version of Dragonfall coming. It is free if you own the Dragonfall already. Honestly, this was so good I would rather fork over $25 for a whole new game but I'll take what I can get.			"

Another nice touch are the player mods wich allows you to keep running the shadows after the main story is finished.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy rpg which functions similar to the X-Com or UFO series games, set in the Shadowrun universe. Pros: *Nice Artstyle*Simple yet effective combat and skill system, allows you to more or less build your ""class"" by picking which stats and skills you want to learn.*Lands the Shadowrun Universe pretty wellCons:*Very short playthrough (core game, not the Shadowrun: Dragonfall expansion)*This game is very easy on ""normal"". I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.Overall: 7/10Fun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.I would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.			"

												A great game, lovingly recreated to resemble the old super nintendo game I used to love.  The turn based gameplay works really well and the karma system for levelling up gives limited scope so decisions must be made carefully, rather than having a fully levelled up character before too long.  Dead Mans Switch felt linear and the responses felt as though they didn't really change the game outcome much, however the expansion, Dragonfall, addresses many issues including the ability to save anywhere.  Dragonfall is a much more honed Shadowrun campaign in my opinion and deserves an applause for the production team who clearly thought hard about the game story and characters.  A triumph.			"

												Overall, I would give this game a 9/10. Everything is fantastic, and I cannot wait to play Dragonfall someday and also play player-created campaigns. I am also inspired to pick up the paper and pen version of Shadowrun, as well as Shadowrun Online. It's just that Dead Man's Switch became quite disappointing. Just take it out, or give the players more freedom, and everything here would be stellar.*****Now for ***SPOILERS*** Kind of.*****I have not played Dragonfall, so this review is of the main campaign, Dead Man's Switch. I really enjoy pretty much every aspect of this game--the environment, combat, characters, atmosphere, etc.--except for the main story. Despite getting very interested in the storyline after the first few lines were presented to me, almost all of my excitement was lost when the Ripper was revealed. I was having fun treating DMS as a murder mystery; I was carefully examining everything and trying to figure out who the Ripper could be--I even had some evidence to support who I thought could be the Ripper--but the game pretty much points a huge sign at the real suspect from the moment they are introduced, and this is overwhelmingly disappointing. The other side of the story after the reveal doesn't even make much sense.			"

												My playthough was about 15 hours total. I went with a Troll who specialized in unarmed combat, and I really enjoyed the powerful hits that would sometimes one-shot enemies. Running into combat like a berserker was quite satisfying too, but  most of the time I would end up taking a lot of damage.  It was a little annoying not being able to get all the little secrets that require decking skills, but I managed just fine without the extra stuff.Pro:  Lots of community contentLots of class/race options and tons of ways to build a character, and lots of spells/skillsWell-executed turn-based combat with a cover system akin to X-COMGreat story that pulls you into the world of Shadowrun (very text-heavy, enjoyable for those who like to read)Con:The RNG seems off sometimes (e.g. a 90% chance to hit might fail three times in a row)The story is very linear, and there isn't a new-game+ option "

												Shadowrun returns was a kickstarter project that gained traction rather fast, although like most kickstarters this was due to nostalgia. This game stands on its own extremely well.Shadowrun returns is a cyberpunk fantasy tactical rpg, which in retrospective sounds absurd but its an idea that works really well and is amplified by the impressive dungeons and dragons art style.Typical for an RPG you level up with points gained from battles but what you put your points into in this case either help you or hinder you.Upgrades are apart of the experience and have a tradeoff mechanic, sacrificing one thing to gain something else, but comes into play later in the game.During my time with the game the battles were more interesting than the story and in an rpg story should be just as important as the rest of the game.The game stands on its own legs and is a good experience for someone who enjoys strategic rpg games and/or cyberpunk settingsRating: 8.5/10			"

												There are two camps that come to my mind. Those that enjoy being 'told' a story and those that enjoy 'telling' the story. If you are one who resides mostly in the camp of the former, then I tell you this:""Wait""There is absolutly no urgency in your purchase of this game, not yet anyway. The Shadowrun community needs to bolster its numbers with creative individuals, and get into crafting trinkets and stories. This game is an excellent tool to tell stories, and with the back-drop of cyber-punk in a world of magic, dragons, and elves one has many resources to craft tales of epic adventures.Now to those of the second camp, get your butts in here! We need more content, and the only way to ensure this is for you to help us in creating it. In due time, this will grow to be something absolutly amazing. Till then, if you do choose to purchase this now, 'Dead man switch' will be the first thing you will get to play through. It is a good introduction to the posibilities you as a story teller will be able to create.			"

												Cyberlike, tatical strategy, turn-based rpg. A lot of great things about this game however, there are a lot of flaws as well. The graphics are nice. The artwork is fantastic. The story is interesting. Shadowruns is a great series!Not to mention, the game editor produced some amazing community content.I especially love that it's compatible with my tablet pc. You don't need a keyboard to play. As a result, I spent my long subway rides progressing with the story which was a great way to pass time. However... this game is extremely linear. There are dialogue choices, but most of the time.. They don't matter. Most, if not all, dialogues end the same.Most importantly, the gameplay is extremely linear. There's not much exploration and the paths are clearly laid out for you. Adding to that, there are very very little side quests to actually do. There are just optional objectives that give you extra karma or help a little with the main quest. A little bit about the combat: Because it's turn-based, it takes a while for each battle. There's no way to speed up the process so battles often take longer than you'd expect. Adding on top of that, You can only save out of combat - Be prepared to finish or don't start it at all. Tldr;+ Interesting story+ Can be fun, depending on your own preferences+ Great time-passer+ Amazing artwork+ Great community content- Linear gameplay & plot- Linear dialogue - Slow combatDespite it all, Shadowrun Returns is a great place to introduce yourself and start the video game series. The sequels are a huge improvement as well. I recommend that you play it!			"

												An old classic is rebooted with the fluid and tactical combat of Xcom mated with a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy theme. The RPG dialouge is top notch and the characters are very fleshed out. Each character is unique independent of their race unlike most other RPGs.If you were ever a fan of Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Torment, or other infinity engine classics, highly recommend this and keeping an eye out for the Torment and Wasteland kickstarters. This is the first of many beautiufl reboots to come (although from what I hear this doesn't live faithfully up to the originals which I unfortunately never played having never owned the consoles needed).I would like to add the current campaign is moderate in length being shorter than most old and new RPGs. The main appeal is the mod kit which will allow for many, many campiagns and such. Also the dialouge while great does NOT affect the world greatly and is more for flavour than anything.Lastly I recommend not playing a Street Samurai. They are in bad need of balancing and it makes the game a cake walk once you unlock the ability to 'one-action kill' most enemies in the game.			"

												Solid Turned-Based RPG.I found the overall game to be solid.  Well written, enjoyable storyline wrapped with some great mechanics.  Complaints about a very linear campaign are accurate.  However, considering the price and solid execution, I feel that is more than forgiveable.  This isn't an RPG with lots of side content or derivative bits to distract you from the main story.  As mentioned, at $15 or even $20, I think that the offering is more than fair.  My only complaints are that while polished, the story and gameplay are forgettable.  The game is entertaining enough to pull you through the campaign but not memorable enough to bring you back for nostalgic purposes.  On the contrary, it will probably give you a craving for some older classics such as Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment or Fallout.			"

												This expansion for Shadowrun Returns (by Hare-Brained Schemes) evokes the old-school grand scope of classic Bioware RPGs.  More than just an expansion campaign, Dragonfall improves on the original engine in many ways, and responds directly to many complaints about the original.  Even better, it translates those improvements (like a new save system) to the original campaign as well, so folks new to the series entirely can enjoy the improved engine from the start.  The result is an improved product all around, and a memorable and enjoyable RPG set in one of the most fun alternate universes ever created.  An excellent set of custom creation tools add to the potential life of the game, as the mod community may well produce some masterpieces of their own, down the line.			"

												I never played the original Shadowrun (SNES and Sega Genesis, apparently), but after playing Shadowrun Returns, I'm going to find it.Shadowrun Returns is one of the few games in the ""RPG"" category that is, in fact, a Role-Playing Game. Unlike Dungeon Siege, Diablo, BioWare Game or Final Fantasy, Shadowrun actually requires you to interact with NPCs and the manner of those interactions actually impacts the game. Imagine that. So many games claim that NPC interactions affect outcomes, but this is the first game I've played in a while (not including the Elder Scrolls/Fallout 3 sub-genre) in which that's actually true.Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign) has a little bit of important dialogue, but Dragonfall (the first DLC campaign) is LOADED with character development and NPCs that actually behave differently depending on how you treat them.But the beauty of Shadowrun Returns isn't the official campaigns. It's the editor, and the integration with Steam Workshop. I've not actually used the editor yet, but judging from the vast range of quality in the user-created content, it must be pretty easy to use. On the one hand, that means a LOT of just pure garbage content. On the other hand, it means that learning how to use the editor isn't a stumbling block for somebody who's got a great story to tell.So while the original campaign is really quite good (I mean really, really good. It's one of the few campaigns of any game that I'm perfectly happy replaying several times in a row), Dragonfall really showcases what the game's engine is capable of.If you've ever played the old Fallout games (Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics), this is a lot like those. If you haven't played those, think of it as turn-based, squad-based Diablo, with almost no emphasis on gear. There is an equipment treadmill, but it's not very involved. More along the lines of Mass Effect 2.There are three or four pistols (for example), and you buy the most expensive one you can afford. So while there IS a reason to make more money and get the better stuff, it's not the need that it is in other games (Diablo, for example). Sorry to keep making the comparison to Diablo, but that's the other game I've been playing most recently.Shadowrun Returns is also one of the few games I've played that knows how to use a touchscreen. Most games work ""well enough,"" but SR has a touchscreen mode that makes it function beautifully. And by ""beautifully,"" I mean that the PC version plays just as well on my Dell touchscreen as the Android version plays on my Samsung Note 2.I don't know if anyone but me cares about that, but with the increasing prevalence of Windows 8, I figure it's worth mentioning.I know I'm making a big deal about Dragonfall, and I mean to. It's an excellent campaign, and is actually (in my opinion) worth the price of a full expansion pack, as opposed to the increasingly-common 2-dollar DLC. But I suppose I should really talk more about Dead Man's Switch. It's an engaging mystery with great characters. It doesn't have the meaningful dialogues and character developmnet of Dragonfall, but I was immediately taken with both Dresden and Kluwe. They're not ""important"" characters, but the fact that placeholder roles are filled with well-fleshed and well-written characters is just indicative of the attention to detail paid by the devs. It's a well-polished introduction to the world of Shadowrun.

												Okay, I finally have to write a little something after playing the Dragonfall DLC.First off, to quickly go over Shadowrun Returns:  Let me preface this by saying I am a kickstarter backer.  Back when SRR popped up on Kickstarter, I immediately jumped on board.  I'd been craving the old-school SR like the ones on Genesis and SNES which I played when I was hardly into my teens, and everything in the KS pitch sold me that this would bring it back to those days.  When SRR finally released and I played through it, I came out satisfied.  It has a solid and deep story, good combat (which has since been balanced and improved), fairly simple puzzles, and yes..it had some flaws like no manual saves (again, resolved since then), but it didn't really bug me that much.  Most of all, they made choice matter.And then along comes Shadowrun: Dragonfall.   Dragonfall absolutely oozes greatness.  There's insane depth of characters and the world, down to the smallest details, even in conversations with side characters like Simmy Kim and reading the Shadowland BBS.  It's a very rare thing where a game captures me so well that I sit and read every single piece of text I come across (and there's so much to read in this series).  I especially appreciated the design in this DLC of having the quest hub, but more importantly, there were so many more rich side quests throughout the campaign than in the base game.  They also upped the design on the puzzle elements a bit which I appreciated (the original campaign's were generally way too straightforward).  But enough of a wall of text, let's break things down:Story: Phenomenal.  Aside from the depth of lore in this world, the story of this campaign alone was so great.  Just when you     think you've got things figured out, something throws you for a loop.  You face lots of decisions that test your morals, many of which mostly seem to test just how close to ""the line"" you're willing to step, or if it's even a question for you.Characters: Great.  This time around, you've got a dedicated crew.  Sure, you could hire runners to go along with you, but the crew is where it's at.  They've got deep stories and I loved every bit of exploring them.  The SRR Dead Man Switch campaign had people occasionally joining you, like Coyote, but those companions pale in comparison to the attention given to the crew of Dragonfall.  I cared about my crew.  Hell, I felt bad that I always had to leave one member behind on my runs having only room for a team of 4.  I felt like I was neglecting them most of the game and that they were going to confront me about it at some point.Combat: Solid.  I played on hard difficulty, and essentially did the same rifle-focused street samurai build I did in SRR.  I found it much more balanced, and there were several missions with some real tension as the fights raged on.  The Matrix served a good purpose as well; it felt much more key to this campaign than the first.Graphics: Beautiful.  They already established this with SRR, they just painted a whole new world for Dragonfall's Berlin setting, and it's gorgeous.So that's it in a nutshell.Final verdict: Worth buying?  Abso-freakin-lutely.  This is an rpg not to be missed. "

												The game is enjoyable but plays like reading a book.  There are almost no side quests or options other than the straight through story.  Combat is simple and the matrix is simply combat in a differnet setting.  Don't buy it if you are looking for something deep but it makes for a weekend of fun.  I have hopes for more depth in Workshop offerings and future releases and will be happy to explore the offering in the future.			"

												If you're a fan of the old-school turn-based games, you'll enjoy this one.  If you're a fan of coorporate run futuristic dystopias, you'll enjoy this game.  If you're a fan of the table-top game that this is based on, you'll enjoy this game.The strongest point of this game is it's story.  The writing is fantastic and the world is immersive.  Walking into this world knowing almost nothing about it, the game gives you plenty of story to build off of.  Each of the characters feel like people and even the slang used in the game that's unique to the world is easy to understand, even for someone who has never came into contact with it before.The artwork for the game is superb.  The game combines 3-D and 2-D elements in the form of painted portraits for most NPCs and the 3-D element of game play.  The world itself isn't very interactable, but it isn't necessary.The game play can get very static very fast, especially with combat.  Once you figure out that the AI is going to react certain ways and the trick to not getting your face blown off, it can get dull quickly.  It's absolutely worth finishing the game, however, as the story is fantastic.If you're a fan of Baulder's Gate, this game will remind you of it in its play style.			"

												Some 18 years removed from the cult following success of the arcade style, cartridge era rpg shadowrun games.  This title puts a new face on a Gen-X classic.  Not to say it is a remake, although it does incorporate some of the characters i.e. Jake and a few others.  This (Dead mans switch) is a brand new story set a few years after the events we played out back in the mid-1990's.  The graphics may not be state of the art and the over all game play is somewhat cell phone app lvl.  However it is LOADS of fun.  Highly addictive and the replay value is surprisingly high although I personally feel that they could have spent a bit more time on programming the sub-missions instead of over-dramatizing the whole wanna-be detective angle which is already well implied.  To sum up.  This is Shadowrun the way it was MEANT to be as a video game.  Not great.  Nor is it trying to be anything more than advertised.  If you want to run the shadows instead of just reading about it in yet another dusty but well written novel.  Then here is your interactive 'BTL' of choice.  True nuff!Jim Lost4daze1 @Yahoo.com "

												A unique and original combination of fantasy and sci-fi, Shadowrun Returns is an RPG with solid turn-based combat system, interesting setting and story, and a complex but easy to learn levelling system, using 'karma' to upgrade certain abilities. Though the game campaign is pretty linear, and there is only one campaign, there are lots of different player-made missions available to get through the workshop. Worth getting if you're into cRPGs and stuff			"

												It's absolutely stunning. I love pen&paper RPG, but I had never thought I'd love classical cRPG until I played this game. It's based on one of best RPG ever, with brilliant setting and good rules. Every piece is in computer game. You feel almost like on RPG session, which is amazing in cRPG. Campaign is short, but it's so moddable, that replayability is incredible.And for that money (I bought it on sale, it's on sale once again and will be lots of times probably)- it's like stealing.

												Well,First of all, they added saving, which was a deal breaker for me.I understand the need for ""authenticity"" but it was too much.The GFX is nice, and the dialogs aren't bad.It's a solid RPG as long as you don't mind the simplicity of it.The mechanics themselves are complex, but the actual usage is limited.Playing on NORMAL is pretty simple so far, even a bit boring (which isn't a good inidication).We'll see if I enjoy it enough to reply on harder levels...

												A turn based game that can reside with the greats! fairly intricate character customization and creation although mostly in the skill area isntead of the looks. The story itself is really inviting and makes you want to continue so you can figure out the mystery just a little more, and if you finish the main story and wish for more to do, there is an expansion already as well as strong support from the community that create whole new stories for you to download and enjoy! expect to really get connected to these characters and environments even if there are almost no voice actors and all interactin is text based, the writing is just that good			"

												It was a pretty cool game. My favorite aspect was just the atmosphere. I'm into that techy almost post-apocalyptic feel. Everything was edgy and I really felt I had to rely on my wits and street knowledge. However I was really confused about the classes and karma upgrades. I felt like I needed to take some time to sit down and go through each section to understand what upgrades were good to get or worthless for my character. Another issue was probably the fact that you'd have a big advantage being a decker. A bunch of quests had only special decker options. Since I wasn't playing as a decker, I could almost never take those options. In general a lot of character development felt a bit off and weighed to one or two specific classes. I might try some of the workshop stories and see how those go, but all in all, I had a lot of fun, but it just stopped abruptly.			"

Posted: June 29, 2014
												This game totally rocks!!  It's a little old, and if you're looking for graphics and cosmetics, go elsewhere, cause those are things you won't find here.  But it has everything else.  Lots of interactivity, like you just don't find:  a lot of the decisions you make for how you say things are just your own flair, don't make a difference, but decisions you make in game impact things early on and forward.  Some of these decisions, naturally, Shadowrun being a logical universe, require you to be able to do it-- so if you don't have the skill in question high enough, it's not an option-- but not to worry, there are more than two ways to skin a cat sometimes, and there's pretty much always going to be more than one.  Sometimes, that involves creativity- like buying coffee if you figure out a solution for a street junkie who wants more money than you (may) have, even if you talk him down in price (though you might have enough) but is too out of it to be able to get down to the cafe for himself, so, insert errand, you pay less than you would have doing it straightforwardly-- though it's the future, and real coffee is still pretty pricey (for coffee).  You get money multiple ways for different things, including of course selling loot-- but so far in my playing the game there's more of an emphasis on selling mission items, specifically software you stole, and by completing jobs and/or tasks.  Tasks:  this is also how you level up.  In this game, trust me from the start, you *really* want to explore the world around you.  There are people to interact with you, and as often as not, the things they want from you can give you a karma point.  You don't know what will give you karma points, but it's not hard enough to figure out looking around and seeing things you can help people with helps.  Karma would seem an odd name for the resource for levelling, but it's actually not, because you can do things like get a junkie help-- which you hear more about later if you do.  Again, you can pick how you go about getting her to get help, too:   do you play it higher-than-thou, at least that's how I see it, do you talk logic to her, do you scare her-- you might have to do two of those at least, actually, but I only played through once.  Just on the earlier point.   But back to karma.  You get karma for beating mission objectives, which again do not just come up without chatting, looking into things and such, clicking on things to figure out what's going on in the world around you-- if interactivity does not appeal to you, this is not the game for you; it is not simply fighting.  If it does, it's more complicated than I make it sound in experience, because there are so many different things to interact with... it would be hard to categorize.  *Ahem!*  You explore, you complete tasks, you get karma....... and you level up!!  Leveling up takes up a lot of karma, and there's a whole lot to level up, so you have to pick and choose, but a lot of it you're just going to forget about anyway, because your character isn't specialized in hacking- oh you included that?  S/he is a super crappy fighter then, at least as far as I've gotten, but okay, that's what you get when you want to hack computers instead of being a gunslinger.  I kinda didn't like the extensive use of spell-like systems in this game to start with, but now that I've gotten more used to it, I just want to go all out when I have the credits and buy like everything and use it all.   The spell-systems are different, though they don't all get called that (there are three of them) and they're not as out of place as you may be thinking.  If you read about the game, bear in mind, there are guns and computers and hackers, but there are also trolls and ogres and dragons.  Just sayin'.   Oh.... the dragons are bad*** and you literally don't mess with them.  Taking down a dragon takes an army, not a small unit, generally speaking, and in this futuristic society the dragons wiped out large bodies of people before getting taken out... not all of them have been.   All of this is in the lifetime-recent past of the living, some of it having started *it's true* since after the game came out, presumably, but at any rate also before 2014, which is when I'm writing this.  Man, I've spent a fortune it seems on MMOs that I got sick of.... this game cost me under $5 while on sale and I can't get enough of it so far.  I'll get tired of it, too, but I'm definitely looking for another game for nothing again when I get tired of it... graphics aren't bad for being old and cheap budget, and I like reading the text better than listening, but oh, there is a lot of reading, did I say that?  lol... you have to read the conversations, no voice acting... it's all low-budget... just straight-up good creativity is what makes it such an awesome game.  Modding community too, though I haven't tried their work yet, no reason-- still playing through my first campaign.   So I highly recommend this game.... it should run on your computer if it's not a fossil, though I could be wrong, and I apologize if so.... this is the first review I've written for Steam, and the game definitely deserved some ""credits.""  Universe is scifi, if you missed that part, looks a lot cheesier than it is.  Lots of effects and ways to acheive them, grenades for instance that do different things, robots that do different things-- you have seriously limitied inventory, but you've got a killer size stash, so the limit is on missions (you can keep as much as you like, there's nothing there specifiying an inventory limit on your stash.)To tell the truth, there are still things I haven't figured out how to do in game yet, or if there's a way to do them (I'm pretty sure I level my own team too, but I don't know how-- or even how to switch out their gear) but there's a help me section I've been having way too much of a blast to wade through lmao.... I don't have the credits right now to buy Igger a new gun anyway lol.  You have time after every mission involving fighting to wander around town and do more missives that are just interaction and figuring stuff out (nothing requiring a high IQ, don't worry-- just be curious, that'll get you more than far enough), during which time you can stock up on supplies, sell stuff, tip a dancer, that kind of thing... have a cup of soykaf!  Woo-hoo! lololol.... World:  Well-drawn.  It's like reading a good book, really.  There's stuff happening, nothing boring, lots, and I mean lots, of drama, nevermind you're a cold-hearted professional cutthroat, you care about sentiment because everybody does in reality and so therefore do you.  You may be bad***, and your team too, but you all care.... I'm only a little way in but I play this game for interacting with a world in more ways than one, with real results (albeit it's a game xD), and not so much so for adrenaline rushes or combat.  Gear is great-- not just armor and weapons, but lots of other stuff too.  You can replace limbs with robotic parts, use different-purpose grenades (including shrapnel xD), use medkits and trauma kits (the latter bring you back to life from a near-death encounter, but you don't have much inventory-- just 7 slots-- so it's not like this makes everything peachy.).. lots else Anyway, the characters are all different, it's not like your team consists of the same 5 people, per se, though your party expands in time- they all have personalities, and they don't all feel exactly the same toward you, and while most of them follow your leadership as far as I've gotten, there are differences that come up-- after something adverse, one of them wants to share alcohol with you (which gives you a choice-- do I drink in this game?  there are more than just two answers).  Naturally there are limits to how much impact you have on storlyine six times in a single conversation, don't get me wrong-- but usually, if I think about it, so's life.  -noroom			"

												This has been an interesting experience! Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.The skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here ) My two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..Pros:+ Beautiful Skill system+ Fun Gameplay+ Enjoyable storyCons:- Too Linear (for an RPG)- Very few side quests - Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!All in all did i fully enjoy this game? Yes Could i have enjoyed it EVEN more ? DEFINITELY YES Do i recommend it? well yes if you are an RPG fan you will enjoy this for what it offers. But maybe try and get it on a Sale as i did			"

												I just finished ""Dead Man's Switch"" of Shadowrun Returns and I really enjoyed it. Just a heads up before my review, the main reason I purchased this game is because I used to play the table top version of Shadowrun back in highschool. Just the product's name brings back great memories and my review (and enjoyment of the game) of course is partially biased due to this background. Here is a quick review for those interested in the title:What is ""Dead Man's Switch""?Think of Shadowrun Returns as the client, and DMS as the story you plug into it. There is also a DLC that I've purchased but not started yet that is another story for Shadowrun Returns. I'm hoping they will continue to support this product! Game Mechanics:Smooth, easy to learn, and well done. The game plays like the first Fallouts or the Baldur's Gate series as an overhead tactical turn-based gameplay. With that said you do not need any prior experience with this type of game to enjoy Shadowrun Returns. The menu, UI, and rpg elements are all straight forward. The only thing that bothered me about the combat UI was reloading my rifle, however I'm sure there was a hotkey I could've used. Story vs. Action:The biggest compliant I saw on my own research of this game prior to purchase was the amount of dialog. The team that created this game obviously aimed to reproduce a table-top setting that focused primarily on storytelling, not combat. There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

Weak. Have to start over now and pick an all new path knowing what i know now. Which is no fun knowing that some classes arent as viable as others. Overall id give it a 6/10. Just fun enough.			"

												This is a decent tactical RPG. While the main campaign is very linear and focuses more on the combat side of things, the Daggerfall DLC offers a much broader experience with proper NPC's, a decent hub and some fun sidequests with more for non combat focused characters to do. There's also some decent looking community content out there, and I reckon I'll be putting quite a few hours in on this one. Definitly one to try if you enjoyed the classic CRPG's like Baldur's Gate or Fallout.			"

												Amazing writing, I really got into the characters in Dragonfall. There is a lot there if you put in the effort to talk to your team members and get their back stories. Combat has enough depth to be fun, but wasn't that challenging on hard. Definitely worth playing for the story. The game mechanics add value but are not enough by themselves.			"

												Even if you're not totally familiar with the universe, if you're looking for a great tactical RPG to knock out in a few days? This is perfect. The whole thing is like having one big tasty snack that leaves you wanting more. But that's sort of the downside. It may not give you enough to entirely satisfy you. Which is better than feeling like it's one trudge, but you still wish for more. The user created levels and junk you can download are okay, but don't really match up to the same quality as the main campaign. That's just my opinion though. And it may not be quite that replayable, or at least not as much as you'd want it to be. Say you decide to be a Street Samurai. This means you probably wont be decking any computers. And while you'll come across a few situations where it'll help, all it really does is save you some time. Same for speech options. They're rare, and don't really offer any change in the conversation.But in the end, I'd still reccomend it. It still has a great short story to tell and a rich atmosphere. I'd say plan on buying the DLC rather than relying on the user created content to get your additional fix, though. At least until some of the more major projects are legitimately finished.			"

												This has been an interesting experience! Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.The skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here ) My two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..Pros:+ Beautiful Skill system+ Fun Gameplay+ Enjoyable storyCons:- Too Linear (for an RPG)- Very few side quests - Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!All in all did i fully enjoy this game? Yes Could i have enjoyed it EVEN more ? DEFINITELY YES Do i recommend it? well yes if you are an RPG fan you will enjoy this for what it offers. But maybe try and get it on a Sale as i did			"

												I just finished ""Dead Man's Switch"" of Shadowrun Returns and I really enjoyed it. Just a heads up before my review, the main reason I purchased this game is because I used to play the table top version of Shadowrun back in highschool. Just the product's name brings back great memories and my review (and enjoyment of the game) of course is partially biased due to this background. Here is a quick review for those interested in the title:What is ""Dead Man's Switch""?Think of Shadowrun Returns as the client, and DMS as the story you plug into it. There is also a DLC that I've purchased but not started yet that is another story for Shadowrun Returns. I'm hoping they will continue to support this product! Game Mechanics:Smooth, easy to learn, and well done. The game plays like the first Fallouts or the Baldur's Gate series as an overhead tactical turn-based gameplay. With that said you do not need any prior experience with this type of game to enjoy Shadowrun Returns. The menu, UI, and rpg elements are all straight forward. The only thing that bothered me about the combat UI was reloading my rifle, however I'm sure there was a hotkey I could've used. Story vs. Action:The biggest compliant I saw on my own research of this game prior to purchase was the amount of dialog. The team that created this game obviously aimed to reproduce a table-top setting that focused primarily on storytelling, not combat. There are plently of short engagements throughout this product and I felt the combat was very satisifying. However, if you are the type that clicks quickly though dialog in other games you won't be impressed with this title. The best part of this game is the story and for those don't care about that and just want an action / adventure title should look elsewhere. If you have any direct questions please comment below! I just wanted to hit those two points since they I felt they were not communicated well in other reviews.			"

												Shadowrun was a breath of fresh air for me.IAmongst hordes of MOBAs and shooters, an classic RPG like Shadowrun definetly stands out. Intriguing setting, fusion between science fiction and fantasy create an unique noir-ish atmosphere of futuristic coroprate-ruled world. The closest game to this that has been released recently is probably only Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Great writing, beautiful system and stylish graphics makes you wish to play it again and again. However, main campaign, while   engagin and entertaining is relatively short. Luckily, with the integration of Steam Workshop, that could become a reality, with steady flow of well-crafted user-created content. Can't wait to play it again in my free time.9/10.			"

Dead Man's SwitchShadowrun Returns. Indeed it has... this intriguing isometric RPG is a great combat system wrapped in a rollicking mystery that although has a few stumbling points, it is very much worth your time. Returns comes with a built-in campaign that will last you 10-12 hours if you take your time, and with plenty of mods in the community to keep it fresh. GameplayShadowrun Returns has a basic isometric movement system, just click where you want to go/interact with. It's when you get into the easy-to-learn combat system that the game really opens up. You can create your Runner to be a Sorcerer, a Drone-using mastermind, or just a guy with a shotgun that shoots people in the face. The RPG system is good, not overly complicated, and has good conversation trees that can be affected with different levels of Charisma. You can even role-play what type of things your character is knowledgable in. Overall, the gameplay of Shadowrun Returns is slick and stellar. StoryShadowrun Returns has a story that doesn't quite work on the empathy stakes... there's no reason really to care for any of the characters you meet, and some of the Runners you can hire are simply generic. If they die, it's just a *shrug* and leave them behind. However, the actual mystery behind the game and what's going on I found to be motivating enough... although it starts off slow, you want to meet the 'Ripper' until you actually stop playing the game- though after you've met him, things really start to get interesting... Graphics, Atmosphere, and SoundThe graphics of Shadowrun are servicable; sure, they won't dazzle you, but they aren't bad either. It has a nice art-style to make the world come to life, and the character portraits help give you first impressions of the characters, as well as the information that comes through text-wise.The atmosphere is great, with dank hotels and rain-drenched streets beckoning your Runner on. The characters are as fleshed out as you can get in a 'short' campaign as the Dead Man's Switch, but personally, I won't miss any of them. The music quality in this game is impeccable. If you are a fan of electronic music, you won't regret listening to the tracks that are on offer here. 'Double Cross' is my personal favorite track. The additional sounds of guns and sorcery that permeate the air whilst fighting adds to the atmosphere. ConclusionShadowrun Returns, A Dead Man's Switch, is a joy to play, and although the story has a few hiccups and the companion system leaves a lot to be desired, the game is overall a solid reccomendation. Worth your time indeed. Ready to deck into the system?			"

												I really enjoyed the game. Shadowrun has a very interesting world and good dialog. The combat system is okay, fairly standard for a turn based tactical game. Downsides were few: selecting things in combat can be clunky, leading to mis-clicks and an inability to move some characters where you want them: the game overall was quite easy as well. I didn't have a single character die, or even get close to death in the campaign and I don't think this is because I played particularly well. Money was very readily available, to the point where I could buy anything I wanted. Overall a good game, mainly for the story, novel setting and dialog.			"

												Undoubtedly beautiful, quite immersive and relatively nonlinear. The greatest drawback of this game is the p&p RPG system it's built upon. I personally find it to be one of the least attractive p&p concepts, doubly so because it invades one of my favourite genres; cyberpunk. Personal buttrage aside, it is a smooth and decently long RPG with a good albeit uninteresting combat system. Play it for a laid-back adventure with a Dreamworks aroma, best enjoyed inside a duvet with plnety of bulk confectionary. [7/10] (personal bias) [8/10] (buttrage aside).			"

There's also some decent looking community content out there, and I reckon I'll be putting quite a few hours in on this one. Definitly one to try if you enjoyed the classic CRPG's like Baldur's Gate or Fallout.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is not in itself a game. It is a platform that supports the creation and play of Adventures, both developer and community created. ""Dead Man's Switch"" is the initial campaign that you get at purchase and is a well constructed adventure. It has almost all the things you might expect to see and hear in a shadow run adventure. The combat is a xcom esque entertaining and at times very challenging. The characters are interested and likeable. The leveling system is more or less an intuitive waterfall setup. Attributes unlock skills, and skills unlock specializations i.e. Quickness[1] -> marksmen[1] -> rifles[1]. Though the game could do better on conveyance in general. Most important though is the adventure is fun and the game mechanics are solid.I do have minor grips with some of the unanswered mechanics issues and other game play short comings. But before that I can safely say that if you are a fan of shadowrun or have ever enjoyed playing the paper and pen or older SENS games you will enjoy this one.** My final recommendation: If you like Shadowrun you will like Shadowrun Returns - Dead Man's Switch **Now If you are interested in an runners ranting here are some of my misgivings about the game.-Characters should be persisten between adventures. Starting a new character every adventure is a little disheartening. (This being between Dead Man's Switch and dragonfall)-Send to stash: sending things to your stash doesn't seem to send said items to your stash.-Hit Chance: a legendary marksmen shouldn't consistently miss from half a room away just because the target is behind a half cover desk.-The lack of stealth is a real bummer, coupled with that is the lack of ability to use your etiquettes to aid in undercover stealth sections.-The absence of a local net on runs to disarm alarms, disrupt communication, shut off lights, lock doors, est. Mostly the disarming alarms before they go off bit.-Magic is also very spartan in comparison to the physical combat skills and interactions. You can summon spirits at predetermined locations-Having to run into an enemy or ambush to trigger combat mode is very disconcerting. The ability to freely toggle combat mode would have been greatly appreciated. -Riggers: Not being able to pilot drones outside of combat is a bit of a disservice to the rigger characters. As setup is a key part to the rigger play style. "

												You! Yes, you.  You like fantasy RPGs? You like strategy games? You like Sci-Fi? Ever wanted to mash 'em together into a delicous nerd smoothie?  Then do we have a product for you.If you're an XCOM fan, the mechanics are pretty straightforward to you.  Honestly, Shadowrun Returns as simply a game is good, but not great.  The Karma system for leveling allows you to customize your character however you like with no limitations on class, though you'll want to specialize as you approach endgame.However, Shadowrun Returns -- Shadowrun as a whole -- is so much more than a game.  It's a living, breathing world; a technologically heightened and magic-infused setting for stories of any kind.  Plots might hinge on the epic and esoteric (dangerous research into blood magic by a ruthless, profit-hungry megacorp) or the throwback noir with a twist (being hired by a dead man to find his murderer).  Sure, most of the RP of this RPG happens via old-school plain text, but you know what they call plain text in most places? Books. It ain't broke, so don't fix it!Character creation remains fun to me, even after a few playthroughs.  It's pretty neat to tell your friends about your human shaman/street samurai who packs enough heat to take on a militia even before summoning his elemental spirits.  Or about your pink-haired elvish techno-wiz equally at home jacking into corporate Matrix blocks or rigging into her homemade combat drones with her very mind.  Moreover, the skills your character chooses will assist them outside of combat, unlocking alternate routes, hidden passages with loot, chances to solve a problem diplomatically (with added EXP!), and more.The campaign that ships with the game, Dead Man's Switch, is a bit short but satisfying nonetheless.  It's an excellent introduction to the Shadowrun world, and veterans of the series will even see a few familiar faces.  Dragonfall, the DLC whose remastered version will drop tomorrow, is just plain phenomenal.  And that's not even touching the free Steamworks fan-made campaigns, some of which are truly brilliant.  Harebrained Schemes, the devs of Shadowrun Returns, have reminded us that a great game doesn't need 60 fps or 360-noscopes. You just need solid mechanics, a fascinating setting, and some hardcore writing chops.Be sure to check out the pen-and-paper Shadowrun RPG, too!			"

												As a first time experience, this game had me really enjoying the whole concept of shadowrun. I must say as someone who wasn't a fan before, this game had really opened up my experience and mind to the world of shadowrun.Gritty, dark and futuristic environment really appeals to me as I was not a fan of cyberpunk before, however this game has really helped introduce this genre as its environment was well designed enough to keep me interested.However, some gameplay elements can be rather repetitive and the base storyline is rather bland, however the additional campaigns online makes up for it, thank goodness for indie campaign creators (do mind me if i used the wrong terms, am new at this)Overall, a 7/10, good game, and great way to introduce people to the cyberpunk genre.

												Finished Shadowrun returns last Monday.From my blog: http://www.dyle.org/blog/?p=233Played fully on Linux with Steam (native, no Windows Emulation).You play a character in the Shadowrun universe which is on the hunt to bring down a friend’s murderer. Time is around 2057 but due to the Awakening, the world is filled with science fiction high tech and fantasy elements alike. You have genetic modification, cyberplants and hacking warfare along with elves, orcs, dwarfes and trolls hurling magic bolts. A rich and fascinating universe.… you have to work trough yourself. The game can be summed up by the phrase “too less”. At first there is too less background for the setting, the story. You just start off creating a character, like an orc, with cybernetic implants. Yep, no explanation to this. If you want to find out more about the Shadowrun world you have to look elsewhere but not the game.Then there is too less RPG. Seldom you find something useful to pick up and equip. Also stats and skills are presented in a very sober way in a plain matrix. No introduction, no nothing. All at once, on page. Also you likely will spend points on attributes and skills you don’t need in future. Sorry, there is no turning back.Then there is too less adventure. The story is nice, but you got not real decisions to make. The storyline is very linear. There are some side-quests, but guess: too less.Then there is too less of a challenge. At the first two thirds of the game. I pimped my elf with quickness and assault rifles and the game was no real match at “normal” level. Strategic fighting is nice and … easy. Yeah, the games picks up some pace in the last third and starts to get harder. This is were the fun really sets in. But up to then it is playing a nice story …And someone always has the idea of something missing. Something’s missing at the RPG, at the adventure, at the combat game, at the grafics, animations.E.g. Harlequin is one of the coolest elves I’ve come along in playing games, but when he wields his sword he is animated as if someone had stiffed a broomstick right along his “back”. The in-game representation is missing the charisma and style this elf has in dialogues.Finally the save game mechanics are just bonkers. Actually you just can save at the start of a level, better: the game (hopefully) autosaves at this stage. Making a wrong decision at the end of a level requires to replay to whole level again.The pro: once you’ve delved into the universe the plot is great to play and the dialogs are really nice written, the combat is fun after all. It remains a nice game. Hopefully they fix this bad savegame mechanics and give more universe background information in the DLCs and patches to come.			"

												For years now I've considered old-school isometric genres to be 'my' genre. That is to say, the one that strictly caters to my sensibilities as a player. I discovered them well after their golden age, and since this wave of kickstarted CRPGs began I've been eagerly awaiting their results.As the first one out of the gate from this batch, Shadowrun Returns does not disappoint. If you're like me and you've been aching for a deep and immersive roleplaying experience and actual agency when it comes to solving problems, this game is a steal at $20. Excellent writing, beautiful environments, and a fantastic soundtrack all tied together with engaging combat and character progression.The campaign will take you about 15 hours to run through, and there's sadly little in the way of extended diversions, and the game is rather linear in how it progresses. There's not much of a sense of an 'open world' that one would expect from this genre, but even still the world itself is one of the most well-realized and vibrant ones I've seen in a long time.They've got another campaign on the way, and you're going to see plenty of gameplay content coming out of the steam workshop, so I can guarantee you'll have your money's worth in actual meaty game.If you like RPGs at all you owe it to yourself to grab this game and play through it. You'll be really glad you did.			"

												Less than I hoped for.Shadowrun feels half-baked in a couple of ways:1) The writing was made with care, but there are far too many allussions and jargon phrases that are used without explanation. It feels like jumping into a conversation after its started2) The games menus and iventory don't seem to be finished or have all the detail other games might.3) The game is short. Like really really short. For an RPG, that's usually dissapointing.4) There's all kinds of class/skill options, but there usefulness seems questionable.But there's a silver lining!Combat system has potential, there could be great mods.Puzzles were clever and challenging.The universe is fascinating.Art style is beautiful.

												Did you like fantasy games with elfs, orcs, trolls and magic? Now put it in a dark cyberpunk world with guns, tecnology, hacking. That is Shadowrun Returns.It was based from the tabletop game Shadowrun, and it is amazing. If you like playing tabletop RPG games, you must read the books.Now, back to the game, it have a really nice character creation, you can chose a class or make your own. Turn based combat like XCOM.The only thing down for me was that i tought the Dead Man Switch story was very short, but fun anyway. Thanks we have a lot other to download in the steam workshop.If you like old school RPG games, with a lot of text, deep story and some tatical action this game is your game.			"

												This game is absolutely great from top to bottom. The main game is a well written and well paced piece of murder mystery cyberpunk action, made with great writing and interesting characters. The writing is so good, in fact, that even characters that show up just once or twice feel really memorable. The graphic style and musical design are top notch and really help make the experience into a cohesive whole. The gameplay is a solid tactical RPG experience that's fun to play, if a bit on the easy side more often than not. The few downsides to the game start with the lack of manual saving. The game automatically saves at checkpoints (probably to prevent save scumming like some other tactical games) which can sometimes be frustrating. The locked angle camera usually is okay, but there are times where it's a problem. Some people will call a 12 hour, very linear main campaign a problem too, but I personally think that it's better to have 12 high-quality hours than 20-25 with lots of filler. So it's not perfect, but it's damned well done. And the inclusion of an editor means that in the end we'll hopefully see a lot more great content from the community.			"

												If you're new to Shadowrun, like me, and not sure whether it's worth buying, the questions is: do you like detective fiction? Because that's exactly what SR is. That means you have to read a lot.Another thing to consider is visual simplicity. Shadowrun Returns looks good, but don't expect much on that side. It won't show you stunning cutscenes or SFX. It'll describe all that in a text box instead. Yeah, just like in 90's.So if these things don't scare you, give it a try and maybe in half an hour or so you'll be completely immersed.			"

												Being new to the PC/Steam community, I was astoniished and a little overwhelmed when I began browsing the Steam store for the first time. Something I am sure many people have experienced.I kept at it and as I searched through the  of numerous titles available along came Shadowrun Returns.....Now, I have been gaming for many years and one of the highlights was playing Shadowrun on the SNES (Super Nintendo). This game was such fun and the world so diverce, it is one of those gaming experiences you never forget!To find this gem among so many other great titles on Steam made my day, a chance to return to the Shadowrun world.The setting is a future Cyber Punk world, centred around a strong story driven experience with RPG/Turn based action elements. It is a game you can play when you want to lose yourself for an hour or often more. It is not as complex as other turn based stratergy/RPG titles, but still as rewarding due to an excellent murder mystery story line. It is above all an excellent place to start for people wanting to give this type of game a go. I have not played the other subsequent titles that have been released, but fully intend to as they each in turn expand the game and it's complexity with new functionality. Just check out the reviews/videos for the rest of the series available! For the price it's a steal for any gamer and will open up a new exciting experiences. Just like the SNES game did for me many years ago.Give it a go, you won't be dissapointed. "

												I marathoned this game. It is fantastic. It reminds me of Infinity Engine games like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, only the combat is much easier to wrap your head around. The setting is cyberpunk (William Gibson and Neal Stephenson specifically) mixxed with high fantasy. The module that is included in the game is a fun story, but don't be surprised if you call out plot points well before they happen. I've only played through it once, but my class choice (decker) seemed pretty useless in most situations. I am hoping Harebrained Scheme puts out a few more modules of their own.There is a module creator and it looks like the community has put out quite a bit of content on their own. I'm looking forward to sinking a few hours investigating that over the weekend.			"

												This game had an excellent sense of immersion in to the world of Shadowrun. I have enjoyed playing both the released main content of Shadowrun Returns as well as many of the player workshop campaigns. One of the biggest selling points was in shipping a very useful editor that put the power of creating these campaigns in the hands of the player community.That being said there are a few rough spots. The current save system (which appears to be replaced in the next DLC Dragonfall) only provided save points at the start of a map, which means in order to save ones progress you would have to complete the section you were on and move to the next load in area for it to record your progress. The replayability was also argueable. While I enjoyed some of the subtle changes each class could bring to the different dialogs and oppertunities that would arise, the game is unfortuantely very linear. Even with those subtle changes the overall story will progress the same way. The linear story did, however, showcase many different aspects of the Shadowrun world and in my opinion was successful in introducing players to different creative aspects they could explore while making their own content for the game. You have sections of story running through the matrix, attacking a corporation and even fighting through zombies. For 20$ I found the game to be worth my expectations and have played a total of 58 hours so far between main story and workshop content. I have no regrets with my purchase.			"

Downsides were few: selecting things in combat can be clunky, leading to mis-clicks and an inability to move some characters where you want them: the game overall was quite easy as well. I didn't have a single character die, or even get close to death in the campaign and I don't think this is because I played particularly well. Money was very readily available, to the point where I could buy anything I wanted. Overall a good game, mainly for the story, novel setting and dialog.			"

												PROPER REVIEW PENDINGWhile I am enjoying this game so far, I cannot recommend this game to anyone except die-hard Shadowrun fans. The gameplay is quite shallow and almost completely linear, the interface is clunky and designed for tablets. There is no exploration, poor documentation, and equipment selection is limited. Dialog choices are meaningless for the most part, and you cannot save the game except for advancing checkpoints, which also means no going back if you missed anything. Fallen enemies disappear and cannot be looted, and class/skill balance is poorly implemented. For a 2 million dollar budget from kickstarter alone this is a disappointment.What Shadowrun Returns really is, is a game engine and development toolkit, whose true merit has yet to be seen, with a short adventure included. This could be a good thing, but only time will tell. I see the potential for great things with this game but in my opinion that is not a selling point at this time for anyone but modders.However, as a Shadowrun fan, I am thrilled to be back exploring the neon lit slums of 2055 Seattle. The level artwork is the highlight, with the music adding to the atmosphere. The 3d character models are quite crude but fit in with the world when you are actually playing, just don't expect to get interesting looking armour for your character. There is no voice acting, but for a video game the writing is a pleasant surprise though that isn't saying much.All said and done, I don't regret preordering Shadowrun Returns, but if you are curious about the setting I recommend picking up one of the books until this game goes on sale.

												After wanting to play Shadowrun for the longest time, tonight I finally finished it. The game was not that long with its 12 hours of game time, and to be honest, it was quite a disillusion. After finishing Baldur's Gate 1 for the first time two weeks ago, I was looking forward to another isometric RPG. Being a big Deus Ex fan, the cyberpunk theme of Shadowrun Returns was very alluring. Being unfamiliar with the Shadowrun franchise, the mix of cyberpunk and fantasy felt weird at first. But even in the end, I can't say that I like it better. I'll try to summarize my experience with this game in a pro/con list.PRO  The 2D backgrounds are from time to time quite beautiful  The user interface was quite ok, and looked sleek  The first half of the story was interesting  Interesting combination of combat going on in the matrix and in real life at the same time.  The game worked quite well on Linux (except for the remarks below)  The game was easy to play with keyboard and mouse, but also with the Steam Controller on my TVCON  The game did not handle ""exotic"" resolutions well. 3200x1800 on my linux laptop and 3440x1440 on my desktop were not manually selectable. Log files mentioned that the game detected the native resolution but a slightly different resolution was chosen. The drop down menu never showed the native resolutions in game. Full HD on my TV was easy.  When contacting the developer's support for the issue above, no support was given. I got an email confirming that they received my email, and that's the last thing that happened.  The loading screens took quite long for a ""2D"" game. I would expect it to be faster than games like Skyrim?  Classes seem very diverse, but they don't feel diverse.   Leveling is quite boring. Not a lot changes exect for some % to hit etcetera.  Fights are repetitive because there are not a lot of different tactics (necessary). The AI is not very bright.  During combat sequences the game goes turn-based, even when all enemies are killed you still keep walking turn based until you find new enemies in the same environment. Moving your whole team person by person is very tedious.  When going on missions you pay mercs to come with you. They are not very strong or optimal in their configuration, so they felt like dead weight compared to my maxed out SMG fighter.  Hacking/Matrix sequences are very repetitive. Both for the looks of the environment and the variation in enemies and variation in weapons. I just spammed my default attack and nothing else was needed.   The game is very linear. There are not a lot of side quests and you can't explore the world on your own. There is no open world to visit.  Because of the linear gameplay and uninteresting classes, replayability suffers a lot.  The story of the game started out great. It felt like a personal story compared to the ""save the world"" kind of stories from Skyrim and company. But from the middle of the game it felt like the writers had to keep making the story more elaborate to keep the gamers interested. They created some complex and unnecessary twists that ultimately made me just click faster through the conversation options because I became uninterested.  Those conversations were often very onesided. The choices you make in conversations almost never matter. Most answers are just different forms of the same answer, making conversations very uninteresting. There is no real impact on the game.  The writing of the game is obviously inspired by the Sprawl trilogy, and tiringly so. Every sentence tries to be drearier than the last one. I like film noir and cyberpunk, but this was way too cliché at times.  The world of Shadowrun combines cyberpunk and sci-fi with fantasy. Obviously a lot of people like this, but I'm not really fond of it. It gets worse when they try to mix even more classic (cliché?) game themes in the mix: violent crazy people in an asylum, undead ghouls, monsters and even spirits!! It just lacked some pirates and vampires...  The (hand drawn?) backgrounds were nice from time to time, but they are very empty. There is not a lot of animation or interactivity. The world feels dead.  The music is nice. I mean, the 3 or 4 tracks that are constantly repeated are nice the first time. They sound perfectly in line with the cyberpunk theme, but after having it on repeat for 12 hours, I just disabled the music altogether.   The game is quite short. I finished it in about 12 hours (thoroughly reading everything), and it seems like I'm slow compared to others. Some did it in 8 hours. Sadly, I was happy that it was over.I was looking forward to play the complete Shadowrun series, but after being let down by the first installment, I just can't bring myself to buy the sequels. Even if they are better... Too bad really! I hope that the other famous tactical 2D Kickstarter games like Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity can make up for this game.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It may focus too heavily on combat at times, but I still enjoyed it. I felt like the game represented the source material very faithfully even including the vocabulary runners and people on the streets would use. Aside from the vocabulary I mentioned (which might understood using context clues) I also feel the game does a good job of introducing the Shadowrun universe. I play the the Shadowrun table top and love it soooooo.....this review may be biased.At any rate I would reccomend it.			"

												Cyberpunk RPG with turn-based, tactical combat based on the pen and paper RPG for the same name. This game is a successor to the Genesis and SNES Shadowrun games, with references to both throughout and is set around the time of 1st/2nd edition Shadowrun - the 2050s. The soundtrack is actually composed by Sam Powell and Marshall Parker, the composers of the Genesis and SNES games respectively - hardcore fans of the SNES game will LOSE THEIR♥♥♥♥♥♥when they hear familiar melodies and phrases in the midst of some of the games tracks.That said it's a solid RPG with a great art style, the included campaign ends about 10-12 hours in but is well written and contains every Shadowrun trope there is (cyberware, shamanic totems, decking, runs on corporate facilities, slaughtering gangers, conspiracies, Harlequin, etc.)More importantly, the fully featured (and almost intuitive) editor it comes with lets you and other members of the community put out their own adventures. You are essentially purchasing not only the adventure that comes with the game but also the framework to play all the stuff the Shadowrun community will be putting together through Workshop.If you love Shadowrun, cyberpunk, RPGs, turn-based tactical combat and community content this is the game for you. If you want another triple-A shooter with RPG elements loaded celebrity voice acting, poorly-used military jargon and regenerating health, move along to the next publisher-funded bore.			"

												As mentioned in other reviews, character modeling could be better, and the music could have more variety, but I've greatly enjoyed playing it. It's not a long campaign, but it's not so short. It took me 15 hours to finish it, and I loved every one of them. The best points, imo, were the background (as I've been roleplaying since the 80's and I used to love the original paper rpg), and the story. I think this campaign had a lot of what Shadowrun players used to love, with a strong storytelling, beautiful sets and 2D artwork, and enough of the cyberpunk world to fit a story of this length (not too much, not too few).And for the weakest points, I've missed looting bodies after a shooting, and that kind of stuff, but I guess it's just a balance factor to get rid of and simplify the system. But as I started the game with a pistol, and my oponents had shotguns, I could have used one of those, and sell the others! xDAnyway, I highly recommed playing it, it was great fun and made me want to play the paper rpg again! :)			"

												Rating: 7/10Budget: Worth it. Replayability: Low - The story doesn't change enough to warrant an additional playthrough. Length: Good - Custom missions too. Shadowrun Returns is actually a really great game. I have a few issues with it. You have to pick a playstyle extremely early in the game, and it's very difficult to know what is the right choice for you - Especially seeing as you have no way of controlling what classes your companions in the game will have. This is actually a much bigger problem than one might initially think. I tried going for a non-combat build, actually. I wanted to be the ""face"" of my party, but have my goons fight for me. Didn't work out - impossible to play this way. You HAVE to be able to fight SOMEHOW, so this was a letdown for me. Especially considering how much of the game you can actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t your way through later on. It's also fairly easy to make a character who is simply so good at fighitng that you can kill everything the game ever sends your direction. The games combat system is a bit rough and while a good translation from actual shadowrun, there's a reason that system is a bit of a cult novelty - It's just very rough in general. Over-all good game, but read a guide or something to save some frustrations.			"

												I know who Jordan Weissman is and am aware of many things he's done, but I had no idea Shadowrun was anything more than a video game, much less something of his; all I've ever known it as was, until this version, a Super Nintendo game.

Damn Magic: The Gathering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, keeping the cool stuff all to yourselves <.< It hits like 20 of my sweet spots....its a cyberpunk Blade Runner-esq style (does anyone else remember Johnny Mnemonic? it smells a lot like that, only good.), its an isometric turn-based RPG like those of old (FALLOUT!!), etc. Now I gotta buy Dragonfall when it goes on sale, until then I'm gonna toy with some of the user-created campaigns on the Workshop to see what people can do with the tools available to them.I'd give an actual, proper review/recommendation, but honestly considering its age and history, if you care about Shadowrun (or anything else bearing Jordan Weissman's name) at all, you probably already know more about it than I do, I have to google certain words they use to understand what they're saying xD but I really dig the atmosphere and the gameplay is...well, Blade Runner-style isometric turn-based (AP system, not one move per turn, think Fallout rather than Final Fantasy) RPG, that about covers it.

												Love this game.  I originally got dragonfall thinking it included the first one (Shadowrun Returns) and having not played any of them before and not touching any turn based games in years it was, very hard to me.  After reading that SRR is a bit slower and better to learn from I got it and have been learning a lot more about playing.  Even as I'm not that great at it and still get killed a lot and have to redo parts, it's still an amazing game. I am hard pressed to want to read dialog in most games.  This one is interesting enough that even though it is very heavy on the dialog, I find that the writing is well done, enough that you don't wan to miss anything.  It's not a lot of empty writing like filler or fluff but it drives the story and most times there are details you don't want to miss, or you might not be able to get to the next part.  The characters have personality even without the fancy voice acting and 3d character animations and cutscenes.  I'm so impressed I plan to return to Dragonfall after this, and Hong Kong is already in my library too.  (those reviews to come later) Tip for new players in this game - pay attention to your builds, learn how to use the Karma points, search for tips and tutorials if you have to or it is indeed a frustrating game to the newb.  Stick with it, it is well worth playing through - even though i'm sure I have quite a ways to go, I'm enjoying every minute.  Highly recommended!			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a story-driven RPG with something akin to XCOM's combat system (albeit a few tweaks and more customization per character).  There isn't any choice that drives the plot in a different direction but there are multiple ways to deal with the smaller scenarios you're presented with, such as how to get into a blocked off area.  These ultimately do not affect the larger story but it's nice to have these smaller interactions in lieu of that.Also, some dialog options are locked behind choices you make during character creation, and occasionally others are behind skill checks.  So that plus the multiple routes in each level makes up for what I imagine were budgetary constraints that prevented a multi-path narrative.  It was a Kickstarter after all.  I don't know if this is the case for the future titles in the series, so don't judge those based on this.  I'm only talking about the base game.The skill system in this game is satisfying, using a steady stream of points instead of levels.  I like all the different ways I can customize my character.  The classes all feel varied and interesting, and they fit the world really well.Shadowrun is well written, even if the story is not revolutionary.  It has fast paced dialog and isn't overly wordy, like the aforementioned Pillars of Eternity, or most games which people claim are ""well written.""  It doesn't bog you down in detail, yet it also provides quite sufficient descriptions to give you a good understanding of everything.  Sometimes the world's ""slang"" feels a bit cheesy (like using 'frag' instead of ♥♥♥♥).  I love a world that has its own slang, like in Clockwork Orange, but that slang was far more believable.  I don't believe for a second that people would say frag and stop saying ♥♥♥♥.Even with a bad story, I'd still be interested because the world that this is set in is fantastic.  It's a cross of D&D, Blade Runner, and Deus Ex.  I've not played any of the other games/tabletop games in this ruleset before so the whole thing is new to me, and I really found myself drawn into it immediately.  The only critique is that it's too bleak to be plausible.  No society with the technological capability of this one could crumble to the place that this one does.  Still, it is a work of fiction, and it's established well enough to overlook the unlikeliness of it.  The story deals with serious subjects like drug addiction, racism, torture, etc. but it also manages to keep a lot of levity in there as well.  It takes itself seriously enough, but not to a point where it's brooding or depressing at all.Overall it's a nice little game which I've enjoyed far more than many other releases.  I avoided the game for its middling reviews, but I am upset that I did in retrospect.  I'd have liked to play these games earlier when I was searching for something to play.  I really love the XCOM type combat, the classes are all interesting, the story is sufficient, and the world is really great.And this is gonna seem strange, but there's some real oomph to when characters get shot, and that has made me want to play the game almost more than anything else about it.  There's something about when games make something feel right that I just love.  I played Spiderman 2 on PS2 for dozens and dozens of hours just because of how web slinging felt correct.  I remember playing San Andreas and thinking about how differently each of the cars felt from one another, and how they all felt right in their own way.  This game, the way it feels when you shoot someone and it makes impact, it just feels correctly made.  I realize that there's probably nothing more subjective than to say that I enjoy the way it feels to shoot enemies in this game, but it's my review, so whatever.  Get the game.			"

												Its about time that Shadowrun went back into the RPG in the world of gaming, i'm so bless that Kickstarter helped made this game possible and the creators did a fantastic job with having an interesting story called the Dead Man's Switch that involves classic history and film noir together. And i also love the fact that you can you create your own stories, or subscribe to other fan custom stories through Steam Workshop, now that's what makes Shadowrun Returns even more worthy of the title Returns. For any Shadowrun fan, or fans of the either or both of the 16-Bit games on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. I highly recommend Shadowrun Returns! Here's my video review on Shadowrun Returns.

												There's a lot more better review than the one I'm writting now so I'm just gonna make this one short:The gameplay derives from familiar style found in Final Fantasy Tactic series and XCOM series in terms of combat while throwing in elements of RPG and storytelling in it. Your character build-up might determine how you tackle each battle and in some cases ""maximizing"" the profit gained, as well influencing some of the conversations in-game without affecting the story. Was considering to jump straight to Shadowrun: Dragonfall at first but decided to give this one a shot. Short game but wasn't disappointed with it....			"

ShadowRun is the game you wish you had instead of playing DnDTL;DRRating: A soild 8/10Pros:  - Hours of playtime - Different play styles  - Many classes that suit all different kinds of play styles - A DnD feel to the game that all DnD players have to try - The story line is not narrow and you have choices on how to solve puzzels or kill enemies.  - Turn base combat system that is actually worth waiting for.  - Tons of ways to complete missions. - Complete charcter customization - Well priced for the contentCons: To begin with the game is not for people looking for a shootem up and kick everyones asses as soon as they get into the room. It's turn based. - Can get borning in some areas, but the game makes up for it with combat and great story telling. - Lacking some content, wish there was a bit more.Conclusion: The game is worth paying the $15. If you're into a DnD play style then this game is for you. Hours of fun and so many ways to complete the game. I'd pick it up if it was on sale if you want to save some money.			"

												TL;DR - Great story/setting, great character customisation, levels/gameplay is fairly linear which restricts the RPG elements of the game, overall a really fun game, worth the money, just have to take it as it is. Before I give my thoughts on this game, I'd like to make it clear that this is the first Shadowrun game I have played, although I am aware of the franchise and it's history. (Tabletop, PC/Console games etc.)Story/Setting: The game overall is pretty solid and good fun. It has a decent story with twists and turns and an amusing ending. You encounter likeable characters and the world is a great representation of Cyberpunk, with it's own take on things with the addition of magic.  Character Customisation:You get to make your own runner at the start of the game and there is a lot to work with from melee characters, armed characters, Deckers (hackers), Riggers (drones), Mages (spells, traps, heal), Shamans (Similar to mages, can also raise spirits, creatures and demons). However where this game shines is you really have the power to go all out with one type of class or mix any of them and make a unique build of your own. (I think I got all the classes correct there. Or near enough!) I'd say this game has great potential for replay value as you could try out all the different classes avaliable, however it wouldn't be something you'd jump straight back into after compleing in my opion, as the story and levels are fairly linear.Mechanics/Gameplay:Everything works as it should in this game and I encountered no issues at all. However I would say the game is a little lacking in RPG elements in my opinion. Let's call it CRPG-Lite! (That was terrible)A couple of areas that came to mind; In conversations you do have the ability to convice, bribe and use etiquettes to persuade and win people over to your side which you would expect with an RPG, but, what I feel was lacking was that you can't really♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off in dialogue or make them hate you and never talk to you again like you can in some RPGs, ultimately conversations (It would appear) all have the same conclusion, you just have little things you can do here and there if you spec'd in charisma, you bribe them or have the correct etiquette.I think this is because the levels and story are fairly linear for an RPG that it can't really give you that freedom. There are oppourtunities that you can miss out on if you give the wrong responses, but in an RPG I want it to be truly diverse in the sense that I can ♥♥♥♥ up an oppurtunity and then I have to go out of my way find another way to achieve my goal/quest. This game ultimately always seems to come to the same conclusion regardless. The other major area that felt a little lacking was the combat, it has the average top down, turn based combat mechanics but I wish it was more like Wasteland 2's. You can get behind cover, but some you can't shoot around, your character literally can't step out with one foot and shoot around a doorway or down a corridor. Just a bit more control over combat and the ability to make better stratergies would have made the combat near-perfect!Other little issues I had were things like not being able to examine the environments other than what the devs wanted you to see. Lack of dialogue/text box like in most RPGs, that displays examine text, Character thoughts and NPC dialogue etc.Overall:Overall this is a really fun game, I played it through in a few days and was pretty glued to it. At first I was a little disappointed with the lack of RPG elements I'm used to, but I quickly accepted that Shadowrun is it's own thing and does it a little differently. I'm really impressed with Harebrained Schemes and that they've successfully brought back Shadowrun. Now I have Dragonfall and Hong Kong to play, and from what I hear they've been improved a lot from this game!			"

												I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nicely paced suspense/ turn-based video game. This being my first Shadowrun game that I've completed I'm definitely going to continue with the others that said this game does have some minor things that I didn't like, but it's nothing game breaking or obsurd.Pros: 1.) Great story telling and characters2.) Combat is fun and has a steady pace3.) The artwork is well done and I found myself looking at all the little things the artists included.4.) The music was great, though I would have liked a little more diversity in some places. Did give the feeling of a grim and dirty world.Cons:1.) It wasn't game breaking or even hindering all too much even on hard difficulty, but sometimes places where you thought would have full or even half cover wouldn't have any at all. 2.) I liked the characters, but I would have like to have seen more from other characters especially back at the Union which is essentially your HUB throughout the game. 3.) I don't think I really missed a lot of content through my playthrough, but I kind of would have liked to see more side jobs.4.) I played through as a decker, which is basically like their word for hacker and I enjoyed it, but there really wasn't all that much to hack and gain access to hopefully in the more recent Shadowruns this is expanded upon.

												After wanting to play Shadowrun for the longest time, tonight I finally finished it. The game was not that long with its 12 hours of game time, and to be honest, it was quite a disillusion. After finishing Baldur's Gate 1 for the first time two weeks ago, I was looking forward to another isometric RPG. Being a big Deus Ex fan, the cyberpunk theme of Shadowrun Returns was very alluring. Being unfamiliar with the Shadowrun franchise, the mix of cyberpunk and fantasy felt weird at first. But even in the end, I can't say that I like it better. I'll try to summarize my experience with this game in a pro/con list.PRO  The 2D backgrounds are from time to time quite beautiful  The user interface was quite ok, and looked sleek  The first half of the story was interesting  Interesting combination of combat going on in the matrix and in real life at the same time.  The game worked quite well on Linux (except for the remarks below)  The game was easy to play with keyboard and mouse, but also with the Steam Controller on my TVCON  The game did not handle ""exotic"" resolutions well. 3200x1800 on my linux laptop and 3440x1440 on my desktop were not manually selectable. Log files mentioned that the game detected the native resolution but a slightly different resolution was chosen. The drop down menu never showed the native resolutions in game. Full HD on my TV was easy.  When contacting the developer's support for the issue above, no support was given. I got an email confirming that they received my email, and that's the last thing that happened.  The loading screens took quite long for a ""2D"" game. I would expect it to be faster than games like Skyrim?  Classes seem very diverse, but they don't feel diverse.   Leveling is quite boring. Not a lot changes exect for some % to hit etcetera.  Fights are repetitive because there are not a lot of different tactics (necessary). The AI is not very bright.  During combat sequences the game goes turn-based, even when all enemies are killed you still keep walking turn based until you find new enemies in the same environment. Moving your whole team person by person is very tedious.  When going on missions you pay mercs to come with you. They are not very strong or optimal in their configuration, so they felt like dead weight compared to my maxed out SMG fighter.  Hacking/Matrix sequences are very repetitive. Both for the looks of the environment and the variation in enemies and variation in weapons. I just spammed my default attack and nothing else was needed.   The game is very linear. There are not a lot of side quests and you can't explore the world on your own. There is no open world to visit.  Because of the linear gameplay and uninteresting classes, replayability suffers a lot.  The story of the game started out great. It felt like a personal story compared to the ""save the world"" kind of stories from Skyrim and company. But from the middle of the game it felt like the writers had to keep making the story more elaborate to keep the gamers interested. They created some complex and unnecessary twists that ultimately made me just click faster through the conversation options because I became uninterested.  Those conversations were often very onesided. The choices you make in conversations almost never matter. Most answers are just different forms of the same answer, making conversations very uninteresting. There is no real impact on the game.  The writing of the game is obviously inspired by the Sprawl trilogy, and tiringly so. Every sentence tries to be drearier than the last one. I like film noir and cyberpunk, but this was way too cliché at times.  The world of Shadowrun combines cyberpunk and sci-fi with fantasy. Obviously a lot of people like this, but I'm not really fond of it. It gets worse when they try to mix even more classic (cliché?) game themes in the mix: violent crazy people in an asylum, undead ghouls, monsters and even spirits!! It just lacked some pirates and vampires...  The (hand drawn?) backgrounds were nice from time to time, but they are very empty. There is not a lot of animation or interactivity. The world feels dead.  The music is nice. I mean, the 3 or 4 tracks that are constantly repeated are nice the first time. They sound perfectly in line with the cyberpunk theme, but after having it on repeat for 12 hours, I just disabled the music altogether.   The game is quite short. I finished it in about 12 hours (thoroughly reading everything), and it seems like I'm slow compared to others. Some did it in 8 hours. Sadly, I was happy that it was over.I was looking forward to play the complete Shadowrun series, but after being let down by the first installment, I just can't bring myself to buy the sequels. Even if they are better... Too bad really! I hope that the other famous tactical 2D Kickstarter games like Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity can make up for this game.			"

												PROPER REVIEW PENDINGWhile I am enjoying this game so far, I cannot recommend this game to anyone except die-hard Shadowrun fans. The gameplay is quite shallow and almost completely linear, the interface is clunky and designed for tablets. There is no exploration, poor documentation, and equipment selection is limited. Dialog choices are meaningless for the most part, and you cannot save the game except for advancing checkpoints, which also means no going back if you missed anything. Fallen enemies disappear and cannot be looted, and class/skill balance is poorly implemented. For a 2 million dollar budget from kickstarter alone this is a disappointment.What Shadowrun Returns really is, is a game engine and development toolkit, whose true merit has yet to be seen, with a short adventure included. This could be a good thing, but only time will tell. I see the potential for great things with this game but in my opinion that is not a selling point at this time for anyone but modders.However, as a Shadowrun fan, I am thrilled to be back exploring the neon lit slums of 2055 Seattle. The level artwork is the highlight, with the music adding to the atmosphere. The 3d character models are quite crude but fit in with the world when you are actually playing, just don't expect to get interesting looking armour for your character. There is no voice acting, but for a video game the writing is a pleasant surprise though that isn't saying much.All said and done, I don't regret preordering Shadowrun Returns, but if you are curious about the setting I recommend picking up one of the books until this game goes on sale.

												After wanting to play Shadowrun for the longest time, tonight I finally finished it. The game was not that long with its 12 hours of game time, and to be honest, it was quite a disillusion. After finishing Baldur's Gate 1 for the first time two weeks ago, I was looking forward to another isometric RPG. Being a big Deus Ex fan, the cyberpunk theme of Shadowrun Returns was very alluring. Being unfamiliar with the Shadowrun franchise, the mix of cyberpunk and fantasy felt weird at first. But even in the end, I can't say that I like it better. I'll try to summarize my experience with this game in a pro/con list.PRO  The 2D backgrounds are from time to time quite beautiful  The user interface was quite ok, and looked sleek  The first half of the story was interesting  Interesting combination of combat going on in the matrix and in real life at the same time.

												I'd strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nicely paced suspense/ turn-based video game. This being my first Shadowrun game that I've completed I'm definitely going to continue with the others that said this game does have some minor things that I didn't like, but it's nothing game breaking or obsurd.Pros: 1.) Great story telling and characters2.) Combat is fun and has a steady pace3.) The artwork is well done and I found myself looking at all the little things the artists included.4.) The music was great, though I would have liked a little more diversity in some places. Did give the feeling of a grim and dirty world.Cons:1.) It wasn't game breaking or even hindering all too much even on hard difficulty, but sometimes places where you thought would have full or even half cover wouldn't have any at all. 2.) I liked the characters, but I would have like to have seen more from other characters especially back at the Union which is essentially your HUB throughout the game. 3.) I don't think I really missed a lot of content through my playthrough, but I kind of would have liked to see more side jobs.4.) I played through as a decker, which is basically like their word for hacker and I enjoyed it, but there really wasn't all that much to hack and gain access to hopefully in the more recent Shadowruns this is expanded upon.

The combat looks simple enough and provides several character development options resulting in a deep and gratifying experience. It's a short but intriguing and captivating game that every RPG fan should play.			"

												A return to to Shadowrun is like coming back to an old friend. I used to play and love ""Shadowrun"" for the SNES - never played the P&P RPG - but I was too young to fully understand the world and lore. Getting back into it now, the memories have come flooding back to me, along with the old enjoyment I felt of exploring a cyberpunk world full of corporate elves and shadowrunning orks.This is a game without voice actors, without an advanced 3D engine, and without amazing particle effects. It is, however, a game with some fantastic and moody writing (and benefits from no voice actors because of this, IMO), a memorable story, and an ending with great closure. Before I get into pointing out a few things I liked and disliked, if you're a fan of RPGs with a focus on story and setting, this game is for you.I played once through the Dead Man's Switch campaign, and I'm still a little undecided on how I feel about the leveling system. It seems, to me, a little bit simple. It could definitely benefit from some type of ""perks"" system that you could put points into that allow the gameplay to vary some. As it stands, it's all a bit too straight-forward for my liking, without any real hard decisions to make. if you want to use SMGs and be a decker, you just put karma points into those two stat lines, and that's about it. It's not bad, just not great.The story, however, is wonderful, along with the characters. Coyote is memorable, and I hope to see her appear in the next expansion as well, and it was nice to see Jake Armitage make an appearance early. It really helped ground the game in the Shadowrun lore. There was a bit of a running red herring throughout the story (at least, I'm pretty sure it was), and I was genuinely happy to see the villain turn out a bit differently than I thought.The actual combat is a bit like a simplified version of X-COM. It's turn-based, it utilizes a rudimentary cover system, and it includes magic along with gunplay. It's fun enough, but, along with the leveling system, seems a bit on the simple side, without much variation. This could be alleviated some, I feel, by using scripting to make the combat encounters more interesting. The shoot-out in the cemetery, for example, was easily, IMO, the best encounter of the game as it added variety and surprise in the middle of the fight.And, of course, the editor! I dabbled in this for a number of hours, and it seems perfectly robust and easy to use if you've ever modded games in the past to any extent. I have experience creating modules for Neverwinter Nights, and the Shadowrun Returns editor is mercifully easier to use when scripting, as it gives you the language to select from, instead of you having to discover it yourself.All in all, I definitely recommend this game to those who are either Shadowrun fans, RPG fans that love a good story (and aren't afraid to read as it seems a lot of gamers are these days), or want to create your own stories using the editor. I would give Shadowrun Returns a 7.5/10.			"

												The good: for a game from a small company, this is quite brilliant. Athmopshere is top-notch, story is very well written, UI and game mechanics are mostly very good, and while some character builds definitely make things much easier, it is possible to play the game through in many different ways.The ambiguous: the game has excellent, relentless pacing, it proceeds like a well-oiled machine. I did appreciate a lot that the playing time was not at any point artificially expanded by making the player travel back and forth in trivial missions of killing and/or collecting umpteen this-or-that. On the other hand, this could also be interpreted as lack of content by some, but the main storyline is so strong and offers so many hours of high-quality content that at least I felt I got my money's worth and then some. Also, given the small budget there is no voice acting; I did not miss it in the slightest, but some may have a different opinion.The bad: there's not much, really. Some aspects of the Shadowrun world are not in the game, but I never missed them, the game is really impressive and highly enjoyable as it is. And it would be nice to have an option to switch the fighting mode on and off, or at the very least be able to switch the active character when not in the fighting mode. Minor things that I almost feel ashamed to bring up, all things considered.TL;DR – 9/10, isometric RPG with very few downsides, loved it.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a digital translation of the pen and paper game. The Shadowrun rulebook contained a short adventure/module/run/gig that served to demonstrate the game's mechanics. In those days it was expected that the GM would make their own runs. In that same way Shadowrun Returns was released with a short run. Soon thereafter the workshop filled with community crafted runs.Please do not look at this game based solely on the released run, look at the community crafted runs as well.Full disclosure: I play this for nostalgic reasons and the low metascore bums me out.

												These still waters run deep.I could try to give this a # out of 10, but I'm not measuring up one game... This isn't just Shadowrun's return... as of this review there are hundreds of other 20+ hour hand-crafted adventures / ""expansions"" / free fan-made DLC that is every bit as legit as the official campaign.  I'm not quite sure you realize without thinking for a second what that implies.You're getting every ""tabletop RPG"" story that someone never got to DM physically- virtually and free with the Steam Workshop.  Buying in to a game that only ends if the content is stopped being made.  Even the developers are in on it and expanding the game with the community:https://www.youtube.com/user/HarebrainedSchemes/videosCustomized campaigns made by dedicated gamers including the original SNES title remastered for FREE!Infinite Baldur's Gate sessions with guns and a simpler X-com-esque cover system.Unlimited cyberpunk sagas made by fans for fans forever.There are only a few games like this, such as Torchlight 2, L4D2 where the community members develop the game further than the original team had a capacity for.This game will never end.  You will never EVER finish all of the possible content AND can choose your own adventure(s) in doing so.I LOVE games like this, where it's in our hands... but this time, the developers are here guiding us, building with us, and inspiring us all the while like a good DM does.I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you thought this game was before reading reviews, but if you sell this title short, you are literally selling short the potential of imagination and role play that this game offers.  Go back to COD, if guns without a reason to fight means that much.  But I'm willing to bet you wouldn't be here reading this review if it wasn't for a well-deserved curiousity and interest, and this game is far more interesting than at first sight.			"

I couldnt' help but read every single line of text in this game, and the conspiracy ran deeper than I even thought possible.Gameplay is good, however towards the end I felt that perhaps I was a bit overpowered.

												As far as turn-based RPGs go, Shadowrun Returns doesn't bring anything new to the table, and its main story mission isn't very long. It makes up for it, though, by still being incredibly fun to play-- the dialogue is cleverly written, the game mechanics are solid, and the world is well-crafted. Fans of the Shadowrun roleplay game will enjoy this, and the fact that it allows for a lot of fan-created missions makes it that much better.			"

												Shadowrun Returns tells a well-written tale of murder and conspiracy called The Dead Man's Switchstories in its long-dormant sci-fi/fantasy universe. Even though it seems like an open-world RPG, in reality it's really linear, directly funneling you from one mission to the next. There are some well-done puzzles that require information-gathering detective work, and some areas that have problems that can be solved in at least two ways – reprogram a blank access card or steal one. But very few of my decisions in dialogue had any significant impact on how events played out. I liked the great told story and the illustrated pdf with a bunch of stories. It had a cool setting I wanted to explore but couldn't because it was too linear. The light tactical combat on hard was fun and not too challenging. All in all it is a good classic RPG with some well told twists.			"

Except there is no tactical strategy battles....In a simple analogy... this game is like a dish of Steak n'eggs. Steak, eggs, some fries, some salad and a nice sauce. The waiter comes, shows you a great steak, then place some beautiful sunny-side up eggs and then places the most golden peppered fries you ever seen... When you are watering with anxiety to taste that♥♥♥♥♥♥ he throws the lettuce and tomato salad right at your face and leaves with the rest. Why give me great customization, combat and progression and then throw me 80 hours of text and 5 minutes of battles...Seriously. this game has less than 1 hour of battle and you are still given the option to skip most of them... loli will recommend this game, since the tactical part is really good and worth trying if the game is with a 80% discount.

												After playing through the story of the game and trying a quick mod for it, I would say that I recommend this game.  The lore surrounds you as you play through the game, but isn't so quick to jargon or burying you in references and events non-fans of Shadowrun wouldn't know of that you get lost or overwhelmed.  I think this would serve as a nice introduction for anyone who might be curious about this fantasy world.  One aspect I appreciate most in the game are the various options available to you, depending on what race you play, though more importantly what skills you've focused on leveling.  It allows you to approach situations in different ways, giving greater flexibility.  There is a limit though, with some areas showing more versatility than others.  For instance, as I leveled up and spent my karma points (skill points essentially) I was disappointed that the pistol had so many perks and skills when levelling it up in contrast to any of the other guns.  I focused on the shotgun and I could rain death from afar, but it would have been nice picking up skills along the way instead of only doing more damage from further away.  Perhaps adding a bleeding status effect to enemies or lowering their movement as they limp off from being pumped full of lead.  I liked switching back and forth between the free exploration areas and combat, as having the two modes separated allows you to freely interact with your environment, sometimes just to nose around and other times to advance the story.  Again what is enjoyable is that you have a choice on how you progress in these areas.  Maybe you grease a palm here and there and sneak your way in or try to blow open an entrance.  Nothing huge per se, but you can play a character that way, instead of merely having to go forward in a single straight line.  The combat is pretty simple but it's certainly serviceable.  Once you familiarize yourself with the UI it makes simple sense and allows you to take cover, draw the enemy in, rush them, chuck grenades, cast spells, summon avatars, use melee weapons, or do as I did and blast away with the best guns money can buy.  I'd say my biggest complaint in the game is that there aren't more optional side missions to tackle.  With the way the programming works, with missions having options built-in I can see why it doesn't, but it would be nice to grind more money (not that you'll need it, if you're frugal), earn more karma, and have more to experience.  I kept expecting to see better armor, guns, and body mods available and was disappointed that they seemed to hint at really potent modifications you could use but never built up to.  I held off on getting any for a long time for that reason, wanting to save up my funds for when I could get the really choice items.  Having another level or two of gear would have built up a greater sense of advancement, as by the end you don't have anywhere else to go.All in all I did enjoy the game though and am looking forward to trying other games from this series.  Plus I can try more mods in this one sometime as well.  Maybe run through it all again with a new character build and race.			"

												Even the mediocre titles in this genre stand out by virtue of the fact that the genre is rather shallow these days (cyberpunk fantasy tactical RPG). Note: if you're planning to play all the Shadowrun games, make sure to play this first. The other two (Dragonfall and Hong Kong) are vastly improved in every way and will make this game seem lack luster by comparison. On its own, it's decent enough to warrant buying on sale if you like the genre.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is in many ways a half-baked game. It's short, not terribly deep, not particularly pretty, and often reminds you that it's a game. Despite this, there's a fantastic deal to like about Shadowrun Returns.Shadowrun Returns (SR) is the second of the major profile video games funded via crowdfunding platform Kickstarter while still in the pre-planning stages to be released. The campaign ran in April 2012, and pulled in about 1.83 million dollars, well over its minimum funding goal of 400,000 dollars. SR is the fourth video game based on the pen-and-paper roleplaying setting Shadowrun, and is the first to not be called simply by its setting's name. The game builds on the story of the first two Shadowrun games - the first released for the SNES, the second on the Genesis - and disregards the third one - released for the 360, PS3 and the PC - on account of it being a multiplayer game with no story.At first glance, Shadowrun is one of the most archetypical cyberpunk settings available in tabletop gaming. It's perpetually rainy, everything is owned by soulless megacorporations, poverty is widespread and the Internet is a world in itself. In a market saturated with these kinds of settings, you need a special something to stand out, and what makes Shadowrun one of the most popular games in the genre is its overlap with standard fantasy. In 2012, magic unexpectedly returned to the world, transforming many humans into dwarves, elves, orcs, trolls, and more. Many were gifted with magical abilities, while dragons awakened from their deep slumber. Two generations later, magic and technology coexist in a society rife with racial (specieal?) tensions and little hope in sight.The game casts you in the down-on-your-luck shoes of one of the eponymous Shadowrunners - a sort of mercenary-slash-master criminal that lives in the cracks of society. Work has been scarce lately after a botched shadowrun, and you are down to your last saved Nuyens when a colleague contacts you about a job. Or, more specifically, the recording of a colleague - as it turns out, your old acquaintance got himself killed, and is contacting you to let you know that his life insurance payout is yours if you will bring his killer to justice. Having no other options, you accept, taking the first step towards unravelling the convoluted mystery behind his death.The simple motivation of trying to get at a former coworker's insurance money is a great story hook. Even the best Shadowrunner is little more than a pawn on the big corporations' boards, and, to mix metaphors, you're little more than a deuce in the Suit of Pawns at this point. As a result, the story is largely personal, and it's up to you if you're just in it for the money, justice or revenge. The interaction is reminiscent of Planescape: Torment, in that much of the environmental interaction is done via dialogue trees or by reading text hovering over the environment, although SR never comes close to Torment's sheer verbosity. All in all, the story is excellently told - it's well-written, has good twists, ups the stakes at the right spots, and has interesting characters. That said, the last third isn't as interesting as the preceding material, as the focus starts to move away from your own story, and it must be noted that there is a complete absence of voice acting in the game - a shame, as the dialogue is superb.Who your character is is up to you - the character creation system is open-ended, and doesn't restrict skills to certain character classes like many RPGs do. Although you may opt to choose one of the ready-made decks, such as the melee-centric Street Samurai or the hacking-oriented Decker, there is no penalty for distributing skill points according to your own preferences instead. You can pick your own name, be male or female, and may choose to be human, elf, dwarf, troll, or orc. The choice of race (species) gives certain minor bonuses and affects the maximum level a particular stat can reach (each skill or subskill is tied to a particular stat, and can't be higher than the stat or skill it's nested under), and you will be treated differently in-game depending on your choice of race (species) and gender. All in all, it's pretty standard stuff for an RPG, but the system is very open, and if you feel like playing as a troll Decker who dabbles in shamanism, go for it.The game is controlled from an isometric perspective, and is divided into two discrete sections: exploration and combat. While exploring, you can only control your own character, and mostly click on objects or non-playable characters to interact with them. There is usually not a lot to interact with, but there is usually just enough to keep exploration rewarding, even if it's just in the form of another description of the environment. Skills and stats are frequently used to solve problems in ways that give better results, although since the game is fairly short, most skills are only used once or twice each. The game is also fairly rigid; the player has little input on how the story plays out, aside from the details. Interestingly, SR does not use an experience point-based system; instead, ""karma points"" are doled out after completing certain tasks. These points are then spent in the skill tree, improving your character directly. Oddly, ""evil"" decisions will apparently not yield karma points, which is a strange design choice. That said, there are more than enough karma points to go around.Unlike most CRPGs, SR is a very linear game. Each level is its own microcosm that can't be exited until the game tells you to, and while there are a number of recurring levels throughout the game - most notably the Seamstresses Union, the town-equivalent you visit between missions - most of them occur in sequence; as such, it doesn't feel as if you're returning to places already visited, but rather to different versions of them. This plays into how the game rewards the player as well: on certain levels, skill checks will have become noticably harder, and equipment upgrades will usually by straight numerical improvements. It's somewhat immersion-breaking, as it feels as if you're just being rewarded for the sake of it. In combat, the game switches to what might be termed XCOM-lite mode. The combat is turn-based, with each participant moving their entire party on their turn. Each character has two or three action points, and each point allows you to move a certain amount of squares or perform some other action, such as attack or cast a spell. Scattered throughout the environment are walls and objects that can be used for partial or full cover. If a character is outfitted with a ""datajack"" they may access the Matrix (the Internet); however, Matrix gameplay is little more than an underdeveloped version of normal combat, and it is a mixed blessing that it is used only maybe half a dozen times, mostly in the second half of the game. Overall, the combat is not outstanding, but it does the job, and it can be rewarding to successfully play off each character's attributes to achieve optimum results. Graphically, the game looks alright. The backgrounds are high-res images, and while not fantastic-looking, they do contribute a great deal artistically to the atmosphere. Sound effects are what you would expect, and the music is mostly moody synthesizer tunes that complement the setting well.Shadowrun Returns may have its rough edges and be a fairly shallow experience at times, but the superb writing, great atmosphere and satisfying gameplay makes it well worth the low price that matches its length. Finally, since tradition dictates I say it: never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.			"

												Summary:  This is probably the best ShadowRun adaptation to a video game I've ever played.  Fun RPG sci-fi experience packed into a small game.  Gameplay and innovation over pretty effects and graphics.  The game also has a toolset you can use to create your own adventures, which is a bonus.  Even better, you can use the Steam Workshop to download cool stuff other people have made to add massive replay value to the game.  For the price, this game is definitely worth it.Cons:  Short.  I think it took me less than 20 hours to finish.  The graphics are unimpressive, and there is no voiceover or flashy effects that you see in most modern games.  This definitely has a ""shoestring budget"" feel to it.  Pros:  Great story.  Great storytelling.  It had a very nostalgic feel, and I liked it.  The gameplay was a lot of fun, which trumps everything I listed in the Cons section.  It doens't matter how pretty the game is if it's not any fun to play.  I love turn-based strategy and RPG, and this game blends the two together very nicely.  Lots of latitude on how to shape your character, and multiple ways to finish challenges in the game.  The Shadowrun universe was nicely represented.			"

												I am told Dragonfall is the good stuff, while the original campaign is crude and crappy? Well, I have not played Dragonfall (yet), but I can tell you the original campaign is one of the best RPG stories I have played in a long time. It's a solid (linear) story. Just like the old pen and paper Shadowrun I used to play, you never know where the rabbit hole ends, and if you don't try to rush through it, you are in for one hell of an epic tale that will keep you engaged for several days. There are some difficulty spikes, but never had to retry a mission more than once. You will adapt easily.The engine is functional and effective, the graphics are beautiful, the writting is more than good. The modding tools a huge bonus.One negative aspect: while the atmosphere is well developed, the music is terribly repetitive, specially in combat.EDIT, AFTER PLAYING DRAGONFALLSadly I didn't finish Dragonfall, so what I can say about it is limited. What I can say, however, is that it appeared uninteresting to me to the extent of ultimately dropping it. I didn't really care for the characters and the atmosphere was kind of out of place in my opinion.			"

												Dragonfall is an elegantly constructed true roleplaying game. I have been playing roleplay for 25 years, and I would most definately recommend this plot. The storyline is surprising and detailed. For instance playing the standard nice-paladin-nice and getting all bonus quests etc. simply will not work, you will get comments like ""kissass"" and will help maniacs if you do. You really have to make true choices all along.NPC interactions are well constructed, but not as good as in Dragonage.Graphics is still primitive, like Baldurs gate 1, with very limited interaction possibilities.The cybersamurai with an Ares Alpha still rules, but if you want more challenge, try playing a mage.Mostly you can use the skills of your team, but sometimes it is impossible to do certain things like looking at a panel in astral space despite having a mage on the team. Total evaluation is 10 on the story. 4 on the graphics. A must-play for true roleplaying fanatics like myself.			"

Note: This is for the base game only, Dragonfall review is on the standalone Dragonfall game.+: Great graphics for what it is, creates the Shadowrun atmosphere and feel very well.+: The story is pretty great until the end, not that it gets really bad but they just didn't do it as well as it could have been done.+: The gameplay is really solid and this is a solid recreation of the tabletop experience as a turn based strategy RPG.+: People who played the original SNES game will enjoy their homage to it. :)+: Workshop has a bunch of new campaigns you can play for free, some of which are really good.-: There isn't enough choices in this game. Not too much you can do to change the ending much and some skill trees are just out right not useful or far too useful.-: Party members aren't as engaging or as likeable as they should be. Some of them kind of just feel like they are there to round out your party and be better than the people you could hire. Also kind of lame that you can't change their skills or equipment really.-: For anyone who is a Shadowrun fan, they did Harlequin absolutely terribly, it is actually absurd how bad he is in comparison to his tabletop character. This is actually the thing I like the least about this game, but if you aren't a big fan of Shadowrun you won't care/notice the issue.			"

												Returns is wiz. Definitely worth the full $20, and maybe more.Though it lacks many of the finer details and nuances Shadowrun fans expect, Returns is an ambitious jump that promises to bring the world of Shadowrun to a wider variety of players through its accessible gameplay and campaign-building tools. The official campaign is a fast-paced crash course through a uniquely colorful noir world, with the writing and artwork delivering a healthy injection of personality, cosmopolitanism, and humanity to a modern sci-fi genre in dire need of an alternative to geometrically recycled blockbuster epics. Even if the simplistic game mechanics can sometimes seem underutilized or frustrating, Returns opens the gate for a broad range of Shadowrun experiences while providing a definitive introduction to newcomers and welcoming diehard fans.

												I just purchased this during the Autumn sale and I have greatly enjoyed it.  The art style, sound, and gameplay are all great.  The combat is turn-based and very similiar to X-Com: Enemy Unknown.  The story is engrossing and well presented, always leaving me wanting more. I have a few gripes with the game, however.  First, there is no way to currently save your game during missions, which can make for some long and frustrating gameplay sessions.   Secondly, there are some bugs with melee combat.  On one mission, I would use a melee attack and it would not register for 10 seconds.  It's a minor bug but after enough times, it is an annoyance.All and all, for the price, I recommend it and certainly look forward to checking out some of the Steam Workshop mods.EDIT:  Be forewarned, the lack of a quick-save feature can be a major annoyance in missions.  For example, during missions where you go into the Matrix, if you trigger the alarm, you will forever be hutned by more powerful foes.  It is extremely annoying and chances are once you trigger it, you will not be able to overcome the alarm.  The ability to save and reload would have easily negated unnecssary frustration.			"

												So I'd only recommend this if you're fond of the Shadowrun series. I liked the narrative, fits well with the mood. And even though it's short, I feel I'd tire of this game if it went on for more missions... I didn't feel it was all that complex. You're essentialy killing baddies in every mission, with very little variance. Even the Matrix missions were just two color versions of the ""meat world."" I'd like to play other scenarios/missions with different characters though.			"

												I've played through a couple times and I'm a big fan. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the writing is particularily rich and well done. I think the visuals are quite good for what you pay for and for a game so cheap, you get a lot of content. Some things seem a little 'meat and potatos', like the design of the character customization screen but generally though, well polished!Now that I've played the game, I wish I could pay 4x the price and get 4x the content.I think if you're a fan of RPGs, fantasy/sci-fi, and turn based combat, you really can't go wrong. It's $15! I've got waaay more satisfaction out of this game then the last pizza I ate.			"

												I just purchased this during the Autumn sale and I have greatly enjoyed it.  The art style, sound, and gameplay are all great.  The combat is turn-based and very similiar to X-Com: Enemy Unknown.  The story is engrossing and well presented, always leaving me wanting more. I have a few gripes with the game, however.  First, there is no way to currently save your game during missions, which can make for some long and frustrating gameplay sessions.   Secondly, there are some bugs with melee combat.  On one mission, I would use a melee attack and it would not register for 10 seconds.  It's a minor bug but after enough times, it is an annoyance.All and all, for the price, I recommend it and certainly look forward to checking out some of the Steam Workshop mods.EDIT:  Be forewarned, the lack of a quick-save feature can be a major annoyance in missions.  For example, during missions where you go into the Matrix, if you trigger the alarm, you will forever be hutned by more powerful foes.  It is extremely annoying and chances are once you trigger it, you will not be able to overcome the alarm.  The ability to save and reload would have easily negated unnecssary frustration.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a game for ""old school"" gamers who like old school  turn based RPG's :DIt has an awesome art design, and soundtrack, but most important for this type of games, it has tons of text a good quality dialog.Some say it's a short game. Maybe....but i put in 37 hours, and you will find interesting content created by fans with that awesome Editor that comes with game.Story is good. It can keep you on some sort of tension until you reach half of the game. After this moment the story begin to be previsible.It has no loot, and almost zero exploration. Yep, it's quite  linear and story driven game.On the other hand the combat system works flawless, and the skills tree it's original and interesting. But because you can control all your party members, you will play with almost all classes available from first playthrough. So....re-playability is not so good.I recommend this game to those who look for an old school turn-based RPG placed in an original cyberpunk world.			"

												Isometric western-style RPG fans rejoice, Shadowrun is back and this time to stay. Comprehensive character creation begins the hero on  their quest to help an old friend. Numerous ways to complete missions in a sprawling city filled with gritty fururistic realism and magical fantasy bring the world of Shadowrun to life unlike has been seen before. The feel of tabletop and the accesability of PC gaming mesh perfectly to make an easy to play and emersive enviroment for the gamer. The characterization of the main character and the runners you choose for your missions can drasticaly alter how you can complete a run. Hack into the matrix to shut down defences while your team defends you and clears the area, cast wild shaman magic to cleanse the technological jungle, construct fireballs from the will of Street Mages to quell thugs: nearly anything is possible.If you are a fan of pen and paper games, the Dungeons and Dragons style isometric PC games (i.e. Baulder's Gate series, Torment) this game will fit nicely into your collection of story-driven RPGs.

												It's really damn good. My opinion is pretty biased though, because I grew up playing Fallout 1 and 2 and other turn-based strategy games with RPG elements.Now, I can't say Shadowrun Returns is excellent in every aspect and it has flaws. Probably the main disappointment about the game is the fact that it's incredibly linear. I think there is only a couple of side-levels and everything else is pretty much traversing through areas from point a to b while killing enemies or talking to people and exploring. All 3 of these aspects are also dumbed down (I can't compare to the original Shadowrun because I haven't played it but the closest that it gets to is Fallout 1/2 for me, actually thinking of it, it's more like Fallout: Tactics). The fighting system is very close to the X-COM one and you've got AP, HP, 2-3 weapon slots and special abilities. Special abilities are presented in a wide variety though: you've got all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥♥- from being a shaman who summons stuff to a decker who can hack computers and transfer himself into cyberspace.Dialogues and social interactions aren't voiced (obviously) and suffer from being linear too. Most of the time you'll find yourself looking at 3 options and they all mean the same but the NPC reacts differently to each one. There are also some special charisma/etiquette-based options that pop-up every now and then, too.Exploring is stripped to its bare minumum as you've got levels filled with NPCs and sometimes promps would show up telling that there's something lying in a room: either a quest item or equipment. I've just covered all of the negative things. That's it. Everything else that's in the game provides a really cool experience: let it be the soundtrack of the game, its story or its world. It also has workshop support! Final verdict: if you see this game below 10$ and even just a tiny bit interested - go ahead and check it out.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a beautifully crafted game, with an amazing job with the story and setting. Based off of the roleplaying game, Shadowrun; You the player create your own Runner. A freelancer. A Merc. A person who's whole purpose is to make money doing the seedier things that society dust under the carpet.With this game, it provides an interesting media to portray your antics. Allowing for most situations to be handled however you want to. Want to hack a turret to fight for you? You can. Want to mow down enemies with a machine gun? Have fun trying. Want to charm enemies into allies, or summon elementals to fight for you? Get started sparky. This game does a great job bringing in just about every aspect of the roleplaying game. Mind you, it does have some constraints.You are following a premade story, so there are limits on what you can and can't do. But with the addition of Daggerfall, you get a little bit more freedom with how you do the story.In the end, the graphics are nice. Music is very fitting for the setting, and the story is wonderful. The fact that it has a user workshop and the tools to make your own story is also greatly appreciated. There are many nicely made user stories out there, and most allow you to bring in your Runner from the main campaigns. Which really does fit well with the idea of the original game. So overall, I give it a 8.5/10. And remember kids, don't trust anybody. Not even your closest friends.			"

												“Deux Ex” meets “Arcanum” — and there are few ways to see that.Most obvious is the setting. Cyperpunk with magic, elves, orcs, dwarves, etc. Though I am not a huge fan of fantasy, it goes perfectly in such a blend. And the world lives. People react to latest events, there is a sense in visiting your acquaintances over and over.Then, “Shadowrun” has a great story with lots of thoroughly written dialogues, impressive characters and plot bends, turns and twists. The tale that is told is mature, but not over the top gore fest (just the right amount of gore fest!). And the soundtrack is appropriately nice.Then, there are many ways to complete each task. They depend on what class you choose — there are some of more classical ones and some more setting-specific, or you can create your own character build, selecting your own mix of skills. Beside that game gives you many choices to solve tasks — governed by how much you are willing to explore, dive into story and the world, in wide sense — globally, and narrow — in a current mission and location.Overall a great experience for someone who like aforementioned classics and doesn’t mind reading lots of text. Like a book, y’know. Where you shoot and burn people.			"

Very well done.All in all, this game provides a place for cyber freaks to run wild and crazy, doing what they do, however they want to do it, and slip back into the shadows before the Corporations knew what hit 'em.Building your own modules? Sold.  Sadly, it's lacking multiplayer, which is supposedly in the works.  Either way, if you want a solid RPG that has TONS of user created missions and content?

												These still waters run deep.I could try to give this a # out of 10, but I'm not measuring up one game... This isn't just Shadowrun's return... as of this review there are hundreds of other 20+ hour hand-crafted adventures / ""expansions"" / free fan-made DLC that is every bit as legit as the official campaign.  I'm not quite sure you realize without thinking for a second what that implies.You're getting every ""tabletop RPG"" story that someone never got to DM physically- virtually and free with the Steam Workshop.  Buying in to a game that only ends if the content is stopped being made.  Even the developers are in on it and expanding the game with the community:https://www.youtube.com/user/HarebrainedSchemes/videosCustomized campaigns made by dedicated gamers including the original SNES title remastered for FREE!Infinite Baldur's Gate sessions with guns and a simpler X-com-esque cover system.Unlimited cyberpunk sagas made by fans for fans forever.There are only a few games like this, such as Torchlight 2, L4D2 where the community members develop the game further than the original team had a capacity for.This game will never end.  You will never EVER finish all of the possible content AND can choose your own adventure(s) in doing so.I LOVE games like this, where it's in our hands... but this time, the developers are here guiding us, building with us, and inspiring us all the while like a good DM does.I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you thought this game was before reading reviews, but if you sell this title short, you are literally selling short the potential of imagination and role play that this game offers.  Go back to COD, if guns without a reason to fight means that much.  But I'm willing to bet you wouldn't be here reading this review if it wasn't for a well-deserved curiousity and interest, and this game is far more interesting than at first sight.			"

												Linear BEV solo(offline) RPG.  With that said, worth about 12 hours of entertainment if you're into the genre.  Be you a street tough cyberer'd Samurai dicing up thugs with your sword, or an elite decker hacking the matrix to make your Nuyen.  Nostalgic fans will enjoy a shadowrun leveling system with a few new tweaks.There may be a few flaws.  There's little replay value in the campaign, as the storyline pushes you through with almost no sandboxing.  The game gives you freedom to pick your shadowrunners, yet seems to lack a certain feel of customization and increasing gains like most other RPG types.  No real stopping to grind out some shadowruns for Mr. Johnsons as in previous video game incarnations.  Some obvious bugs and crashes, but nothing to get too worked up over.All in all, a pretty decent reboot.  (P.S. the deluxe version doesn't include an additional campaign - just some soundtracks & PDF text)			"

The lore surrounds you as you play through the game, but isn't so quick to jargon or burying you in references and events non-fans of Shadowrun wouldn't know of that you get lost or overwhelmed.  I think this would serve as a nice introduction for anyone who might be curious about this fantasy world.  One aspect I appreciate most in the game are the various options available to you, depending on what race you play, though more importantly what skills you've focused on leveling.  It allows you to approach situations in different ways, giving greater flexibility.  There is a limit though, with some areas showing more versatility than others.  For instance, as I leveled up and spent my karma points (skill points essentially) I was disappointed that the pistol had so many perks and skills when levelling it up in contrast to any of the other guns.  I focused on the shotgun and I could rain death from afar, but it would have been nice picking up skills along the way instead of only doing more damage from further away.  Perhaps adding a bleeding status effect to enemies or lowering their movement as they limp off from being pumped full of lead.  I liked switching back and forth between the free exploration areas and combat, as having the two modes separated allows you to freely interact with your environment, sometimes just to nose around and other times to advance the story.  Again what is enjoyable is that you have a choice on how you progress in these areas.  Maybe you grease a palm here and there and sneak your way in or try to blow open an entrance.  Nothing huge per se, but you can play a character that way, instead of merely having to go forward in a single straight line.  The combat is pretty simple but it's certainly serviceable.  Once you familiarize yourself with the UI it makes simple sense and allows you to take cover, draw the enemy in, rush them, chuck grenades, cast spells, summon avatars, use melee weapons, or do as I did and blast away with the best guns money can buy.  I'd say my biggest complaint in the game is that there aren't more optional side missions to tackle.  With the way the programming works, with missions having options built-in I can see why it doesn't, but it would be nice to grind more money (not that you'll need it, if you're frugal), earn more karma, and have more to experience.  I kept expecting to see better armor, guns, and body mods available and was disappointed that they seemed to hint at really potent modifications you could use but never built up to.  I held off on getting any for a long time for that reason, wanting to save up my funds for when I could get the really choice items.  Having another level or two of gear would have built up a greater sense of advancement, as by the end you don't have anywhere else to go.All in all I did enjoy the game though and am looking forward to trying other games from this series.  Plus I can try more mods in this one sometime as well.  Maybe run through it all again with a new character build and race.			"

												The good: for a game from a small company, this is quite brilliant. Athmopshere is top-notch, story is very well written, UI and game mechanics are mostly very good, and while some character builds definitely make things much easier, it is possible to play the game through in many different ways.The ambiguous: the game has excellent, relentless pacing, it proceeds like a well-oiled machine. I did appreciate a lot that the playing time was not at any point artificially expanded by making the player travel back and forth in trivial missions of killing and/or collecting umpteen this-or-that. On the other hand, this could also be interpreted as lack of content by some, but the main storyline is so strong and offers so many hours of high-quality content that at least I felt I got my money's worth and then some. Also, given the small budget there is no voice acting; I did not miss it in the slightest, but some may have a different opinion.The bad: there's not much, really. Some aspects of the Shadowrun world are not in the game, but I never missed them, the game is really impressive and highly enjoyable as it is. And it would be nice to have an option to switch the fighting mode on and off, or at the very least be able to switch the active character when not in the fighting mode. Minor things that I almost feel ashamed to bring up, all things considered.TL;DR – 9/10, isometric RPG with very few downsides, loved it.			"

												Even the mediocre titles in this genre stand out by virtue of the fact that the genre is rather shallow these days (cyberpunk fantasy tactical RPG). Note: if you're planning to play all the Shadowrun games, make sure to play this first. The other two (Dragonfall and Hong Kong) are vastly improved in every way and will make this game seem lack luster by comparison. On its own, it's decent enough to warrant buying on sale if you like the genre.			"

												5/10Great customization. Awesome ""team-work"" possibilities. Interesting and challenging enemies. Fun battles. Smart progression-influenced combat.Awesome tactical-strategy-battle game! Except there is no tactical strategy battles....In a simple analogy... this game is like a dish of Steak n'eggs. Steak, eggs, some fries, some salad and a nice sauce. The waiter comes, shows you a great steak, then place some beautiful sunny-side up eggs and then places the most golden peppered fries you ever seen... When you are watering with anxiety to taste that♥♥♥♥♥♥ he throws the lettuce and tomato salad right at your face and leaves with the rest. Why give me great customization, combat and progression and then throw me 80 hours of text and 5 minutes of battles...Seriously. this game has less than 1 hour of battle and you are still given the option to skip most of them... loli will recommend this game, since the tactical part is really good and worth trying if the game is with a 80% discount.

												A very loyal take on the the ol' dice-n-paper RPG I begrudgingly played during high school and college. I had a strong dislike for FASA's SR family-friendly cyberpunk lite (at the time I was reading a lot of Gibson and Sterling), and I always found its allusions street culture hokey and painfully suburban; also a pretty good description of my college RPG group.That was a long time ago, however. Now I can just enjoy this for it's silliness, which SR RETURNS has in abundance! This game moves along well, has a very low learning curve, and is fun right away. If you grew up on SR like me, you will be delighted to see plenty of NPCs from the earliest editions of the dice and paper game. A fun diversion for about 20 hours or so; I am looking forward to acquiring new stories / campaigns to play.			"

												Very good turn-based game, but not so good as an rpg, I expect more of the next campaings since I cant use the workshop (it simple crashes after i try to make a new content). As for my opinion concerning the rpg genre, the thing is: in the main story your choices doesnt really matter, because it is pretty strait-foward you do as your told, or you cant progress. It is like a GM that doesnt know really how to embrace multiple possibilities. For instance, you cant change alliances, jobs, take a lot of side quests (almost none, almost), fully specialize your character (obs.: it will cost you a lot of patience, since you always need to explore, out of combat, in the front lines - a support mage doesnt explore in the front lines, period). The same problem about specialization happens in player-made content, not to mention that ranged combat is far superior than melee in this game, to have a good melee combatant, on par with a ranged, you need twice as much karma and money, I think it is pretty unballanced, but possible to fix it.One important thing to mention is: browsing through the player-made content it became pretty obvious that the publishers can make the game much more interesting in terms of choice, exploring, loot, etc. They did a very good job on the writing, but not so much on the rpg.

												The good:+ The world is interesting, and looks great. Has this kind of style that feels gritty, dark, and unique.+ You can really seem to play whatever kind of character you want (at least on normal).+ Combat on normal is not hard, but just hard enough that you might die randomly. I feel like it’s a good mix for just a casual gamer.+ Not too long. No unnecessary grinding. To the point. Play through took like 12 hours or so.The story:- The story isn’t anything special. There are some nice twists, but parts feel sort of disjointed like there was bigger ideas that just never quite made it in to the game.- The game does not always do a good job explaining some of the mechanics but really if you are playing on easy or normal you’ll pick it up relatively quickly and many of the mechanics are present in future games.- I feel like even scaled up the text is generally smaller than I would like.- Ssome wonky interface stuff. For example healing other team members in between combat.TLDR;An interesting 2d isometric cypberpunk rpg. Not the greatest RPG I have played, and certainly not the worst. I don’t have very strong feelings on the game, others in the series are better, but this one is OK and probably worth a play.			"

												A solid game, but not as amazing as a lot of sources seem to say.On the upside, it's very well-written, the setting is well-realized, and there is a lot of room for modding and extra scenarios and whatever. The core system is bland, but playable, and the game did not feel too hard or too easy - things were fairly easy on normal difficulty so long as I moved tactically, used cover, and had my team give each other cover.On the downside, combat all gets very samey, and turn-based combat is not the fastest thing The story the game comes with is awfully linear and does not feel, for lack of a better term, very 'Shadowrun-y' to me. Those two things may be related, as being a Shadowrunner is kind of about freedom, isn't it?Anyway. Good game. Not great. Certainly reccomend giving it a try for fans of turn-based RPGs.			"

												Shadowrun is good. Making a kitchensink setting isn't always easy (after all, this is magic AND cyberpunk) and making Shadowrun games is even harder. But this is good. I liked the first campaign a little more than Dragonfall, but that might be a side effect of some technical issues (and some incredibly bad luck at dice rolling). The main issue I have with the game is visuals. While the character portraits are supremely good and backgrounds look good more often than not, combat leaves a lot to be desired. While the character models are good enough, especially when viewed from so far away, the combat animations are lacklustre. And the greatest shame is how spells bland and impactless the spells look. Other thant that, it's a very good RPG that should not be missed.			"

												I played both SRR DMS, and SRR Dragonfall, and are playing SR5 tabletop since summer.I can say both games are pretty good on catching the shadowrun atmosphere. Dragonfall is true on 'Berlin setting' trivia, and the designers sure did their 'legwork'. Its a great game if you are playing pen n paper, and want to get the 'feeling' in an crpg too. Or if you like powerfull toolkits that allow you to be creative. I am sure there could be a different game for the kickstarter income. But this would have no toolkit and this very nice people who made some pretty solid campaigns on their own, free of charge.You can expect a solid, slow, oldschool  game. But if you are expecting mass effect level production value, look for EA or Bioware. They got nice looking shells, true, but they lost their essence on the way.			"

												If you enjoy tactical turn based combat and compelling storylines this game is for you.Pros:-Great writing-Fun turn based tactical combat-Greater than average ability to feel like your character's skills and the choices for specialization matter-Unique setting that if you're not familiar with may definetly be worth losing 30-40 hours in-Great RPG giving a mix of storytelling and classic character building-Player generated content that adds replayabilityCons:-Lots of writing (do not play if reading text makes you bored)-No multiplayer (I sincerely hope they add in co-op multiplayer in future DLC, but I understand why it is not currently a part of the game as they have focused on creating an immersive single player environment with compelling companions, but as anyone who has played tabletop RPG's in the past knows, a large part of the fun of these games is being able to run around with your friends attempting to complete the various tasks of a shadowrunner)Other Points of Interest:-I strongly recommend not playing Dragonfall until you have completed Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign) Not only is dead man's switch a better intro to the universe + mechanics, but after playing Dragonfall you will not want to go through Dead man's switch because it will feel like a tracked, clunky version of Dragonfall-If you're not really sure if you're interested in the gameplay go look up the Shadowrun Universe, because a large part of what makes this game great is how well they portrayed it, and if off the bat you don't like things like the idea of decking, the implementation of magic, or the way that orks, trolls, elves, and dwarves came into existence, chances are that you will continue to be annoyed by whatever annoyed you in a text based RPG.

Posted: July 15, 2014
												I'm proud to say that I contributed to this game's initial Kickstarter campaign.  It delivers a solid turn-based-tactical-RPG experience, and it paints a beautiful-if-grim-and-gritty image of the Shadowrun setting, and it tells a solid story in the process.For the uninitiated, the setting of Shadowrun is a dystopian future in which corporations rule the world and governments are beholden to the whim of these international corportations.  Magic, and all the fantastic creatures that come with it, reentered the world in the early 2000s.  And in all of this, a 'shadowrunner' is a mercenary who is hired to use their guns, magic, muscle, computer hacking, or remote-controlled drones on a job-by-job basis.One of the neat tricks that this game pulls is that different types of character literally see the world differently.  A mage can see ley lines on the ground that can bolster their magic (or that of their enemies!) if they stand on them.  A shaman can see spirits lingering in the world, ready to be called into battle.  A decker (read: hacker, who have neural interfaces in this world) can see hackable computers.  Okay, I think that anyone can see hackable computers, but you need a decker to get into them.Without revealing any spolers, I'd like to say that the story in the original game is solid.  It's nothing to write home about, but it makes for a great introduction to the setting, and fans of Shadowrun video games will see a familiar face.  The story in the expansion - which, by the way, was at least as long as the original campaign, and I've sunk 82 hours between the two of them - is, on the other hand, phenomenal.  Both games have great characters, although be warned that there's no voice-acting - if you demand that from your stories you should be aware of its absence.  The dialogue is similar to Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights - style, although if your character doesn't have the skills needed to engage in a particular line of dialogue, that line and its requirement show up, greyed out, so you know how to build your character next time.Of course, the game also comes with a level editor, and Steam Workshop support.  This was one of the big features touted during its Kickstarter.  I'm not immediately seeing a link to the editor from Steam but it's in the same folder as the game files.  I have not put this to the test but I'm told that it's a very powerful toolset.The combat system is interesting.  The greatest depth can be found in building your main character and selecting a squad for each mission as there is quite a bit of variety available in a character's skill-set.  Once you're on the ground there's still quite a few decisions to make, from where to take cover, to how tightly to pack your squad, to when and where to expend your consumable resources.  Personally, I found the game to be a smidge too easy on Normal difficulty, even when I realized that my character concept wasn't a particularly strong one in this universe.  There were two harder (and one easier) difficulties that I didn't try.Visually, the game performs solidly.  It's a nice, clean (well, grimy) - looking game, but it won't turn any heads for reasons other than the unusual setting.  The developers had other priorities, and they're priorities that I happen to agree with.Shadowrun Returns delivers a passable audio experience.  The game sounds great, all of the effects sound like I imagine they should...but there could really, really be more variety in background music.  What is there sounds wonderful, but I for one was tired of hearing the same music for every battle by the end of it.  Again, if you can't stand reading text, pass this one up, because it has no voice-overs whatsoever.All in all, I would heartily recommend this game to RPG fans, turn-based strategy fans, and Shadowrun fans alike.

												I felt that the DLC Dragonfall was below par compared to the original ShadowRun Returns. Luckily, the developers did add a save feature so I commend them for it. Although I enjoyed the game, the Dragonfall story was less exciting than the main game's story. For combat, it's like your typical RPG. It takes a while to understand which skills are best suited for a character. For one, the base campaign rarely makes use of a decker. On the other hand, Dragonfall incorporate all the features. Sadly, there is no uplifting music that promotes the gameplay. Final Verdict is to buy the base campaign and skip the DLC. Rating: 6/10 (60%)No AchievementsGame Done.			"

												I recomend this game with the simple caveat of get the Dragonfall expansion.  Quite simply Dead Man's Switch (DMS) campaign that comes with Shadowrun Returns is not bad... but its not great.  It's a decent proof of concept and works.  It does some things well and other things not so well.Dragonfall on the other hand is a whole different beast.  This game is simply one of the greatest RPGs I've played.  It has a great story and characters that you care about.  Some things could be better or more in depth... but that is hopefully what the Director's Cut of Dragonfall will be for.  If you read this and the Director's Cut is out... get that instead.  So far these guys have done nothing but do better each time around and I expect nothing different now.  I would reccomend DMS on its own.  I GREATLY recomend Dragonfall.  If you enjoy RPGs do yourself a favor and get it.			"

												Rather simplistic but fun RPG in the world of Shadowrun. It's simplistic because you can't change anything in the story, there is no branching you can't take different directions. There are no side quests. It's also rather short.Yet i'd say that it's easily worth playing, because what Harebrain does well is imagining the world, creating a story in that world, putting interesting characters in that story, writing fascinating background stories for the characters, etc. etc.. And these are all here and very well done.The combat is turn based and it works quite well, although it gets a bit boring at the endgame, where ther's basically no talking involved just shotting through dozens of baddies. The leveling system is plain, but gets the job done, you can create very divers characters from the shaman through the decker (hacker) there are lots of variations....and then there's the Dragonfall campaign:They listened to their fans and vastly improved upon the original campaign. The writing, the characters (my companions here are the most memorable video game characters since I don't even know when), the story, hell even the gameplay is a lot better. There is a central hub now, where you can take side quests, make donations, buy stuff or just converse with random residents. Almost every main mission involves at least one serious choice too.Everything that was missing from the original campaign is right here in an almost perfect package. Definitely one of the best DLCs I've ever played.One important warning though: There's lots of reading involved in both campaigns, so if you want non-stop action this is not for you!			"

												7.5/10Excellent story.  Very interesting campaigns.Gameplay is a little wanting.Graphics aren't the best, but they could be worse.  A lot of animations are reused and somewhat boring.Access to steam workshop so there is replayability and extra gameplay.Story:The original campaign ""Dead Man's Switch"" is relatively well written with an interesting plot which morphs and changes the further you go starting with something mundane and ending with bizarre.  It is extremely linear with very little in the way of optional quests not related to the story.  The ones that do exist often times are just there for flavor giving no benefit to the player.  However the finale to the campaign was very entertaining, though the ending was somewhat of a let down compared to the build up.The DLC campaign ""Dragonfall"" was a surprisingly well written story.  It ties together a number of different plots in such a way as to make the whole much greater than the sum.  There is a lot more in the way of optional quests compared to ""Dead Man's Switch"", but the story is still pretty linear since your likely going to have to do most of those ""optional"" quests in order to advance the story anyway.  This isn't to say that it's a bad thing.  Like I said, the plot for Dragonfall is very satisfying with excellent pacing, a surprising amount of flavor, and a number of plot twists which send a shiver down your spine including an ending with interesting ramifications for the world.  As a side note, the game played excellently in hard mode, though there are two sections in the game which I know a lot of people had trouble on.Gameplay:The gameplay is shallow compared to more familiar RPGs.  The selection of skills is rather small and the abilities associated with the skills are very basic.  Magic is a little more interesting, but for the most part many spells are very similar with many offensive spells having little variation between them.  Fighting in Shadowrun can be satisfying, but what really detracts from it is the way your character gains experience.  Instead of the basic XP system your character gains a resource called ""Karma"" as you complete quests, optional objectives, and other events.  The problem I have is that fights give you virtually nothing in terms of Karma.  This makes a number of fights just something to get through knowing that your likely not to get a reward.  I assume it has something to do with the nature of the resource in the game.Issues:There are a number of gameplay mechanics that are either under utilized, not working, or simply missing.  Etiquettes are a way of slightly customizing your character giving you access to some player decisions and conversation topics which almost always gives you either some sort of advantage or extra flavor to the game.  However in both campaigns, certain etiquettes are virtually ignored throughout the entire story making its choice a complete waste to the player.  For some reason some abilities available to a player are not shown in the character skill progression.  An example is all of the throwing skills you can use despite nothing indicating that they are available when increasing your throw skill.  Another thing I found issue with is the complete inability to decide which of my characters would pick up an item when out of combat.  That's right, your able to manually get your individual characters to pick up items in combat, but as soon as your out of it those items may as well be useless if your main character has a full inventory while your partners sit there with empty slots.  Which also brings up the topic of why aren't you able to enter the combat phase at will?  This would let you set up for fights such as getting in position, setting up buffs, and being able to get your partners to do things that you can't such as pick up an item or using their character skills.  The game gets around some of this by forcing the combat phase, but it would be better if you could manually enter combat phase yourself.Despite these issues which make the game seem as if it was left undone in some areas the story is, again, excellent.  It may not be worth the current full price to some, but if it's on sale I would recommend trying it out.  This is especially true in the case of Dragonfall, which will require the base game.  It should also be noted that you will also have access to the steam workshop which has a number of community made campaigns and scenarios available as well as the ability to make your own campaign should you so wish it.7.5/10Excellent story.  Very interesting campaigns.Gameplay mechanics are a little wanting.Graphics aren't the best, but they could be worse.  A lot of animations are reused and somewhat boring.Access to steam workshop allowing for replayability and extra gameplay.			"

												A modern game in the style of the SNES Shadowrun game. A vast improvement on the original in all departments. Only complaint it can be slow at times.Knowing how to save up your karma until you need it to improve a skill for a specific task is a must, and the battles can get challenging if you didn't prep right. Challenge is a Good Thing.Immersive gameplay, incredible atmosphere, gorgeous graphics. A must-play. And workshop integration means you'll never run out of content.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a science fantasy turn based tactical RPG. It takes place in the Shadowrun universe from the fantasy tabletop RPG game. It was successfully crowd funded through Kickstarter and it peaked my interest. I hadn't played a game that fit this discription before and was a little hesitant. A friend of mine highly recommended it to me. Later I got it on sale and had a quick look. I loved it. I finished the first campaign; 'Dead Man's Switch' over a few days. I was fully immersed in this new universe and I loved every second of it. I had control over my character, I decided who I wanted to be and what I wanted to train in. Then I learnt about a DLC for the game called 'Dragonfall'. I thought it might just be a small add on to the game. It's not it's another full length campaign. The Dev's listened to the feedback of the Shadowrun community, what they liked and what they didn't. From there they started to make a second campaign; 'Dragonfall'. I started playing that and it was even better than the first campaign. I thought, could this get any better? Well it did. The Dev's are in the process of releasing a Directors Cut of 'Dragonfall', which includes even more improvments and changes that the community have been asking for. Plus for people who have already bought the original 'Dragonfall' you can get the Directors Cut for free. So I highly recommend this game. It has an amazing, immersive storyline which has been brought to life by people who want to stay true to their fans and the original Shadowrun universe.			"

												I played the original shadowrun roleplaying game for years in my teens and early 20s. The world has an atmosphere that is a gripping grimy-fantasy-noir-cyberpunk-bladerunner blend that somehow works perfectly. I've played the game here on steam several times and I can only write that it is fantastic, loyal to the genre, fast paced, atmospheric and has good strong character development. Everyone should play it, no drek chummers. Please make more games like this. I want more! 5 out of 5 for me.			"

												The setting is new to me, so I can't comment on it, other than, you know, it's got sodding orks and elves in it, like every other vaguely fantasy setting, even if this one is cyberpunk. The combat is very new x-com-esque, and will probably scratch that itch if you're needing a tactical fix. I rather enjoyed it.Pros:- Functional story with a few twists and good writing (we're not talking Torment good, but there's nothing to cringe at)- Good range of character options with no single thing being mega OP- Deep without being overwhelming turn-based combat system which offers plenty of options- Lets you choose your team of level-appropriate mercs, freeing you from managing loads of characters skillsheetsCons:- Leaves you to read the tutorials tucked away in the menu rather than explaining the systems (possibly a plus if you're old school and find modern tutorials slow)- Decker classes are probably awesome the 2 or 3 times you need them to do their matrix thing, but have limited options in the real world, largely due to the lack of computers in most environments and effectiveness of shooting things instead- Arguably too easy if you use the options available to you: none of my characters ever came close to dying in the campaign, but this was normal mode and it's possible I'm a tactical genius and didn't notice.- A special weapon required for the final mission is intentionally short ranged and small-magazined. This is slightly annoying.- (Possibly a tiny bit on the short side for those used to epic RPGs, but there's no filler here, so I'll take no issues with it)I'm told the new campaign is even better, which sounds pretty good to me: wishlisted, as the cool kids probably don't say.

												Imagine a world filled with your wildest imaginations. A futuristic world where humans, trolls, dwarves, elves, and orks exist and live together. Imagine the presence of mages, cybernetic freaks, skilled hackers, deadly swordsmen, chi-casting masters, wicked shamans, and one-shot marksmen. No, let's not stop there! Imagine an organized group of people called Shadowrunners, who take missions from clients, avoid the influences of corrupt businesses, and lurk in the shadows. All of these ideas I mentioned are the world of Shadowrun Returns.   Shadowrun Returns is an immersive, intelligent, and fun game that is influenced by many references. It's a strategy cyberpunk RPG game that gives you freedom. In order to keep this review short and sweet, I'll make a Positives vs. Negatives list of Shadowrun Returns. POSITIVES:   -Main campaign has an engaging story that dives you into the mystery of your friend's murder. DLC campaign also has an engaging story that makes you uncover the secrets about an infamous dragon and the chosen one who defeated it.   -Twists and turns occur just when you think the story is over   - Lots of Races to choose from right from the get-go (Human, Elf, Troll, Ork, Dwarf). Each have special qualities and set-ups.   - Lots of Classes to choose from right from the get-go (Street Samuari, Decker, Shaman, Mage, Physical Adept, Rigger). Each have special qualities and differ in gameplay.   -A wide cast of characters who are surprisingly relatable and interesting   -A DLC campaign (Purchased Separately) that explains an aspect of the story more and provides a different experience from the main campaign. The DLC campaign is about as long as the main campaign. The DLC can be longer if you do all the side content there.   - Complex world with interesting atmopsheres. Game created its own terms (ex; chummer, nuyen) and has its own glossary in-game. Shadowrun is a combination of A LOT of influences. The decker class is heavily based on a book.   - Karma system (Skill tree) that enhances gameplay and abilities   - Game allows you to choose multiple conversation paths, making the plot more immersive.   - Depending on what class, race, and ability you pick, you will have more options to choose from when you converse with NPCs   - Some side content is avaiable in both campaigns   - Has a User-Generated Content system, which adds replayability value and allows the players to create their own stories and levels (just like the developers!)   - You can save ALMOST anytime (Can't save between conversations). There are also autosaves.   - You can hire other Shadowrunners to experience other classes and accomplish missions.   - Solid and unique RPG gameplay that is easy to learn   - Difficulty is scaled well, especially at the end of the game   - About 20 hours of content in main campaign. About 30 hours of content in DLC campaign. More hours of content when playing/making user-generated content.   - Solid musicNEGATIVES:     -Game doesn't have a lot of side content, making it seem linear at times.    -Sometimes, the game can get too complex in background story. (Might be just me)    -Occasional glitches and bugs, especially with the user-generated content.Of course the game has negatives, but look at how the positives outweigh them! I played about 50 hours of this game by playing the main campaign, the DLC campaign, and one of the user-generated content. I could easiy generate more hours by replaying the campaigns with a different class or trying out a new user-generated content. This game is worth trying out and it's definitely worth the price. I'll say the DLC is recommended too because it does flesh out some background of the story and it gives a fresh approach to the world of Shadowrun. Also, I'm sure I'm missing some positives and negatives because this game has a TON of content to explore. This game is amazing and I'm glad to play it.			"

												So, I never played the paper based version of this game although it was something I was aware of in my teens,  I picked this up in the Steam Summer Sale as something of an impulse purchase and, idly lookng for something to play fired it a week or too back and I've been playing it ever since.It's set in a sort of post-apocalyptic future world where after magic reawakens and the world is suddenly awash with Magic, Elves, Dwarves, Trolls and all the trappings of standard fantasy tropes, but retains guns, computers and technology. If you have ever read William Gibson's Neuromancer (and if not, why not?) then it's that world. But with magic. Governments have seemingly collpased, Dragons run rampant and Mega-Corporations now run the world. Into this your little band of mercenaries - shadowrunners - instigate heists, perform assassinations and generally do whatever they can to survive.Gameplay wise it's basically the Fallout & Fallout 2 model - you explore your environment and find stuff to do and, more often than not, end up in a turn based combat system. There are plenty of different character classes to choose from, ranging from street samuri (your tanks) to battle mages, shamen, Deckers (these guys are your computer experts and hack into ""the matrix"" (which is exacly what it sounds like)) and RIggers - guys who control robots to do their fighting. There are others too, and you can specialise how you like even mixing classes if you want to - although the jack of all trades is master of none, especially in this world. As you progress you earn Karma to spend on skills that your character class uses to improve and become much more effective in-game.The game is very solid - graphics are solid  for a kickstarted game, there are few minor bugs but nothing major - and the game stands very much on the quality of it's writing, which is very good indeed. The first campaign from the kickstarter (Dead Man's Switch) is very involving, and although I thought it lost its way towards the end at least gets you there - you'll want to know how it's all going to end. The combat system works as well - you'll be using cover, buffing your team mates and working out how to get the drop on your opponents. However it lacks some character development (for example you can only hire other shadowrunners, so you don't develop a team you get to know) and outside of the main quest there isn't much else to do. You can explore a bit, maybe find a few fetch quests but that's it. The expansion DLC Dragonfall is where this game is at though. It maintains the quality of the writing, it's got proper character development and you get a team of shadowrunners to get to develop and know as the game progresses. There are plenty of missions outside the main mission, with some real decisions (and consequences) to work through as you take them on. The main hub you retreat too a large area with plenty of other NPCs to chat to, some of who will give you some side missions, others of whom need you help.  It is a great little RPG and really deserves a lot of praise. Where game falls down is in two areas - there are too many character classes to choose from and to be honest many of them are essentially identical - only one set of classes use technology and other use magic. The only distinct class are the Deckers, but unfortunately the Matrix sections of the game are distinctly underwhelming - you basically run around a white wireframe world while red blobs shoot at you - and it doesn't really work. I have a lot of sympathy for the developers there - short of developing an entire differnt game for the Matrix bits I'm not sure what else they could have done - but it does sell the game very short.However don't let that put you off - there aren't many of them and the Dragonfall campaign leaves them entirely optional.Finally th developer has released a full editor suite of tools for you to make your own campaigns and release for public consumption. As good as they are, the developer campaigns aren't that long (Maybe 12 hours or so to complete) and so having fans with the ability to make their own efforts gives this game a lot more replayability. Some of the ones released so far are pretty damn good - Ashron's 'From the Shadows, Run' being a particular stand out.So yes, this is a good game with a lot of longevity. If you liked the original fallouts, Jagged Alliance, XCOM etc then you'll love this. It's got a few rough edges to be sure but they don't detract from the main game and it is more than worth a purchase.			"

												This is a xcom-like tactics game RPG. You control one main character that can hire mercenaries to attack various corporations. It is important to know that the game is extremely linear and that the original campaign doesn't have any forks. The levels themselves are tiny usually made out of less than 10 rooms. The combat is really fun with lots of special skills and weapon choices. However for some reason there is no shared inventories and you cannot trade except outside of mission. Also decker mercenaries (hackers) for some reason cannot assist you when you need something hacked. If your main char does not have the skill you are out of luck. I would say skip shadowrun returns and only play Dragonfall expansion. But that is not possible unfortunately. 7/10			"

												Review from a perspective of somebody who never played the original.  I guess this is also like a D&D tabletop thing too?  I came in pretty clueless.  It's a fun RPG with an interesting combat system, lots of skills and abilities, and several races with different stats and whatnot, so you've got the standards down.  The murder mystery campaign mode that comes with the game is good, although extremely linear, most sidequests come down to maybe opening a door or talking to an NPC slightly to the left.  Characters are also lacking, most of the interesting ones never join your party, leaving you with a few named characters from the story and a barrage of filler with one line each.The game universe is this weird mishmash of things, where I suppose the writers decided to throw every setting (Post Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk, Magic, Tolkeiny Fantasy Creatures, Urban Underworld) they could think of together.  And to their credit, it's not bad.  It's certainly weird, but not bad.  Some of the ""standard future slang"" makes its way in, though, so if you cringe like me everytime you read ""fracking"", some characters will be intolerable.  Shotgun toting dwarves and troll hackers aside, there's a lot to work with here, and the campaign editor is apparently fairly robust, so some good stuff should come out, likely for free on the Workshop.  Mechanically there are some mistakes.  I would have liked to rotate the camera in the fight scenes, and the saving system pretty much requires you to play through a single scene in one sitting, but there's a lot of fun to be had here.  The combat works well, kinda like XCOM or Final Fantasy Tactics, and the story has kept me interested so far.I wouldn't pay full price, but on sale, if it sounds interesting, pick it up and try it out.  I haven't even touched the usermade stuff yet, but it looks promising.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is an amazing game that has changed nothing from the deep and storied flavor of classic Shadowrun.  As a matter of fact, the original story mode from the SNES game that this iteration is based off of is available as a downloadable mission in the game's Steam Workshop.  Shadowrun will leave you empowered, deadly, and begging for more distopian Seattle to conquer.  Gameplay is perfect in that it gives the player the option to perform actions as they see fit, in whatever order they want, much in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics.  For example, where as a lot of turn based strategy games require that the player move, and then attack in phases, Shadowrun Returns allows player characters to take their turns together, and spend action points in any order the player wants.  You can move a character and then attack, attack and then move, attack multiple times, use multiple abilities, or move as much as you want, provided you have the action points for it.  Want to heal a character and attack with them?  Spend an action to move them to your medic, switch to your medic to heal them, then switch back to the first character, and walk them back in to combat guns blazing.  Not all fighting revolves around gunplay and magical blasts of death however.  Tired of only having the choice to convince the bad guy to give him self up of his own volition, or decide for him at gun point?  Plug into one of the cyberpunk futures numerous netscape access-points, hack police scanners and lead them to him, all while draining his bank accounts so he can't run, and forwarding his personal emails to the press so no-one wants to help him.  Just watch out for police and bank corporation hired player eating AI that roam the netscape looking for unwary hackers to slay.  But combat isn't all that Shadowrun Returns has to offer; where it really shines is it's role playing element.  Based off of the original pen and paper game that made Shadowrun so popular, you will spend most of your time in dialogue with other characters.  Don't expect the ""wall of text"" storytelling present in most ""story driven"" games though.  The player doesn't watch the story unfold, but instead dictates what happens next through their own brand of in-character interaction with their world.  Don't like the way that gang banger is shaking down that poor shop owner?  Flex your muscles, and smile a fanged grin to let him know that no matter how much he steals, it won't be enough to pay for his hospital bills, or if that's not your style give him a heads up about the police cruiser making rounds around the block to convince him that it's not worth his time.  Or if that's still not your style, and you'd rather make an example of him to other gang bangers, let him know that he's disappointing his mother, and lead him hand in hand to an early grave when he reacts poorly to the comment about his mother.  The best part is, no matter which version of conflict resolution you choose, you're going to get experience from it.  That's right, you don't actually get much in the way of experience from fighting, but from getting your character to grow as a person.  With few mandatory responses, and even fewer characters that won't respond differently to a specific kind of treatment, Shadowrun Returns boasts a story mode that feels like sitting across the table from a game master, trying to balance social politics while desperately seeking to solve a murder mystery.  Oh yeah, by the way, that's exactly what the standard starter story is, a murder mystery.  Gone are the days of ""go here, kill villain, save world"" role playing games.  In Shadowrun Returns, your character growth takes on the form of solving your own characters personal problems that lead to new friendships and adversaries, while saving the world is a side effect of beating the game, not the goal of it.    Shadowrun Returns may appear to be just an update to a classic SNES game, but with the plethora of official support, and the vast multitude of free user created content, it's clear that Shadowrun video games will never need an update again.  Now if you'll excuse me, it's raining in Seattle right now, and my cyber implants aren't waterproof.  If you need me, I'll be inside playing Shadworun Returns.			"

												As someone going into these games with *zero* experience with the Shadowrun universe beforehand, I was pretty overwhelmed with the notion of a setting that essentially exists at the intersection of BLADE RUNNER, NEUROMANCER, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Where one can meet a street-wise elven bartender, turn around, and project your consciousness into cyberspace -- all done in the shadows of massive mega-corporations that happen to run most of the world. Also, there are dragons.And seeing how this game is based on a pen and paper campaign setting that has been expanding and refining itself over the course of 25 years, the depth and breadth of the universe can most definitely be felt as you walk the streets of Seattle and Berlin. This is an outstandingly versatile and exciting setting, and the two campaigns currently available to a fantastic job of exploiting it to its fullest.SHADOWRUN RETURNS: DEAD MAN'S SWITCH - (8/10 Stars)Campaign Length: Approx. 12 HoursWhen you purchase the base game, SHADOWRUN RETURNS, you'll be purchasing a campaign titled DEAD MAN'S SWITCH, which has you tracking down a murderer in Seattle after an old acquaintance of yours turns up dead. The story takes a lot of twists and turns, as getting closer to the truth seems to be hazardous for your health. Along the way, you'll run into a number of very interesting characters (albeit, sometimes for far too short a time), including a few that fans of the SNES/Genesis/Pen and Paper games will find familiar.As others have pointed out since launch, DMS is a tad linear compared to most other RPGs on the market. There will be dialogue options aplenty, allowing you to play your character the way you want, but ultimately there are few choices that make a real impact on the story, and you'll feel the invisible hand of the narrative tugging you along without much room for sidequests or exploration.Regardless, the story of DMS is *more* than worth the price of admission. The writing and attention to detail do the setting a great service and it acts as a great introduction to the Shadowrun universe.DRAGONFALL - (9/10 Stars)Campaign Length: Approx. 18 - 20 HoursThat being said, it's a shame that most people have been judging the overall package on the weaknesses of DMS, because DRAGONFALL really is the definitive Shadowrun experience so far, and more than worthy of being counted among the best RPGs to be released in recent years.This time around, you play as a citizen of the Berlin Flux-State, where anarchy reigns (or doesn't reign?) and the nation's stability waxes and wanes as gangs, corporations, and political clubs fight for controlling interest in the chaos. As a shadowrunner, your latest mission goes horribly wrong, leaving you and your team kicked to the curb with no explanation as to what just happened. As you start peeling back the layers, you uncover conspiracy after conspiracy, and find yourself getting caught up in an F-State conflict that may very well lead to disaster for Berlin.As I said, many of the ""weaknesses"" of DMS have been rectified this time around. The linearity is not completely gone, but it's certainly well hidden, providing plenty of sidequests with multiple ways of accomplishing each, a more permanent group of companions with rich backstories, and a greater emphasis on choice. And, like DMS, DRAGONFALL does a fantastic job of playing up its setting, and making Berlin feel suitably unique in comparison to Seattle. There is just a greater sense of effort all around, including a more engaging story on top of it all.The base game and the expansion are presented anthology-style, with individual sets of characters and stand-alone stories, so if one hold more appeal than the other, feel free to play DRAGONFALL first. (Though, you will still need to purchase the SHADOWRUN RETURNS base game.)In the last few years, we've been seeing an RPG renaissance by way of Kickstarter, and SHADOWRUN RETURNS was among the first out of the gate. Neither game is completely perfect, but there's an attention to detail and a reverence for the source material -- not to mention some fantastic writing -- that makes the game and its expansion an absolutely immersive experience. I sincerely hope we get to see more of this universe, and judging by the dramatic leap in quality between DEAD MAN'S SWITCH and DRAGONFALL, the next game will surely be something to keep a close eye on.

												I'm proud to say that I contributed to this game's initial Kickstarter campaign.  It delivers a solid turn-based-tactical-RPG experience, and it paints a beautiful-if-grim-and-gritty image of the Shadowrun setting, and it tells a solid story in the process.For the uninitiated, the setting of Shadowrun is a dystopian future in which corporations rule the world and governments are beholden to the whim of these international corportations.  Magic, and all the fantastic creatures that come with it, reentered the world in the early 2000s.  And in all of this, a 'shadowrunner' is a mercenary who is hired to use their guns, magic, muscle, computer hacking, or remote-controlled drones on a job-by-job basis.One of the neat tricks that this game pulls is that different types of character literally see the world differently.  A mage can see ley lines on the ground that can bolster their magic (or that of their enemies!) if they stand on them.  A shaman can see spirits lingering in the world, ready to be called into battle.  A decker (read: hacker, who have neural interfaces in this world) can see hackable computers.  Okay, I think that anyone can see hackable computers, but you need a decker to get into them.Without revealing any spolers, I'd like to say that the story in the original game is solid.  It's nothing to write home about, but it makes for a great introduction to the setting, and fans of Shadowrun video games will see a familiar face.  The story in the expansion - which, by the way, was at least as long as the original campaign, and I've sunk 82 hours between the two of them - is, on the other hand, phenomenal.  Both games have great characters, although be warned that there's no voice-acting - if you demand that from your stories you should be aware of its absence.  The dialogue is similar to Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights - style, although if your character doesn't have the skills needed to engage in a particular line of dialogue, that line and its requirement show up, greyed out, so you know how to build your character next time.Of course, the game also comes with a level editor, and Steam Workshop support.  This was one of the big features touted during its Kickstarter.  I'm not immediately seeing a link to the editor from Steam but it's in the same folder as the game files.  I have not put this to the test but I'm told that it's a very powerful toolset.The combat system is interesting.  The greatest depth can be found in building your main character and selecting a squad for each mission as there is quite a bit of variety available in a character's skill-set.  Once you're on the ground there's still quite a few decisions to make, from where to take cover, to how tightly to pack your squad, to when and where to expend your consumable resources.  Personally, I found the game to be a smidge too easy on Normal difficulty, even when I realized that my character concept wasn't a particularly strong one in this universe.  There were two harder (and one easier) difficulties that I didn't try.Visually, the game performs solidly.  It's a nice, clean (well, grimy) - looking game, but it won't turn any heads for reasons other than the unusual setting.  The developers had other priorities, and they're priorities that I happen to agree with.Shadowrun Returns delivers a passable audio experience.  The game sounds great, all of the effects sound like I imagine they should...but there could really, really be more variety in background music.  What is there sounds wonderful, but I for one was tired of hearing the same music for every battle by the end of it.  Again, if you can't stand reading text, pass this one up, because it has no voice-overs whatsoever.All in all, I would heartily recommend this game to RPG fans, turn-based strategy fans, and Shadowrun fans alike.

												I was a big fan of the Paper & Pencil RPG since its first edition for its unique and immersive world of cyberpunk-meets-fantasy.  I just finished playing both pre-made campaigns (yes, you can also write & share your own campaigns) called ""Dead Man's Switch"" in the original game and ""DragonFall"" in the DLC update.  They fully deliver the atmosphere of the shadowrunner experience in these campaigns, and both storylines play out like good novels - I *highly* recommend playing this game, especially with the DLC update to allow mid-scenario game saves.It is generally a turn-based combat system where you have several ""classes"" but you are free to hybridize.  The archetypes include an offensive-spell-wielding Mage, a spirit-summoning Shaman, a computer-hacking Decker, a drone-controlling Rigger, a Chi/martial-artist Physical Adept, and of course the cyberware-laiden Street Samurai.  You also have a choice of playing a human, a dwarf, an elf, an ork or a troll - each with advantages and limitations.  Scenarios are written with multiple ways of success, but choosing a well-suited team for each mission is still critical.  I personally played a human detective-type character who was generally a Physical Adept but with a more diverse skillset, and made sure I had at least a spellcaster and Decker on my runs to cover my bases when possible.  The character generation system is not as detailed as the RPG but you will find the balance and flavor of the development makes the same kind of characters with most of the possible character concepts reconstitutable if you wanted to relive your gaming heydays.All dialog is text-based, so you only need speakers to listen to the theme music and sound effects.  I am a Linux user, and being able to play this game without a reboot was a *big* plus for me (but I still need Win 7 to make my own campaigns).  The storyline really flows, and I often found myself spending hours non-stop trying to unravel secrets and plan out a larger strategy.  Expect a game to take 50 hours or more to complete - I did Dragonfall in just under 60 hours on Easy without any redos of battles.One big drawback - this is Single Player only.  No co-op or competitive play.One word of caution - you play street-savvy shadowrunners (i.e. black-ops for hire) so it is a gritty world with lots of moral grey zones, foul language, blood-spilling violence and innuendo.  This is supposed to be a dystopian future of the mid 21st century, so be ready for some hard-luck stories and tough choices between jepardizing your pay or your conscience, with no hope of making a dent in the struggle between the urban poor and the ultra-rich puppet-master megacorps.  Also, be careful with your choices - they will impact later game play.  Fun times! :DTake a gander at the game, and review some Let's Play videos to see if you'd get into a game like this.  Personally, it was well worth the price.  Thanks for reading.(Edit: fixed some typos.)			"

The combat seems reminiscent of Fallout 2, with action points and such. The overall character customization is also very good, altough not so much appearence-wise, which isn't really a problem because you're rarelly gonna be looking at your character close enough for it to matter.

												Shadowrun Returns is a decent romp through a cyberpunk world.  It does a good job of making the world seem much larger than it is at first, and personally I really liked the characters, missions and story.  Since the cyberpunk community is rather small as far as selection goes, this is a no-brainer for anyone hoping to get some good PnP-lite action in.  The stories are told well enough and with community mods, you'll have plenty to dive into if you really like it.  So for the price is isn't a bad deal.If that seems like a general compliment, it is.  The game itself is a bit too simplistic for its own good, and fails to standout beyond its initial premise and art style.  This is a game with roots in the pen and paper role-playing world making it impossible to not ask 'where is the rest of it'?  Whether your character uses throwing knives, magic spells or a shotgun the gameplay is identical.  Levelling feels arbitrary because the skills are almost identical for any 'specialty' and there seems to be little reason to really diversify your party.  It's that mentality which does the most damage.  Character customization is highly limited outside of some nice details such as cyberware that becomes visible on your character, and weapons are as bog standard as you can get and don't even seem to have unique models.It's an average budget RPG with decent replayability and a fantastic setting.  The biggest mistake here was not trying for anything better.  Instead of a unique game in a unique setting, we got one that would be right at home on your cellphone next to Candy Crush.  It isn't a bad game, which explains the recommendation, but there's too many oversights or just plain missed opportunities to stand out that keep this game from being much more than a casual enjoyment.

If you like tactical battles, a rich sci-fi setting with a lot of history and room for a lot more stories, and have a roleplaying itch you need scratched, this game is a must buy.			"

												Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall is a solid, entertaining game.  I got Shadowrun Returns back at release, and the base game was frustrating, unforgiving, and bug laden.  I eventually stopped when an error prevented me from progressing on a map after over an hour of playtime.  I shelved it until now, expecting to come back once the errors were cleaned up.  Trying to pick up where I left off was fruitless, as my game was now corrupted.  I attempted to start from scratch, but Deadman's Switch wouldn't load at all after character creation.  Instead of giving up, I skipped to Dragonfall to see if it worked.  It did.  And it was amazing.  I can't say if Deadman's Switch ever got cleaned up or fixed or if it was any good, but Dragonfall made everything worth it and then some.  If you have this game, and the base story didn't grab you, get Dragonfall, because that is a slick DLC.			"

												This game was a lot of fun, but disappointingly short.  The pacing is also extremely linear compared to most RPG's with no option to explore the different areas once mission objectives have been completed.  This, however did not stop me from enjoying the game but it left me wanting a lot more out of it.However, the game does come with software to create your own campaigns and there is a lot of community created content to keep things interesting.  It's also supported by Nexus Mod Manager which makes it easier to keep track of the additional content.Overall I wish that this game was longer and less linear but the community involvement seems more than capable of picking up the slack.  Given time this game will have a lot more to offer in the future than it does right now.			"

												The setting is new to me, so I can't comment on it, other than, you know, it's got sodding orks and elves in it, like every other vaguely fantasy setting, even if this one is cyberpunk. The combat is very new x-com-esque, and will probably scratch that itch if you're needing a tactical fix. I rather enjoyed it.Pros:- Functional story with a few twists and good writing (we're not talking Torment good, but there's nothing to cringe at)- Good range of character options with no single thing being mega OP- Deep without being overwhelming turn-based combat system which offers plenty of options- Lets you choose your team of level-appropriate mercs, freeing you from managing loads of characters skillsheetsCons:- Leaves you to read the tutorials tucked away in the menu rather than explaining the systems (possibly a plus if you're old school and find modern tutorials slow)- Decker classes are probably awesome the 2 or 3 times you need them to do their matrix thing, but have limited options in the real world, largely due to the lack of computers in most environments and effectiveness of shooting things instead- Arguably too easy if you use the options available to you: none of my characters ever came close to dying in the campaign, but this was normal mode and it's possible I'm a tactical genius and didn't notice.- A special weapon required for the final mission is intentionally short ranged and small-magazined. This is slightly annoying.- (Possibly a tiny bit on the short side for those used to epic RPGs, but there's no filler here, so I'll take no issues with it)I'm told the new campaign is even better, which sounds pretty good to me: wishlisted, as the cool kids probably don't say.

												Disclaimer: I never played the old Shadowrun game. Ever. Never even heard of it.If you missed the description, Shadowrun Returns is an isometric tactical turn-based RPG. Think XCOM: Enemy Unknown's battle system simplified a bit. It's set in a cyberpunk world in which magic has resurfaced after hundreds of years. You're essentially playing detective for your dead friend in this environment, almost entirely by battling street gangs and corporate security.The graphics, for an isometric game, are spectacular. The sound, too is pretty good. The game's fun, and the battle system feels functional, though at times I was a bit frustrated by the difficulty.I have one major complaint and two minor ones.This is my one major complaint: Why is there magic? At no point in the game does it feel like the sacrifices to the integrity of the story are worth the inclusion of magic in this universe.My minor complaints are that the game is too short and linear (this is mostly rectified by Workshop content) and the Native American characters seem stereotypical, which is a bit off-putting.I recommend Shadowrun Returns, but with the caveats that it's under $15 and you go in knowing you'll have to play workshop content to get your money's worth.

												Ok so i just finished the main story. This are my firs impressions (im gonna edit it as soon as i calm myself a little). First at all as soon as u start to play the game u will realise, that this is the low budget game. There is no voicecasting, no cutscenes, no open world. But the game is just awesome the graphic is so beautyfull the story is deep and the atmosphere is breathtaking. This is  the must play game for every old school rpg fan. The game has its lows but about it later. Now just buy it and play it. If u seek elderscrolls like open world u are on the wrong adress. This game is linear like....hmmm like DOOM. I finished it in 2 days and im sure if i pull an all nighter i can make it in one day. I definitelly recommend this game. Edit Pending			"

												I've always been a huge fan of Shadowrun, and as such played most of the videogames based on it (except that FPS for the 360, and no tears were shed). So when I heard of a new game (actually a series of new games) being developed, yeah, I was REALLY EXCITED. What was advertised on Kickstarter and Youtube looked extremely promising, almost too good to be true. And it kinda turned out to be just that, with many features missing from the final game that were promised to be included.That being said, what came out of it is definitly worth playing and a worthy game in the Shadowrun line of games.At the time of this review there were two official campaigns, Dead Man Switch and Dragonfall, the second being sold as an expansion. Don't play Dragonfall until you play Dead Man Switch. Not because the stories are connected (they aren't really) but rather because Dragonfall's story is even better than Dead Man Switch (which was already excellent) and the gameplay is much less linear and improved.Plus, theres lots of fan made campaigns and more coming out over time.

Each expansion is a new adventure using the same game system.

If you decide to buy it, get Dragonfall with it. Play it first (they are not sequential, they are different stories), you won't be sorry. Also there is some real good workshop content to try. Shadowrun Unlimited in particular is worth playing as it is very different than the story campaigns that come with the game.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is pretty faithful to the table top role playing game. The language and the atmosphere is spot on.The Deadman's Swicth campaign is an interesting and deep story which I found absorbing.I enjoy turn based combat so this just felt right for me. The upgrading of skills is of a depth and variety that can appeal to all types of RPG players. I rolled with a human ""Face"". High on inteligence and charisma. Which meant I didn't have to fight in every situation, I could at times use diplomacy or just blag my way through some scenarios. Which incidently is very much how I play the table top version.For me this was a top experience and for was a 92% game. Obviously deduct some from the score if you do not like turn based combat, rich stories or have no interest in the SHadowrun Universe. But if you love all these things then it is a must buy.			"

												A very linear but very fun RPG, The game consists of three main components Combat, exploration, and conversations Combat consists of a very basic turned based strategy, it isn’t the most unique system but it carries the game well enough through its roughly 11 hour playtime.Moving around the world is perhaps the most disappointing part of the game; you have little to no interaction with the environment beyond clicking yellow objective prompts, there’s also very little exploration beyond a few slightly more expansive environments for the most part the game consists of linear corridors, although admittedly very nice looking corridors Dialogue options are varied but ultimately lead to the same conclusions, they exist more to allow you to develop your characters personality and role within the shadowrun universe. Dialogue for the most part is well written. A bulk of the game comes from lengthy NPC exposition; most of the characters aren’t very memorable but the overall murder mystery has enough turns to keep it interesting until the conclusion Even with its faults it’s still a surprisingly fun game that quickly eats away at your time, if you can overlook the faults and just enjoy the cyberpunk charm that I’d fully recommend the game and its standalone expansion “Dragonfall” "

												I played both SRR DMS, and SRR Dragonfall, and are playing SR5 tabletop since summer.I can say both games are pretty good on catching the shadowrun atmosphere. Dragonfall is true on 'Berlin setting' trivia, and the designers sure did their 'legwork'. Its a great game if you are playing pen n paper, and want to get the 'feeling' in an crpg too. Or if you like powerfull toolkits that allow you to be creative. I am sure there could be a different game for the kickstarter income. But this would have no toolkit and this very nice people who made some pretty solid campaigns on their own, free of charge.You can expect a solid, slow, oldschool  game. But if you are expecting mass effect level production value, look for EA or Bioware. They got nice looking shells, true, but they lost their essence on the way.			"

												If you enjoy tactical turn based combat and compelling storylines this game is for you.Pros:-Great writing-Fun turn based tactical combat-Greater than average ability to feel like your character's skills and the choices for specialization matter-Unique setting that if you're not familiar with may definetly be worth losing 30-40 hours in-Great RPG giving a mix of storytelling and classic character building-Player generated content that adds replayabilityCons:-Lots of writing (do not play if reading text makes you bored)-No multiplayer (I sincerely hope they add in co-op multiplayer in future DLC, but I understand why it is not currently a part of the game as they have focused on creating an immersive single player environment with compelling companions, but as anyone who has played tabletop RPG's in the past knows, a large part of the fun of these games is being able to run around with your friends attempting to complete the various tasks of a shadowrunner)Other Points of Interest:-I strongly recommend not playing Dragonfall until you have completed Dead Man's Switch (the original campaign) Not only is dead man's switch a better intro to the universe + mechanics, but after playing Dragonfall you will not want to go through Dead man's switch because it will feel like a tracked, clunky version of Dragonfall-If you're not really sure if you're interested in the gameplay go look up the Shadowrun Universe, because a large part of what makes this game great is how well they portrayed it, and if off the bat you don't like things like the idea of decking, the implementation of magic, or the way that orks, trolls, elves, and dwarves came into existence, chances are that you will continue to be annoyed by whatever annoyed you in a text based RPG.

There's no classes, so early on the best thing is to have a gun skill, a magic skill and some cyber skill because the game equips you before the second fight based onm what skills you start with. On your first playthrough, make sure you examine the whole interface for you and each character in your team, a lot of skills give special abilities you won't know about if you don't dig a little to find them (different attacks with their favorite weapon, different magic spells).

												I gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with Shadowrun Returns when it arrived last year. BUT. Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall completely turned me around. I had backed the Kickstarter so I received both and on a lark decided to give Dragonfall a try when it showed up in my library.I played on very hard because one of my complaints was that the Dead Man's Switch campaign was far too easy. Very hard is what I would recommend for anyone who enjoys tactical rpgs, otherwise the difficulty isn't there.This time around the game has a hub system, and a save anywhere system. Both were desperately needed. The writing is just good. The characters remind me of old-school Bioware characters. Personalities you get quite attached to.Its not super deep. But its deeper than you expect. On very hard it took me about 20 hours. My only real gripe is not being able to equip items or gear on your other runners. I still don't quite get that but it's not a deal-breaker. You get over it.If you're looking for a fun summer game. You like tactical rpgs, you like Shadowun, don't pass it up. My final advice is play Dragonfall first. I didn't finish Dead Man's Switch initially but liked Dragonfall enough to go back and squeeze some fun out of it. The two are COMPLETELY unrelated so it doesn't matter which order you play them in.			"

												Yeah, this is definitely a game you are going to want to play. There was some debate as to what style of game this is amongst my gaming peers. This was resolved in my opinion by describing this as a fairly perfect video game emulation of the table top gaming experience. It has elements in common with games like XCOM:EU, Dragon Age, Baldurs Gate, and plenty of other aweome games. However, it really stands alone by virute of its comletely intuitive gameplay, deep and yet simple customization system by way of karma points, and a pretty gripping story. The graphics are cool looking for a top town style game, and do a great job of depicting the world in whuich Shadowrun resides. There are plenty of conversation options, and a touch of morality decsion making, but for the most part, all choices lead to the same place. Overall, I felt this to be a completely engaging game, so much so that the 21 hours or so I put into it only really felt like 8 or 9 hours. I look forward to future expansions and such and am keen to try out the user generated content.Pretty much the perfect game for the subject matter and genre.Enjoy!!!			"

On the other hand, it cost a third of the price during the sales, so it's well worth looking into if you feel yourself in need of a nice tbs game while waiting for top releases.as an added bonus, there is a lot of custom fanmade dlc available for free on the steam community hub.

If you liked Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, or any other similar game, you'll probably like this.That being said, don't expect too much from this game. When compared to the classics, Shadowrun Returns isn't just short - it's light. VERY light. Expect to solve puzzles quickly and easily. Choosing gear doesn't involve much more than buying the most expensive gun. Combat is actually quite dull. Speccing out your character is kind of fun, but I was left wishing I had more options. It's a surprisingly simple game overall.I played as a Decker, which was great for the story but left me relying on the tried-and-true (and boring) combat tactic known as ""shoot things with guns a lot."" Mages seem a bit more interesting, since placement in battles was somewhat more important, but since you can't use hired Deckers to interact with objects outside of combat you're somewhat hamstringed if you go with a non-Decker class. Each area could have definitely used a LOT more alternative solutions.I've only played the basic campaign so far, and I will probably pick up the DLC, but the fact is that most of these problems are with mechanics and game design, not with the campaign itself. Still, the writing is good - really good. Combined with the rich built-in lore, it makes an otherwise mediocore game a fun experience worth your time and money.			"

												If you're a fan of old ISO rpgs like Fallout and the SNES Shadowrun, this is pretty solid.  No the deepest RPG around, but good story and fun turn based combat similar to the Fallout titles. If you've read other reviews online  you've likely heard about the editor that can be used to craft your own stories and campaigns, and that's where the game's potential is.   Community created scenarios and campaigns are already out there and some are very well done. For fans of Shadowrun, this is a must buy.			"

												The graphics aren't particularly pretty, but the story is good.  Turn-based combat is similar to X-COM.As with any RPG, remember what Curly said in City Slickers:  ""One thing.""  The game rewards you for specialization rather than for being a jack of all trades.			"

												It took me a while to decide to buy this game since it looked cool but I don't usually like turnbased games. I finally oicked it up over this last steam sale and I'm glad I did. It's a lot of fun and very satisfying to play. My only complaints are that it is too short and sometimes the missions will require you to take a certain character with you, who never seems to be as usefull or as powerful as the characters you can just hire. Also, I wish you could spec each person in your squad and choose their weapons to customize it more. But still, this game is awesome.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a fairly short experience, but well worth it. The ""Dead Man's Switch"" campaign that the game comes with really feels like a Shadowrun tabletop RPG campaign, and is well written. On top of that, the game comes with the tools to make user generated content - something which a lot of people have already taken advantage of - and you can therefore find a wealth of player-made campaigns as well, giving this game more longevity than just the campaign it ships with. If you're a fan of cyberpunk and roleplaying games, this is one to get!			"

												I was a big fan of the Paper & Pencil RPG since its first edition for its unique and immersive world of cyberpunk-meets-fantasy.  I just finished playing both pre-made campaigns (yes, you can also write & share your own campaigns) called ""Dead Man's Switch"" in the original game and ""DragonFall"" in the DLC update.  They fully deliver the atmosphere of the shadowrunner experience in these campaigns, and both storylines play out like good novels - I *highly* recommend playing this game, especially with the DLC update to allow mid-scenario game saves.It is generally a turn-based combat system where you have several ""classes"" but you are free to hybridize.  The archetypes include an offensive-spell-wielding Mage, a spirit-summoning Shaman, a computer-hacking Decker, a drone-controlling Rigger, a Chi/martial-artist Physical Adept, and of course the cyberware-laiden Street Samurai.  You also have a choice of playing a human, a dwarf, an elf, an ork or a troll - each with advantages and limitations.  Scenarios are written with multiple ways of success, but choosing a well-suited team for each mission is still critical.  I personally played a human detective-type character who was generally a Physical Adept but with a more diverse skillset, and made sure I had at least a spellcaster and Decker on my runs to cover my bases when possible.  The character generation system is not as detailed as the RPG but you will find the balance and flavor of the development makes the same kind of characters with most of the possible character concepts reconstitutable if you wanted to relive your gaming heydays.All dialog is text-based, so you only need speakers to listen to the theme music and sound effects.  I am a Linux user, and being able to play this game without a reboot was a *big* plus for me (but I still need Win 7 to make my own campaigns).  The storyline really flows, and I often found myself spending hours non-stop trying to unravel secrets and plan out a larger strategy.  Expect a game to take 50 hours or more to complete - I did Dragonfall in just under 60 hours on Easy without any redos of battles.One big drawback - this is Single Player only.  No co-op or competitive play.One word of caution - you play street-savvy shadowrunners (i.e. black-ops for hire) so it is a gritty world with lots of moral grey zones, foul language, blood-spilling violence and innuendo.  This is supposed to be a dystopian future of the mid 21st century, so be ready for some hard-luck stories and tough choices between jepardizing your pay or your conscience, with no hope of making a dent in the struggle between the urban poor and the ultra-rich puppet-master megacorps.  Also, be careful with your choices - they will impact later game play.  Fun times! :DTake a gander at the game, and review some Let's Play videos to see if you'd get into a game like this.  Personally, it was well worth the price.  Thanks for reading.(Edit: fixed some typos.)			"

												Shadowrun is good. Making a kitchensink setting isn't always easy (after all, this is magic AND cyberpunk) and making Shadowrun games is even harder. But this is good. I liked the first campaign a little more than Dragonfall, but that might be a side effect of some technical issues (and some incredibly bad luck at dice rolling). The main issue I have with the game is visuals. While the character portraits are supremely good and backgrounds look good more often than not, combat leaves a lot to be desired. While the character models are good enough, especially when viewed from so far away, the combat animations are lacklustre. And the greatest shame is how spells bland and impactless the spells look. Other thant that, it's a very good RPG that should not be missed.			"

Posted: March 5, 2015
												There are some VERY heavy caveats going into this overall positive review.Shadowrun started as a pen & paper RPG in the 80s that set a lot of the trends for the cyberpunk genre. You have a future sci-fi world where cybernetics, magic, computer hacking, and fantasy races all exist side by side. No one has really attempted a Shadowrun video game since the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions over 20 years ago. The classic Shadowrun missionn usually consisted of your team raiding a mega corporation building to get somethig valuable. You broke into the building, fought your way through security, covered your decker (hacker) as he broke into the computer to steal valuable data, then made a getaway. The Genesis version did this particularly well with random generated missions and a separate, detailed combat system for hacking.Enter Shadowrun Returns. On its own, it's a solid RPG. It would best be describe as a linear version of the old Fallout games meets the combat system from X-COM Enemy Unknown. The writing is also very good and is probably close to being up there with stuff like Deus Ex. If that alone is good enough for you, then go for it and get this. $20 might be a bit too much though and you might want to wait for a sale.Now, the negatives.Linear: There is no open mission system. You get ONE very short optional mission the entire game. There is only one classic ""corp raid"" mission in the entire game.Hacking: Has always been a huge part of the Shadowrun universe. The Genesis version did a great job with it. In Shadowrun Returns, it is useless and poorly implemented. There are only 3 points in the whole game where you need a decker (hacker), and the game will tell you in advance as well as provide you with one for free. Aside from that, there are only 2 optional decking areas in the whole game that will only open up a single room for measly rewards that won't add up to even a fraction of the money and experience you put into the decking skills to get them. It's a total waste to invest in any decking skills for your main character or spend money hiring deckers. Worse, the hacking portions are just an exact copy of the regular combat only with a virtual reality reskin. It's disappointing because all they had to do was copy the Genesis version hacking system and it would have been great.Guns guns guns: Shadowrun has always been about a huge range of combat choices. Guns, remote control drones, melee weapons, martial arts, and 3 different branches of magic. In this game, guns are vastly superior to any other combat path that it's not worth bothering with anything else. And out of the different gun types, only shotguns and rifles are worth it. The combat systme is similar to X-COM but it literally becomes X-COM when all you use is rifles and shotguns. 90% of the combat options and a huge part of Shadowrun are uselss here. Deal 22 damage at range with a gun, or use magic to lay down traps the enemy has to walk over for 12 damage? 22 damage with a single gunshot, or spend your whole turn summoning a spirit that does less damage and might break free to attack you? Spend action points casting spells to inflict minor status effects, or spend the same amount of action points flat out killing an enemy with guns? They're all no brainer choices and the choice is always ""guns"".Hit percentage: The game will tell you your percentage chance to hit each target. That number is always always B.S.  You're going to constantly be missing 4 times in a row on attacks that had a greater than 70% chance to hit (5 misses at 85% was my record), while anything under 50% is a guaranteed miss. It's way too consistent to chalk up to bad luck. There has to be some hidden factor that the game never tells you and it makes weighing tactical options a pain.Useless conversation skills: You can put points into charisma which earns you conversation skills in certain areas like ""security"", ""gang"", ""socialite"", and so on. Getting even half of the areas requires a huge experience investment in charisma, and each conversation skill only comes up a grand total of ONCE the whole game. Some let you get past a plot obstacle, but it's unnecessary because the alternate solution will be sitting literally right next to the obstacle. The other conversation areas will get you maybe an extra 200-400 bucks the whole game. That's it.Tight money: Money is ridiculous tight in the game. You get around a total of $14k over the first 6 hours of the game. Spells cost 200-1200 each. Grenades and medkits run up to 500 each. Hiring party members is 1000-3000 each PER MISSION. Armor is 2000-4000. Cybernetic implants will run you up to 5000 each for very minor bonuses. This just further cements guns as your only combat option because they're by far the best money value when just $2000 will set you up with best guns to breeze your way to victory. You can't grind for more money; 80% of all the money you get will be handed out at pre-determined stages of the plot and the other 20% isn't worth investing in the skills needed to get the extra. In the final quarter of the game, it finally gives you enough money to buy stuff, but at the same time it gives you the best stuff for free, meaning it makes money pointless at the same time it gives you enough to do anything.The final note about this game is that while it's still a decent linear Fallout experience on its own, every single thing it does is done much, much better in Shadorun Dragonfall to the point where I'd say you should just skip it and go straight to Dragonfall. I still give this game a positive recommendation since it's not bad, but it's pretty much made obsolete by the Dragonfall sequel. "

												Shadowrun Returns offers a single pre-loaded story called Dead Man's Switch as well as the tools to produce your own stories and content or play others' creations. Focusing on just Dead Man's Switch as that's all I've done so far you will find a fairly interesting story of about 10 hours worth of gameplay (on the normal difficulty) with a small set of jobs that are exceptionally linear. It feels more like an introduction to the systems and setting of Shadowrun than a full fledged game, but it's very fun nonetheless! The music is very appropriate to the environments, and the character dialogue is entertaining to read. The combat and progression systems are easy to pick up so it doesn't take long to get right into the game, and because of the many ways in which you can improve your character for both combat and non-combat roles replayability seems high. I'd definitely recommend picking this game up!			"

												The good:+ The world is interesting, and looks great. Has this kind of style that feels gritty, dark, and unique.+ You can really seem to play whatever kind of character you want (at least on normal).+ Combat on normal is not hard, but just hard enough that you might die randomly. I feel like it’s a good mix for just a casual gamer.+ Not too long. No unnecessary grinding. To the point. Play through took like 12 hours or so.The story:- The story isn’t anything special. There are some nice twists, but parts feel sort of disjointed like there was bigger ideas that just never quite made it in to the game.- The game does not always do a good job explaining some of the mechanics but really if you are playing on easy or normal you’ll pick it up relatively quickly and many of the mechanics are present in future games.- I feel like even scaled up the text is generally smaller than I would like.- Ssome wonky interface stuff. For example healing other team members in between combat.TLDR;An interesting 2d isometric cypberpunk rpg. Not the greatest RPG I have played, and certainly not the worst. I don’t have very strong feelings on the game, others in the series are better, but this one is OK and probably worth a play.			"

												If you're a fan of old ISO rpgs like Fallout and the SNES Shadowrun, this is pretty solid.  No the deepest RPG around, but good story and fun turn based combat similar to the Fallout titles. If you've read other reviews online  you've likely heard about the editor that can be used to craft your own stories and campaigns, and that's where the game's potential is.   Community created scenarios and campaigns are already out there and some are very well done. For fans of Shadowrun, this is a must buy.			"

												It took me a while to decide to buy this game since it looked cool but I don't usually like turnbased games. I finally oicked it up over this last steam sale and I'm glad I did. It's a lot of fun and very satisfying to play. My only complaints are that it is too short and sometimes the missions will require you to take a certain character with you, who never seems to be as usefull or as powerful as the characters you can just hire. Also, I wish you could spec each person in your squad and choose their weapons to customize it more. But still, this game is awesome.			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a fairly short experience, but well worth it. The ""Dead Man's Switch"" campaign that the game comes with really feels like a Shadowrun tabletop RPG campaign, and is well written. On top of that, the game comes with the tools to make user generated content - something which a lot of people have already taken advantage of - and you can therefore find a wealth of player-made campaigns as well, giving this game more longevity than just the campaign it ships with. If you're a fan of cyberpunk and roleplaying games, this is one to get!			"

But if you time is limited and you are looking for best times to be had look to the better more polished.  This seem like a budget turn-based game and is not as good as Xcom enemy unknown, Fallen enchantress: Legendary Heroes Civ or Warlock.  The game has a lot of good options but with limited time I prefer big budget more polished games. Ok game nothing too grand though.  If I had my time back I would have spent it on a different game pretty forgetable...			"

												An accessable, isometric cyberpunk RPG? It would be a crime to *not* like it. It's generally well-written and thought-provoking, there's quite a bit of variety in character-building and the combat is challenging and varied without being overwhelming.It's all over quickly - less than 10 hours - but not every RPG has to be a 50+ hour epic. It's nice to have a focused storyline, a clear objective and to not have to sort through endless loot for a change. There's at least a degree of replayability through vastly different character builds and some choices, so the game should be good value for money.			"

												First of all, I'm not a long-time fan; My first contact with the Shadowrun franchise was with this game. Though of course you miss out on stuff if you're not familiar with the lore, it's easy enough to catch on. Cleared Dead Man's Switch and Dragonfall. Ten hours for the former, twenty for the latter. Combat is a turn-based tactical thing that would be best described as a slightly more streamlined but also dumbed-down version of XCOM's battle system. It's okay.DMS is pretty linear and has a relatively barebones story, but gives room for roleplaying. I played a decker, however, and it's really unfortunate that decker skills are pretty much useless in it.Dragonfall is much better, with more options to end each quest, well-written characters with their own backstories who stick with you throughout the game (this might not sound like much, but it's what DMS was sorely lacking), and chances for all character classes to shine (my decker/rigger actually did awesome stuff!.I VERY highly recommend this.

												Definitely a sleeper.  In a world of gaming flash and pomp, and very little meat, Shadowrun is a refreshing throwback.  There's no voice acting here, nor is there any movie quality cutscene, not even at intro or outro.  What Shadowrun is is a turn based RPG that ranks up against the best of the classics (D&D Gold Box, for example).  The campaigns are a little short, but well worth the investment in time, money, and effort to play through.  Fair warning, the graphics are lush and pretty much competitive, but the dated audio (including lacking voice talent), inability to rotate the camera, and other qualities make the whole game feel very dated.  A great dated game, mind you, but dated nonetheless.			"

												The top-down Kickstarter-funded RPGs are starting to come out of development, and if this is any indication, it's gonna be ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. This particular game captures the feeling of the old console games and it plays like XCOM: Enemy Unknown (which I'm not about to give it♥♥♥♥♥♥for, XCOM did many things right when it came to turn based combat.). The included campaign, Dead Man's Switch, is a solid module but has issues with its constant gunplay and slightly bruised writing. And there's also a mission editor and the ability to plug different mechanics in with different user-written modules. It's a good game now, and if the modding community gives it a lot of love, it's going to be a fantastic game later on.			"

												Shadowrun Returns had the potential of being a great game, however, they fell painfully short. First off, the game is incredibly linear. Make sure you complete EVERY task as you come across it because you can't go back to do it later. Second, there is no save feature other than a waypoint system that autosaves the game when completing quests and changing areas. So if you need to step away from the game you either let it sit open until you come back, or you lose playtime when the game reploads your last autosave. Third, the game was on the short side. I was able to complete the entire game in about 12 hours.Now on to the good stuff...I really like the skill based system that lets you pick and choose what you want to do with your character. There really needs to be more games with this function. The game also had some interesting characters (I especially liked Dresdan). I like that NPC attitudes changed based on how you responded, and that your skills actually swayed them one way or another. I would recommend the game to others, but to be honest, I'd wait for it to go on sale first. $20 for a 12 hour extremely linear game is a bit on the steep side in my opinion.			"

												3/5 Not everyone can enjoy a game and sadly I was not blessed with an interest in this game.The storyline was oh so bland. I started this game years ago (and decided to resume and finish it today) but I can still recall how easy you walked into the story, witnessing everyone play their scripts and all you had to do was blow them away or allow them to live for one reason or another.I tried to like my character and his pursuit to help a friend ------ Not that this game catered to the user's ability to customize the personality of the character he made, but I don't quite enjoy playing a game that gives you limited options for responding to encounters. You act as some sort of mercenary so you're supposed to be rough around the edges, but it seems every conversation just reeks of one writer half-assing all your responses. Let alone the cheesy NPCs that don't know who the hell you are and should smoke your♥♥♥♥♥where you stand, but instead they want to give you a chance because hell, the society that works in the ""shadows"" has nothing but secrets  and tours to give about their secret organization.Lore/Environment was lost on me as well ----- This game is lovely that it tries to make a new fantasy world away from the redundant DnD aspects of Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale (two of which I adore), but for a newcomer it was just too much to process, not that it was well explained why the things around me existed anyway.

												This game will appeal to a particular gamer. Remember the old SNES version of Shadowrun? If you liked that game, you will love this. It plays in mostly the same way, with mostly the same watered-down rules to the classic pen-n-paper roleplaying game of the same name.On the plus side, the game embodies the essence of what Shadowrun is: cyberpunk meets magic. There are plenty of ""class"" features to play as and the runs themselves are entertaining. The combat is fun and takes a marginal amount of tactical skill. There is an editor built into the game, so if you're handy with such things, you too can create your own games. And there are some characters from the old game as well as Shadowrun lore that make an appearance. The game also necessitates that you hire shadowrunners yourself to complete jobs, thus creating a team party. This is fun.On the negative side, there is only an auto-save feature after you complete a run. So if you're in the middle of an hour+ jaunt and you gotta leave for work - guess what - either leave the game running or start over. The game also ignores some of the major mechanics of the pen-n-paper game such as essence and magic. Cyberware (machine augmentation in a character's body) lowers essence in the old game. Low essence means that one's magic rating starts reducing as well. Put in too much cyber and you'll eventually be such a weak mage that you can't light a candle with a fireball spell. In Shadowrun Returns, you can do both with only a spell cooldown modifier. The mixed side is that the game is rather short and has a fairly linear story. A good story, but it's pretty straight to the point. I wanted more when I was done. This is a good compliment in reference to how fun the game is to play. It's a negative though in the sense that there isn't more. But for $20 (or $18 that I got it for on sale), the game ended up costing me $1/hour to play from start to finish. Of course I can download user-generated content or make my own if I so wish, so at least there's that.Ultimately though, if you liked the old SNES version, this will be a nostalgic blast from the past. If you're a fan of the pen-n-paper game, this might annoy you, but overall it encompasses the feel of the original game.. so, give it a shot. You'll probably like it.			"

												 This new release is is more lot more complicated and move involved than the Sega Genesis game I played a long time ago but I do miss the ability to just visit the streets and grind out a level or two against whatever baddies I find out there.  I don't think I've found any treasure other than keys on dead opponents so plan on buying everything you need because other than a couple grenades, healing items or a boost of some sort you'll be shelling out for all those fine items you want. There's a certain linearity to this version that might not be noticeable if you have never played the Sega Genesis version but maybe I'm still complaining about not being able to walk the streets whenever I want to. Yeah, that's probably it. The story so far is pretty cool and they do wait for you should you pick up a side quest BUT, don't skip any 'likely fights' you see while on the streets because chances are good you won't get back to them or at least I haven't yet. I'd recommend this game. It's a 75+ out of 100.			"

												Shadowrun Returns marks a return to the Shadowrun universe in video game form after a really long hiatus. And it is indeed a brilliant return. The gameplay itself isn't much to shout about. If you've played games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you'd already figure it out although XCOM's gameplay was still more refined than the one in Shadowrun Returns. This, being a Kickstarter-funded game, there's no voice-acting, just text-based dialogue. Text-based, but very well-written. In fact, the story is the game's strongest point. A cyberpunk conspiracy with all sorts of twists and turns while also showing off the different types of creatures or people who populate the world. As of now, the main game's price has been reduced a few dollars, so I see no reason why you shouldn't purchase it. Don't expect a revolution in gameplay and you'll definitely enjoy this game as it is.EDIT: I already played Dragonfall and I agree with the majority of players, it is better than the base game. So a purchase of the Director's Cut is a definite must.			"

												Shadowrun does some awesome storytelling as if you're sitting with friends around the table and listen to the GameMaster telling the story. This feature really shows that some of the original FASA people are involved and I really like it as old-school RPG lover....old-school RPG-lover... But yet I've never really gotten into Shadowrun :( And when playing this RPG I'm sad that I never did. Damn, the setting just rocks and the game mechanics are pretty neat.About the computer game itself... Graphics aren't that great though, but the way the story is presented and told makes up a lot! It feels more like the old 80s text-adventures with painted surroundings and animations, like the early BioWare adventures (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and such).Music is also a so-so for me. There's not too much, the effects are simple, but it all fits just fine in the whole Shadowrun setting.A very good point I found at start is the editor and the amount of adventures (runs) already available for this RPG. When you're done with the actual story (and the upcoming DLC soon), there's tons of other adventures to choose from.I'd say, if you're an old-school RPG lover - BUY THIS ONE!			"

												It's a tricky endeavor to build a game mainly on story and narrative - but Shadowrun Returns handles this with success. Shadowrun is a lore-rich cyberpunk/fantasy mashup universe which has been explored since the 90s. There are more than 40 novels in English, 5 video games and countless table-top campaigns. There is also an MMO being developed. Having it's back on this lore, this game offers a very compelling story, rich characters and and immersive game play. One downside, however, is the linearity. Even though character and class variations are well balanced and of satisfactory variety, the playthrough is linear. This wouldn't necessarily be a downside if this game was an action/adventure game; but over the years we've come expect at least some sort of openworld gameplay. I hear, however, the upcoming expansion will be addressing this.The additional plus for this game is its workshop. You can download user made content (which exist, and are pretty good) from new classes to new campaigns. Go ahead chummer, you'll like this one. Wiz.			"

												Much easier to learn and digest than the SNES iteration of Shadowrun.Shadowrun is a basically an engine and editor that comes with a campaign to load up out of the box.  The user generated content is where Shadowrun Returns really shines.If your're into cyberpunk roleplaying with turn based combat and a bit more emphasis on story and character development, this is right up your alley.

												Thematically great, amazing narritive, engaging story, akin to old school RPGs. The base game was fun, but the true quality lies in Dragonfall.  The add-on campaign is written so well that you feel part of the story -- you hurt when things go wrong for the people you care about, and it has you agonising over decisions that need to be made regardless of their severity. Great experience.			"

												Base Campaign is alright but very linear, and doesn't even try to give you a sense of choice. Dragonfall expansion is far superior to the base campaign, with great (avatar worthy) characters, writing, and scenarios, and it takes a more non-linear approach than the Base campaign.The UI can be♥♥♥♥♥sometimes, but the game is still very fun and I enjoyed both campaigns thoroughly. I will certainly pick up the second expansion should they put one out.The stand-alone Director's Cut is available on Steam as well, and I'd recommend playing that one over this version here.			"

												This game will appeal to a particular gamer. Remember the old SNES version of Shadowrun? If you liked that game, you will love this. It plays in mostly the same way, with mostly the same watered-down rules to the classic pen-n-paper roleplaying game of the same name.On the plus side, the game embodies the essence of what Shadowrun is: cyberpunk meets magic. There are plenty of ""class"" features to play as and the runs themselves are entertaining. The combat is fun and takes a marginal amount of tactical skill. There is an editor built into the game, so if you're handy with such things, you too can create your own games. And there are some characters from the old game as well as Shadowrun lore that make an appearance. The game also necessitates that you hire shadowrunners yourself to complete jobs, thus creating a team party. This is fun.On the negative side, there is only an auto-save feature after you complete a run. So if you're in the middle of an hour+ jaunt and you gotta leave for work - guess what - either leave the game running or start over. The game also ignores some of the major mechanics of the pen-n-paper game such as essence and magic. Cyberware (machine augmentation in a character's body) lowers essence in the old game. Low essence means that one's magic rating starts reducing as well. Put in too much cyber and you'll eventually be such a weak mage that you can't light a candle with a fireball spell. In Shadowrun Returns, you can do both with only a spell cooldown modifier. The mixed side is that the game is rather short and has a fairly linear story. A good story, but it's pretty straight to the point. I wanted more when I was done. This is a good compliment in reference to how fun the game is to play. It's a negative though in the sense that there isn't more. But for $20 (or $18 that I got it for on sale), the game ended up costing me $1/hour to play from start to finish. Of course I can download user-generated content or make my own if I so wish, so at least there's that.Ultimately though, if you liked the old SNES version, this will be a nostalgic blast from the past. If you're a fan of the pen-n-paper game, this might annoy you, but overall it encompasses the feel of the original game.. so, give it a shot. You'll probably like it.			"

												Lays down the foundation for a really good game... and then leaves you wanting.Can't say I had a bad time. I have really enjoyed my whole 10~15 hours of Shadowrun.The art and music are good and true to the cyberpunk universe. The fighting is simple yet quite tactical and enjoyable, and while you will miss your 93% hit chance suspiciously too often, it's not too frustrating (definitely not as much as X-com) even in hard mode. The storyline is the big star of the show, with a rivetting plot that you cannot miss or forget, simply because there is only one straight line throughout the game.This is possibly the most linear RPG I've ever played, so if you are looking for open world or side quests, stay away from this. There is literally just one side quest in the entire game, and it doesn't seem to change anything.There is however a lot of freedom on how to spec your character and its class, but this is also where it builds up excitement to leave you wanting at the end. There are so many options to choose from, which seemingly open many doors... most of which never become of use. If you want an example, you get rewarded a whopping 15 skill points after defeating the last boss, after which..... credit roll !All of this feels like a prologue to something greater, like the devs just lay the bare foundations of the game and then vanished hoping the community would build up on it....and they have! The game has an editor and there are lots of community levels to choose from, finally offering you a way to use those interesting mechanics  which were underexploited in the main campaign, like the matrix hacking.Whether you call it a cheeky dev serving you a teaser, a greedy dev letting the community do the work, or a wishful dev trying to unleash the public's imagination in true table top RPG fashion, the end result is still, a very well rounded game which will keep you entertained without overstaying its welcome.

												Откладывал прохождение этой игоры как только смог, знал, что веселье будет коротким, а новых модулей от сообщества ещё толком нет, от разработчиков только в октябре, но не смог больше тянуть - сел и взахлеб прошел последнюю битву. Чувство детской радости и настоящего разочарования вперемешку, хотя на этом можно и закончить короткую заметку, но все же.Когда проект увидел на кикстартере, начал активно ждать - в арты сразу же влюбился, сеттинг был знаком по игре на сеге, врать не буду, ничего тогда не понимал, просто бегал и исследовал локации. Появился предзаказ в стиме, сразу захотелось приобрести, но, учитывая прошлые разочарования, решил сначала таки ознакомиться с геймплейными видео и прочими штуками из интернетов. Вот тогда и случился приступ ярости - восьми-десяти часовая флешка, без какой-либо реиграбельности, абсолютно линейная с боями без челленджа.После долгих и мучительных сомнений все же приобрел. Начал исследовать ролевую систему - проста, изящна и гибка, освоить её можно просто поглядев на древо умений, ничего сложного нет. Сама игра дерзко устраивает покатушки по киберпанк-рельсам, свернуть никуда не удастся - как выяснилось, не только из-за лени разработчиков сделать что-то огромное и массивное, сам движок и его особенности не позволяют. Пока что. Бои в самом начале никакущие - можно лениво тыкать на все подряд, осваивая механику (так сильно похожую на последний xcom), в самом конце хочется размахивать руками и громко ругаться, внезапные перемены сложности выбивают из колеи.К слову, в концовочке и последних эпизодах самый смак.Но веселье, как я выше писал, было недолгим. Нуар закончен, дело об убийстве бывшего коллеги раскрыто, у каждого персонажа своя концовочка (ах, какие персонажи!) и вот собственно все, печальные титры идут безмерно долго, мельтеша записями никнеймов всех бейкеров.Ждем-с октября! Думаю кампания в Берлине будет куда более массивной.Как итог: если фанат изометрического олдскула - можно взять, понастальгировать. Не стоит расчитывать на глубокость арканума, скорее фаллаут тактикс в киберпанке. Только короткий. Очень короткий.			"

												I liked what I was able to play of this game, but considering I keep hitting a bug that won't let me continue with the campaign, I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't recommend buying this game. If you got it for free, sure - just know that this bug may turn your game into an extended demo. I can put up with the UI that will only respond to 1/3 of your clicks, but I can't get past a game that won't let you play it (or even close it) once you've hit the bug.The developers have known about this bug for years, but still haven't fixed it. I don't think it's going to be fixed anytime soon. Makes me glad I didn't waste my money on their new Kickstarter.A quick edit: Oh, and I almost forgot: the save system is useless - when you want to save the game, you can't, and relying on the checkpoint save system is useless, as it doesn't save after key moments (completing objectives, etc).

												TL;DR version:+Awesome and immersive setting with an engaging story and characters+Nice artstyle and visual design+Big variety in classes, races, weapons and combat styles+Don't have to make a certain class to experience playing as that class+Fun and traditional turn-based combat, with a lot of possible combinations of classes in your party+A lot of good dialogue which can be affected by your character's skills and etiquette-Linear and short-Too little gear upgrades and loot-Fairly easy overall-A lot of dialogue, should you not like reading a lotFull version:Shadowrun is a Cyberpunk strategy RPG game, with a very interesting setting, and a crazy but engaging plot. I like the artstyle, and it feels just right for this setting. The areas you visit look good and are designed nicely. It features turn-based combat, with an AP system which determines how many things you can do in a single turn. It also features a cover and line of sight mechanic, and the longer the distance between you and the enemy, the lower your accuracy.The game also has a very big variety when it comes to classes to play as and combat styles or weapons to use. This might be my favorite aspect of the game, just because it gives you so much freedom and so many options in creating your character. It's a shame the game turned out to be very linear aside from some side jobs and your character skills influencing specific parts of missions. But since you can upgrade every stat as you want, and hire characters to join your party, you don't have to play through the game again to experience all of the different combat styles and class skills. I would really have liked to see an actual loot system in this though. There are only a few different weapons and about two or three armours in each category, which felt like too little. There are some more spells, but that's because there are better versions of the same spell. It would have made it a lot more fun to me if there were more gear upgrades altogether, or it could have featured a Diablo-like loot system to make it even deeper and more varied.There is a LOT of dialogue in this game, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you enjoy reading. But if you do enjoy reading, then you'll like the dialogue too. It's pretty well written and it makes this setting feel even more engaging and immersive, but it does have typos here and there. Having certain skills at certain levels or having certain etiquettes and also influence how a conversation goes. For example, you might be able to encourage a guard to let you in, or tell him something to distract him, or just intimidate him or knock him out. I personally liked the dialogue, since I also liked the plot and the characters, so I wanted all the background information I could get about this world and the characters I met. But I will say that there should have been some more actual gameplay relative to the amount of dialogue there is.Overall, this game was a great experience and I loved it. I recommend this game to both casuals and veterans when it comes to RPG games. Actually, I might recommend it the most to the more casual RPG players, since the game is short and pretty easy overall, unless you play on the harder difficulties. This low-ish difficulty makes it easy for inexperienced people to get into the game, but will probably leave the more experienced to not feel truly fulfilled with this experience. The story, character building and good - albeit linear - gameplay which belong in an RPG are all there, but it does lack the difficulty and length you would want or expect from a game like this.			"

I really loved the interpretation of decking into the Matrix. If you enjoyed the RPG then this is a great trip down memory lane.But I don't think I'll finish playing the game through. The scripted dialog is moody and the storyline is interesting, but every dialog choice feels like it leads to the same conclusion. The combat feels arbitrary and doesn't seem to have the nuance of other turn-by-turns I've played like xcom.7/10.			"
