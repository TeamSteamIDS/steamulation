												Possibly one of the strangest and greatest games ever made.This is a story about a man named Stanley ... but honestly it really is a story about a Narrator and the exquisite mental torture he puts you through trying to figure out why. 'Why what?' I hear you ask. No! Just simply 'why'. A question you will constantly ask yourself, and probably never answer well enough to feel satisfied.So what is the game? Well you play Stanley, who works in an office. And one day Stanley realises everyone else has disappeared and it is up to him to find out why ... or is it? You see the problem with describing this game is whilst there are many different endings, none of them seem to be 'the right one', or perhaps all of them are.Yes I realise this review is not even slightly helpful in undertand what this game is, and wether or not you should buy it.  So here it is: Buy this game and play it! It is something that everyone should experience. Love it or hate it .... you really should try it.

OverviewThe Stanley Parable is a one of a kind game. You play as Stanley, an employee that has to press buttons. When suddenly, you stop and head out your office. A narrator describes your adventure and it's up to you to listen to him or not. Explore the office building and make different choices every playthrough and unlock all of the many endings possible!The Pros:Beautiful - The graphics are decent, the lightning glorious, and walking through the building is pleasant to the eye.Choices - The best thing a game can do for you is let you be in control. The Stanley Parable makes you make your own story, every step of the way, and unlocking a different ending every time. Such decisions include taking the left or right door, going to the meeting or not, or turning off the evil machine... or not. Every action has a thing to say for the ending.Comical - The narrator says things that are sometimes very funny, the way he reacts when you disobey him and the scenes you encounter have some very rich monologue.Deep - It might not look like this the first time you play, but as you uncover different endings you will see the hidden meaning behind Stanley's story. The writing is very cleverly done, the existance of the narrator poses further questions, and the very nature of reality bends amongst different endings.The Cons:Repetitive up to a point - As the story forks at different intersections, you are bound to repeat parts of it until you reach the branching point. Some of the paths require waiting for long narrations to play, so you might become a little impatient along the process.Unconventional Achievements - Most achievements require a degree of witt to figure out what they want (or read a guide) but there are some that are really unnecessary, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, implying either BIOS Time Changing or leaving the PC idle for 24 hours, the Unachiveable, which requires configuration file tweaks and the Go Outside which makes you not play for... 5 years. Of course, circumventable with a little sly techniques, but they are not achievements related to the game. They don't track progress or skill, they're just there to mess with you and waste your time.Conclusion:The Stanley Parable stand out amongst the rest of pshycological narratives and really puts the player in a position of power over his destiny, or at least gives him a very powerful delusion about it. Buy with confidence, it is an enjoyable experience.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												At it's core, it's a playful mockery of video game storytelling themes.  The writing is clever, and the narration is charming, while also managing to be just a little unsettling.  It's a game, so much in that you control movement and press buttons.  But there isn't any combat, and the freedom of choice is just an illusion (which is kinda the point).  It's meant to be played over and over again, just to see the different reactions you can get from the game.  And there are many many reactions to find.And if this doesn't sound like something you'd want to spend any time with, you can always treat it like a really obscure easter egg hunt.  Because there's a ton of those too.  If you are like me, and you try to break a game just for fun, you might find out that this game considers it a legitimate storytelling branch.And if that doesn't sell it to you either, you can consider it a narrator annoyance simulator.  It's something for everyone, provided you like these three things.			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: The Stanley Parable 

			Views: 3,477		

			This is the story of a man named Stanley... Is The Stanley Parable, a game originally released as a Half Life 2 Mod, good enough to warrant a $15 asking price?Why buy the cow when the milk is free?		

	The Stanley Parable began life as a mod for Half Life 2 and was recently updated and released on steam with achievements, more story branches and shiny new visuals. It places players in the mundane shoes of Stanley, a corporate desk jockey who is placed in an office in front of a computer where he punches buttons for a living. One day his monitor goes blank and the other corporate drones that he shares the office building with disappear and so begins your Journey as Stanley.  Being the dull chap that he is, Stanley himself doesn't offer much ion the area of entertainment, but a charming English narrator provides the personality and humor necessary to make The Stanley Parable an enjoyable experience. The narrator provides player with instructions, becoming almost like a GPS device that has confused itself for a raconteur.	Where most games are about following the rules, The Stanley Parable is best enjoyed when breaking them. If the narrator says go right, you will certainly find more satisfaction in taking a left and listening as the narrator's knickers become twisted by your wanton disobedience. By taking these divergent paths you will find yourself faced with one of the game's 15 different conclusions. Each conclusion revels something a bit different about Stanley and they range from conspiratorial to surreal. The game plays a few tricks on you by repeating rooms endlessly or swapping out props on the fly truing an office into an apartment space. All of this is rendered in a simple and clean visual style. The color palette is muted to reflect just what a dull and miserable existence our pal Stanley has and the props are equally generic creating an appropriately stodgy atmosphere. As advertised the texture work adds far more detail than could be found in the original mod and overall the HD remix has much greater visual appeal.	So is The Stanley Parable a biting satire of the way in which modern games tell their story by allowing us to control a character on a predetermined path where deviation is punished? Is it a parody of the life of the average key punching office drone? Or, is it just an excuse to have a rather cheeky British man tell us what to do? The answer is that it's all of these... and none of them. It's a game that will give each of it's players a different take away. Each playthrough lasts between 15 minutes and a half hour. This doesn't sound like a lot of playtime, and it isn't but there is a tremendous degree of satisfaction in finding new ways to get the game to react to what you are or, in some cases, are not doing. Seeing all 15 endings without consulting a guide will probably take around 3 hours. These 15 endings are not Mass Effect 3 style endings either—they are wholly unique and there are a couple of treats for gamers to be uncovered. Ultimately, The Stanley Parable will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it holds a very special spot in the gaming landscape. It's a testament to satire and unconventional design as well as manipulating gamer's expectations. In short it's the antithesis of it's key punching dullard protagonist.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a narrative story that stars, you guessed it, Stanley. Stanley works in a dead end job carrying out mindless tasks; and the story is told by one of the best narratives I have ever heard. Graphics isn't an important feature here, but that being said, it looks really nice.  The design of the world is very well done, you are essentially in an office building, but it does a very clever thing where you can sometimes be walking around in a circle, and then all of a sudden the world changes, and you are somewhere else. This made the experience feel more real to me. You can make this game as easy or as difficult as you want. There is fifteen different stories and endings to the Stanley Parable, each of them is amazingly written, probably one of, if not the best story in gaming I've experienced and well worth playing.  It has taken me almost seven hours to play through all of the endings, and do all but one of the achievements. After you have played all of the endings though, there is probably no need to go replay any of the game again. Is the game worth £9, 99, sure? For about seven hours of gameplay and the amount of fun I had playing it; you cannot miss out on The Stanley Parable. This is now in my top ten favourite games of all time.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												The Stanley Parable is a really good meta-game. The game investigates the relationship and interaction between the character, the player (you), the narrator and the game developers. (Almost) The entire game is set in a dull Source-made office landscape, yet managed to keep my interest all along because of the intriguing and deceiving narration. You can play through it in probably half an hour on your first go, but the game has tons of different endings, and you can approach the game in lots of different ways. I played it for roughly 2,5 hours, and I believe I got all the endings, or at least as many as I fancy for now. Give it at go!			"

												Stanley Parable is a unique, if not atypical game. You play as employee number 427; an employee who only pushes buttons as per the instructions of his superiors. Stanley, however, does not receive any orders one day, therefore, he gets up from his desk and starts investigating what exactly has happened.And this is where you take control of him in this FPS which uses the well-known game engine called Source. Our protagonist immediately notices that nobody else is present in the office - he passes empty cubicles and corridors trying to find the answers.There are no weapons in this game. No NPCs you can interact with. No objectives. No goals. Stanley Parable is about exploration. And this exploration, this journey of our white-collar worker is accompanied by the narrator's voice.However, you will notice that the narrator tells Stanley, in advance, which door he is supposed to take. But you can refuse the command and go to the direction you desire. And this is the most crucial part of this game: it is about choices. Your choices.And these choices can yield you at least a dozen endings. Endings that are funny, serious, sarcastic and some are even meant to be no more than mere easter eggs.This is not something you'll spend dozens of hours with. No, Stanley Parable can be completed in a mere 30 minutes, still, it's worth the journey and the appreciation.			"

So Stanley instead clicked the thumbs down button for the review, which made his entire review make absolutley no sense at all, but he posted it anyway. After he posted his review, he realized that everyone in his workplace was missing, so Stanley-Note: This serious review for this serious game was seriously typed on a serious computer in the serious room, seriously.""Aw crap, the Narrator hacked into my computer and wrote this rather humorous review for The Stanley Parable. Here is my real review for this game:The Stanley parable is an interesting game, but it has no jumping, no zombie killing, and no Call Of Duty references in it, but a whole lot of button pressing.This game gives you choices, but a small number of choices. The many endings are quite few and I believe there should have been more of them.There's really not much more I can say about this game. It does have a balanced amount of humor and it is actually good humor. Wow, a game (better yet SOMETHING in modern America) with actually good jokes. Other than that, the game is pretty fun, for about 5 hours. To be honest, it gets kind of boring after playnig it for a while.7.5/10This game has potentional and it is of acceptable quality, but it needs more to it. You can buy it out of curiosity, but it won't entertain you for long, unless you do it for achievement farmi-After Dr. FeelGoose wrote his review on The Stanley Parable, he checked up on his download for WarGame: European Escalation.

												I'll try to tell you what the Stanley Pararble is about without spoiling to much. This is gonna be long, so bare with me. The Stanley Parable is a game like no other. You play as Stanley, a man who works in an office and pushes buttons for a living. One day you look up and see that everyone in the office has disappeared...As you wander around the office, a narrator narrates everthing you do. EVERYTHING. ""Stanley wandered around touching everything the office, but there was nothing to be found""""Stanley stepped into the broom closet, even though there was nothing there.""""Stanley continued down the hallway even though he knew it would lead to his violent death.""As you come to rooms with multiple paths, the narrator will tell you what path to take. You choose whether to obey him or not. If you continue to disobey him, the narrator becomes angry with you and reacts differently depending on what you have done. The narrator is hilarious when you aggravate him! He breaks the fourth wall many times, stating that he knows he's in a video game. I also really like how much there is to explore in the game. While it may feel confined, if you truly think outside the box there are tons of things to discover. Hidden rooms, narrator soliloquies, and other secrets are everywhere. Even when you think you glitched the game, the narrator scolds you for trying to break his masterpiece. Not to mention there are about 20 endings to the game to discover. (Some are very hard to find though.) I think the price is a bit high for the game, so try to get it on sale. I got it for $4 and it is definitely worth a few bucks more than that. (Maybe not $15 though.)Overall, this game is one of my favorites. It's hilarious and your mind will be blown as you try to wrap your head around some of the paradoxes in it. Highly recommended.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a ground-up remake of the cult Half-Life 2 mod and expands it in a dozen directions without altering its fundamentals. It is one of those ""first-person walking"" games in which you wander around a completely non-violent experience exploring the environment and unravelling the story, like Dear Esther.You are Stanley, an office worker. Stanley has the job to push buttons on command until some day those commands abruptly stop. Stanley is leaving his desk to investigate, his actions are directed by a narrator who guides him through the office facility to discover the truth.The Stanley Parable is a game about walking from A to B. As you approach a pair of doors, the narrator will indicate that Stanley takes the left one. Whether you do and how you decide to follow up your revolt or acquiescence, tilts the game towards wildly different conclusions. A playthrough may only take minutes, but The Stanley Parable has a lot of choices and a lot of different endings. It will take a few hours to see everything and every ending.At each of the game's many intersections, you can follow the narrator's instruction or ignore it and face the consequences of your petty resistance. Each combination of choices leads to something unique. Some of these ""endings"" are lighthearted, some are absurd and many centre around the narrator's attempts to get back to his story.The Stanley Parable has not the best Source Engine graphics. Many of the environments are bland, but deliberately so. Delightful hidden details show their faces everywhere if you are willing to look.The best part of The Stanley Parable is the voice acting of the omnipotent Narrator. He plays witness to every move which do you make. From a kindly, yet firm, guiding hand at the start of the game to an acerbic wit if you ignore him, the Narrator really adds a soul to the world of The Stanley Parable.I enjoyed the game and I would recommend the game to people who want to try out something different instead of the normal games, but I would advice everyone to try out The Stanley Parable Demo before buying the game. It will tell you nothing about the main game, but you should then be able to decide if the game is something for you or not.If you should still be unsure, you can also try the free mod, to make your final decision. The mod does not actually require Half-Life 2 on PC, only the Source SDK.Sounds 8/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 3/10Atmosphere 8/10Video of playthrough:

Narrator: ""Stanley was fascinated about reading reviews. On this particular day, a new review showed up on his news feed. Stanley got excited. Without hesitation, Stanley began to read it.""Narrator: ""Sorry, I said, without hesitation, Stanley began to read it.""Narrator: ""Ahem. Without hesitation, Stanley began to read it.""Narrator: ""STOP IGNORING ME!""The Stanley Parable is an odd one partly because it is, in essence, a first-person walking simulator with minimal “gameplay” in it.  So, does it qualify as a game? Not in the traditional sense, that is certain. So what is the catch then?Unlike other walking simulators you would find around, The Stanley Parable's gimmick is its narrative-driven ""gameplay"", so to speak. Taking the role of Stanley Parable, you find yourself alone at your desk in the office until one day when the computer screen turns blank and all your colleagues mysteriously vanish. At this point, you begin to follow The Narrator’s voice which “guides” you through the complex by narrating what Stanley would have done in the first place.But this is where the game shines and, arguably, distinguishes itself from other dull walking simulators. If you remember how games nowadays (maybe even in the past) boast about how they provide the player with choices and consequences which in reality are all just an illusion, then The Stanley Parable showcases and criticises the nature of those narrative constructions in video games. You are given various opportunities to not do what the voice tells you to do which leads to a range of interesting, but twisted events and endings - some are peculiar, some are rather sad and others are hilarious. During each ending though, the playthrough resets and takes you right back from the start where from there on it is up to you to do whatever you want, once again. Whilst this might seem weird, maybe even underwhelming since you begin to think that you just completed the “game”, in fact it is all a continuation. Each reset is a new experience where at least one thing is different from the previous playthrough. As much as I would like to discuss these events and endings, they should be left for the player to experience without spoiling anything. So, the""game""  indirectly encourages the player to break the flow of the narrative and does it in a very smart way, indeed. It all comes down to the level design which was well thought out. At times, it even starts playing with your mind. It makes you question yourself: Are you in control? Or is the “game”? What if it is neither? Heck, it even mocks both you and itself, including The Narrator. The hidden story behind all this is rather deep once you uncover it. What it tries to achieve here is unprecedented. Additional praises include The Narrator’s voice acting which is excellent and the soundtrack that fits perfectly with the mood of the “game”. Visually, it looks similar to any recent Source game. It has a nice colour pallet and some of its aesthetics resemble something from Aperture Science. In truth, The Stanley Parable does many things right, it seems, making it very hard to criticise it for any flaws or to even be nitpicky. The most obvious observation would be that it is a very short “game” of up to four or five hours if you go for all its endings, I would say. It is even possible to complete it in about five minutes if you follow The Narrator’s instructions. However, based on its scope, I believe it has the right length and does not over stay its welcome. More would have definitely made it actually repetitive.In conclusion, at the end of the day, I personally found the experience enjoyable and perhaps that is enough to warrant a recommendation. It is a not a traditional game, and I would even say that it is not a game. It acts almost like an interactive playground for the player to experiment various ways to break the narration. But it is uniquely designed, intelligently written and amusing at times. Yes, very creative. Actually, it might as well have the best narrative as far as I am concerned. Personally, I could not find any traditional faults with it, aside from having almost no ""gameplay"", if that counts. I will admit that this might be the first and only non-game which I really enjoyed. So if you are looking for a traditional game, then do not get The Stanley Parable. You will be disappointed. However, I strongly recommend it for its one-of-a-kind experience which should not be missed nor ignored.One advice though: Do get it on a sale. I believe ten pounds, or your regional equivalent, is a tad too much for its amount of content, even if it is exceptional. Maybe that is its only flaw actually.			"

												This short review/analysis contains spoilers about the game. Stop reading if you want to have a fresh experience with the game. Everything below is my speculation, don't take them as definitive facts.The Stanley Parable is everything and beyond video games. It's a giant commentary on todays game development philosophy. Throughout its unexpected span and twisty narrative, it has a clear message - there are problems with narrative in video games, which we have not addressed yet.In recent years we have seen a great amount of open world/sand box games. But there hasn't been shortage in linear games with strict control over players actions. Invisible walls or direct threatening by the game if you go off the map, even in scenarios where the level design suggests more freedom than the available and, but not limited to - bugging out the whole game or level by reaching unexpected locations are common practices in multiplayer and even in singleplayer games since decades.The layout of the office (which is briefly explained in the museum, behind the scenes room) is designed and created with the mind that the dialogue and attention span of the player would balance and lead to the first sense of conflict - the two doors.This first dilemma is presented geniously - with a confident and calm voice. At this point the narrator is still following the hardcoded written script. Which is what I describe as the main and simple story the whole Stanely Parable is based around - there is a problem, the protagonist decides to end the tyranny of the evil force and it concludes with a happy ending.The simple story has cartoonish elements. Toward the end of it, it cultivates exaggerated tone and willingly becomes boring, it's purpose is to show the most basic and at the same time intriguing story. But only if the player obeys/follows the steps the given by the narrator. Not obeying the narrative, leads to all sorts of interesting results, which ultimately don't explain the whole picture of The Stanley Parable, which is left to players imagination. The game doesn't feel the need to address any of the questions which the audience asks frantically after playing it. The same happened in the demonstration, particularly in the 'Escape elevator' sequence.Throughout the exploration/ending hunting there are many sections where the nature of narration and design in games is examined and often made fun out of.Many actions, which are not part of the hardcoded script, of the player are directly commentated by the narrator.Like the 'Broom closet' - this room has no place in the whole game. In traditional game narrative it would be a waste of time - there isn't a collectable or extra life and if the player decides to explore it, the game would punish him for doing so. But here, the comedic nature of TSP rewards the player for paying attention to it, even if it is only a piece of dialogue.Achievements are another device with which the The Stanley Parable mocks the current video game industry. Take the 'Click on door 430 five times' for example  - a great way to address the ridiculous amount of pointless achievements in some games. Or 'Unachievable' - an obvious phantom which doesn't have a solution. It is created solely that particular part of the player audience grinds through the game, desperately trying to get it.So, how does The Stanley Parable get away with being so rude to every aspect in the modern video game industry, while being part of it?Its complete and constant self awareness makes TSP simply perfect. It is written and executed exceptionally well. It deflects most of the criticism, directed at it, simply by being one.			"

												There really isn't anything that you can say about this except that it isn't a game.  Anyone buying it as such will be sorely disappointed.  What it IS is a brilliant commentary on not just gaming culture, but the thought processes of gamers themselves.It really is brilliantly done, and superbly executed.  As a gamer, I felt a strange air of danger and menace throughout, as if something was going kick off and lead to some sort of battle for survival, and the game plays with this notion throughout, offering a number of different ""endings"".  The ""good"" ending (which I won't spoil) is a very well observed satire on game design and player choice.It really is hard to write anything about the game without spoiling something!  All I can really say is - it's not for everyone.  Some people may look down on people who don't enjoy it or don't get it and that's not entirely fair.  The ideas and concept explored aren't hugely complex, but probably require a high level of self awareness and self criticism on the part of the player.In summary - this is a sublime mix of art, gaming and genuine entertainment.

With that being said, this is one of the most creative and incredible plots that I've ever had the privilege to play. It pulls you into an ever changing relationship with the narrator that becomes the most important part of the game.

												This isn't a review so much...as it's more of an...observation.When I bought this game, I expected a quirky, fun, and curious adventure.Why then, throughout every ending, was I constantly on edge? This is not a horror game. In fact, there is only one single part in the entire game I would say could actually jump you, and it's an error noise.But...something within me was bothered during my gameplay. Was it the blank interior? The lack of music? Maybe it was the pure silence you experienced while awaiting the narrator to provide you with your next choice. No. I think it's more.There's something else about this game. Something I noticed from the start. Something about this game is...wrong. It's like you are being watched. The entire time. And, even more disturbingly, you discover in one of the endings that this is entirely possible. This is not a horror game. And yet......it's something else entirely.			"

												This Steam user was going to write a review, but they weren't sure exactly what to say about the game. Perhaps it was the great storytelling of the Narrator, or the way they couldn't pick up items. It could also be that they liked the part where the Narrator's voice was amazing and that MUST be the reason they chose to use the Narrator as a reference for their review style. This review was simple: Just two more sentences to type, and they'd be ready to post it. But they were unsure of whether to say they liked the game or not. Then they thought better of it and recommended the game anyway.			"

												A gem in my opinion! This is one of those games that I actually tell myself I’m so glad that I played. The concept of this game is great to me.You play as Stanley. A man who works in a mundane job pushing buttons all day. Orders come through to his screen to push buttons and he does as told. One day, Stanley realises no orders are coming through, and that no one else is in the office. He gets up to see what’s going on.That’s where we come in! You navigate Stanley around a very seemingly linear office, and quickly discover that you have a narrator dictating everything that you do, before you do it. Of course, leaving you room to either play out what he says, or go against it. You come to various paths and crossroads and are given the choice to either do what you’re told or not.What I love about this game is how it plays on pure human curiosity. If you go one way, you usually wonder… but what would happen if I went the other way? There is many endings to the game, and as the narrator goes on with his story, you wonder what is true. If anything you’re being told is true, what the real story to the game is or if there even is one. It gets you thinking, and I love a game that’ll make me think!I enjoyed this game very much. I have an odd “fear”, kind of, of missing or losing things. So being given a game with many paths, endings and different things to find, admittedly I did OCD over it a bit and actually went as far as drawing myself a map (Don’t judge me). But it was a lot of fun! I had a great time playing this game and think it is something anyone could enjoy. The graphics are nice. I wasn’t aware before, but this game actually started as a Half-Life 2 mod. As a standalone game I think it did really well for itself.The characters are amazing. I love both Stanley, the narrator and the odd “relationship” they have with each other (Even though Stanley never speaks). The voice casting for the narrator is on point, I honestly couldn’t imagine the character any other way. He’s well-spoken and has a great charm about him. The narrator in ways kind of “trolls” you a bit with how he tries to keep you on track or how he reacts when you go against him. But he’s a great character and that is important for a game so dependent on that character being entertaining. The humour in this game was something I did enjoy quite a bit. The way things are done and played out I was quite impressed with. In terms of achievements, a few can be a little tedious, but in ways you ain’t even mad. As said before the game can “troll” you at times and it does so even more through the achievements. I would say that it’s still easy to 100%, but there is a few that you kind of need to “cheat” to achievement. For example, an achievement titled “Go outside”, your task being to “not play The Stanley Parable for 5 years”. Which, come on!All in all, I love this game and really think you should give it a try. If you like a good bit of humour and like your curiosity being tempted I think this game is a good one for that.TL ; DR : A great and unique game that tests your curiosity and gets you thinking. It has many endings to offer and generally is fun, definitely try it! "

												The Stanley Parable is fantastic! It's design is on a genius level and it's a classic as far as I’m concerned. It's very funny and a bit sad too, with social commentary, science fiction and even horror elements.It starts in a seemingly mundane office environment but then you find that this place is filled with surreal and shocking secrets. This gives the game world a feeling of mystery and depth that I really enjoyed.The game also includes one of the funniest acheivements I’ve ever seen. Which again starts of as a boring task but leads to something far more interesting. It ran flawlessly for me at 60FPS on my GTX 980 and it looks beautiful with it’s own unique art style.I would highly recommend The Stanley Parable as one of the best games I’ve ever played.			"

												I've been playing games for many a year now and many of these games have had lines in them. Many games have had truly great lines in them. Who could forget that one to the left of the web on Tempest? The one that stretches out from the explosion in Minestorm? Ah, the beautiful lines that you crash your bike into in a game of Light Cycles. They were good lines. And as time went past, games got more lines. Then one day we decided that lines weren't enough and we had some triangles and we put the triangles together and we made videogames with triangles instead of dots and instead of lines and oh, what did we lose? But it was OK because then lines came back into fashion around 2006 and they sort of glowed too. Glowy lines! We made games with glowy lines and the lines in those games were great too. I didn't like the green ones so much in Geometry Wars but they were trying y'know?Years and years of great lines and yet, it took until 2013 for us to get THE BEST LINE. Ladies and everyone else out there, The Adventure Line is the best line in all of videogames. Let us take a moment to let that sink in. The. Adventure. Line.The Adventure Line is the best line. Sing it from the rooftops because this is -the- Oscar worthy line performances, the BAFTA of road markings, the Laurence Olivier award of yellow. Thank you, Adventure Line. You're amazing. Just great.			"

												There once was a man named Stanley,Who people considered so manly.But the truth must be told,He was not very old,And was quite particularly gangly.What Stanley liked most was buttons.He pushed them like some kind of glutton.He did it all dayIn a meaningful way,But his brain had long ceased to function.Which is why he is in this parable,And lives an existence quite terrible.And if you are not strong,And keep playing along,You too will become quite unbearable (x2).

Posted: June 22, 2014
												I was very reluctant to give this game a negative review because I have mixed feelings about it, but ultimately, I would not recommend it to anybody else, especially not for it's full asking price. After playing it through a few times, I believe that the game just simply isn't worth the money, perhaps on a very generous sale, but even £4.99 for that matter is a bit of a stretch. While I really admire the concept behind The Stanley Parable, which is what drove me to purchace the game in the first place, I personally found it to be dull and disappointing. The Stanley Parable has lots of positive (yet, unhelpful) reviews, which ultimately leads anybody to believe that it's a fun game, that is the main purpose of a game, right? Unfortunately for me, the game just didn't live up to the expectations set, so I am relieved that I didn't end up paying full price for it (£9.99 in my case), if I had, I'd certainly have felt cheated, let me elaborate.The game itself is appealing because it is genuinely interesting and refreshingly different, the trailer and the highest rated user reviews don't really give much information away because it genuinely would ruin the experience, but all in all, this is not a game, it is a lecture.The Stanley Parable attempts to convey a message about game design and the illusion of choice, and while this message is conveyed well through the narration (great voice acting) it is in no way a fun experience. Sure, some of the dialog can be amusing, but that for me is the only positive factor. There is no real gameplay and there are no real objectives, The Stanley Parable offers nothing more than a few hours of exploration around repetitive and dull scenery, waiting for the next line of dialog to pop up more often than not. I can't speak for everybody, but having to sit and listen for instructions on what to do next is not my idea of a fun experience, and even though the project is very well made and has a good concept behind it, I believe that you would have had the exact same experience just watching a play through of it.Fans of the game tend to use the argument that if you don't enjoy The Stanley Parable, it's because you don't understand it, which I'm afraid is simply untrue. I understood the messages conveyed and I think the idea and crafting behind the game is clever and very unique, but all in all, I regret spending money on a game that turned out to be an unsatisfying lecture. The reason I buy games is to have a fun experience, and unfortunately I didn't achieve that at all playing this one. I firmly stand by my suggestion to avoid paying the full asking price for The Stanley Parable, but again, it's all down to choice. If you do feel compelled to buy it regardless of any negative reviews in favour of the (mostly) vague positive reviews, don't expect any actual fun gameplay, because I honestly believe there isn't any to be found here.Please note that this review is purely my own thoughts and opinions, so I know there will be people that agree with me and certainly others that do not. If you are one of the people who purchased this game and felt that you had spent your money well, then excellent, I'm glad that you enjoyed the experience more than I did.			"

												I was recently talking with a friend about how we hate games that call themselves ""games"" but are really just stories with no true interaction. ""Games"" where the designer just wanted to tell a story and occasionally has the player click something to move the story along but the player's actions never actually mean anything. The Stanley Parable is very much NOT that sort of game. It has some legitimately profound things to say about narration and choice in games and storytelling, but it never comes off as pretentious. But I can't really say much else, because I don't want to spoil it. I normally hate vague reviews that tell you ""just play it, I don't want to spoil it!"" but... it's true. Trust me. Or don't trust me, since I'm an idiot that unironically enjoys Goat Simulator. Whatever.			"

This game is a 7 button presses out of 10This review is a reupload from Gao Li Occasionally Reviews[gaolioccasionallyreviews.wordpress.com]The Stanley Parable is the story of a man named Stanley, who one day realizes that the office he works in is suddenly completely empty. He then gets up, tries to search for his colleagues only to stand in front of two doors where he then has to make a choice.Choice – That’s the core of the game.Writing about The Stanley Parable without giving away what makes it special is a truly difficult task, especially because it is really dull on its surface. To start off, the adventure requires audiences to be familiar with both (first-person) video game mechanics of the early 2000s, as well as commonly used gaming narrative of the same period to be appreciated and understood. One’s interactions with the world are then purposely limited: Jumping has been deactivated and as a rule clicking on objects doesn’t do anything. Instead, the player appears to seemingly be forced to only walk around. The sole focus lying between what the game’s narrator says Stanley will do and whether or not the player follows these commands.

This sounds very boring, especially considering that the first playthrough took me around 15 minutes and then the story restarted from the beginning – and overall it takes around ≥ 2 hours to unearth all endings (, except for the one where players need to repeat a mundane task for four hours). It truly would be a dull affair, if it weren’t for the very strong, comedic writing presented by the narrator’s humorous tone and the leitmotif of choice.With that in mind, I was going over multiple revisions on how to approach this review. After all, The Stanley Parable’s basically only mechanic is presenting players with one binary choice after another and humor is dependant on timing and context. Despite being convinced that a funny review would be the best choice, I find myself tied to earnestly discuss whether or not this game is worth your time and money. And the answer is somewhere between a “yes” and a “no”.

ConclusionThe main issue of this entry is replayability. As it is a very short game, being able to relive the experience in subsequent playthroughs is vital to justify a purchase. True, there are multiple endings and each one of them is memorable, but once an outcome has been discovered, the question stands if there’s a point in doing it all over again - especially with the lack of gameplay mechanics. If there were such a thing as video game rentals, this would definitely be a very good rental over the weekend, but with a base price of $14.99 USD or your local equivalent, it is debatable whether or not a purchase can be justified.

												Combining existentialism and humour, confusion and wit, surrealism and stark confrontations with an isolated reality, The Stanley Parable serves as one of the most self-aware video games in recent memory. It is definitely a contender for one of the most intertextual video games ever made in its self-referentiality and in the developers' awareness of all the standard tropes that become subverted or distorted. The Stanley Parable is basically played one of two ways: straight through following the proper story or deviating from the normal path, and there are very specific points where you are given a clear choice between the two. However, once you branch from the correct path, you'll find that even if you try to go back to it, it becomes impossible. This game touches briefly on some notions such as narrative and individual autonomy, but unfortunately never does anything more than make you contemplate them briefly. The way it comes together seems to differ each time as it has a number of different endings, and beginning again will offer you yet more choices. However, as self-aware a game though it is, it is rather short as its intertextual premise simply can't sustain itself for very long. The player reaches an ending of one form or another, and then restarts to explore another path, seemingly arbitrarily.On to the technical aspects. The voice acting for this game is superb, and although there's a lot to listen to, it never comes across as boring. The developers could not have cast better voice actors for this game, and it's clear that in the hands of lesser talents, this game would be nothing.  They make this game. Visually, it's the Source engine, so it predictably looks good, but nothing fantastic. The overall polish is very good and it ends up finding a nice middleground that looks modern but not too sleek. I didn't have any problems running it. There really aren't too many complaints on the technical side of things.Now, I do have some criticisms for the game. Although it is very good and the concept, design, and voice work are top-notch, there are still a couple of things that I would say are problems. For instance, I don't think there's more than two hours worth of content here. You can beat the main story in less than five minutes (in fact, for one of the achievements, you're encouraged to), and there's only so long you can run around. On top of that, this is still a Source mod, and although it has a large file size, it reuses a lot of assets from other Source games. Lastly, for the few third person scenes that there are, they look quite bad. There's nothing that just screams lazy like a static image with a slow camera pan out. A lot of the reviews I've read highly praise the game, but I don't think it's really THAT worthy a game for all the praise it's received. The developers deftly subvert the average player's expectations and have created a uniquely cerebral game with some creative design choices, but it doesn't hold a lot of replay value or weight. It incorporates humor and is funny in places, but it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot there. Although there are a ton of different legitimate paths you can take, there isn't any actual puzzle-solving or anything that will make you think. It's well-made but it really does feel like a Source mod and it ultimately just ends up being a short game.It also drops pretty much all tropes from FPP (first-person perspective) video games, in that there's no combat or intricate maneuvering to be had. I applaud this since it distinctly breaks the mold from most FPP games, but it doesn't fill the hole with much else than wandering around barren corridors. Most games either focus on combat, puzzle-solving, platforming, immersing the player in a compelling and interesting world, or if nothing else, appreciating the scenic view, if not a mix of all five. Removing combat, puzzles, platforming (you can't jump at all and never need to crouch), starting the player with a nonsensical premise and boring environment, and keeping interactivity surprisingly low, The Stanley Parable in fact doesn't have any of the above. Rather, the game opts for what are in actual fact simply minor decisions (such as taking a right path instead of a left path), but constantly reminding the player that this decision is incredibly important. Whether or not this subversion of authority and declaration of autonomy is really as significant as all that is up to the player's interpretation, but it leads to my next point.****MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD****Mild spoiler warning from here until further indicated. It ultimately turns out that actually the entire point of the game is the player's decision to either follow or disregard the game's storyline. By expressing his own volition, he can choose whether or not to either submit to or betray the narrative. That's it. Now, I'm fine with that, but it doesn't really go anywhere with this. Furthermore, as a game, it doesn't do much, if anything, with its medium. For instance, The Stanley Parable could be rendered in first-person perspective in the Source engine, or it could just as easily be rendered in the medium of an eight-bit pixelated platformer. Or it could even be text-based. The reason is because it's the concept behind the game that is on display here, not the stuff of the game itself (i.e., the engine). The Stanley Parable depicts its environments accurately but likewise, there is little reason for it to take place in the environment it does. It looks like an office, and it feels like an office, but it could just as well take place pretty much anywhere else. The game opens up conveniently after everyone has suddenly disappeared, and although while playing the game the player doesn't really question this much, afterwards it made my brain itch, and I just got the sense that this was done so the developers didn't have to animate models, write scripted dialogue, or find more voice actors. Basically all this is to say that the same concept could be done any number of ways, so much so that the storyline that the game (read: Narrator) is trying to tell is rendered completely meaningless. Lastly, the decisions that you do make are possibly only there for comedic value. Nothing really has any reason to be there, which may be the developer's own ironic take on narrative structure. As it stands, there is at least one point where it becomes literally impossible to save yourself from a bad ending in what feels like should be an ultimate confrontation, which is a major disappointment. One can argue that that was the point, to subvert your expectations and force a ""Game Over"" during what feels like what should be a boss battle or confrontation, but instead it feels more like an unsatisfying psychological experiment that gives a major case of blue balls. It's as though the developers don't realize that these tropes exist and get perpetuated because they're actually emotionally satisfying to actual living people, the kinds of people who bought this game.****END OF SPOILERS****This is a game that is fun to play through at the time but can get frustrating when thinking about it afterwards. That being said, I think you should use your discretion when considering buying this game. I certainly don't think it's worth the $15 pricetag at all. As it's also very heavy, even ham-fisted, in its trope subversion, if that's not your cup of tea already, this isn't going to win any converts. My opinion is, if you're interested in a short, light-hearted, trope-subverting Source mod, get it when it comes on sale. However, this seems like one of those cases where the public is so infatuated with a game that so overtly indulges itself with tropes that it feels like it's one step away from being meme-defining. I'll take a cue from The Stanley Parable and say that it's really your choice whether or not you think such a game will be worth your money.			"

												Any individual with even the slightest or most remote interest in video gaming as a medium of artistic expression must categorically play The Stanley Parable within their lifetime. It's, ostensibly, a re-release of the 2011 Half-Life 2 mod of the same name, and is still built on the Source engine and is, more or less, largely the same game but having been thoroughly redesigned in certain key ways, especially its themes and parts of its narrative structure.The Stanley Parable (developed by a small indie studio named Galactic Cafe) is, essentially, as its demo states, ""a game of endings"". It's a game that poses some very important questions about the way games currently work - it's a parable (a story which illustrates a lesson), or rather a collection of parables each hidden within another. Each new playthrough represents a new part of the experience, revealing yet another of the game's many endings, each with a different existential or absurdist lesson that build into the game's broader thesis. It's also a game of choice, in that it proposes that ludic notions of ""choice"" and ""free will"" are inherently absurd in all games, since they don't actually represent any kind of meaningful or significant choice: they're just slightly different parts of the same overall plan that the game designer has laid out before you, and thus subordinate to his own intentions and choices; and therefore, inconsequential. You're still only just walking that path - in fact, all you ever do in the Stanley Parable is walk; literally. And when you do press the use button (which is for ludic purposes the mouse button, but in the original mod, was the 'E' button), you hear the unmistakable sound of a key being pressed. And as the intro and several endings exemplify, that is the nature of Stanley's job and ultimately, the nature of his existence and of our experience within the game: pressing buttons, both in-game and out of game.It also has a lot to say about endings, and the way choices feed into those endings. By presenting us with a closed environment with very minimal and sparse mechanics, The Stanley Parable is able to present us with an environment so sparse and so limited that the ""choices"" we are offered seem that much more significant and that much more abundant; and the same goes for its endings. But as much as the choices themselves mean nothing, they also lead the player into the aforementioned endings. No ending has finality, and no ending presents a perfect victory for Stanley or the player. In fact, in almost all the endings the respective thematic conflict between Stanley and the Narrator remains entirely open, but no ending feeds into another in any capacity, underlining the lack of meaning the notion of multiple endings in games can offer. Games teach the player that anything but a perfect win-state is a failure, and that further playthroughs can objectively improve the conclusion of the story, be it through moral superiority or mechanical perfection. The Stanley Parable, in comparison, gives us subjective endings which can be interpreted freely which all invariably lead into a restart of the game. As the game itself states: ""the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never LOADING"".In the process, certain themes and concepts will be left underdeveloped; but isn't this the point of the game? Asking questions that only subsequent explorations of the game by way of critical commentary or subsequent works in the same vein (perhaps by Galactic Cafe, or other designers) will be able to answer? Leaving its own ideas open to interpretation and exploration? I certainly think so. And so, it's definitely worth experiencing for yourself. Set your prejudices regarding ""walking simulators"" or ""ungames"" aside and walk into The Stanley Parable without any expectations but those the game designer creates for himself and for his own vision.

												Whether or not you feel you have gained anything from the Stanley Parable will depend on how much you value a minor metaphorical critique on ‘gaming choices’ and if so, whether or not that is worth it in direct relation to the amount you spent. In a nutshell, this ‘game’ is essentially an attempt by you, Stanley, to discover what has happened to your co-workers and bosses, all of whom have completely disappeared. That’s the game in its entirety on a superficial level without giving away any spoilers. The underlying message is regarding the choice, or the illusion of choice, that modern video games allude to offer. The developers seem to be responding to games such as Mass Effect, that suggest they offer the gamer real choice in the outcome of the narrative yet in reality the gamer only has a couple of options dressed up in different clothing. There is a clear critique here regarding the nature of ‘choice’ in the video game industry and while it is welcomed change for video games to include a metaphorical message (beyond the simplistic), these messages and critiques should not exist in a vacuum, devoid of any gameplay. The point being that, there is a thought provoking message here, but this is not a game.  Stripped down, the Stanley Parable is a game of ‘walk and listen’. Yes there are some interesting points mentioned by the narrator relating to conscious decision making, but this same message could have been offered through or alongside gameplay features that stretched beyond walking around a corridor. Quite simply, this is a lecture, a chore of a lecture that unfortunately lasts for 2-3 hours before you realise you could have just read the same underlying message in a free online article in about 10 minutes without being subjected to this gaming con artistry. Clearly there is a sense that the Stanley Parable is offering some ‘high art’ by not including actual gameplay, or that this ‘genius indie title’ will have your head scratching. There is a suggestion that if you ‘don’t get’ intelligent games that you won’t appreciate the Stanley Parable, that you can’t grasp its deeper message. Well, that is quite frankly a gross lie and yet a master stroke in marketing. People are desperately scrabbling to offer rave reviews of this new form of game, eager to show they are not cut from the COD cloth of gaming, that they can enjoy this intellectual critique. Do not be fooled. This is a totally unsatisfactory experience especially considering the price charged. Do you want a thought provoking experience about the intricacies of the mind and the illusion of choice? Read a book. This is just pseudo-philosophical gaming at its very worst, conning the masses into feeling like an intellectual giant for a couple hours at the small price of being tricked by the illusion of gameplay. Who’s more of a sucker in this scenario, Stanley? Or us? 'The game will end, the game will never end'. Sold to us as an interesting game of uncertainty. Well, there is at least one certainty about the Stanley Parable; you will never see the cash you spent again.As always comments are welcomed and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.

												This “game” is brilliant. It plays with the illusion of a choice. You think you’re making a choice by going against what the narrator says, but there’s no choice. It’s a false freedom. Absolutely mindblowing. The achievements also play with your mind a little, and there's one for not playing the game for the duration of 5 years.			"

												It's good for what it's trying to do. To be honest, though, I sometimes think I should've spent my money on something else. Since there isn't an option to classify you're review as mixed, since there were parts I liked about the game, I'm just labeling it as negative (not because I completely hated it). The Narrator is a really funny character and I laughed at a lot of his reactions. However, that's all I really found enjoyable. It's not that I didn't like everything else, it's just there didn't seem to be much else to do. You get different endings depending on your choices, but after playing it over and over for a while I already got most of the obvious (as in ""easy to obtain"") endings and was just running in to them again and again multiple times. I know there's more complex things you can do to get different endings, which I don't mind, but it made me think I could've just easily looked them up on YouTube instead of spending $15. I was playing a game with no real challenge to prevent me from getting to those endings.I understand that it's supposed to be more an experience then just a game, but I personally didn't find it that philosophical with it's message and would've been better off getting an actual game on Steam. I'd have probably enjoyed this more if it was either for free or at a lower price. I don't think it's worth $15, you'd be better off spending that money on Shovel Knight.			"

												EVEN IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS GAME, PLAY THE DEMO! The demo is entirely original  content, and is easily as good as the main game.About the game:With only about 3 hours worth of content and minimal replay value, it's hard to justify the purchase price. Pick it up if it goes on sale, though...Since the store page isn't very helpful, here's what the game is about. It's an exploration game in the same vein as Dear Esther or 30 Flights of Loving. You wander around looking at things and the environment is only minimally interactive. An extremely clever and witty narrator tells your story as you wander through the environment. Gameplay uses FPS controls and there are few cutscenes to interrupt the immersion, but you will often find yourself trapped in a small area waiting for something. This is less annoying in The Stanley Parable than it is in other games since listening to the narration is basically the whole point of the game.The plot moves along a lot like a choose-your-own-adventure. You'll be repeatedly sent back to the beginning of the game and need to repeat one of a few choices that select which ending you get. There aren't a lot of choices to make and only about 10 endings, but there are some random elements to the game and some of the endings have an effect on your next restart, so there is enough variety to keep the beginning of the game interesting even though you'll see it many times.The plot is extremely witty, clever, and well narrated. The dialogue is easily as good as Portal II, even if the gameplay is rather bland. I liked it and I'm glad I played it, even though I feel I overpaid for it at $12.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

Whoa...It requires no skill.You only use basic wasd movement.Graphics are decent at best.It is not long.So what makes The Stanley Parable such a great game?The Stanley Parable's one and only selling point is it's story. But man, it is one hell of a story (or rather, stories). You basically begin the game in the same setting every time. However, there are points in the game where you are forced to make a decision. These choices will ultimately lead you down different paths with vastly unique stories. It felt like there was deeper meaning behind each storyline, that there was a different lesson being taught as a consequence of your actions. Maybe I read too much into it, but it sure as hell impressed me. The Stanley Parable will blow your mind. Oh, and the narrator is incredible.			"

												Stanley Parable I think its a game about wasted youth. The short story is greatly represented by a narrator that follows every move you make. Now if you think that's cool try Bastion too :PThe path you thoroughly follow it matters towards the end of the story; multiple endings, hilarious dialogues and tons of secrets. It might be a short story but It's a solid one, well made and worth every second. If I could rate it I would give a 11 out of 10 seriously. ------Now there is an achievement called [Go Outside] ""Don't play The Stanley Parable for five years."" which I ♥♥♥♥ed up... set my clock to 2021 and wrongly earned it without thinking decently.After 10 seconds .. I felt reallly bad. It was a mistake. I know that might sounds stupid but developers maybe had it for a reason. Luckily there is a command I found on steam discussions* that resets all 10-achievements to 0 and you must earn 'em again; a small price to pay.Moral: Don't rush things, just let 'em slide... *tsp_resetzaxis (~console)			"

												The Stanley Parable is a unique ""Choose Your Own Adventure""-style walking simulator, with a heavy focus on humor relating to the role of narration and the player/viewer/reader in an interactive story.Overall I would say the game is a very enjoyable, albeit somewhat short, experience. I'd be hard-pressed to find a joke or gag that fell flat.			"

												This is a review about a man named Stanley. Stanley is a man that loves to play good video games. He enjoys playing just about everything, from shooting lots of things, to solving puzzles, to driving fast cars. Years ago he stumbled upon a Half Life 2 mod called ""The Stanley Parable"" which he looked at the screenshots with much attention. The page did not give much info out on what the game really was. Confused on how everyone that played it, said he should play it immediately! Thinking nothing of it, Stanley continued on and did not play the mod.Few years later, Stanley logs onto Steam and heads to the front page of the Store. The first thing he sees is a giant banner that says ""The Stanley Parable Now Available!"" Stanley was confused on how such a thing was on Steam, which it was only a Mod. So Stanley checked out the store page. He first checked out the videos and screenshots. He was still confused on what the game actually was. He noticed that there was a demo available, so Stanley downloaded the demo, to give the game a shot. After all, he was tired of playing games with the younger kids screaming into their mics saying that they ""Did his mom last night"" and other inappropriate  comments.An hour later, Stanley finished the demo. He was so confused on what he had experienced, and oddly very happy about it as well. Without hesitation, Stanley purchased the game and started playing ""The Stanley Parable.""The game made Stanley question so many things in his life.What is this game?Do I really have a choice?How does this game know?Who is this Narrator?Why is his voice so amazing?Why is this game so funny?Why have I spent over 20 hours playing it?What is Life?What is Love?Why are you still reading this?Stanley could not really answer this, for he could not think of the right words to say. The experiences he had while playing this game was nothing he had experienced before. Knowing why everyone else kept telling him to play it, he now understands. Trying to tell other people to play it? Well... That is where YOUR choice begins...Pros:- If you played the game already, you probably read the entire review in the Narrator's voice.- Extremely cleverly made. (Unlike this review.)- Hilarious most of the time.- By far the best Walking Simulator ever created (and I hate most games like that.)- Kevan Brighting's voice is godly.- Multiple ""Endings""- Adventure Line.- 8888888888888888888888888888888- You push buttons.- The choice is a lie.- The Broom Closet.Cons:- Might be a bit pricey for some people.- It IS a walking simulator, some people may not like those games at all.- Not so simple achievements (to do legit.)- There is 1 ending that requires 4 hours to get.- You can experience most of the game in 6 hours, unless you really look around and pay attention to the little details.Seriously though, give the Demo a try. The Demo is it's own experiance that does not spoil ANYTHING about the main game. If you enjoyed that then buy the game.Stanley enjoyed this review so much, he gave it a thumbs up!			"

 The Stanley Parable 	Currently trying to get the achievement 'Don't Play The Stanley Parables for Five Years'. It's tough though because I really want to play it again but I don't want to ruin my progress so far I am one year in. Pros: + Good Amount Of Endings+ Narration is Quite Humorous+ Pretty Fair Price+ Makes you feel different emotions Cons: - There aren't any huge cons that I can think of, maybe just some small things but nothing worth saying. Review Have you ever wanted a personal narrator? Well in The Stanley Parable you can have just that. The Stanley Parable is a humorous walking simulator game that tells the life of Stanley. This game is great because of the wonderful Narration. As you explore the halls and offices you are being narrated by some sassy person. It has been out for a long time and is already highly praised. I am just writing this review so you might finally buy this wonderful game. It's at a pretty fair price, but if you can wait for it to go on sale. If you haven't played The Stanley Parable yet, you are missing out. It's a very enjoyable game and a great experience. Also the demo is like a little game itself, so if you haven't played the demo I suggest playing that as well. Hope they make another one like this soon!This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

												After playing this game I don't know what the point of life is, however ..The first time I played this game it made my day, laughed my♥♥♥♥♥of. Especially cuz of the amazing narrator. You can beat the game in less than 5 minutes or even speed run it. The key of the game is about making choices, and believe it or not, the narrator give comments on your choices, which will make you smile. Either way, it can go really deep too ... I played minecraft and portal in the game for some minutes, pushed a button million times to save a baby from fire but afterward failed anyway, I got litteraly mind-blown and I turned the game a few times off.If you're not sure whether or not to buy this game, there's a demo available for you to try it. Traight forward.			"

												If you like snarky narrators and adequate planning for players deviating from the main path, give this one a go. The game's limited in its replayability, and by now, there are enough LPs to have seen everything. If possible, go in blind, but it's otherwise a fun game to try out. It being a sale at the time of writing, you should pick this up regardless.Note: if, like me, you played the original mod back in the day, you'll get an even bigger kick from the game, but I would not recommend you going back to play that now. Find a video for a little extra as you explore.			"

												This is a story about a man named Stanley. Stanley uses Steam client to buy games to play. The games he played does not contain a game named The Stanley Parable. Stanley had seen the 'Very Positive' user ratings and promotional videos. He then scrolls down to the bottom where he can read user reviews. All the user reviews does not contain anything related to the game. Stanley feels strangely curious about the game. He read and read the review but he just couldn't understand what the game is about. He then decided to buy this game. After all, spending few dollars would not cost him a leg. .........But after he read this review, he decided not to buy it now. After all, there are more interesting games out there. Look at those wishlish Stanley had kept since back before. Oh c'mon! Look at those positive reviews! Does all the positive reviews could not convince Stanley to buy?Would a review containing score convince Stanley to buy this game? 10/10 best game ever?Does Stanley even need to read this review to buy this game?

												Fantastic game, one that I found intriguing, funny, creepy, enlighting and hauting at the same time. Stanley's Parable is a game-shaped narrative experiment about game design tropes among other things. I don't want to say more but trust me, like or not, this is something you should play, even if it just for a little bit. Also, In an age with some many great indie game feature strong quirky narration, Stanley's narrator still stands out in the crowd. I could write a lot about Stanley Parable, but I don't have to because it has probably the best demo I've ever seen for a game, a demo that showcases the spirit and mechanics of the game but it's completely unique. Download it, and if you find it intriguing enough, then by all means, buy and play the real game.			"

												After playing the brilliant, but very short, original Half Life 2 mod, I was very eager to play this when it was announced that they were making a full game.  With funny, clever and witty humor from the narrator, who is simply brilliant, this game was highly enjoyable from the start to its err....ending(s). My only disappointment really was that it's a bit on the short side.  So overall, I strongly recommend this game to anybody. :-)			"

A Paladin's Steam Review: The Stanley Parable. That Game You've Heard Of.Genre: 1st Person Self Exploration. Developed & Published by: Galactic Cafe Platform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsIs Stanley Parable a game? Are you a real person? Ok, you've probably gotten sick of hearing this joke when it comes to reviews about the Stanley Parable, so I'll knock it off. But cmon, I had to have a little fun. Yea, that joke was old even when I originally posted this review. So, time to put a bit of strikethrough it and put some actual effort into talking about the game itself. You play as Stanley, an office worker that wants something more out of life. Or maybe he doesn't. The game mechanics are simple: you walk through doors, hallways and rooms while listening to an excellent British accent describing what you are or aren't doing. Or going on a rambling about some unrelated happening. Or maybe its incredibly related and you don't realize it. Sometimes you'll push buttons, open doors or fall to your death. But really, those actions that you perform aren't what matter most. It's what you take away from the experience that matters. You'll be replaying the levels over and over again as different actions can cause different little ""stories"" to play themselves out. It's a pretty passive experience though as you can't really do anything other than choose minor actions at certain times. This could have easily been a game stuck up on itself but it's clear that the developers want us to consider what it is to live this life and to play videogames. How we interact and deal with videogames on a regular basis. There's quite a bit more under the surface than even I gave it credit for after I finished playing it and watched some other people talk about it.PC SettingsThe game comes with more PC settings than you could possibly ever want or need for a game like TSP. Resolutions, FoV slider, AA/Shader/Effect/Texture detail controls and much more. Everything is here, even support for high framerates. The game is very stable from all that I can tell and have heard. There is nothing missing that I can think you would need. Final ThoughtsThis is a title where I don't think it matters what I think. I think it's a title you need to explore for yourself and take away from it what you will. It is essentially a walking simulator, I won't deny that. And the player interactivity is minimal at best. But, I think its worth checking out. Take the time to appreciate what's being said and shown to you.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												[ ★★★☆☆ ]Wow, The Stanley Parable was a very interesting play. You can either follow the Linear storyline and do as the Narrator says or explore the game in your own way, ""defying the Narrator"" which I found very funny.The Narrator is very funny to listen to, even when you come across a broom closet. A fair amount of fun dialogue there :-)The only problem is once you have seen a lot of the ""endings"" the game to me doesn't feel replayable at least for a while afterwards.			"

AUDIONarratedVISUALSimpleDIFFICULTYN/AVIBECuriousCRAVINGMental Chewing GumON SALEInfrequentPROS: The exploration in Stanley Parable needs no introduction or enticement. Narration is excellent, both humorous and thought-provoking. Stanley Parable creates boundaries for the sole purpose of breaking them.CONS: Those staunchly against walking simulators should check further into the games content before purchase. The game had a few unexpected, personally-upsetting moments. A few of the achievements are very gimmicky and hard to obtain.WORTH: It's probably the best of its kind, but that can hold little value to a person disinterested in this sort of philosophical walking sim style game. This game's worth is definitely dependent on what you like, but it doesn't hurt to know that it sees an occasional sale every other month.OVERALL: You know when you're willingly spending a couple hours exploring an empty office, the creators have managed to do something pretty awesome.SCORE:9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												There are video games, and then there is ""The Stanley Parable."" Forget about normal video game rules and discover that the end is never the end.The Stanley Parable is an indie first-person explorer game by Galactic Cafe. Stanley is an office worker with a very mind-numbingly boring job.In the Stanley Parable, you play Stanley. Everyone in the office has suddenly vanished, including the boss. It’s your job to make your way through the office and… well, the actual goal of the game isn’t quite clear.You can “beat the game” in about five minutes by finding your way outside, or you can explore a seemingly endless set of scenarios that turn an otherwise static office environment into a maze with constantly shifting directions.You are joined on your adventure by a narrator that tries very hard to tell you what to do. You can choose to ignore him and take a different route, but you may regret that decision. Then again, you might not.There is a demo available for the game, which plays out more as a clever introduction to the themes and atmosphere of ""The Stanley Parable."" The witty narrator is present, as he guides you through a number of rooms containing objects found (and not found) in the full-length game. The demo comes as highly recommended as the actual game. I think ""The Stanley Parable"" is the most incredible video game experiences ever created in the past few years and a ""MUST HAVE""The end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end.Play it - Love it!░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█████████░░███████░░░░░░░░░░███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒███░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░░░░░███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒███░░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░░░██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░░░░█▒▒▒▒▒█░░░██▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒███░░░░░█▒▒▒█░░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒▒▒██░░░█████████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒███████████▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██▒▒▒▒▒███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░█▒▒▒███████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒██░██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█░░████████████░░░█████████████████			"

												So this is going to be another spoiler-free super-secretive ultra-vague review of The Stanley Parable.Is the game worth getting? Yes.Is it as mysterious and thought provoking as it is supposed to be? Yes, not in a bad way either.I do have to say visually the game was more impressive than I expected, it uses Source pretty well.The narration is beautiful, but of course that's obvious.The game works. It really does. It's a pretty far-reaching concept and yet it's a success.Hell, it even manages to use the loading screen as a plot device.Bottom line, if you love games, you'll most likely love The Stanley Parable. Is it worth the pretty high asking price? Absolutely.			"

												What do I think of pretentious indie art games? Honestly I can't stand them. They usually sacrifice graphics, gameplay, playtime, and other important things just so they can make ""art"". It drives me nuts when I see some stupid indie game with potato graphics get praised by everyone, break sales records, and generally make hipster gamers go on and on about ""games as art"" as if more standard games aren't art.Stanley Parable does everything wrong (considering my above statement) but in the end it's all just right. Despite the fact that it's short, the gameplay is extremely limited, it can be a bit pretentious at times, and the graphics are just middle of the road Source engine, it's one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure to engage in.Funny, sad, shocking, irreverent, serious, and ridiculous at different times, this game has an emotional and artistic depth that you just won't find in most other games. Down one passageway is an inspiring emotional moment, around the corner a silly laugh, across a chasm the 5th wall breaks entirely, and down a cleverly hidden walkway is an examination of art and life of a depth that you probably never thought you would ever find in a video game.But the real star of the game, the part that kept me enraptured for every solitary minute is the Narrator. Equal parts comrade and torturer, he accompanies you through the entire game commenting on your every move, applauding every ""correct"" decision and chiding every ""wrong"" choice. His performance sweeping back and forth from inspiring highs to admonishing lows. He is the reason you keep playing, keep searching, keep digging to find more of the game. His happiness is yours, and equal parts his sadness.Honestly I cannot say enough good things about this game, but to praise it any more would require spoiling the manifold layers of the game, and the numerous surprises and hidden secrets this game holds. All I can say is, if you are ready for something different, unique, and emotionally resonant then this is the game for you.			"

The demo is a perfect example of the game before you buy, and being it's own separate path with the same special charm should be played by those who own the full game already. The same goes for people who played the mod, because this full release will still manage to blow your mind.

												After Stanley realizes that the usual day in his office is quiet...quiet, he stands up from his desk and choose to search for his co-workers....or not. Since here begins the branching story of ""The Stanley Parable"".TSP is more or less an interactive adventure, a simpler version of the 80's game ""Alter Ego"" if you will. This goes along pretty well especially due the witty nature of the Narrator, which guides you through the game and choices. It's overall cleverly written and dances between the “It's oh so random” and “2deep4you” themes so well, that you willingly fill the gaps and contradictions with your own meaning. This is one of the main reasons I believe that gamers and critics love it so much.What I liked:+: Cleverly written.+: The Narrator (I'm a sucker for british english anyway).+: Fitting ambient sounds and music.+: Includes some not very obvious (or I wouldnt had thought of that) routes which leads to other ""endings"".What I didn't like:-: It's short.-: The pricing imho is way to high. Yeah, you can argue you had 1000x more fun in this than on a random 50€ game, but most of the content is unfold within the 1-2 hours you play/replay it. 4.99€ would be the perfect price imho.7/10: TSP could really be a Sidequel to Portal, where you explore the offices instead of the test chambers.

												This game is really special. It knows you. It knows what you are going to try to do. It will respond to your actions with precise voice narration. It plays with recursion, game mechanics and, of course, with you. Try doing what the narrator says. Try not doing what the narrator says. Try thinking outside of the box. Try unlocking the achievements.It is really amusing.			"

Pros+ Simple control's. W,S,A,D as in any game. And responisve at the same time.+ Polished around the corner. Well designed room's and interiors .i haven't experienced bug's.+ Fine,fine graphic's for it's genre. Not something astounding as the witcher 3 or crysis as it wasn't mean't to be like that.+ Great sound-track. and over all crisp sound's.+ A brilliant,interesting,mind bobling and really inovative story. With multiple consequences.+ Very well voice acted narration from multiple people.+ A very well designed menu and not seen elseware menu aswell responsive.Cons- A bit long load time's.- Very short roughly about more than 3 hour's if you play through all the endings.- Asking price is a bit to much as there's not much there. A far better price would be to charge $9.99 dollar's.Worth it?Well as you can see it's really small and not something you would get for value from a $14.99 dollar game, but it's really well on what it does it's mostly perfectly just not much content for the asking price as it is.if you have many money to blow then just buy it you will love it but if you have a limited budget i say get it on sale.I'm aware i only have ""1"" hour's of playtime in the game as i have not yet finshed all the ending's. But let me tell you all this playtime was enough for me to judge it as the game is actually (short) i might add.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

”Nothing that is expressed is obscene. What is obscene is what is hidden.” -Nagisa Oshima***Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to my fiancé for proofing this review for me, as well as to wish her an early Happy Anniversary. Thank you for giving me the five most wonderful years of my life.What some consider to be an Indie gem while others plea confusion as to the course of this title, The Stanley Parable is a game about choice and consequence, with moderately brief journeys being the focus of play. The player takes control of Stanley, an office worker whose position entails the pressing of buttons throughout the day; the operation of these simple devices is his sole function, until one bizarre day, all of his coworkers vanish. From here Stanley leaves his office unprompted in search of some answers. I will do my best to refrain from writing this review in the identical joking tone of most writings, though the comedy in this title is infectious.Here are just a few reasons to give this memorably fantastic game a try:Atmosphere - This title progresses through Stanley’s well-crafted office space as the player maneuvers through the expected rooms and hallways that you would foresee composing a business department. I do not wish to spoil much about the broom closet, cargo lift, mind control facility, or other sections of The Stanley Parable’s branching story for the sake of having you experience them for yourself.Gameplay - As stated in the introduction, players assume the role of Stanley from a first person perspective as he explores his abandoned office spaces, through multiple unique rooms and themes in order to discover the ‘finale’ for the tale. The controls are simple, with the W, A, S, and D keys acting as movement commands; the Control key assuming the crouched position; and the LMB allowing the player to interact with various objects within the environment. There are both hidden and pronounced articles within the environment that can be toggled to alter story paths-covered in the coming section.Writing - As unambiguous as this game appears to be, this story-rich satire is far from any other market experience. The Stanley Parable performs as expected, with the players unraveling new beginnings and ends while probing for secluded secrets. Between these points of interest, the brilliant Kevan Brighting voices each interaction-or lack there-of-to entail a sense of accomplishment for the player, in the stead of simply stalling in a daft room until prompted otherwise. This commentary is extremely witty, and displays each critical action Stanley makes. In a sense, this is more of a powerful placebo to gaming: it takes the form of what you expect any game would yet lacks just the right amount of properties, toning it a simulation.TL:DR - As with the quote above, The Stanley Parable is an obscure game which presents the perfect amount of subtly in its processes. There can never be a proper review for The Stanley Parable due to how absurdly miraculous it is, yet every review written about it is the perfect review since it is that of individuality, such as with this title; the only true way to understand this title is to simply play it for yourself. As much as I would love to write on and on about this title, no words can do it justice, as it is difficult to pinpoint every exceptional portion of this work. I highly recommend this title to those who enjoy titles depicting choice and consequence, as well as narratives. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												Way too overpriced for what you get !Look at all the top positive reviews. Very few have a playtime longer than 3-4 hours, because that's really all you can stretch out of it.     One of the achievements requires running the game up to 24 hours in a single setting (although you can trick the game by editing your BIOS)  My own review would only show about 2 hours of actual gameplay. The rest, was idling for the achievement. Almost every review that shows a play time over 24 hours is misleading if you think they actually got that much time and attention out of it. You can literally see and pick apart everything in the game in just a few hours, especially if you are particularly clever.  I have 8 friends who currently own this, i combined all of their total play times. approx. 16 hours combined. Add in the actual 2 hours I was playing, and we're sittin at 18 hours total. Its not a tremendous value. I bought it at a 75 percent off sale, and I still feel they were asking too much.  Its just a source mod with some clever writing. I wished there was more game here, because there's nothing wrong with what you get ! The ""game"" and the experience it provides is great!  but the price, oh lord. that price. Being such a high priced game and having all the positive reviews simultaneously, i expected a lot more.If this was $3.75 or less (what i paid) I would change my review to positive. For 14.99, you could get so much more than what this will offer you.			"

												There isnt really any other game quite like this one. It's an adventure that changes with each playthrough based on the decisions you make. You are Stanley and you start out in your stale office, in your stale job, in your stale life....or do you? Perhaps your life is amazing, sad, depressed, happy...whatever. The choice is yours. The gameplay is seamless. Perfect controls for the game. The graphics are also top notch. It actually looks like the Unity engine a bit, but if it was, the developer maximized what he got out of it. Some of the puzzles can be challenging, and deception factors in to some aspects of this game as well. The narration however is really where this game is at. There are only two other games that I can think of that rivals this one in that regard (Battleblock Theater, Bastion), although their styles couldnt be more different.I have seen something like 18 different endings with this game. Not sure how many there really are, but there are a lot, and so as you can expect, there is a ton of replay value with this game.The developer also had some fun with the achievements. One of them is to play all day (24 hours) on a Tuesday, lol. One is to play, and then play again a year later. Etc....This game is an easy 10/10. It is perfect for what it is trying to be, doesnt force anything, and allows itself to be whatever you want it to be.			"

												Not a very long game as you can see and that's getting nearly every ending (I'm not playing a baby game for 4 hours), but certainly worth it for me on sale as it was a very interesting experience (rather than much of a 'game'). I DO recommend playing it yourself rather than watching a playthrough, because the humor comes from sort of deconstructing expectations of gameplay as has been said and being the one taking actions gives it a lot more meaning to me. I'm extremely eager to show this game to friends which will stretch the value considerably because I would love to see their reactions.If you're looking for something with action, a focus on gameplay, or even a deep story, this game will probably be lost on you. The story IS interesting, but not the same way games like Final Fantasy, Pillars of Eternity, Dues Ex, the Fallout series, etc. are. The story is interesting because it narrates every choice you make, which is why I think it's better than your average ""walking simulator"" as it means that the game acknowleges your actions in a way that I haven't seen done before instead of just having you along for the ride. This leads to a lot of humor and is satisfying to the player. The game literally responds when you try to break it. That's fullfilling.			"

												Like Dear Esther and Thirty Flights of Venerating, The Stanley Representation is an endeavor differing things with canny record, another attempt to discover another kind of depicting excellent to PC diversions. It's engaging, self-referential, shocking, and every once in a while uncomfortable to play, a story related not through one direct story but rather through a broad assortment of fanning ways that curves the dubiousness of control that PC amusements work so difficult to give us. You may know The Stanley Story from its 2011 cycle as a Half-Life 2 mod. I didn't, as it happens, yet this has a basically more mind boggling modification of that idea, no longer made of Half-Life resources and hugely connected by maker Davey Wreden as a gathering with William Pugh. The Stanley Story begins in a standard work region area in a shrewdly dull looking office, cursor sparkling on the screen of a beige screen. You are Stanley, an agreeable salaryman who spends his days respectfully creating summons in a diminish work territory extend. One day, the majority of his partners vanish, surrendering him to investigate the workplace alone in the relationship of an avuncular storyteller. This storyteller detest Dear Esther's bright, careful speaker, with his stories about dissidents and goats and verse. He prods, reprimands, gets drained or irate with you, whispers conspiratorially with you and – in particular – lets you know what to do to instigate the story as you investigate an office that is startling in its harshness, from the uniform covering to the propelling expressions on the whiteboards and non specific nature depictions, in every practical sense everything stamped with a number. My actuate sense was to disregard the voice in my cerebrum, yet regardless you try to subvert it, The Stanley Tale is set up with yet another readied condition, another lump of witty script, promptly annoying and remunerating you for endeavoring to stray from the set way – notwithstanding the way that, and this is the basic point, everything is a set course in The Stanley Story, and it reprimands the mind flight of decision. You imagine that you're controlling the result, in light of current conditions it's dependably the storyteller controlling you. I expect the purpose behind The Stanley Outline, on the off chance that you feel constrained to discover a show it, is well while in transit to see the vast majority of its differing endings and changes, which turning out from pivotal decisions – like taking the entryway on the left, or the gateway on the advantage – into trade plotlines with further augmenting occasions, fanning outwards to sporadic conclusions. The substance ""the end is never the end"" floats over the screen when you discover one of these endings, and you are come back to Stanley's work space to begin again. What's bewildering is the route by which constrained conditions and plainly restricted decisions incite such a generous number of various results. Here and there you'll settle on precisely the same and something else will happen, as the storyteller changes track. In around a hour I discovered seven fascinating endings, and when I saw another person play, they found another two that I'd never viewed. My first Stanley Account experience was a Kafkaesque bureaucratic shocking dream where each endeavor I made to sharpen my essentialness of decision drove me more noteworthy to a tenaciously inflexible, inevitable course of action of charges that I had no honest to goodness elective however to take in the wake of, winding up at ground zero in my passing. Some of its stages trap you in unlimited circles, compelled to listen to the storyteller pontificate until he condescends to give you another demand. The storyteller's aggregate control over what you can do and when you can do it now and again makes him feel like a correctional facility screen; unmistakable times he's a sidekick, an assistant, a delicate engaging associate. It's a really odd trouble for some person before long acquainted with PC diversions and their essentials. You have to break them, however the storyteller is always a couple wanders before you, lastly you're left tending to what the inspiration driving decision is at all in a framework where each change is laid out for you and some omniscient storyteller has every one of the reserves of being set up to anticipate all that you may do. The best way to The Stanley Account's engaging ""best"" conclusion is to take after the storyteller's headings and do as you're told like a not all that awful little droid, and a little while later a violently twist accomplishment appears commending you for ""beating the preoccupation"". In context of its prelude, I thought The Stanley Outline may be a festival of decision, of the power that we need to break out of our life's repressions by in a general sense acting all of a sudden, however that is precisely The Stanley Story assaults. I speculated that it was remarkably uncomfortable to play on occasion, similar to I was gotten in it – it's the nearest a distraction has ever come to duplicating that inclination being stuck in a dull dream. The title screen – a recursive photograph of a screen demonstrating similar Start screen – mirrors that unease. It's in like way especially captivating, generally because of a sharp script and the storyteller's vivacious execution, and makes visit attacks into the dreamlike and incredible. One of the endings, especially, is an amazingly illustrate joke that gets all the all the more intriguing and cleverer as it goes on, and made me giggle more than any redirection since Entryway. Where The Stanley Story's demo was a light joke of PC preoccupation traditions – unquestionably go play that, in the event that you haven't beginning now, it's a standalone thing - the full stimulation is impressively more bizarre, and less constrained especially. Infrequently The Stanley Tale feels like an examination of the particular free for all of weariness. Particular times it's something else all around: a joke at the player's cost, a distribution on decision and result, a joke, a bureaucratic horrendous dream. All its arranged plotlines and characters cover and join to make something that is intriguingly dinky, however continually dazzling, and really captivating. Whatever it can't abstain from being, it legitimizes playing.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												This game is one of the most  unique things I've played in a along time. Its a story based game, where you you make decisions that affect the ending. As you play, your actions are narrated humorously. Its got a quirky sense of humour, that will make you want to play through dozens of times just to get the alternate endings. It may be short, but theres nothing else quite like it.			"

												Right now, there is nothing about The Stanley Parable that I don't hate.There are games built around a cohesive story with relatable characters, a satisfying dramatic arc and a worthwhile conclusion. This is not one of those games. The Stanley Parable is confusing and all-over-the-place, the main characters are inconsistent, sometimes depressingly shallow, other times infuriatingly opaque. The story spits on the ideals of internal logic.If a video game makes you want to stop playing video games, what does that say about it?The Stanley Parable dragged me into its tangled mass of content without much of a warning. During most of my time playing it, I had at best a vague idea of what was going on. And although it tried everything in its power to defeat me (at one point it was literally begging me to stop playing), I pressed on.The game is ruthless in its mission of deconstructing the concepts of video game narration. It draws back the curtain and exposes the man who pulls the strings. Or pushes the buttons, as it were. Am I able to simply go back to normal games with normal stories, pretend I didn't gaze into the abyss? I can only hope.I think I've come reasonably close to hearing everything that The Stanley Parable has to tell. Its attention to detail is impressive, the love and skill that went into it easily apparent. At times I felt like Sherlock Holmes, with my personal Moriarty always one tantalizing step ahead. Other times I felt a sense of true companionship when my friend and I forged ahead towards destiny. Yet other times I was confronted with a sadistic psychopath, a gentle father figure, or a petty, passive-agressive bystander.The Stanley Parable raises more questions than it answers. Fortunately they are the right kind of questions, the ones that keep you questioning yourself and the world around you rather than frustrate and paralyze you. I'm still relishing the afterglow, so my opinion may shift slightly when I've made more progress processing my experiences.Right now though, there is nothing about The Stanley Parable that I don't love.

												The Stanley Parable is one of the most remarkable games I've ever played.It is a game about games. It's about the relationship between the player and the game and the interactivity that makes this medium unique.That's about as much as I can say about The Stanley Parable without giving anything away. There are no mechanics bound to your keyboard and mouse beyond move, look, open doors and push buttons. The central mechanic of the game is your choice and your perception of the game, incarnated as the Narrator.The game is essentially a choose your own adventure book, elevated to become something truly special by excellent writing, one of the endings features a profound paradox, and phenomenal delivery by the Narrator. The Stanley Parable is extremely clever, amusing and thought-provoking. An absolute must-buy, though I would recommend playing the demo first.<3			"

												Clever and witty. Play time is anywhere from 3 minutes to hours. It is a thin story with numerous branches to follow on subsequent playthroughs.The basic theme comes across like Hitchicker's Guide to the Galaxy, with a fun narrator and amusing circumstances. I can see a few of the references getting dated, before too long, but overall it is a very good little game.			"

												I bought this due to rave reviews, but I did not experience a Eureka moment where I ""got"" it and suddenly it was worth the money. I understand the concept, and yes, ha ha, very good commentary on how games don't present you with choices / free will. That's fine. But it's not great. It's barely even ""good"".This isn't really even a game, so much as an experience. If that's what you want, then maybe this is for you. I was looking for more of a game, and after getting to many of the endings in an hour or so, I couldn't motivate myself to find any more.			"

												Great game. The amount of detail put into the endings makes for a really entertaining game. It even has Easter eggs of other games such as Papers, Please, Payday and even Portal. The voice work of Kevin Brighting makes the game even better. And the way the game bounces between serious and funny makes it more fun to play. The way it breaks the forth wall all the time is possibly the best thing about the game. And the endings are great to! From playing a game that involves you trying to stop a baby from burning to a crisp to going to Heaven in the strangest Easter egg ending ever, the ending are just outright hilarious or serious. (But most of the time, funny). Rating: 8.5/10 Recommendation: Yes			"

												If BioShock was a lesson in player agency, The Stanley Parable would be the whole course. The Stanley Parable encourages players to defy its one simple rule -- follow the directions. Your refusal to play along results in some of the most hilarious moments in gaming. But beyond the finely tuned humor is a thought-provoking, memorable game that will stick with you long after you walk by the credits. This is an absolute must-play.			"

												While the idea for the game is good, it becomes very repetitive and boring fast despite all the ""alternative endings"" and game cameo appearances. This game is titled ""though-provoking"" but you will get the idea it tries to communicate pretty fast and then it is just repeating the whole ""no choice in games"" thing over and over again. For somebody who prefers non-linear games, this preachiness gets annoying fast, as it is neither a revelation nor very interesting. It is thought-provoking only in the first minutes.			"

												The Stanley Parable is, no doubt, one of the strangest games I've ever played. Right when I saw it on steam I had no idea what to think. All it shows is a bunch of office cubicles and computers, and the discription, though interesting, didn't really help me decide whether to buy it or not. I almost gave it a pass, until I heard everyone and their grandmother going on about, ""Have you played 'Stanley Parable? It's AMAZING!' It's hilarious! It make's you question your existance!"" So I finally decided to give it a try when I saw it on sale. And...It's unbelievable. I never thought I could play something so hilarious, so drawing, so strangely thought provoking in my life. I honestly don't know where to begin because, and I know everyone whose reviewed this has said this but, I'm afraid I'll spoil something. I don't even want to upload any screenshots. Just trust everyone on this, this is a game that no one, I mean no one should pass up.Okay I'll give a little bit more detail, here's what I love best about it. Every joke works, I mean it. It has, what might be hundreds of jokes packed in there, and every one of them had me flinging my head back with laughter. A lot of the jokes are Fourth-wall jokes (and if you don't know what the Fourth-Wall is look it up on TVTropes.com), addressing the player directly. The game also likes to screw with you, but not in a scary way. As you progress the environment starts to change, sometimes drastically. To the point where you may throw your hands in the air and scream ""What's happening!?"" as I did at one point. The game may make you start to question reality as well...Look the point is stop reading this review and BUY THIS GAME! Every thing you've heard about it is true. All of it's Game of the Year nominations are well-deserved. GO NOW!			"

												Play the demo to get a taste. Just get that out of the way.  And don't worry, the demo has almost none of the content of the actual game.  But it does give you a feel for what to expect.Now, look, I admit that ""play the demo"" may sound like a bit of a cop-out, but trust me, The Stanley Parable is unlike any game you've ever played. On the surface, it looks like you're just wandering around an office in an FPS where you can't shoot or jump.  And that's true.  But it's not a fair assessment.  The Stanley Parable is -- to employ an outdated and well-trodden expression -- ""like a Choose Your Own Adventure on crack"".  It's a game about choice.  Your coworkers have vanished, and you are tasked with finding out why.  Will you bother to discover where they went?  Or maybe you'll forge your own path.  But what consequences could there be for straying from the story?  What if compliance was actually...in your best interest?  Will you ever find the myriad secrets and endings tucked away?  Will you even go so far as to cheat to find them?!  (Seriously?!)The Stanley Parable has been a deeply memorable experience. It's a haunting, yet hilarious, unconventional journey.  For me, it is second only to Antichamber in my personal Top 10 list of great gaming experiences.(For those who have played the original, free HL2 mod of this game, it is WELL WORTH picking up this new retail version.  It looks amazing, and adds a ton of new material.  And you can finally thank the author with actual money.)			"

												It was really fun, but a bit short. Although there are multiple endings, it takes at max 10 min to complete each one. Normally I would be fine with a short game like this, but priced at $15 (I got mine on sale for $9) I expected more gameplay. Like I said before, the gameplay is brilliantly scripted, and the narrator is probably the best I've ever heard. Every single aspect of this game is great, but just for price reasons, I do not recomnmend it. If, however, money isn't an issue for you, absolutely buy this game. Hopefully in the future new updates will create more endings and keep the game fresh!			"

												The Stanley Parable is a biting, witty and satirical take on the current state of video-games. Their design and interaction mechanics, how they function to entice your progress (or impede) through the game's plot and enviornment. Throughout the game, there is a narrator who guides you through your curated experience, in certain points of conflict or 'choice' he tries to coerce you down the 'right' path. Whether you follow this disembodied voice or no is left up-to you but Galactic Cafe accepts a 'players' right of impositing their own 'choicesi/i]' in the game. The Parable has a minimalist soundtrack and soundscape which seek to complement the rather barren and sterile look of the game environment and the feeling of disconnect with the same. Overall The Stanley Parable is a wonderful look at how everything is right and wrong with the way games are presented to their audience, gamers and how we are stimulated to be kept in this circle. Also, you cannot jump and this game has an ADVENTURE LINE. You got to purchase the game just so you can follow that, YES! YES! You must. "

												Again, after Gone Home, I'm here trying to understand if this is a game or not. Again, I really don't have an answer, at least not one that will satisfy everyone, all I can say is that I really enjoyed playing The Stanley Parable. It is fun to explore, more than  A LOT of ""open world"" games, it is fun to look at, it is fun to understand. The narrator is brilliant, the madness of the whole situation is hilarious. A game about choices whose first clear statement is that you don't have any... and still, you got multiple endings, a lot of crossroads to try, a lot of different explanations to what's happening. But only playing you'll understand that everything is kinda useless... or maybe not. I liked it. Thumbs up.			"

												     I'm back with another handy-dandy review. There's not much I can say about this game without spoiling things for you. Because of this, all I can say is: this game is amazing. I can't tell you why because that would ruin it. Don't look it up online. Just buy it and play it blindly for the best experience. Trust me, it's worth it. The only thing I will say is that there are several endings, so be sure to play through the game like 5 to 10 times (It's worth it).Although I can't talk about things that are in the game, I can give you some tips to improve your experience.HELPFUL TIPS:DO NOT SKIP THE INTRO CUT SCENEJust don't.LISTEN TO THE NARRATORYou don't have to do what he says, but listen to what he has to say.GET THE DOOR 430 ACHIEVEMENT(After playing through the game a time or two)That's about it.

												♥♥♥♥ed up. In a good way. A strong case for games being art whilst also fun and meaningful. It's a contrived yet witty ending simulator.I like the dev and creative director. Both the in-game one and one in reality. Even if this reality is in principle creepily similar to that of Stanley, and hence not a type of reality that's commonly conceived at all. :)Has been a long time since a game made me question reality itself yo. And obsessively hunt for different endings, all of them in-your-face baffling.I did not go through with the one where you need to press buttons in fast succession for 4 hours. Will not bother to script that, not even for the divine art.			"

												Witty, unusual and quietly discomfiting, The Stanley Parable, without exaggerating, is one of my favourate games of all time. I am not going to give much away in this revew as I bellive I would spoil it, and I dont think I would do it justice in my attempt to describe it. All I will say is that it is, at risk of sounding cliché, more of an 'experience' than a traditional game, it has a absolutely great sense of humor, frequently mocks the player, game design itself, and is one of the only games to this date that has truely astonished me.

												This game starts as a walking-simulator in an office listening to a beautiful voice. The narrator wants to guide the player, and then starts to complain when the latter does not follow the rules. A love-hate relationship grows between the player and the narrator. The experience seems short but actually there are tons of branching paths (sometimes leading to different places and concepts), and the deeper themes of the game start to unravel. Choice and free will, a meta commentary on videogame narration and player agency, and so on.Very meta, very funny, each playthrough is short but sweet and got me excited to try new things and see how the narrator would react.

												The Stanley Parable is an experimental narrative-driven first person game. It is an exploration of choice, freedom, storytelling and reality, all examined through the lens of what it means to play a video game.- You will make a choice that does not matter- You will follow a story that has no end- You will play a game you cannot win...it's actually best if you don't know anything about it before you play it...The HD Remix of The Stanley Parable is a remodeled, remastered version of this unique title.I think this is not even a game, but in life someone told us to give us advice, and someone wants to scourge us, he brings a very deep meaning. 10/10			"

It's really immersive, I also recommend playing the demo too (when in doubt or not) because the demo literally explains a lot of what you'll get in the main game, and you'll enjoy it as well. There are so many choices that will leave you craving to find out ""What would happen if I do this?"" and the game will give you unpredictable answers (mostly). I wish to see more games with this kind of uniqueness in the future.			"

Do you listen to the voice, do you ignore it, do you prove the voice wrong, do you sometimes follow the voice. That's up to you.Without ruining the game. You have the ability to retry the story and see how different decision may impact your success.The narrator/ominous voice was very good (well chosen voice actor).I hope this game comes out with more contect (hopefully not having to purchase DLC) cause I would be interest to see if any changes occur if another option appears or another decision is made.

And you will, indeed, press many buttons to play this game. You move by pressing buttons. You press buttons by pressing buttons. You feel by pressing buttons. And while Stanley is hardly what one may call a role model, Stanley does listen to what I say, and when I say you should purchase the Stanley Parable, then you ought to do it. Stanley also says the Broom Closet ending was his absolute favorite.			"

												One of the most clever, thought-provoking deconstruction of common video game narratives and tropes in recent years. This is not a typical video game in the most common sense. Instead, it is an effective vehicle for some of the most important subjects pertaining to video games and their narrative. Where Dear Esther failed by wasting the video game medium for its narrative, The Stanley Parable succeeded by making full use of video game mechanics, and then subverts them in a humourous, and yet elegant way.This game is designed to be played several times, and the real value of this game is to see what happens when you stray from the narrative that the game sets the player out to follow.I will not discuss the specifics of this game, as doing so will ruin the sense of discovery so vital to keeping the experience effective, Instead, I will tell you to go pick it up and experience it, several times. You will not regret it.			"

												Giving this game a thrumb up is as hard as giving it a thrumb down.The Stanley Parable is a WITTY game. Pros:+ Multiple Endings+ Good immersive deriving from interactions with the Narrator+ Impressive combination of scene and narration+ Countless Easter Eggs+Cons:- Short contents- Pseudo-intelletual plot-In the game, the game-makers show us an interesting story with their inspirational thinking through the endless loop of our protagnist, Stanley's fate. It trys to discuss the probabilities that derive from obedience and rebellion, and to achieve a high-level of interaction between players and the game. I cannot allege it is successful, but this attempt is praisable.Various endings is an attraction of the game. Among those endings, my favoriate one is the 'Crazy Ending', which will be achieved by walking down the stairs instead of up. The final narration is so good that it makes me feel I am Stanley, and being assisted by repetitive rooms, description of thinking and the style of stream-of-consciousness, it gives players an intense atomsphere and great immersive. Every ending is so distictive and interesting that can inspire players to try every choice over and over again. Under those circunstances, I think, it is as a metapher, instead of as a simple character, that should Stanley be defined.The narrator is the most important role in the game. It is he who continuously pushs the story forward and guides Stanley into different endings. He can be regarded as a highlight and also a drawback of the game. His words and tone contribute to game's style and atmosphere, but also undermine it's reality. If most of the narration can be replaced by text and make it focus on pushing the climax(just like what he does in the Crazy Ending), it would be more splendid.Except those advantages, this game is quite boring. Although it seems like players are exploring the game, but they not. All they can do is just walk along the routes that pre-designed by game-makers, and repetitive narration helps me comfirm it. Simply, throughout the game what players play is to choose 'left or right?'. It does provide some interesting things, but the gameplay and replaybility are poor. But you can regarded it as a voiced novel.Another drawback is that the game is so short that players can beat it within 10 mins. Although it contains multiple endings and the plot will be changed just result from slight changes in choices——it is still too short →_→. $15 is too much, so I strongly suggest anyone who wants to try this game keep waiting for this game apparing in bundles.How to define this game? Or, more prudently，should it be defined as a game?Without a doubt it is a good experiment. Yet, compared with novels and movies of the same type, The Stanley Parable seems still primitive.			"

												Prepare for spoilers. Normally I don't spoil, but it's mighty hard with this one.To enjoy The Stanley Parable, it takes a peculiar type of person. Or types of persons. There is no 'action' to speak of in this game. No guns to shoot and, debatably, not even a failure condition. (even if you CAN die...)I've been troubled in finding the best way to describe this game. People have called it a mind♥♥♥♥, something that messes with your logic. But from the moment I defied the narrator, I never felt like that. I didn't feel like I was being tossed around with. I felt like I was in a thought experiment. A thought experiment that got out of hand and resulted in other thought experiments, until it had evolved into a narrative in how I'm seemingly breaking the purpose of these by simply not cooperating.What I've concluded is that The Stanley Parable is a narrative genius. A statement on multiple facets. For example, the question can be asked how the power of the narrator compares to that of a hypothetical God? And what if the subjects in the universe the narrator and/or hypothetical god are ruling, become sentient?But that's not the only question that can surface. Your question could be ""how defiant can I be and not die? What if death is part of the pathway and continuing forward will actually result in a different outcome based on the fact that I died?""Yes, that seems like a very long and convoluted question...But that's what this game does. It makes you question the reality it resides in. The non-eucledian level design (Google it) means that any progress is progress permitted to you by the narrator. But then you reach a point where even the narrator questions their own power and choices.Or you could have taken such choices that angered the narrator so much that he instead turned confrontational and made you face the fact that, even if you are walking around, you are still an automaton of a human pressing buttons.Maybe you instead drive the narrator so desperate enough that his last resort is a splendor of a room with particle effects where he seems to feel at peace and happy, with your only physical choice being to stand there for eternity, or kill yourself, stealing away the narrator's happiness.In that perspective, you could question whether you are Stanley to begin with. Maybe Stanley is a very complicated tool for you to control the narrator. Maybe you are the hypothetical God, whom's tenacity can undo or counter anything the narrator does or commands.I am far from done on describing What this game is like. The narrator could be a villain, a desperate companion, a frustrated writer... But what stands central is choice. You can only move and interact, but the choices you physically make can last so far that you wonder... not if you should do it, but what first?The Stanley Parable can be funny. Can be sad, inspiring pity within. But should you really forget yourself? Who are you anyway? Are you even real? Do you even exist? Who says you are not dreaming this and are still pressing those buttons on that keyboard?But there is one central truth to this game: It rewards semi-lineair exploration. It's not open world, but it can very much be explored and said exploration can get out of hand. And that's where the strength of the storytelling comesIf you like narration, spoken by a very skilled narrator, and like to pay attention to the story (as non traditional as this very much is) then you'll be in for a treat.But again, I can't state this enough: this is not a game for people who only wish action and effects. Such people will probably find this a boring experience, so be forewarned. If you can bring yourself to slow down your pace and allow yourself to think, you may yet enjoy it.Because I sure did. As an amateur writer, The Stanley Parable has employed many narrative tools and tricks, chastizing or rewarding you for falling for them, or not doing so at all. Carrots on a stick and red herrings, It is a thought experiment encompassing several of it's kind with a carefully laid out madness.I wish I could keep on writing about this game. But I have to stop at some point.Good job, Galactic Cafe.			"

												This game is great. I would say almost as brilliant as Portal. Just try it, you'll like it if you like Portal.Edit:I was pondering what to add to this review, but I can't. The story is self-explanatory enough (and I do not want to spoil it, that is half the fun), and the mechanics is just brilliant. I would and I will just say this: the game itself is amazing, but the best part is the thought behind such a concept, and will ask you some questions that you will never think of when you are playing other games.If you want another CoD / HL2 shooty-blasty-killing FPS variant, this is not the game that you want, BUT...if you want to play a thought-driven experimental with will-crafted humor like Portal, you would enjoy this game as much as I did, and remember this experience for a long time.As for the price itself, I almost got every content within the eight hours that I played, so the original price is not that good compare to other games that can let you be enjoyable for hours and hours for 15 bucks (or less). But I think the price is well worth-it if you got it on sale (I got it for 40% off and I'm satisfied for the content at the price).I would strongly-suggested that you do not read any reviews that contains spoilers, any videos that has gameplay footage on it, and even the trailers that posted on this very page, just experience it (demo or the full game) and enjoy, employee 427.

												I had high expecations for this game, but I was still suprised about how good it actually is.This is the closest you'll get to having a real choice in video games. Multiple endings and converations with several answers are merely an illusion of having a free will.Even the biggest roleplaying games feel like being on a railcar that drives you through a storyline in comparison with The Stanley Parable.The duration of a single playthrough is short, but everytime you start anew, everything can and will be different. Even choosing the same path over and over again, will be different from the first, second and even third time you did.I highly recommend playing it, to give yourself the chance to see what a truly interactive game can be -- and not just by the watered-down definition the medium uses.

												Every once in a while, it's nice to come across a game that you weren't expecting, the kind of game that creeps up on you and then stays with you long after you've finished playing.  The Stanley Parable was originally developed as a Source engine mod back in 2010. Its creator Davey Wreden said that he set out to discover something about video games that hadn't been explored yet. More specifically, what would happen if you could disobey their rules.The game tells the story of Stanley, an average man who finds solace in his simple mundane office job. However on one particular day it appears that all his co-workers have suddenly disappeared. Guided by the narrator, Stanley must step out of the safety of his little cubical and begin his adventure to find out what exactly is going on. At first glance it might seem easy to categorise this as another artsy ""walk 'em up"" in the vein of something like Dear Esther or Proteus. It has a simple setting, lots of long-winded narration, not much to interact with and of course no jump or weapons, so what exactly do you do in The Stanley Parable? Well, essentially you make decisions. This is because the driving force behind the game is that of ""choice"". You decide HOW you play the game, and the game responds accordingly. And these decisions may appear simple, left or right? Over there? Over here? Touch that?Meanwhile you're guided by the soothing sound of 'the narrator' voiced brilliantly by British voice actor Kevan Brighting! The narrator attempts to lead you to successfully complete the game by advising you which path to take as well as narrating the inner monologue of the troubled protagonist Stanley. And it's through this narration that the game achieves a level of hysterical self awareness and brilliant charm very similar to the Portal series. This dynamic narration will react to the decisions you make, often breaking the fourth wall to talk to you directly. And should you decide not to listen to these directions and ""disobey"" the resulting dialogue and consequences can easily spiral out of control into the strange and surreal. But to say anymore would no doubt ruin your experience of The Stanley Parable as no two play throughs are really the same. And multiple play throughs are inevitable in a game that encourages you to poke and prod at its structure, almost everyone I know who've played this walked away from this game with a different story to tell. Depending on how your experience plays out, at some stage or another you will no doubt be forced to return to Stanley's office to once again set out to look for your co-workers, and it's here that you might decide to stop playing the game and that's totally fine, but in my experience, once you've been presented with so many variables, it's very hard to resist that urge to go back and try out every possible deviation, especially when they can alter the game so radically beyond your expectations. And this kind of thinking is just so refreshing, I found myself laughing with confusion and disbelief because every time I pushed the game, it would push back. I guess the only disappointing moment was when I came to the stark realisation that the game couldn't possibly live up to the illusion of infinite choice. However this was more bitter sweet, as I soon came to the realisation that any game that gave me this feeling of absolute freedom, if only for the briefest moment in time, was truly remarkable.The Stanley Parable might not be for everyone, but in my opinion it should be played by everyone. It's a hilarious experiment in psychology and non-linear game design that will probably teach you more about yourself as a gamer than you might want to know. "

												Are you an experienced gamer?  Have you played enough games that you instinctively recognize the tropes and common things that all games do, but can't quite put a finger on them?  Would you like a game that points them all out, and makes it amusing at the same time?  Good.  The Stanley Parable does that.Well, I mean, that's where it starts.  First it puts its finger right on those tropes, pointing them out, having a chuckle.  Then the whole hand.  Then it shoves its hand through the tropes and the wall behind them, shattering a hole into a Escher-like dimension of allegory and humor spiraling endlessly around a story that deliberately falls afoul of the same tropes it works so hard to identify and undermine.Then the game restarts, or maybe it doesn't restart.  Maybe you restarted it, but did you restart it because you wanted to, or because the game wanted you to?  And is this really a game anymore?To perhaps make that rambling a bit more clear, The Stanley Parable is a game about a man, which is really allegory about games, which in turn is a metaphor about life and choice and free will and about a billion other things.  There are so many layers to the story you could get lost in it all, but the beauty is that you don't have to.  You can be philisophical about what it all means, or you can simply laugh hysterically at the spot on narration describing, bemoaning, and sometimes belittling you, the story, and who knows what else.In short, The Stanley Parable is a beautiful mix of humor, philosophy, allegory, and self-aware commentary on video games, requiring almost no skill to understand and enjoy.  It is a masterpiece that blurs the line between game, story, commentary, and art.			"

												I can't even call The Stanley Parable as a 'game', which is so far from being something bad, it is more like an 'experience', some other kind of gaming from a very different and weird perspective (I'm having a hard time defining that..), a type of perspective which can for example make adults who are purely against gaming in one way or another, actually enjoy playing it (Except the ones who'll turn the game off in the main menu.). Not sure if it makes sense.Well, whatever. I don't know if it is an experience which everybody would enjoy. I also don't know if it justifies its full price (I got it from a sale anyways.) or not. What I do know is that, I wish I could forget all I know about The Stanley Parable, and play it once again.(I don't know how deep it goes, but I hardly reccomend playing the demo before buying it. Trust me, it is most wise.)			"

												The Stanley Parable is actually a pretty hard game to recommend. The first time you'll play it you'll probably be like ""Wtf?"" but the more you play it and the more different you play it the more it starts to make sense, atleast it did for me. I actually have no idea how to describe without spoiling it, I can only say that each of your own choices will lead to a different outcome. I honestly don't think that The Stanley Parable could be described as a game that belongs to a certain genre, it's pretty weird but yet, mindblowing genious. Possible one of the greatest achievements in videogaming narrative and storytelling and a very successfull one too. Be warned, there are different endings to the game and I don't even know if I got them all and no I didn't even bothering looking up and no I don't care if I got them all because the way I see it I played through this game with no knowledge of it whatsoever and that resulted in an amazing experience, one which everyone should try.

												Excellent game, brilliant use of humour. The narrator is perfectly voiced and for such a simple 'adventure' game its extremely diverse in the sense that there are plenty of endings, easter eggs and secrets, a lot of which I haven't even found yet. The achievements are fun and fairly simple. A game that I thought I'd speed through, enjoy the humour and never look at again has become a game that I am constantly coming back to and finding new little things every time. I'd recommend this to almost anyone. If you like the Portal humour then you'll definitely like this.			"

												9.2/10 - A game where Office Space meets Groundhog Day!This game does it right, great graphics and amazing narration. You are Stanley an employee who pushes buttons and does what he's told. You can follow the narrator’s directions or choose another path at your own risk.The game is really short and meant to be played a plethora of times. Each time you play you will discover something else and uncover more dialogue.The achievements are random, irrelevant and worth pursuing. I wouldn't pay $15, since i do have to play this game in smaller doses. Although this game is amazing; it can get little tedious finding new paths each time.Worth $10 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												This game is definetly worth playing. However, it is important to understand that it's even less gaming-game than Telltale's or Quantic Dream projects. This is a glorious game-designing experience which is built around the narrator. Literally, just like in the famous 'Bastion', you've got a narrator that describes your every step, every idea you got in your head. And that's how it goes 'till the moment you face a small divarication. Two doors, and the voice above you, the voice that you've been listening as if it was your own, tells you to pick the left one. And you may follow this order, and end the game sooner or later. You'll get your ending, and will be happy with it, I suppose. But what would have happened if you had chosen the diffirent path? That's when the game actually begins.This is not a drama movie and not a horror fiction. Actually, it is pretty funny and will make you a little bit happier, if you'd like. This is not even a 'story', just a small sandbox, which you can use to play with your narrator. Or... Maybe it is you that is being played? It's not gonna take a long time to complete this game, but after that you'll remember Stanley for a long, long time.			"

The Stanley Parable				* 8/10This is not just a common game and it's quite unique in its approach to the player.Technically this is just a walking simulator, but it has no importance at all, because gameplay has not much to do with the game as it could have been an isometric point'n'click, a sidescrolling arcade or whatever you want. The core of the game is the way it relates and plays with the player.As the title suggests this is a story about Stanley, an employee living a monotone life and working in an office when all of a sudden he realizes the entire floor is empty. And here the player begins the game. The real core of the gme though is the Narrator's voice, the way he describes your actions and guides you. There's a canon ending where you hear Stanley's story where he finally realizes he's free and all, but that lame and simple specious ending has nothing to do with the game itself, in my opinion. In fact you simply have to blindly follow the narrator's directions to finish it in 15 mins or so. The real point of the game is in the huge amount of variations derived by all the choices you're being presented, the Narrator's reactions breaking the 4th wall both with Stanley and the player itself more than you'd expect and the way the game evolves in multiple directions and restart in different variations, resulting more in a comedy than a parable.The engine is the good old trusty Source Engine, and the office and other ambiences have been well built with a simple but effective level of detail.Unfortunately there's not much music in game but it's kind of right this way, as it would break the atmosphere of the game.+++PROs+++ NARRATOR. The real core of the game is not to beat the game, nor Stanley himself or his parable, but it's the narrator. It's all about the choices you make and his reactions that can drive the story to an incredible number of variations, from tragedy, to comedy at the limit of ridiculous with the narrator breaking the 4th wall not only with Stanley but with the player as well.---CONs--- UNCOMMON. The unusual structure of the game might not look appealing to the most conventional players, as they could finish the game with the canon ending in 10-15 minutes not realizing that the purpose of the game lies in testing the limits of all the choices and variables and seeing the game evolve and degenerate as the narrator hilariously comments your actions and choices... Even if you're doing nothing at all! As a ""traditional"" gamer myself I've been lucky enough because I chose to never listen the Narrator since the very beginning (I didn't trust him XD) to finish with a sad and nonsense ending that slowly brought me back at the beginning. Since then I started trying various alternatives.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64And on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

												The Stanley Parable is very in love with itself.As what I can only describe as an abstract rumination on contemporary game design, Galactic Café’s The Stanley Parable is, from its opening moments, confident to the point of near irreverence. I suppose it’s understandable to a degree, as The Stanley Parable is undeniably witty and unconventional, with a quirky charm and dry self-awareness. It is so overwhelmingly eccentric that it can begin to feel as if not playing along with it and laughing at every joke is an act of disrespect, such is the perception The Stanley Parable cultivates within moments of leaving the main menu to venture forth into a cornucopia of contextually appropriate satire and bizarre dark humor.The Stanley Parable gives off such a sense of self-prescribed brilliance that I feel both dumbfounded and maybe even a little angry at just how much I dislike it. I get the joke and admire its delivery, but when approached from any angle but the one the game so strongly attempts to cultivate, The Stanley Parable feels like little more than a few intelligent observations on modern game design strung along by a series of amusing, yet immensely inconsistent and inscrutable scenes with no conclusions to be found.I understand that the lack of closure is part of the point. I can find a certain poetic appreciation for the circular design of the game, and as a lesson in abstract game design The Stanley Parable certainly gets marks for trying. But then it tries some more, and eventually (which is to say sometime within the first 20 minutes of play) I became rather weary of hearing the same joke play out as I raged a supposedly hilarious war with the narrator over increasingly innocuous choices.There is such an abundance of creativity to be admired within The Stanley Parable, one would think that even in worst case scenarios everyone will be able to find something to like buried in its labyrinth of compounding decisions. But by design each disconnected moment is compiled with the next, creating a sequence of random and oddly directed scenes for which the primary goal is to disorient the player as they continue bumbling through a game with no rules and a rather antagonistic sense of progression.The Stanley Parable without a doubt knows what it’s doing. The script is tight, the pacing smooth, and the overall concept worthy of praise. And yet I found myself despising every moment I spent with the game. The more I tried to peel back its layers to find the game I had seen praised to the ends of the earth and back, the more I was confronted with the same shallow and narcissistic experience that only became more meandering and unfulfilling the longer I stuck with it. I suppose it was fitting that I eventually arrived in a museum dedicated to the game itself; an internal monument to a project which clearly recognizes its own genius even as I struggle to understand the appeal.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												There are games that awestruck you with the amount of graphics or non linear gameplay or both. However, Stanley Parable is a game which, art lovers will love to pay the full price. Its makes you think differently. And, I have to say I am impressed by The Stanley Parable. It has references to other games too Its a must buy.you can either follow the linear gameplay or follow your own paths. You can complete the game if u follow the linear gameplay in less than half an hour. But, there are a lot of things to explore!Recommended for Narration, art lovers, References, Dialogs.			"

												The Stanley Parable is an odd fast-paced spectacle exploring the absurdity of many things in life and video games to a brilliantly voiced interactive narration. At first sight, you can beat the game in about 5 minutes, but the outcome turns out to be just one of the dozens of completely unexpected ways in which one can traverse the game world in an effort to experience, explore and undrestand.For fear of unintentional spoilers I will now shut up after saying just one more thing: PLAY IT.

												I really enjoyed 'The Stanley Parable', I enjoyed it the same way some obessive about movies enjoys an movie critique and other examples that I can't honestly think of right now.Does the fact that I enjoyed this game, and I mean I enjoyed it a lot actually makes this game a good game though? ( I hope no one gets man, since the whole point of the game is to get people to think and ask questions). As a whole, I don't honestly think so. As a game I think 'The Stanley Parable' is pretty mediocre in terms of its mechanics and aesthetics. Its narrator and script are top notch though and really carry the game ensuring that its tone and mood are always spot on. As a whole, I think people should play this game, its the equivilent to visiting an art museam in my opinion, just a bit more engaging.A more robust review of the game can be found on my blog over here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-stanley-parable.html.

												While Antichamber uses philosophical wisecracking as mere specific hints for solving puzzles and Dear Esther doesn't really deserve to be called an interactive story, playing The Stanley Parable is like going on a spiritual journey. There's a massive feedback effect, making you reflect about your own life. The way it messes with your head I could compare to some of the experiences I had on ayahuasca... how it first tries to confuse you so that you begin to get your narrow rational mind out of the way and open yourself to the big questions. The fact that this 'game' (it's definitely a game if you consider life one, too) has no real end further supports that training character, not unlike the Dao De Jing that you can keep reading again and again and gain new insights every time. While a desire for 'completing' it might eventually get the best of you and make you consult guides, you're definitely not meant to know all there is in this game. It is part of the experience to not have the full view on everything.Big themes in The Stanley Parable are the idea of free will and personal responsibility for your decisions, as well as the purpose of life, the challenges we face, destiny and the nature of reality. ... Yeap, this is a vast little game.			"

												WHAT THE STANLEY PARABLE IS - NO SPOILERSTL;DR: Play the demo avaliable on Steam to quickly see exactly ""what the game is about"".The Stanley Parable is a game about making choices that is simple in terms of mechanics (WASD/arrow keys to move, E to interact with objects, mouse to look around, that's it)  but it is very unconventional in other aspects such as plot development or character presentation.You play in first person view as an unsettlingly ordinary office worker named Stanley, in a story that begins with him realizing that all his coworkers have suddenly vanished. What really enriches the story is the omnipresent, amusing narrator (voiced by Kevan Brighting) who eventually contributes to the story much more than simply narrating it.This story branches out to multiple, very different endings depending on what the player chooses to do. The brilliance of the game is how these choices change much more than just the plot, because the game does not proceed with conventional video game logic, sometimes even criticizing it. For example, the narrator's personality changes according to how you play and sometimes he breaks the fourth wall to comment on your decisions as the player. The achievement system and how ""glitches"" are handled are other examples of this. The game is also sprinkled with secrets and easter eggs for the more curious players to search for. I find The Stanley Parable to be a thought-provoking and insightful on matters like the power of choices, the illusion of free choice, and what a video game really is or could be. Despite its brilliance The Stanley Parable is a short experience, although it is still likely to stick around in your mind for a long time, even after you found all of the endings.			"

												I will start by saying that this review contains mild spoilers, so if you haven't played the game yet, I highly suggest that you take caution before reading this review.I was not familiar with the original Half-Life 2 mod that The Stanley Parable started out with. Heck, I only heard about this game through word of mouth. The Stanley Parable is what happens when you take an interesting concept that you probably wouldn't dare put into a videogame, and actually make it work. The story (if you can call it that) is of a man named Stanley who works at a boring job in an office building, pushing buttons that his boss tells him to push via his monitor. One day, he notices that his boss hasn't given him a single command the entire day, and appears to have gone missing, along with his co-workers.That's where the gimmick of the game takes place. While there is a narrative telling you what to do throughout the game, you have a choice to follow it or stray from it. Depending on what decisions you make throughout the game, there are a total of 14 different endings in this game. This can range from ]turning off the power in a mind-control facility that has been controlling all of the thoughts and feelings of the workers in the building, including Stanley, to entering a homage of a small string of existing videogames. The thing I like about this game is that there isn't a morality meter. The choices you make aren't necessarily based on thoughts, but actions. Not only that, but some of the endings are based off of bugs, glitches and whatnot that were in the original mod (Try closing the door on yourself as you start the game.)The Stanley Parable is almost entirely psychological. During the time that it was still just a mod, the creator, Wreden,  thought up the game considering how most games on the market ""confine the user to its rules."" The dialogue in the game is very thought-provoking at times, and I've even seen some players and journalists state that it made them think about their own lives. The thought that a simple game like this can have so much influential power on someone like that is remarkable, and I applaud Galactic Cafe for this.The presentation is definetly not anything to turn your head at either. The visuals are vastly different in this game than anything you would see in Half-Life 2 (Go figure). When the developers said they were going to make an HD remake of this game, they weren't screwing around. No hallway nor room looks the same (unless designed intentionally), and everything looks crisp and clear. The music is a nice touch as well, perfectly fitting the locale and scenario that takes place. The voice acting is also a department I have to give major props to. Kevan Brighting does a fantastic job as the voice of the narrator, depicting emotions of happiness, despair, confusion, anger, worry, really the list goes on. He even goes through an evil persona during one of the endings.As I stated before, 14 endings is a lot for a game, but it is still quite a short game. Is there anything else that might convince you to take a second glance at the fifteen dollar price tag? Perhaps. The Stanley Parable may be a short game at its core, but there are a ton of secrets to be found within the different branching pathways. Extended dialogue, little visual easter eggs, and areas of the map you probably didn't even know existed until you did a little exploration. The developers really thought of everything when making this game. (Try typing sv_cheats 1 in the console. I dare you.)If you're one of those people who enjoys a non-linear experience in your videogames, as well as comedic and witty dialogue, then I highly reccomend The Stanley Parable for you. However, if you're still not sure about the fifteen dolar price tag, I advise trying out the demo first. It's actually a unique experience from the official game, and you might like what you see.

												The very first thing that should be mentioned about the Stanley Parable is that it is short. Very short. This is not to say the game is not worth getting, quite the contrary. However, waiting for a good sale is probably the most prudent course of action given the length of the game.In a way the Stanley Parable is like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. While you play as Stanley, the narrator will tell the story of Stanley and which actions the narrator wishes you to follow. However, there are multiple points where you can choose to follow the narrator or not. When choosing to follow the narrator, it is possible to complete the game in a little over four minutes, but the fun is in exploring all of the various paths and seeing the various endings to the game. The narration is done wonderfully, and as the narrator becomes frustrated with your choices, the game can become rather comical.  The game is an exporation in story telling, and while simple, it is very well done.			"

												Let’s start this game off by saying as an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ getting the 430 achievement of this game had me laughing to the point where I hurt.The Stanley Parable is a great satirical look at our modern society and gaming culture. If you just follow what you’re told you miss out on so much of this game and every moment of it is great. Though it is pretty short if you follow the narrator seeking out the other possibilities makes this game endlessly entertaining. One of the best things about this game is how much you can miss if you take it at face value. It is almost necessary to do some of the achievements as they are the developer trolling players about the things they do to earn achievements in games.   "

The Stanley Parable is impossible to truly describe. At its most tame, it's an incredible psychological experience that will stay with you for the rest of your life. It has an outstanding blend of humor and seriousness, wrapped in the type of weirdness you can only find in games like EarthBound or Katamari Damacy. It pokes a lot of fun at various video game tropes, sometimes subtly, sometimes flamboyantly. It makes the player think about their life and the validity and consequences of choice and free will. And it does all this while maintaining a simple but intelligent gameplay experience. So the real question is not what The Stanley Parable has to offer, but rather what you are willing to obtain from it.			"

												The Stanley Parable is easily my favorite game of 2013. The humor is top-notch (whether it's light-hearted like the Adventure Line or one of the many fantastic times it gets dark) and the Narrator is a fantastic and very well-acted character -- the staircase ending is legitimately among the most affecting scenes I've encountered in a videogame. I can't recommend picking this up more.If you haven't yet, make sure to pick up the demo too - not only is it free but it also has absolutely no content from the full game in it, instead attempting (quite successfully) to show off the humor and style you'll encounter. It's very much worth trying out.			"

												I thought I had cleared The Stanley Parable after a mere 2 hours of play. Surely, I thought, I had cleared it after 5 hours? After 7 hours I have taken each possible route and explored the corners of this game to the best of my ability and realize that I probably have still not cleared it.To some this would mean the game is worth its 12€ price tag and to some it would be exactly why it isn't worth it at all. To some it would not even be considered a game. I'm not too sure on that point myself but I can say that it is an experience. Such is the paradox that is The Stanley Parable, It really is whatever you make of it. I think I have squeezed its value out of it but some may never feel they got their moneys worth. Is it worth the price? I couldn't say. Is it a good game? I don't really know. Is it even a game? Not sure.			"

												I love the explorative choices in this game, but buyer beware; If you have a really hard time accepting any kind of authority, this may not be the game for you. If, on the other hand, you wish you had time to play through every game that had ""good ending/bad ending"" layouts, this is likely right up your alley. Very short playthroughs and surprising dialogue make this worth the full price of the game. Again, if you aren't obstinate, this is an unexpressably wonderful game!			"

												A flawlessly executed analysis of gaming conventions, spoken and unspoken. Like its contemporary fellow experience-a-thons Gone Home and Dear Esther, it's a bold innovation in storytelling. Also like Gone Home and Dear Esther, it's a far better experience the less you know about it beforehand. If you like great writing, acting, presentation and something meaningful to take away, and you haven't played The Stanley Parable, you're missing out.			"

												I have no words to describe this game. So i will try the best i can.""The Stanley Parable"" is a game that isn't a game, it isn't something you ""play"", neither is something with an objective. It's a narrative that, at first, seems really linear, but, when you start to explore, there will be a mass amount of possibilities.Different from most games, you don't have a prize at the end, there's no reward or resolution whatsoever, the only thing that you get is a different ending each time that you play it in a different way. Witch is pretty good! Because i can, by my actions, see the resolution to MY story.Witch gets me to the first topic: The Story.The story is simples: You are Stanley, a normal worker that only press buttons everyday. And this it. Many times in the game, it seems that you have a wife to take care of and because of she, you can't get out of your prison, that is your work. But when you receive no more orders, you get out of your office and see that everyone that worked with you was gone, without any trace of what happened whatsoever. That's where YOUR story begins. The game does an awesome job making you and Stanley the same person. This is your story and you will decide what to do with it. You can follow the voice of The Narrator (witch can be a protagonist or an antagonist, depending on your actions) or make your own way. There's a lot of endings (""Normal"" ending, The Nuclear Explosion Ending, The Crazy Stanley Ending, The Adventure Line Ending, The Escape Ending, The ""You Actually Made A Choise"" Ending, The Death Of Stanley Ending, The Space Ending, The Serious Ending, The Story Of Stanley And His Wife Ending, The ""But Stanley Couldn't Force Himself"" Ending, The ""I'm Sick Of This Gag"" Ending, The ""I'm Not Sick Of This Gag"" Ending, The Stanley Heaven Ending (this one is quite awesome, buttons everywhere :D), The WhiteBoard Ending and The ""Since You Don't Like This Game, Let's Try Another One"" (This one has a total of three posibilities: The one where the narrator takes you directly to the ""baby game"", the one that, before he takes you to his game, he takes you to Minecraft and Portal and the one that, while you are in Portal, you can walk to the elevator, fall on it and actually step in the original ""The Stanley Parable"" mod game). I don't know if i forgot some, but for me, it's a total of 18 endings (counting the multiple possibilities of the ""Don't like this game"" ending). I also don't know if all of then are right, i don't remember they correctly, but i'm certain that THEY ARE in this game.The sound is actually...Well, there must be like 3 musics on the game. That's because the most important is The Narrator's voice. It remembers A LOT GLaDOS from Portal. Not just because it's actually pretty well done, but because it varies so much, sometimes he is just mocking with you, others, he just trying to help you. And this goes on and on...You never know when the narrator is your friend or your enemy, only your actions will change how he is with you and how you will like him or not.Gameplay is quite simple. You walk and interact. Most doors don't open, but there a quite few Easter Eggs through the scenarios that will only activate when you complety a certain action. Some achievements requires this. (Including one that's pretty obvious).Overall, great ""game"". Because, most people consider this a thing that it's different from a game. It's fun, it tricks with your mind, it has a lot of content hidden and, when you're done with, you still don't know how to describe this. That's the magic of this ""game"". It shows not only how videogames should be, but how with simply follow the orders that is given to us in gaming, instead of doing what we want. The freedom, paradox and immersion of this game is what it made it so special and so acclaimed by both the users and the critic. This is a 10/10 without doubt, a piece of art and maybe one of the best games i have ever played.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a very interesting. It tells some fantastic jokes, makes some self-indulgent commentary, but then it proceeds to get stranger and more intimate and less pointed and more interesting the more you poke at it. It isn't making fun of games for the sake of some self-appointed enlightened savior of gaming and it doesn't seem to be strange for the sake of strangeness.What makes Stanley Parable feel so fresh isn't the humor or the satire or the criticsm that's baked into it--those are enjyoable, but they weren't what impressed me. What makes it feel fresh is how intimately it converses with the player. I'm reminded very much of a game called Save the Date--though that was a smaller and simpler affair. Both games start with meta commentary and then submerge from there, talking carefully with you about how the narrator, creator or other characters think, feel and the ramifications of that for your behavior and your experience of the product. The secret of both of these games which drape themselves in the trappings of meta-narrative is that they do actually contain characters who you will learn about, be asked to empathize with, be asked to listen to, and be asked, after it all, to act on your conclusions should you have reached any.They are games that start with the nature of games, then the nature of reality, and then quietly, timidly, reveal that at their heart they are about the same intimacies and relationships as most intersting or moving stories. For all of the delightful jokes, strangeness, non-linearity and surreality of The Stanley Parable my most clear feeling when I stopped playing was one of loss; I had run out of ways to communicate with this person with whom I formed a relationship. I had run out of things to say and ways to prove I was listening.I was alone.			"

												The Stanley Parable will end; the Stanley Parable will never end. The Narrator will stop talking; the Narrator will never stop talkingMore Stanley, less StanleyFollowing the logic so far? If you are, you must be on some sort of medication.... and yes, this is the kind of logic that the Stanley Parable incorporates in it. The Stanley Parable is one of those games that make you go: “What the hell just happened?” Just like that time you somehow break the time continuum just by walking into a broom closet. The Stanley Parable is quite basic if you look at it from the outside, but if you dig deeper, then you’ll find some peculiar things. Like when you somehow get into a game that you have to save a baby from a fire by repeatedly pressing the same button that says ""8"". The whole game revolves mostly around the Narrator, who narrates/insults you in the game. (You Sherlock Holmes, you!) The Stanley Parable has what most games lack: choice: you can either follow the Narrator, or you can go against him to start a whole web of interesting events. When you do make these choices you get a great amount of odd happenings. Sometimes the most random things will happen that will make you fall out of your chair laughing, or things that will completely blow your mind and make you re-think life. Occasionally, you have to sit there for a moment just trying to ponder: “Did that just happen right now?”. Trust me; you’re going to get a lot of these moments from this game. The Stanley Parable is like that one guy who stands out of the group. It's just so... different. What makes the Stanley Parable so different from other games is that it takes you on a journey that will make you re-think the reality of the world. Overall: the Stanley Parable is an oddity of a game. The things you least expect may happen. So just watch out. The Stanley Parable ranges from being taunted by the Narrator all the way to getting smashed by piston platforms by random button pushing; the Stanley Parable is just a whole world of choices. It just matters on what choice YOU make. Just make sure you don’t set off a nuke on accident.Personal Gaming Score:9/10I recommend this game for those who want an interesting game to play, but not to those who want action, multiplayer games, or those who just don’t really want to “think”. Can your mind handle this game? If you think you can, or cannot but decide to get the game anyway, remember this little thing I learned:THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END…			"

												The Stanley Parable is, without any doubt, one of the best headaches I've ever had. Even though it's more of a self-telling short story than a video game, you'll have yourself shaking your head and chuckling every time you walk through it... because your walkthrough will change with the smallest decision. The Pros:· Great and entertaining narration will follow every step you take...· ... and every step you take feels surprisingly drastic, as something as little as going left or right will determine the way the story is told. · Every decision you make will spin its own web, making it a joy to replay as it will rarely be the same.· Asides from the light and humoristic narration, the game actually manages to adress some things we rarely think about, what gives you a unique sense of vulnerability even though not a single bullet will be shot or axe swung. You will have complete freedom, yet you're trapped from the very beginning.  The Cons:· Even though there are many different ways you can go, the options aren't limitless. There is no real reason to play through the game the exact same way multiple times.· Definately not for everyone. It's pure exploration that minimalises gameplay to simple environmental interactions with buttons and doors.The Looks:· The Stanley Parable runs on the Source Engine, and that shows... in a good way. The lighting and textures are phenomenal and soak you into the game's unique atmosphere that complements the entire story you get to tell. Final Verdict:Although it won't be for everyone, The Stanley Parable manages to suck you into its complexely simple story that is a joy to discover and rediscover differently the next time you play it. 8/10.

												The Stanley Parable is a bag of candy that seems almost endless. Seriously, every 30 seconds, ""Oh! Piece of candy"". Whether the ""candy"" is a brilliant easter egg, a well-constructed story element or whatever, it's great. Every path you take has a durastic affect on the outcome, each has it's own funny take on the path you've chosen. You have the choice to obey or disobey the narrator, who takes notice of you disobey him. But as I said at the beginning, this game is a bag of candy that seems almost endless. I got all the endings in 2 and  a half hours, and while it was a grand time, it was over quickly. The bag of candy had ran out. I knew every thing that was going to happen, nothing to suprise me after all the endings were found. Sure, going back to the endings would still be funny, but they wouldn't have the same puch they did on your first playthrough of them. You feel let down because this wonderful bag of candy which had the ""Rich neighborhood on Halloween candy"" now have ""From the depths of grandma's purse which makes you say,""How long has that been in there?""candy"". While I recommend you get this game, beware; You'll get what you wanted, but it won't last forever.			"

			Views: 85		

			The Stanley Parable a narrative lead story Available here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/ HomePage: http://www.stanleyparable.com/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your...		

	A parable is defined as a succinct story which illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles using analogy. The Stanley Parable is a narration based game told from a first person perspective .  Through the eyesof the main character, Stanley, you are taken on many bizarre, twistingadventures  narrated by sarcastic, hilarious inner dialogue that explore themeaning of life, and ferns though parables.	The gameplay is fairly basic.  As you progress through the levels, it offers choices that affect your current and future playthroughs. The level design is layer upon layer of rooms that seem to twist in on themselves to confuse your sense of direction and add to the story.  The story never trulyends, until the player decides it does. 	There is not a lot of depth in the game, but there is a lot of choice.  The story plus the narrations is entertaining, amusing, and charming, and wortha few hours of play through.  It plays on our natural curiosity, making us wonder what there is yet to discover.  The end is not the endThis is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												This game has me royally ♥♥♥♥ed up. Never have I ever played a game and been paralized in fear over my next action. It is not a game that scares you with jumpscares, but psycologically as you realize the game plays you the whole time. None of your actions are ever unplanned for. Much like the movie Stranger Than Fiction if anyone has played that. 10/10.			"

Seriously, Stanley PArable is funny and it's great to show off to house guests but not much content here.   It's so short, you probably can complete every scenario less than 2 HOURS. wink, wink.Oh yeah, definitely play the demo first before buying...because it's own unique scenario			"

												A clever examination of video-game narrative structure. Not really re-playable (unless you want to show it to other people — it's always great to see their reactions), and could use a little polish here and there (lines of dialogue getting cut off all of a sudden in specific circumstances), but overall it's pretty nice.In some ways, Portal 2 without the portal gun.

												personally i think the pricetag is a little high for the kind of game it is. but the game it's self is rather enjoyable as it has many endings and a host of choices. it also constantly breaks the 4th wall in a rather comical and entertaining way. while the game has some strong replay value it loses just as much to the fact that there's only so many options. i fully recomend the game for anyone with 15$ they need spending and a good indie game in their library or as a christmas or birthday gift for a close friend or anyone really. the stanley parable was a very good experience and one of few living examples of what is good in the world of gaming.

												I wanted to love this game, I really did. For the first hour, it seemed great!  In a couple of endings, like the Confusion Ending, each time the game was reset it would effect the next run. However, during other runs, this is not the case.  So after about 2 hours, it just got boring and repititive. I had completed practically every ending, and I see no reason to return to it. It was fun while it lasted, but not very replayable.I bought it for $3 when it was 80% off, so for that much it was probably worth it. But I couldn't imagine paying $15 for 2-3 hours of gameplay. If its on sale, I would recommend getting it. You will enjoy it for a few hours straight. But after, it will get boring and you'll probably have no reason to keep playing it.			"

												I am slightly conflicted about giving a negative review for this game. The game seems witty enough. There is a narrator and he does a wonderful job.However, there's not much to really do apart from walk around and listen to the narrator. The amount of content is severely lacking - you could 'finish' the game within 5 minutes, although it is meant to be played through more than once. The replayability, which is supposed to be one of the game's strong suits, eventually becomes a weakness. Once you've seen an ending, you may not want to bother seeing it again.The Stanley Parable reminded me of a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book, but choice alone does not lend itself very well to gaming. Interaction is what makes gaming different and fun, and the game has little interaction further than choosing which door to enter.I don't think The Stanley Parable lives up to all the praise that is heaped on it (mainly by critics). If you're going to get it, wait until it is heavily discounted. Or get Antichamber instead.			"

												If you like to rush through games to see how fast you can complete them, most of the humour, and in fact point, of The Stanley Parable will pass you by. On the other hand, if you like to explore every nook, cranny and option presented to you, you could do worse than pick it up. I'll say no more about it, because to talk about The Stanley Parable is to spoil it, but grab the demo to get a sample of the humour; don't worry about spoilers, because it has almost nothing to do with the actual game.

												It's been a while since a narrator in a game has made me laugh as much as this one has. He get's angry if you rush and cut him off mid-speech, I annoyed him so much by going in the broom closet that the next time I went to it, it had planks of wood nailing it shut. It makes you want to rebel but you can't control the game, it's not your game! highly enjoyable albeit quite short in its standard mode(listening to the narrator) play through, I haven't uncovered most of the secrets yet though so there is plenty to do! Really really enjoyable!			"

Nearly unexplainable!Although the game is so great, it's hard to describe, because it's great in its own way and maybe opening a new genre of video games. You just have to play it to feel its special atmosphere and the ""storyline"" that is complex, confusing, thought-provoking and awesome at once.Just try it, I can only recommend it.For those who want to know of it nevertheless: It's a game comparable with a tree. You follow a story, told by a narrator, but have choices at so many points, so that there's a big range of brach lines, which lead to so many endings. The unique thing is that the narrator tells you to do it one way, but you can do it differently and get dialogues about that too. During playing The Stanley Parable you identify the narrator's character more and more and often it's very funny.I hope you can imagine more now, I tried to spoiler as little as possible, have fun with the game. :) "

												The Stanley Parable is best described as a mind screw, but in a good way. In the game you play a character named, oddly enough named Stanley. Or do you? Is he game playing you? Are you playing YOU in the game or Stanley? This game goes so many ways and gives the player the choice to go and break the game. But even when you “break” the game it is still only a choice the game allows the player to make. The other important character in the game other than the player is The Narrator. He even calls himself that. He clams to have written the story, but he is just a part of the story like the player. Some excellent voice work brings this game to life and really plays with your head.

												The Stanley Parable is a very small game world that is, narratively, expansive. It is one of the many recent games that is more of an experience than a game. It is very short (all experriences can be had within a couple of hours), so the price-sensitive may wish to wait for a significant sale. Otherwise, you are in for a great ride that will have you saying ""whoa, no way!"" several times throughout. I picked this up, having been waiting for what seemed like eons for it to come out, without knowing what to expect. I left it with a huge smile on my face and hoping that there will be a more expansive experience based on this idea in the future. It deserves more depth and room to grow.Besides, where else will you find a game with an achivement to ""play for the entire duration of a Tuesday"" and ""don't play this game for five years""?			"

												I'm not sure I should be writing this review yet, because I'm not sure I've reached every ending yet. I think I've broken double digits? Whatever, not running a game into the ground hasn't stopped me before, so here it is!Buy it. Boom. Done. You need this game in your life. Because it's not just a game, but a story. And not a story like most first person shooters are stories, but it's a story that's 100% about player choice. Some of these choices are hilarious (the Confusion Ending, the Whiteboard Ending) while other result in your death (the Escape Ending, the Downstairs Ending); many of them find a way to re-route you to the beginning of the game, with minor cosmetic changes that leave you uncertain as to whether or not you're truly restarting.The game's primary draw has to be the narration. The VO is soothing, witty, full of emotion; it's also surprisingly complete, with many dialogues going on much longer than one would expect. The game is all about the joy of discovery, and the narration encapsulates this perfectly, as you can't wait to hear what he says next.Because of the nature of The Stanley Parable, it does get repetitive after a while. This is why it's best to set aside a full day (preferably a Tuesday) to play through everything at once, so the game can continuously update itself for you. It'll be a good day, I promise.			"

												At first, I was going to write a full-length (yes, even longer than this) and in-depth review about this game. Then I realised that it would be way too hard and complex to do, because this game isn't really a game. Totalbiscuit however did an amazing job trying to explain the very nature of this... game (see link below).The Stanley Parable is more of an interactive story than a game. Or, interactive stories, to be exact. The Stanley Parable consists of somewhat short stories (~20 minutes each), and the choices you make during gameplay affects the ending(s) you get. Because that is mostly what this game is all about; making choices. And yet, the choices you make, don't have that much of an impact, because it's all already planned out. Kevan Brightning does a truly amazing job voicing The Narrator, person, who tells you how story should continue and what you should do. I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant his voice acting is in this game; his voice and the way he plays out his lines are perfect. His voice acting is one of the most considerable factors why this game is so good.The job of this very unique masterpiece is to question everything. To question decisions, life, nature/linearity/plot of other games and the whole existence (of itself and others). Because that is what this game is also about; it is supposed to wake up some thoughts in you. To wake you up to think. To wake you up to things around you and how you're living. To wake you up to the fact, how much your choices actually have an impact on anything at all. To wake up any thought in you.I strongly, I repeat, STRONGLY recommend you to play at least the demo version of this game. It will give you at least some sort of an idea of this game. You can find the link below, but remember that the real version of this game is even better.So, as overall, this ""game"" is brilliant and it is also very unique, truly one of a kind. It is worth of the experience, and it is worth of the thoughts it should wake up in you. You should try this ""game"" yourself to understand the very nature of it. Because The Stanley Parable is something you can't explain verbally.RATING: 90/100-AsplodeLink to the Totalbiscuit's video:

												This game is awesome! I really like how it immerses you in the world of choices. This game doesn't take any particular skill, but it's very fun to play, and is very funny. The narrator is really good, graphics are good, and you can pretty much always make your own choices. Definatly reccomend getting it!			"

												If this was free, I think I would have enjoyed it more. Even though I bought this in the winter sale for £5, I kinda regret this purchase. I appreciated the philosophical concepts coupled with the humorous narrative but I just didn't find it very exciting. If you have a couple of hours though and have the money to spend guilt-free then give it a go. It's just not for everyone....			"

												Stanley Parable originally was a mod for original Half-Life 2, a story about a man Stanley who works in an office, his job is simple, press buttons, one day though his usual day gets interrupted, everyone goes missing...Stanley decides to explore.......And..that's all what I can really tell you..I don't want to go deeper into the game, I would spoil everything and by that I'd ruin everything.----------------------Stanley Parable is a unique experience which cannot be seen in any other game. It manages to give us a message and thoughts to think about related to games while not taking itself seriously. I was smiling throughout the entire game while still thinking about the game and the message it's trying to get across.  The best way to experience Stanley Parable is simply not reading about it, going into it blindly. That can be a big risk for many people. That's why there is an excellent demo which shows us what you could except while not showing anything from the actual game. Narration from Kevan Brighting is perfect, if it was any different narrator the experience simply wouldn't be the same.It's hard to write about Stanley Parable, it truly is. I don't want to spoil anything. If you're still not sure try out the demo mentioned before. "

Nearly unexplainable!Although the game is so great, it's hard to describe, because it's great in its own way and maybe opening a new genre of video games. You just have to play it to feel its special atmosphere and the ""storyline"" that is complex, confusing, thought-provoking and awesome at once.Just try it, I can only recommend it.For those who want to know of it nevertheless: It's a game comparable with a tree. You follow a story, told by a narrator, but have choices at so many points, so that there's a big range of brach lines, which lead to so many endings. The unique thing is that the narrator tells you to do it one way, but you can do it differently and get dialogues about that too. During playing The Stanley Parable you identify the narrator's character more and more and often it's very funny.I hope you can imagine more now, I tried to spoiler as little as possible, have fun with the game. :) "

												I'm not sure I should be writing this review yet, because I'm not sure I've reached every ending yet. I think I've broken double digits? Whatever, not running a game into the ground hasn't stopped me before, so here it is!Buy it. Boom. Done. You need this game in your life. Because it's not just a game, but a story. And not a story like most first person shooters are stories, but it's a story that's 100% about player choice. Some of these choices are hilarious (the Confusion Ending, the Whiteboard Ending) while other result in your death (the Escape Ending, the Downstairs Ending); many of them find a way to re-route you to the beginning of the game, with minor cosmetic changes that leave you uncertain as to whether or not you're truly restarting.The game's primary draw has to be the narration. The VO is soothing, witty, full of emotion; it's also surprisingly complete, with many dialogues going on much longer than one would expect. The game is all about the joy of discovery, and the narration encapsulates this perfectly, as you can't wait to hear what he says next.Because of the nature of The Stanley Parable, it does get repetitive after a while. This is why it's best to set aside a full day (preferably a Tuesday) to play through everything at once, so the game can continuously update itself for you. It'll be a good day, I promise.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a very small game world that is, narratively, expansive. It is one of the many recent games that is more of an experience than a game. It is very short (all experriences can be had within a couple of hours), so the price-sensitive may wish to wait for a significant sale. Otherwise, you are in for a great ride that will have you saying ""whoa, no way!"" several times throughout. I picked this up, having been waiting for what seemed like eons for it to come out, without knowing what to expect. I left it with a huge smile on my face and hoping that there will be a more expansive experience based on this idea in the future. It deserves more depth and room to grow.Besides, where else will you find a game with an achivement to ""play for the entire duration of a Tuesday"" and ""don't play this game for five years""?			"

												At first, I was going to write a full-length (yes, even longer than this) and in-depth review about this game. Then I realised that it would be way too hard and complex to do, because this game isn't really a game. Totalbiscuit however did an amazing job trying to explain the very nature of this... game (see link below).The Stanley Parable is more of an interactive story than a game. Or, interactive stories, to be exact. The Stanley Parable consists of somewhat short stories (~20 minutes each), and the choices you make during gameplay affects the ending(s) you get.

The Definitive Review of The Stanley ParableSo, I was browsing through the Stanley Parable community page, and I inevitably ended up coming across a number of reviews. To be honest, I was actually surprised at how many negative reviews it got, and not just a bit disturbed at how many people found those reviews “helpful.” After reading several of those reviews, I came to the conclusion that many gamers do not really understand The Stanley Parable or how to go about playing it. The first and most important thing I feel like I should address comes from the several reviews I read which stated how they “beat the game” in such a short amount of time, and how that made it not worth the money. The thing is, The Stanley Parable is not by any means a normal game. In fact, as many people have pointed out all over the place in a somewhat fanboyish fashion, it is not even really a “game” at all, in the familiar sense of the word. It is, in fact, exactly what it says it is: a parable. For those who don't really know what that is (don't be ashamed: I had to look it up, too), here's the definition, courtesy of the late Ms. Merriam-Webster: par·a·blenoun \ˈpa-rə-bəl\a short story that teaches a moral or spiritual lessonThe point is, you can't “beat” The Stanley Parable any more than you could beat a movie or a book. You can finish it, true. Once you've found every ending and heard every bit of dialogue, you can safely say that you've finished it; but there's no award at the end, no “Story Progress: 100%,” no achievement for finding all of the endings, nothing at all to say that you've “beaten” it. And besides, “beating” something implies that there was a challenge in the first place. The Stanley Parable isn't about any challenge; it's about exploration and discovery, along with some intriguing and entertaining psychological wizardry. Now I've talked about the “beat the game” part, I want to discuss the “length” of the game a bit. Basically, The Stanley Parable is short for a reason. Each ending probably takes no more than half an hour to reach, often less. If all the endings took even just one hour, let alone the multiple hours most modern game storylines last, nobody would have the patience or curiosity to start over and find out what happens if you do it a different way. In the end, The Stanley Parable may just not be for you. If you enjoy linear plot lines without pesky deviations and multiple endings, don't get it. If you don't have the patience to search for every possibly dialogue trigger, don't bother. If you get frustrated when you have to start something over, try something else. It's as simple as that. Think and research before you buy. If you wasted your money on The Stanley Parable, it's not because it failed to live up to your expectations, but because you did not know what to expect. Finally, here is my verdict on The Stanley Parable. An enthusiastic thumbs-up, ★★★★★, at least 94/100, whatever you want to call it; it is well-made, cleverly designed, and ingeniously implemented; the dialogue is involving, emotional, and filled with dry, quick-witted humor. In many ways it is very reminiscent of Portal – it was made in Source, after all. I absolutely love it, and I highly recommend it. Anyways, this was more or less a product of my boredom. I hope it was nevertheless helpful to some people. I did try to stay objective, except during that last paragraph, and I hope I succeeded in that. Enjoy your day, and enjoy The Stanley Parable. I know I do.			"

												The Stanley Parable feels a lot like the puzzle box from the Hellraiser series. Everytime you start at the same place. Depending on your actions you get different results. However, there is no real ending. No matter your choices, no matter how well you follow direction, or how rebellious, you will always end up at the same place. You will probably begin to feel a sense of hopelessness or frustration. You see, it's not called Stanley's Games, it's called The Stanley Parable.			"

												Very interesting game. Basically, there is not really any goal in this  game (apart from finding all the endings), speaking of which, that is what this game is based upon. Endings. How many endings can you find? I liked the concept, it's very interesting and the devs had some nice ideas for the many different paths you can take. This game certainly is not for everyone as some will be disapponited by it. If you want to get this game and were say expecting a... ""game"" I guess? Then don't get it? It's an interesting concept but not for everybody. You decide, I enjoyed it however.			"

												The first time I launched the Stanely Parable, the game actually broke within a minute or so and wouldn't let me continue, leaving me with a shell of a doorway and no escape, only to have myself become lodged inside of a half-closed door until the end of time. Then I tried it again and had a proper metafying experience as I was originally meant to. It lead me to consider what was even the game's doing and what was me somehow making everything break, etc.All that aside, awesome game if you're into exploring outside of the box experiences as well as a fair sense of humor. Similar to another 'experience' on steam called 'The Path', you get a clear sense of direction on what you're meant to do, and only when deciding you want to be a punk♥♥♥♥♥nay-sayer do you really find out what's what.TLDR;its a game where you can't lose :D			"

												This is one of those games where the more you research the game, the less you'll get out of it when you play it. In simple words, it's a game based on the choices you make in each run-through which result in one of the many powerful endings as you're being narrated by a male voice in your head. There are some detours you can make and the game does an impressive job in retaining some continuity with certain events, despite starting another run-through in the same session. I've enjoyed this game very much and would say it's one of my favorites.			"

												An absolutely awesome deconstruction of  a modern video game. Highly recommended for those who is looking for something unusual exciting and inspiring. The game reminds me Portal with it's esthetics, but the gameplay is quiet different. And be sure that it will surprise you much.If you like post-modern, grab this immidiately!			"

This game is a real fun experience and truth be told I still haven't seen all the endings and I've owned this game for awhile now. The gameplay, secrets you can find, the narrator, and endings make this game great and I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who wants to have some fun.			"

												Such a simple yet excellent game with a short but intriguing story and multiple fun endings so you can replay it. The narrator makes The Stanley Parable what it is, explaining every you do in the story, whichever end you take. This story is an adventure, it takes 1-2 hours to get most endings, so don't expect too much for your money, nonetheless I definitely recommend this masterpiece.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a short, open-ended indie game set in a mysteriously empty office building. You, Stanley, are guided through the building by a mysterious voice who claims to want to help you escape. Although this unseen narrator tells you where to go, you're under no obligation to listen to him, and choosing to take a different route will often result in hilarious responses. There are a number of different endings, all of which are interesting in their own way. While the game does get somewhat dull after a few playthroughs, the narration is fantastic and the experience overall enjoyable. $15 is perhaps a bit much to ask for this game, but I would recommend it if you can get it on sale.

You'll find this highly entertaining...Humor is a big part of this game, and the Narrator is the primary part of this game...I came to that conclusion when I tried to play it with my sound turned off...I lost interest in less than a minute...But with the volume on and listening to the Narrator, I actually enjoyed it, and got a good chunk of hours of fun out of it, and completing it.BTW: Getting the Impossible Achievement was a feat on its own.

												James stared at the blank text entry quadrangle trying to piece together his thoughts on The Stanley Parable.  He thought back at all the good times he had with Stanley, the Narrator, and The Adventure Line.  But a thought crossed his mind, is it really a game?  The setting, story and dialogue are all there (with quite high quality voice acting even!), but what of the gameplay?  Is the mere act of movement enough of a world and pushing buttons, gameplay?James then realized the obvious: it did not matter.  What is important is the same thing that is important in all other games, the experiance.  As James looked over the hour's played count for The Stanley Parable, he noticed that he had poured hours into it, much of which were spent joyously listening to the narrator's witty remarks.James recommends the game highly.

												A lot of people think that The Stanley Parable is a difficult game to describe, but I don't think it is that hard. It is a game about storytelling and player choice in video games. It is very aware of the fact that it is a video game, and there are many jokes about how games operate and the kinds of choices that you are allowed to make in them. As an avid story-based game player, I enjoyed the humor immensely. If this kind of meta-humor sounds at all interesting, go try out the demo. Even if you know you are going to buy the game, play the demo anyway because the content of the demo is not in the full game. Because this humor is really the core of the game, the more I tell you about the game, the less you will get out of it when you play it; it is best to discover everything for yourself. Therefore I want you to stop reading this review as soon as you are convinced to play the game. If you make it to the end and are still not convinced, then you and I have very different tastes and I don't know why you take my advice on anything entertainment related.A voice narrates your journey as you play as Stanley, an office worker who realizes that nobody is in the office building today. The narrator will tell you the path that Stanley took, but you are often free to try another path. The narrator will try to convince you to get back on track. At first he tries to rationalize why Stanley went the wrong way in the context of the story he is telling, but it doesn't take him long to break the fourth wall and address the player directly. There are many different branching paths in the game, but don't worry; the game starts back from the beginning when you get to the end of any of them.One of my favorite wall-breaking moments involved the broom closet above.The first time I played through, I tried to open every single door I came across. When the broom closet unexpectedly opened, I went inside. The narrator said, ""Stanley went into the broom closet, but seeing that there was nothing in there he turned around and got back on track."" So I did.The second time I went into the broom closet again, and the narrator said, ""Seriously? I'm not even going to narrate this for you. Just do whatever it is you think is worth going into a broom closet for, and then let's get back to the story. I can wait.""The third time the broom closet was boarded up. I laughed for a good 30 seconds.There were of course the mandatory jokes about office life, and how pointless meetings can be.If you defy the narrator enough times in one play through, the game world will start to deteriorate and the narrator will panic. That was a really fun thread.There is also a museum about the game and the creation of the game within the game. That was probably the most meta moment in the game.Then there was the time that the narrator tried to improve the game by adding more choices and global leader boards. He even decided to show you some other games that he did not make, namely Minecraft and Portal.Most of these are very silly, but some were much more serious and/or philosophical. In one Stanley thought he was in a dream, because that was the only explanation he could think of for all of the video game logic (he couldn't see his feet, the doors automatically closed behind him, etc.) In another Stanley died.Achievement hunting in The Stanley Parable is an absolute riot. Only a couple of the achievements are obtained through traditional means. Others are found in the main menu, or require you to exit the game and come back to it, or play throughout a Tuesday. Yeah, they're pretty intense.Seriously, you should go get The Stanley Parable, it will be the best two hours of your day. Even if you think the $15 price tag is too much for such a short game, you should at least check out the demo. You won't regret it.			"

												""Stanley walked through the RED door""-the NarratorI originally saw my favorite Youtuber named Markiplier play this game way back when it was a HL2 mod,then last year a stand-alone version of it was released on SteamAfter playing it myself,I can say that I love this game or at least the idea behind it(even tho I managed to beat it the same day I got it)The plot: There really isn't a""plot""since you can sort of make your own plot with all the possible endings the game gives you,but it mainly revolves around a man named Stanley who suddenly stops receiving commands from his computer,and as he wanders around the office(along with the Narrator who(somewhat)guides him),he notices some strange things happeningIn the game you don't necessarily have to listen to the Narrator,and in fact you can just completely ignore his directions altogether and go on your own path,or while you're letting him guide you,you can go on your own path,all of these things open up so many different possible endings,some of which I still haven't discovered yet.The music in this game is really good,especially that one piece of ambiance that plays in the beginning in Stanley's office and the music that plays while you're on the Adventure Line.The characters are really good,especially the Narrator with the funny dialogue he has.The different endings in this game were probably one of the best parts of the game because of the cool ideas behind them,especially the""Break The Game""ending(which I consider to be the true ending)Some of these endings were hilarious while some others just screw with your mind.(and in some cases,both)If you like games like Portal that are hilarious,but at the same time,mind-boggling,this is the game for you10/10 from me :)			"

But it was overall a good experience, and you could choose the way you want to go. Don't follow the narrators voice, rebel and go your own way, you'll never know what you will run into. Heh.			"

This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ METAPHYSICAL UNIVERSE THAT YOU WILL INHABIT. YOU WILL BE STANLEY. I WILL BE STANLEY. This game is not up for debate, this game IS the debate. To even call it a game is almost an insult. This experience is a mind-breaker.

Clever writing, superb narration and meaningful satire prop up an otherwise weak game.As I sit here mulling over the meaning behind The Stanley Parable's parables I'm dismayed to find an overall depressing and pessimistic undercurrent. After playing all endings except the ""Art Ending,"" I look at the big picture and it seems to me that the game is saying something along the lines of ""Follow all of 'The Narrator's' commands or else something bad will surely happen to you."" ""The Narrator"" being interchangeable with ""The Man"" or God or any authority figure. Even the ""Heaven Ending"" is twisted, albeit humorously, to be unappealing to the player.At a more surface level The Stanley Parable is parodying modern life, particularly work life, as well as video games themselves. It is here that the game shines and earns the praise it's received. I appreciate the jabs it takes at the mindless routines that consume much of our lives. Getting us to see our faults while simultaneously making us laugh is this game's greatest strength. However, as I stated in the previous paragraph, what happens within the game when you try to break out of the preset path seems to discourage the very same type of action that the game's satire encourages. This makes for a muddled message that makes me question the clarity and depth of the game. Perhaps I'm focusing too much on the real life issues when they meant it to be foremost a critique of modern game design where you often can't deviate substantially from the narrow narrative path.Excellent voice acting and witty comedy make the first few hours with the game very enjoyable. The way the game is designed to be replayed many times to explore different choices ultimately catches up with it as the repetition grows stale. To be fair, they did a lot to mitigate this by speeding up certain sections or by changing up what the Narrator says in successive playthroughs. It took me 5 hours to complete nearly everything the game has to offer (excluding 1 ending that requires 4 hours of ridiculous tedium). That time includes a significant amount of repetition and a short time on the web checking for any endings or achievements I had missed. Being that short I can't call this a good value for your gaming dollar. 6/10 and a weak ""thumbs up.""			"

												It's pretty hard to tell what's this game about. Let me try not to spoil it for you... Well...This is a game about the honorable knight of a modern century. Stanley uses his power of thought to fight against the realms of forgotten human fears. The fears all of us have. Almost all of us. Stanley isn't afraid of our mere troubles, they're way too small for his thoughtful brain. He is a hero.Oh, the game, right. It takes place in space, where Stanley fights against demons disguised as giant stars. They will try  to seduce him, but we all know that this is impossible. Stanley cannot be controlled. He's the one controlling. He saves people and planets just on his own. Entire universe is fighting against him, but he will manage to strike back. He's a hero after all.But Stanley isn't one of the shining armor knights riding a white horse. He's close to our human beings. He has feelings. He sleeps, he laughs, he coughs, he frightens, he washes floors for free being a nice generous guy. See? He's just like you and me. He will never  give up trying to prove to this world being a perfect person who deserves this title.Levels? Who need them? The game runs perfectly well using two maps with giant attention to detail. Every piece of paper has it's own unique messages about Stanley being awesome. Every single chair has a bubblegum attached underneath. Even more: each gum has it's own flavor! Real revolution in game design will let you feel to be there, with Stanley.The story adjusts to your game style! It may be either fast-paced or slow walk on a park. Or maybe you will run across that park with bunch of sharks on your tail. Stanley doesn't have a tail like most of us. Another similarity! You're pretty much alike with Stanley! Except he does what he wants.But this game is not about what Stanley wants. This game is about what you want. You want to get another game where you play as a wizard,  because you want to be one, but simply can't. You want a game where you play as someone better than you. A game, where you can escape your daily routine and dive into a thriling adventure you will never get in your boring life. Stanley doesn't need neither you nor me nor anyone else. His story is perfect and complete.But you want to see it in action. Let all those puppets dance just for you. You were not even paying attention to what I was saying. It's a human nature to be maximally boring and minimally paying any attention to the matter of facts. I bet you can't wait to finish reading this very review to post a comment about both grammatical mistakes I've made, or maybe even about double spaces. Why are you reading this then? Most of you has already played the game and read this just to find some person to mock up because of his writing or spelling skills. Because none of you make mistakes. You're all perfect. Like Stanley is.			"

 Review of The Stanley Parable I simply love this game. I love the narator and I love the story or shoud I say stories in this game. It's brilliant how you can f**k with the narrator's story and how he can f**k with you back. There are so many easter eggs to figure out and had a blast doing it. I really wish it was longer. Developers, If by any chance you are reading this please make the game at a scale of 10-15 hours. I would seriosly play 60€ for this, as this game puts a smile on my face like no other . Yes it is short, but I loved the genius put into this. Buy this game guys! Overal this isn't a 10/10 for gameplay, but a 10/10 for story and entertainment.			"

												Stanley is just an average guy with an average job, doing what he's been told. That is until he one day discovers that his coworkers have dissapeared. Confused and curious he begins to search the office for answers, while being narrated throughout his journey. But unfortunately for Stanley, the more he finds out, the more confused he becomes.""The Stanley Parable"" is an exploration of story, games, and choice (via thestanleyparable.com), It's a first person game where you play Stanley, leading him through his journey for answers. As the story goes by, Stanley is presented to different choices, and as he makes different choices during the game, the story develops in different ways.""The Stanley Parable"" explores a world with choices and consequenses. The fact that there's a ""narrator"" narrating Stanley's exploration might indicate that Stanley either is insane or maybe even that he doesn't have a real choice at all. The game is catchy and has quite a few ""What ifs"" that makes the player want to take a different path every time they play the game 10/10			"

It's really an fantastic storydriven experience. Well, entirely storydriven (Yes, there is gameplay. It's not quite an interactive movie... well it is... but it isn't... Look it's hard to explain, just go buy it.)MY POINT IS. This game is in my top 10 of the year, just for the sheer entertainment value I got from it. Wonderful voice acting, funny story, and a surprising amount of gamer culture critique hidden within it. I wholeheartedly recommend it.			"

Posted: January 17, 2014
												One of the best games of this decade, ""The Stanley Parable"" brilliantly makes of self reflection a raison d'être. More than introspection we should probably talk about what we can call ""self extrospection"".The game's self extrospection is favored by making the player bring up and reflect over all of those things that he (or she) considers being implicitly existing in some formats (that a videogame can be beaten, that there are good and bad choices to make, that enviromental interaction gives positive feedbacks, et cetera), and, on the base of those reflections, pushes him to consider the meaning of such conventions, their real value and, with a more distant perspective, his own relation to them and his acceptance of rules in general. One of the central arguing points of the game is that the player, by systematically trying to apply the same mechanics he is usually applying to videogames in order to achieve the results he is used to achieve, is substantially growing accustomed to mechanically do the same thing over and over, without demanding anything extra-ordinary (uncommon) of himself nor leaving any space for free reflection. ""Stanley [...] has a job that demands nothing of him, and every button that he pushes is a reminder of the inconsequential nature of his existence. Look at him there: pushing buttons, doing exactly what he's told to do. Now, he's pushing a button. Now, he's eating lunch. Now, he's going home; now, he's coming back to work. One might even feel sorry for him, except that he's chosen this life."" As Stanley is not questioning the repetitiveness of his job so the player might not be questioning certain patterns that he is automatically following in his gameplay sessions; in The Stanley Parable these patterns are usually bringing the player to look for something that he's used to get in other games, only to end up getting it in a very ridiculing form ( just think of the competitive leaderboards and the achievements ).In most of the cases, by giving the players exactly the contrary to what they wanted from the game, The Stanley Parable pushes the player to obtain a sort of third person self analytical perspective (even intensified in one of the endings in which  the game ends with a third person view on Stanley incapable of making a choice ), the so called (by me) ""self extrospection"", in which he is asked to reflect on the nature of his impulsive attractions or behaviours. The arising questions and the following thoughts are many: is what the players are looking for something really worth to look for, or are they just grown accustomed to have it and therefore they're feeling its absence when it's not given to them? But it is only when this perspective is moved to other entertainment forms, which are also demanding nothing of people and just drench them with a shower of positive or shocking stimuli, that we can really start to question the level of free will that we possess; as Gustave Le Bon writes in his book ""The Crowd – A Study of the Popular Mind"": ”It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of crowds that it can be understood [...] how powerless they are to hold any opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them and what seduces them.” How much are we automatically doing because we've been pushed to grow accustomed to it? Are we laughing at a video where someone crashes with a motorbike because it is really funny and not at all unethical, or are we doing that to relief some of our personal frustrations by watching someone else failing? ""Yes, it's all very amusing. And we laugh and we call our friends over and they laugh too and soon the whole world laughs and laughs and laughs at the man who failed. [...] But [...] you, sitting there: what have you gained watching this video? What have you learned?"" And if we do it because of the frustrating monotony of our life, why are we then allowing the frustration to latently exist? Are we so accustomed to our life as it is that we're scared of doing any changes? How many non-influenced choices are we making? What's the worth of those choices? Stanley might be starting to understand all of this: ""in and amongst his aimless meandering, I think he is actually beginning to discover something: he is getting closer to  an answer, an explaination, an exit. He is beginning to earn his freedom"", but he is a videogame character bound to narrative limits and cannot escape his own story. He is Stanley and can only be Stanley. But what about us? ""Now, if I could truly put you in his shoes, to show you the paths he walked and the choices he made.. [...] soon you will be the one to walk: the controls will be in your hands. [...] Oh, I think I'm going to enjoy this. When you find out how alone you truly are.. I will be laughing more than anyone.""Is this a time in which we should break the old entertaining clichés of the videogame medium and release some of its pedagogical potential? Afterall ""men never shape their conduct upon the teaching of pure reason"" as Le Bon writes, and we can deduce that they learn by empirically experiencing reality. But if the virtuality is empirically making them experience and hate their own reality, isn't that potentially a formative experience? Is this then a case in which ""ludus est magister vitae""?Well, it's certainly worth a thought.The Stanley Parable Personal ReviewRenzo ""Stermayer"" Arcuri			"

												To describe anything about the game, that is to describe any scene that is going on in the game, any moment that stood out to me would be telling you too much. It would be too big a spoiler, no matter how insignificant the scene might seem. For nothing is really insignificant in the Stanley Parable. A butterfly flaps its wings and creates a hurricane, Stanley does something and chaos ensues.You can follow the narrator, or you can disobey him and watch what happens. What does happen would be a spoiler, however it leads to both hilarious dialogue and at the same time, somehow, without sacrificing comedy, it manages to make you think things over. It manages to question the nature of choice and free will. Are you truly free to do anything in the Stanley Parable? After all, the game has been predetermined, hasn't it? It has been built by a developer, and as such as a finite number of endings... But that's the thing, it never seems to end. Even after playing it for four hours straight, I had only found what, 7 endings? And I'm sure there's more to find, since I only explored the endings from the choices you were given, and I am told there are 18.Speaking of the narrator, you thought GLaDOS was good? This is basically GLaDOS on steroids. His voice is soothing, he is well written, and he has the right amount of intonation into everything he says, every line is delivered to perfection.The only complaint I could possibly have about the game is that it's on the short side, but that's good. It's like the original Portal, its length means that it doesn't overstay its welcome and that it keeps everything fresh.If I had to give it a number, I'd give it a solid 10 out of 10.			"

												The Stanley Parable is an amazingly funny exploration game, with many different endings. It continually breaks the rules of video games in the most creative ways, and it manages to do this without becoming tedious or boring.Every individual ending is a completely different experience, from trying to defuse a bomb, to being lectured about the importance of your choices, to playing through different video games, all leaving you shocked and surprised as you play. You can never truly see what is going to happen.This, along with the excellent voice acting of the narrator makes an experience you wouldn't want to miss!The only downside, is that the game does not have much replay value, as once you have experienced an ending, you will never get the same feeling of surprise.Final Score: 9/10			"

												The Stanley Parable is just one of those games which people either really like or really dislike; some may feel that they can't do much except freely roam around and listening to a guy talk. However, its beauty lies in the fact that it's entirely oriented about choice. It has some clever humor, and it is generally the type of game where you HAVE to try every single stupid action you can think of, in order to get a reaction from the narrator.Even if it's a bit short, The Stanley Parable is a great game. If you intend on buying it, I suggest that you try to learn the least possible about it or its story. I would also suggest to play the demo before buying the game (even if you are sure about your decision) : it will help you see if you like that kind of game or not, and it will also provide a good introduction to the actual game if you're going to buy it.The Stanley Parable is also best played with other people. and it requires a basic, general knowledge of first person video gaming in order to fully get its humor, in some moments.Have fun!

												lol...i find this game irrationaly ammusing, even though i have no hour's into it i plan on playing it for the ammusement, and no matter what the haters say i give this game a thumbs up, not because of graphich or playability...but because of the ammusement, the plot of this game is to ignore the dialouge guy and do the opposite of what he says. 5 minutes into the game i lept of the playform after i took the right door instead of the left and the Dialogue speaker complemented me with the comment in a very **sarcastic tone of voice**''Stanley finally decided that he was in control and wasn't going to let anyone tell him what to do he lept off the platform to end his life. we all think your powerful stanley""The game has its cons and pros, but beware those looking for a mystery type or intense storyline game wont find it here, go play another game. this a game for this looking to just spend the day and have a little laugh.

												If you know a little bit about the Half-Life 2 modding scene, you may have heard of ""The Stanley Parable"", a critically acclaimed experiment by Davey Wreden from 2011. The free mod explores the theme of storytelling in video games: How does it work in this medium, when a player can determine what the character does, unlike the audience to a movie? How free can they be in their choices?Wreden has turned his (still recommendable) mod into a full game. Or, rather, ""full"" game, indie-style. Even when exploring every possible option, only 3 - 6 hours are what you can expect to get for your money (I have read of people spending more time on the game, but they may be revisiting the same places a lot more than me).But wait, what IS this thing anyway? The (new) Stanley Parable takes its model from the mod and expands it with more scenes. The main character Stanley works a dull office job, but one day he suddenly finds himself all alone in the complex and sets out to find out what happened. Stanley is played in classical FPS perspective, minus the gun. The special twist is that there is a narrator that accompanies him wherever he goes. The narrator makes sense of what Stanley encounters and tells the player what they are to do next. Whether you listen to him or not is entirely up to you - if you want to discover all that the game holds, it's even recommendable to not do everything he asks of you.According to your choices, Stanley will live, die, end up very confused, get stuck, have to sacrifice hours of his life in the service of art incarnate, ... I won't spoil it any further - the game is chock-full of wonderfully creative and funny ideas. Even going through the same area multiple times can reveal different things. If you like to explore, be surprised, prod at things to see what'll happen, or just goof around, this might be a game for you.Minor criticism: The mod's theme was quite clearly defined. This version is pretty much all over the place - while it is fun to play, I cannot really find a red line. Oh well. It taught me some things about myself, maybe that counts.Additional note: It's possible to create savegames, but that option is off by default. You need to activate it in the settings.			"

												A narrative experience like no other. You will no longer need sleep, instead you will think about Stanley, think about the meaning of modern videogames and ultimately start pondering over life itself. If you like food for your thoughts, this is a 12 course meal with dessert and free ice cream, it's simply that good. Don't rob yourself from one of the post narrative games in existence, join Stanley and the Narrator on an adventure and have your mind blown over 8888 times on this epic journey. When you're done, you can (and should BY ALL MEANS) start over again and choose a new branching path, ending and mind blowing experience.9.5/10  - More fun than I've had with any other game of this decade.

												The Stanley Parable is an interesting game, it shows you that set tracks arent always fun, that a set story is not always captivating. It's for gamers that just want to fill spare time, its humor can entertain the few who understand the story as they play it, and for people like me, it shows a deeper meaning that i can really understand. At points in the game if you go off track the Narrator will judge you and tell you that he has writen a story for you to play and that he should never have done those things, which is what most games do, they give you a path to follow and forces you to try again if you dont do it properly by killing you or placing an invisable wall infront of you, all in all making a boring game. damn rants get to me, if you like a game with humor then you'll love this, if you love a game with an interesting story you'll love this game, if you love paper you'll love this game. this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game will make you love this game.

												Oh lord, what can be said about this game? The Stanley Parable is a gem, it really is. It's one of those games filled to the brim with sublte mystery and -fantastic- narration. Every path you take delivers witty dialogue, clever jokes, and an all-around, genuinely good time. As far as replayability is concerned, well, technically that's what this game is about--you've just got to find all the secrets and endings scattered around here and there, hoping to find something new, testing things you haven't tested before--pushing you to limits of clicking on just about everything--still, once you find satisfaction, picking up this game again might be challenging. For instance, I won't be playing this game for another five years in order to get a certain achievement, and no, I won't be resetting my clock to do so.			"

I recommend to anyone that wants to play this game to try and do as much as you can alone and then when you're completely stuck on what to do and where to go next, only then, to look at the guides for anything cool that you might have missed out.

												First of all, before purchasing the Stanley Parable, you should understand that this is only a ""game"" in the loosest sense, and you'll probably either love it or you just won't ""get"" it. You walk around, you occasionally press the ""use"" button on buttons and doors, and that's just about it. If you've tried Dear Esther or Gone Home, you can imagine that kind of experience, but where those games were far more serious and ""artsy,"" The Stanley Parable is... something else. I don't want to spoil anything, and you should play the demo or watch the trailers to get an idea of the game's tone and the outstanding voice work of Kevan Brighting, if nothing else. That said, I loved every minute of the Stanley Parable, and though it is extremely short, there are multiple endings that all take the game in a completely different direction. If you want to laugh out loud, this is the game for you. Once you've seen everything there is to see, the game doesn't offer much replay value, but this is not an experience to be missed.			"

												I have maintained the notion for a number of years that video games are pieces of art, just as viable as books, paintings, and sculptures--in some ways more so.  There are games that are eyeball-poppingly beautiful, of course, and games that make your brain cells implode--looking at you, Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite--but I have never before found a game that really made the player delve into their own psyche, a game that surpassed the boundaries of common narative functions and made the player the true star of the show.Thus enters this little game.  What can you do?  Walk around.  Sometimes, you interact with an object or two.  The only other being present is the brilliantly voiced narator.   Mostly, you walk, listen, walk some more, and listen some more.But, oh, that's the beauty of it.  Forget ""gaming"" mechanics, forget all the bells and whistles.  This game exists to get in your mind, where all the real action occurs.  It is a stunningly deep and riotously funny condiut for some of the most incredible glimpses of human nature I've had the pleasure of witnessing--via game or other media.  The Stanley Parable is a wonderful play for anyone with a sense of humor and a pension for self-examination.  This is a game about you--your importance, and your dispensibility, but even more so, about... well, I can't really say, lest I run the risk of spoiling the fun.  Pick this gem up.  10/10.			"

I'm not even kidding with this recommendation. 9/10.It's only missing one point because some endings are extremely cryptic (and who knows if there are any more still to be discovered?) and I honestly expected a LOT more from the game.

												The Stanley Parable is quirky. Well, maybe quirky isn't the write word...witty? Ah, no, that doesn't seem right...It's a story. That's it! It's Stanley's story. It's the story of a man who works a job and who suddenly finds himself in the middle of a walking simulator.There are not many gameplay elements to The Stanley Parable. You really do spend your time walking, and maybe interacting a few times. The focus, rather, is on the humour and narrative of The Narrator, who will attempt to dictate your actions. Choice is a very big factor in this game, and you can choose to follow him or to be a rebel and go against his wishes. The Narrator's reactions are varied enough to make each walkthrough feel unique, and it's a joy to hear some of the wit and tongue-in-cheek meta humour written into the game itself. There are many endings, so replayability is quite good. Surprisingly, there was a rather dramatic moment in one of the endings, but for the most part this is a humorous game.I recommend purchasing this, as the writing alone is fantastic, and it is boosted by the wonderful voice acting.  If you're not into ""walking sims"", this may be a bit hard to get through for you, but the writing itself may take some of the edge off if it's your kind of humour. The price tag might be a little hefty for this kind of game, however it is well worth it if you can get it. As always, sales are the best so definitely pick it up on sale.Finally, there's a demo on Steam. What better way of finding out if it's for you than trying it out yourself? :)			"

“This is a story of a man named Stanley”  Premise  In The Stanley Parable, the player takes on the role of a man simply named Stanley. Stanley’s job is just as simple as his name: an average everyday office worker. The only thing that sounds more boring than Stanley’s job and name, are his job requirements: press certain buttons as directed by a computer monitor. But don’t let this boring premise deter you from this game, it’s brilliant beyond measure.Despite sounding mindless, Stanley has a passion for his boring office job. Such a mindless passion, that when the orders stop coming in for him to press buttons from the monitor, he waits an entire hour beginning to question the lack of instruction. It’s this lack of instruction that causes Stanley to become self aware for the first time in his career (and possibly his life), and drives the beginning of the game. It also helps him notice other strange occurrences around the office and makes him ask questions. Where did my co-workers go? Did I miss a memo? Stanley finally has to make his own choices. He has to speak up. He has to think on his own. Where to I walk? What do I interact with? Stanley had been shielded from independent thinking his entire life it appears, all thanks to a computer monitor always telling him what to do. The choices and the independent thinking are where the finally player comes in, and where the excitement of the game is found. Or more accurately, the lack of choice is where the amusement is found. Mwahahahah. Ahem, carrying on.  Bulk of Review  Choices (and the lack of) are undoubtedly the cause of entertainment and humor in this game, but it’s the way these choices go hand-in-hand with the witty commentary that makes this game truly amusing. Wait, commentary? What commentary? I think it's a point of emphasis that I mention this a narration-driven game. When Stanley finally gains awareness, a narrator begins to narrate Stanley’s story audibly, remarking his thoughts and actions. The narrator is the one who woke up Stanley from his mindless slumber in the first place. He decides of what happens in the story just as much as the player does. Scratch that-- the narrator is an all powerful omnipotent being who limits the player in every thinkable way possible. That’s the point of the game in a nutshell.The thrill of the game is toying with the soothing narrator, who comments on every action and choice the player makes, or for that matter, refuses to make. The narrator not only makes comments, but directs and eventually commands Stanley to go down certain passageways and up certain staircases. He wants to control Stanley as much as you yearn to rebel against him. The true amusement is resisting and compromising with the narrator when he directs you to go down a hallway or through a door. In essence, that is the idea of the game. The struggle for control between the narrator of you and you-- No, not this door, I’ll go through this hallway instead. The narrator’s frustration and responses with his own character is hilarious and the most thought out part of this game.The game has very little visual feedback and reinforcement, which can be it’s downfall and it’s strength depending on the person. In most cases, I’d call it a strength. The player can only interact with a handful of objects, which are limited to doors, computers and buttons. This is what makes The Stanley Parable a breath of fresh air. For the first time in my gaming experience, a game relies on the majority of it’s feedback being audible instead of visual. That’s a strikingly new concept despite how simple it is to implement and carry out. If you like the Portal franchise or puzzle games like Antichamber, The Stanley Parable is comparable to a good mix of both, while still maintaining it’s own personality as a video game. The witty commentary and it’s amusement that comes with it draws an easy parallel between Portal and The Stanley Parable. If you like GLaDOS’s company, the game will do a excellent job of keeping you entertained. This game best caters to those who are willing to question everything in the room, and have an eye for patterns and details. The game has a total of 18 different endings depending on how you and the narrator get along, and how well you can think for yourself despite having limited alternatives to what the narrator says.  Some Criticism  So what is this game lacking? Choice. Despite the fact lack of choice is one of the key features of the game, it’s nonetheless a bit too limited. The vast majority of doors go unlocked and sometimes the player feels very forced into complying with the narrator. Of course, it’s worth noting the game itself is a analysis on the state of choice in video games. In video games as a medium, we are often more limited with our choices than we care to admit. The Stanley Parable makes light of this. We tend to accept the premise prematurely often too much. We blindly accept the number of choices that are presented, are the number of choices there are. Even with that being the case, the game needs more endings. 18 endings is great, but I feel there is a perfect threshold for this game to capture so it can still make it’s point about the lack of choice, and have more choice. Perhaps I’m sour I’ve completed the game and found all the endings, but hey, who wouldn’t want to rebel against an omnipotent soothing narrator a little more?  Conclusion  Currently, The Stanley Parable goes for a decent $15 on Steam. At best, it will give you 7 hours of gameplay if you’re sure to analyze every detail. For the average player however, 3 hours is what’s expected. Due to the nature of the game, it’s a rainy day experience. And while it has brilliant commentary and thought-provoking critique on the nature of choice in video games, $15 is a bit much for a day’s worth of entertainment. I’d strongly recommend waiting for a sale, but if you love Portal and soothing voices, I can empathize if you can’t.A Fair Recommendation - 8.7/10 "

												I have maintained the notion for a number of years that video games are pieces of art, just as viable as books, paintings, and sculptures--in some ways more so.  There are games that are eyeball-poppingly beautiful, of course, and games that make your brain cells implode--looking at you, Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite--but I have never before found a game that really made the player delve into their own psyche, a game that surpassed the boundaries of common narative functions and made the player the true star of the show.Thus enters this little game.  What can you do?  Walk around.  Sometimes, you interact with an object or two.  The only other being present is the brilliantly voiced narator.   Mostly, you walk, listen, walk some more, and listen some more.But, oh, that's the beauty of it.  Forget ""gaming"" mechanics, forget all the bells and whistles.  This game exists to get in your mind, where all the real action occurs.  It is a stunningly deep and riotously funny condiut for some of the most incredible glimpses of human nature I've had the pleasure of witnessing--via game or other media.  The Stanley Parable is a wonderful play for anyone with a sense of humor and a pension for self-examination.  This is a game about you--your importance, and your dispensibility, but even more so, about... well, I can't really say, lest I run the risk of spoiling the fun.  Pick this gem up.  10/10.			"

												Is it a game. Is it not a game. All you need to know is you are stanley, or are you.  You work in an office, or do you. All you coworkers have gone missing, or have they.  The stanley parrable is an amazing game that means something different to everyone so I highly recomend that everyone play it so they find out what it means to them. The stanley parable constantly pokes fun at the player for exspecting more out of something and at the idea of vidoe games in general. With excelent diolouge and a perfectly excecuted concept the stanley parable is a must have game 9.5/10			"

												One of the best games of this decade, ""The Stanley Parable"" brilliantly makes of self reflection a raison d'être. More than introspection we should probably talk about what we can call ""self extrospection"".The game's self extrospection is favored by making the player bring up and reflect over all of those things that he (or she) considers being implicitly existing in some formats (that a videogame can be beaten, that there are good and bad choices to make, that enviromental interaction gives positive feedbacks, et cetera), and, on the base of those reflections, pushes him to consider the meaning of such conventions, their real value and, with a more distant perspective, his own relation to them and his acceptance of rules in general. One of the central arguing points of the game is that the player, by systematically trying to apply the same mechanics he is usually applying to videogames in order to achieve the results he is used to achieve, is substantially growing accustomed to mechanically do the same thing over and over, without demanding anything extra-ordinary (uncommon) of himself nor leaving any space for free reflection. ""Stanley [...] has a job that demands nothing of him, and every button that he pushes is a reminder of the inconsequential nature of his existence. Look at him there: pushing buttons, doing exactly what he's told to do. Now, he's pushing a button. Now, he's eating lunch. Now, he's going home; now, he's coming back to work. One might even feel sorry for him, except that he's chosen this life."" As Stanley is not questioning the repetitiveness of his job so the player might not be questioning certain patterns that he is automatically following in his gameplay sessions; in The Stanley Parable these patterns are usually bringing the player to look for something that he's used to get in other games, only to end up getting it in a very ridiculing form ( just think of the competitive leaderboards and the achievements ).In most of the cases, by giving the players exactly the contrary to what they wanted from the game, The Stanley Parable pushes the player to obtain a sort of third person self analytical perspective (even intensified in one of the endings in which  the game ends with a third person view on Stanley incapable of making a choice ), the so called (by me) ""self extrospection"", in which he is asked to reflect on the nature of his impulsive attractions or behaviours. The arising questions and the following thoughts are many: is what the players are looking for something really worth to look for, or are they just grown accustomed to have it and therefore they're feeling its absence when it's not given to them? But it is only when this perspective is moved to other entertainment forms, which are also demanding nothing of people and just drench them with a shower of positive or shocking stimuli, that we can really start to question the level of free will that we possess; as Gustave Le Bon writes in his book ""The Crowd – A Study of the Popular Mind"": ”It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of crowds that it can be understood [...] how powerless they are to hold any opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them and what seduces them.” How much are we automatically doing because we've been pushed to grow accustomed to it? Are we laughing at a video where someone crashes with a motorbike because it is really funny and not at all unethical, or are we doing that to relief some of our personal frustrations by watching someone else failing? ""Yes, it's all very amusing. And we laugh and we call our friends over and they laugh too and soon the whole world laughs and laughs and laughs at the man who failed. [...] But [...] you, sitting there: what have you gained watching this video? What have you learned?"" And if we do it because of the frustrating monotony of our life, why are we then allowing the frustration to latently exist? Are we so accustomed to our life as it is that we're scared of doing any changes? How many non-influenced choices are we making? What's the worth of those choices? Stanley might be starting to understand all of this: ""in and amongst his aimless meandering, I think he is actually beginning to discover something: he is getting closer to  an answer, an explaination, an exit. He is beginning to earn his freedom"", but he is a videogame character bound to narrative limits and cannot escape his own story. He is Stanley and can only be Stanley. But what about us? ""Now, if I could truly put you in his shoes, to show you the paths he walked and the choices he made.. [...] soon you will be the one to walk: the controls will be in your hands. [...] Oh, I think I'm going to enjoy this. When you find out how alone you truly are.. I will be laughing more than anyone.""Is this a time in which we should break the old entertaining clichés of the videogame medium and release some of its pedagogical potential? Afterall ""men never shape their conduct upon the teaching of pure reason"" as Le Bon writes, and we can deduce that they learn by empirically experiencing reality. But if the virtuality is empirically making them experience and hate their own reality, isn't that potentially a formative experience? Is this then a case in which ""ludus est magister vitae""?Well, it's certainly worth a thought.The Stanley Parable Personal ReviewRenzo ""Stermayer"" Arcuri			"

												This is my review of The Stanley Parable, which I definitely played.The Stanley Parable is a computer game. It is available for $14.99.Its genre (as the French say) is definitely first-person exploration.The game is set in an office, but sometimes it's not.The parable in the game is about Stanley.The graphics are very white, and black. Sometimes it is blue, though. There are also some shades of red. Blue is an awesome color.There’s a part where you see a guy in a white coat typing at a desk. I still don’t know who that is, but that’s okay. There’s also a brown sofa and a table with empty glasses on it, plus tall shelves of books, as well as a portrait of a suit and two hands. There’s also this part where you get to see two doors with numbers on them, and another desk with a number beside it.Is the game hard? Well, maybe. I mean, some people say Super Meat Boy is easy, while I find Super Meat Boy Super Hard. As for MY experience with the Stanley Parable, I’d say it was maybe hard, but you might find it easy.I am Very Positive that this game is good. Overall I give it a 92% rating, plus or minus one percent.			"

I've never had such a deeply emotional responce to a video game before and I doubt anything will ever come close to this work or art's existensial questioning.  It is an amazing testament to how far gaming has come, moving beyond jumping on gumbas or shooting zombies to something of such an unparalleled meta-game.  Thank you Galactic Cafe, Thank you.			"

												A very short game... If you're a sheep.This game is very special, you can spend as much as 4 minutes and a bit or a few hours on this game. It's a kind of game that plays with the illusion of choice. What this game does is that it takes the 4th Wall, straps 20lbs of C4 to it, adds a sprinkle of thermite and lets it rip. But wait it ain't done with the 4th Wall yet oh no. It then fires 163613 jackhammers out of a cannon and a squirrel at it until that wall ceases to exist anymore. Donald Trump doesn't stand a chance against this game.You play as Stanley, or should I say ""Employee No. 427"". You sit in front of your 1980's era DOS interface CRT monitor and wait for instructions on which buttons to push on the keyboard. You are one of a plethora of generic employees who work for a corporation. What kind of corporation? I still have no clue. It kinda reminds me of the ""1984"" ad by Apple for their Macintosh.You are given instructions to follow by the narrator (a very amusing narrator I may add) of the game, but listening and conforming to those instructions is up to you, which also mean the consequences that follow for each instruction followed (or should I say not followed) are your responsibilty. It seems extremely linear at first, but once you realise you are the one controlling Stanley and not the narrator, the possibilities are endless.I aqcuired this game in the Summer Steam Sale for €2.39.Is it worth it? YesIs it up to you to decide if it is? Abso-****ing-lutelyMy rating? 7.5/10			"

												The Stanley Parable is a game that will make you question the langauge of games. A game is a just a series of planned out stories. Does your choice in a game really matter? If everything is already determined, what are you REALLY doing in the game. If you're interested in playing a game that will make you look at the ""meta"" of gaming then this game is for you.Of course, you could just also not buy the game. The choice is really all up to you.

												Oh lord, what can be said about this game? The Stanley Parable is a gem, it really is. It's one of those games filled to the brim with sublte mystery and -fantastic- narration. Every path you take delivers witty dialogue, clever jokes, and an all-around, genuinely good time. As far as replayability is concerned, well, technically that's what this game is about--you've just got to find all the secrets and endings scattered around here and there, hoping to find something new, testing things you haven't tested before--pushing you to limits of clicking on just about everything--still, once you find satisfaction, picking up this game again might be challenging. For instance, I won't be playing this game for another five years in order to get a certain achievement, and no, I won't be resetting my clock to do so.			"

If you like wandering around and trying weird things to see if the game notices it, The Stanley Parable is basically the game for you.  If you think wandering around and having funny things happen in a choose-your-own-adventure sort of format sounds dumb, or ""isn't a game"" then you probably won't enjoy this.  And that's okay.

The Stanley Parable is a farce.Originally posted by Wikipedia:In theatre, a farce is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable. Farces are often highly incomprehensible plot-wise (due to the many plot twists and random events that occur), but viewers are encouraged not to try to follow the plot in order to avoid becoming confused and overwhelmed. [...] A farce is also often set in one particular location, where all events occur.Now let's speak in practical terms. TSP is technically a walking simulator. There is not much interaction beyond opening doors and pressing buttons. The game is about walking through different locations and exploring different scenarios.Of couse, TSP is much more than that, or it wouldn't have been the focus of so many articles in the gaming press, or have so many positive reviews everywhere (as here on Steam.)TSP is a deconstruction of structural narratives in gaming. It is best appreciated by gamers who've played plenty of scripted games, wondered at all about how such experiences are designed, or have become wise to the patterns and framework that hold a game narrative together.This mostly translates to you, the player, defying (or obeying) the narrator's instructions and seeing how that goes.Of course, those defiances and their effects are, in the end, just as scripted as the rest of the game. And the game is aware of it, deconstructing even that. Is your head spinning yet?All this to say that this is a very enjoyable, clever, funny experience. The narrator is brilliant in his delivery. The different branches and endings keep you interested for far longer than you'd expect. And I would suggest you resist the urge to go online and look at the game's unofficial wiki. Try to find as many paths and endings as you can, alone. Most are easy to find. Some are hidden.Is this game for you? If you've ever thought about how game stories are put together, then yes it is.

												$14.99 seems like a lot for a game. And yes, in most cases I'd agree with you. However, there are some circumstances in which paying what feels like more-than-average is entirely okay. This is one of those cases.The Stanley Parable is one of the most original, creative, and though-provoking games (or THINGS, for that matter) I've ever played. Once you finish it, you've finished it. You can go back and do everything as many times as you want, but once you've done it, you've done it.And that's okay.I've played this game for about 6 hours (at the time of review) and while I've done pretty much everything there is to do, I've spent hours in reflection of what any of it means. You will learn from this game if you allow yourself to.It can be silly. It can be unsettling. Most importantly, it can be touching.I cannot recommend this game highly enough. If you're on a budget, waiting wouldn't hurt, but if its on sale for as cheap as it gets (I think around $3.75?), there's no reason not to buy it.I love this game, and it's made its way into my list of favorites with ease.P.S. If you don't like the fact that there is (for the sake of this review) no action, and you don't want to spend time listening to the narration, I do NOT recommend it. Its VERY VERY good, yes, but it may not be what some people consider 'fun' (although I presonally had BLAST with it).			"

												A struggle between the narrator and the player to take control of the story to the point of breaking reality and the game itself.With multiple paths for you to wander and wonder about what could it happen if you do the exact opposite of what the narrator says.Each door, each corridor, each button, each step... has its own story.

												8/10Not sure where to start with this review, but I will say this: this game messes with your mind! In terms of mechanics, this game is incredibly simple. It is a walking simulator set in a bland office building. But, in a game like this, mechanics and visuals really don't matter. For this little game, all you need to worry about is the satirical narrator and your choices.The Stanley Parable is an extremely peculiar but hilarious game. The humor is witty and sarcastic, and on occasion, can be rather dark. Also, forget the fourth wall in this one; it is practically nonexistent. Of course, we have the narrator to thank for that. He is extremely reactive to the player's behavior and will comment on the strangest things. (Get the Door 430 achievement; that's one of the best pieces of commentary in the game!) However, he also has some moments where he will either rail on the player in a fierce rant, or seriously guilt trip him/her in a somewhat dejected manner. These rapid changes in his dialogue can be a little disarming but give the narrator more depth as a character (if that is how you see him), thus having the potential to affect the way you play the game.Despite its fantastic humor, the game's primary focus is on its philosophical topics. Most of the time, those topics dance around in the background and are alluded to by the narrator. Where the really shine is in the ""endings"". Each one, no matter how quirky or funny, has some sort of message to convey. Some, as would be expected in this type of game, focus on the nature of choices, and whether or not they matter. Others may touch on subjects such as the meaning of life or one's perception of reality. These ""endings"" can be incredibly thought-provoking and deep; one in particular left me staring at my computer for about 15 minutes in contemplative shock. And, when I describe it as a shock, it's not hyperbole.Of course, what you get out of said endings is completely up to you. How will you interpret the endings and what the narrator has to say about them?So, to sum it all up, The Stanley Parable is an extremely clever and philosophical game that is sure to keep the player's attention all the way through(?). It is one of those special games that can give you both memorable laughs and the occasional existential crisis! Enjoy!			"

												Truly amazing. I wrote a review of the Demo and the original mod before the full game came out awhile back and never got around to writing a review for this one, but I can say that this was well worth the $15. For those who played the original, know that it is not just an HD remix of the original Source mod. It also adds plenty of new endings, as well as new secrets. The original made it quite obvious to the player the choices available and the amount of endings that could be had, but now they've changed plenty of things around to add more secrets, endings, and oh, the replayability!Now, every time you finish the game, the game will begin again and sometimes after certain endings certain things will change, and it has some hilarious achievements, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, or not playing for five years, or the ""Unacheivable"" acheivement (which is apparently somehow acheivable but I'm not sure how to legitly yet).I definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE.PS: Don't look up any videos or any information about it. It's best experienced first-hand; there's a reason the Store page tells you nothing about the game. If you aren't prepared to throw your money around without knowing about it, play the Demo. Actually—either way, play the demo first. It has exclusive content from the actual game and is hilarious in its own right–it's the best Demo ever, such a good Demo that I wrote a review of the demo.... yeah.If that's not enough for you, you can play the original mod if you want. It's on Desura and IndieDB for free–you don't need Half-Life 2, just the Source SDK Base 2007 will do it.I rate this game 8.8888 Stanleys out of 8.8888			"

												The Stanley Parable is quirky. Well, maybe quirky isn't the write word...witty? Ah, no, that doesn't seem right...It's a story. That's it! It's Stanley's story. It's the story of a man who works a job and who suddenly finds himself in the middle of a walking simulator.There are not many gameplay elements to The Stanley Parable. You really do spend your time walking, and maybe interacting a few times. The focus, rather, is on the humour and narrative of The Narrator, who will attempt to dictate your actions. Choice is a very big factor in this game, and you can choose to follow him or to be a rebel and go against his wishes. The Narrator's reactions are varied enough to make each walkthrough feel unique, and it's a joy to hear some of the wit and tongue-in-cheek meta humour written into the game itself. There are many endings, so replayability is quite good. Surprisingly, there was a rather dramatic moment in one of the endings, but for the most part this is a humorous game.I recommend purchasing this, as the writing alone is fantastic, and it is boosted by the wonderful voice acting.  If you're not into ""walking sims"", this may be a bit hard to get through for you, but the writing itself may take some of the edge off if it's your kind of humour. The price tag might be a little hefty for this kind of game, however it is well worth it if you can get it. As always, sales are the best so definitely pick it up on sale.Finally, there's a demo on Steam. What better way of finding out if it's for you than trying it out yourself? :)			"

												A pretty fun and unusual game. It's mostly a parody on certain mechanics used in games, most notably the idea of player choice. Throughout the entire time, there is a narrator speaking to the player, who is trying hard to guide the player along a certain direction. The player can then choose to listen to the narrator or wander off and do what they feel like, which gets on narrator's nerves.There isn't all that much content in the game, and I kind of wish it had more, but what is there is certainly worth experiencing. The game is both funny and thought-provoking. ""Now, Stanley, let's go and find the story."" :D			"

												Stop trying to learn what this game is about and buy it already. The less you know, the more you'll appreciate it. Every single thing you learn about this game before experiencing it for yourself only takes from its cost. Take that leap of faith and be rewarded. I was.			"

												This game rocks!It's all about choice, and it's great to see how it pokes fun at other story driven games in general... Other than that, telling you any more would ruin the experience!Seriously though, if you love story games then this game is definitely for you. It will surprise you and leave you wanting more again and again. The only issue is that it is pretty short, but I was able to get a solid couple of hours out of it, and it was definitely a lot of fun.			"

												Oh lord, what can be said about this game? The Stanley Parable is a gem, it really is. It's one of those games filled to the brim with sublte mystery and -fantastic- narration. Every path you take delivers witty dialogue, clever jokes, and an all-around, genuinely good time. As far as replayability is concerned, well, technically that's what this game is about--you've just got to find all the secrets and endings scattered around here and there, hoping to find something new, testing things you haven't tested before--pushing you to limits of clicking on just about everything--still, once you find satisfaction, picking up this game again might be challenging. For instance, I won't be playing this game for another five years in order to get a certain achievement, and no, I won't be resetting my clock to do so.			"

												First of all, before purchasing the Stanley Parable, you should understand that this is only a ""game"" in the loosest sense, and you'll probably either love it or you just won't ""get"" it. You walk around, you occasionally press the ""use"" button on buttons and doors, and that's just about it. If you've tried Dear Esther or Gone Home, you can imagine that kind of experience, but where those games were far more serious and ""artsy,"" The Stanley Parable is... something else. I don't want to spoil anything, and you should play the demo or watch the trailers to get an idea of the game's tone and the outstanding voice work of Kevan Brighting, if nothing else. That said, I loved every minute of the Stanley Parable, and though it is extremely short, there are multiple endings that all take the game in a completely different direction. If you want to laugh out loud, this is the game for you. Once you've seen everything there is to see, the game doesn't offer much replay value, but this is not an experience to be missed.			"

												I like the part of the game where I slap buttons and the narrator chides me for it and then I don't listen to the narrator and he gets miffed about it and then I throw myself off of a high ledge just to make him cry and then I do something else but he doesn't like that at all and he passively-aggressively does something mean.

												A high-quality remake (including more content) of the original title with the same name. It's a sort of choose-your-own-adventure with narration. A typical play-through is probably about 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the choices you take. The game is designed to be replayed multiple, multiple times. Awesome narration, clever humor and writing. I spent time looking at everything, and doing all the obvious choices that are presented, then looked up the additional ones and went through those. Took me about 3-4 hours to do so. Highly recommend this game, as well as the demo (which is completely new content, due to the nature of this game.) The original HL2 mod is also really good, but dated.			"

												Incredibly unique.  Addictive not in the traditional ""gotta level up"" sense, but more of an exploration type of addictive.  This game breaks the ""fourth wall"" in a few aspects, and there's honestly way, way, way more than what the eye sees.  If this game was an iceberg, maybe 5% of it is on the surface.I've maybe played 2 hours or so, but I've pretty much just been exploring and seeing what options = what outcome.  Also, soaking in the level design, which is AMAZING might I say.I got this during the half off sale for $7.50.  Very well worth it at that price.  At full price, maybe, if I knew exactly how much content there was.  I usually expect about 1 hour of entertainment for every $1 USD I spend.  The other qualities of this game make up for it if this falls short of that expectation, though.  So if you're thinking about it, do it, especially if you're a fan of Source engine based games.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a pretty decent game. I've already beat all of the stories to this game even though there never is an end to it. For me it seemed a little disturbing but i got used to it, I played this game so many times but there is one question i have about it, which is... What is the game about? Is it about an insane man with a voice coming from his head? Or is it just simply Stanley talking? I would love to know but i don't want to know because that's what makes this game exciting.

												The game achievements alone are a huge middle finger to completionists and I think that's wonderful. The Stanley Parable has multiple endings that make you question your very existence or why you decided to sit in a literal broom closet just to mock the narrator and make HIM question your very existence. Fairly simple but entertaining nonetheless. Also lets you release your inner rebel by directly going against what someone is telling you to do.I highly recommend the demo if you're on the fence about buying, since it's a pretty good taste of what you'll get and is a surprising example of a demo that is 100% separate from the main game.

I won't say anything else for fear of spoilers, but here's my Pro/Con list:PROS:+ Engaging gameplay+ Easy controls+ Wonderful, interesting storyline+ 19 possible endings+ New, unique idea+ The narrator+ Small changes with each playthrough+ Fun Easter eggs and jokes if you take your timeCONS:- Gets repetitive- When you exhaust all endings, there isn't much more contentOverall, I highly recommend this game.

												The End is Never The End is Never The End is Never the End...Where to start with The Stanley Parable?  For 15$ dollars, I played the game for only a few hours.  Was it worth my money?  Was it worth my time?  It's hard to say.  Did I enjoy it?  Certainly so, but will you, the reader enjoy it?  There's only one way to find out and play it for yourself.It's hard to write about a game like The Stanley Parable.  The entire game is comprised of decisions.  You walk around, choose a path, and listen to some dialogue.  Sound boring?  Except the narrator has some of the most witty dialogue since GLaDoS and his humor really rubs you the right way.  The game is wrapped up in metaphors and sarcasm and open to interpretation.  It's up to you, the player, to decide what truly happens at the end of the day.  Yes there are set endings, but it's up to you to give them meaning.  Even after I got all the endings, I found myself still playing it to find the small secrets.  It's rare that I touch a game after beating it (unless nostalgia calls), but I really just wanted more.  I wanted to hear the narrator more.  I wanted to see what little gems the developers had thrown in.While this review may have just made you more confused, just buy it.  Don't go to YouTube and watch some videos, don't stare at your computer screen and ponder about the question, just buy it.  It's 15$ may be a bit steep, but it's a philosophical journey that I enjoyed.TL:DR - An artsy type of game that isn't pretentious or dumb.  Filled with emotional bits that make you think.			"

												The Stanley Parable is just one of those games which people either really like or really dislike; some may feel that they can't do much except freely roam around and listening to a guy talk. However, its beauty lies in the fact that it's entirely oriented about choice. It has some clever humor, and it is generally the type of game where you HAVE to try every single stupid action you can think of, in order to get a reaction from the narrator.Even if it's a bit short, The Stanley Parable is a great game. If you intend on buying it, I suggest that you try to learn the least possible about it or its story. I would also suggest to play the demo before buying the game (even if you are sure about your decision) : it will help you see if you like that kind of game or not, and it will also provide a good introduction to the actual game if you're going to buy it.The Stanley Parable is also best played with other people. and it requires a basic, general knowledge of first person video gaming in order to fully get its humor, in some moments.Have fun!

												My first impression of ""The Stanley Parable"" was that it was an overhyped average narrative indie game that people happen to latch onto. That is only because I beaten the game in 30 minutes and felt quite dissapointed in my $15 spendings. I'm writing a positive review instead of a negative one though because I have recently changed my mind. I have gone through almost every single ending this game has to offer (which is quite a few). And it still surprises me at every turn. This game is hilarious and creative. It's like watching a good movie that I get to direct... but yet I'm not the one directing at all. Anyway I'm in the game right now standing in a broom closet, in which I've been in this broom closet for fifteen minutes so far laughing my butt off. That is what this game has done to me.			"

												This game is seriously one of the best games i have ever played. Its clever, witty, and this dialog based game is a refrefresher from the same decaying genres that have taken over video games. However theres really no way to review this game without spoiling it, so you'll just have to play it to understand its genius. 9/10. Wish i had paid full price, the developers deserve it.

												Well, this is a new one. A First Person game where there is no shooting or puzzle solving. Mainly just making choices and exploring every area is what this game is all about. I enjoyed the comedic dialogue of the narrator and the strange endings that transpire depending on the different decisions you make. It had alot of confusing moments as rooms tend to change each time you come to a dead end. Even though everything seemed pretty random, alot of scripted dialogue was put into the game and possiblities were many but still I feel there should have been more. But I haven't made a game so I could not do any better than this. For the price I paid for it, it was nice and fun to play. I think I enjoy more the reaction I get from having my friends and family play it. I definitely enjoyed markiplier's commentary while he played the game. This is a fun game to experience once and then have your loved ones play as well.			"

												    There, more or less, is no such thing as a good, spoiler-free review of this game. After all, what makes this game so ridiculously ingenious, darkly comical and chillingly haunting can only re/ally be captured within examples from the dynamic and somehow engaging tale. Plus, most of what the story is about is discovered over time and unraveled throughout the game. I'll do my best all the same.    You are cast into an eerily vacant office space, full of mystery and the echoes of an ironic and altogether fitting British man giving you orders by means of telling your story, before it actually happens. I won't give too much detail for fear of ruining it, but there often is a choice. Follow what you are told, or revolt against what you are told. It is up to you. I won't say any more. You need to find out for yourself.    Although very short (completed in one and a half hours), this game captures emotion and pyscological elements in an indescribably unique way, and is an experience that cannot be missed. 9/10, absolutely astounding. Prepare for profuse mind blowing.			"

												I'm a little torn when I try to rate The Stanley Parable. It is not really a game I would say. I mean, in a way it is: you control a character move, press buttons, but that's pretty much it, in terms of 'playing' the game. It is more of an experience, a little bit pleasant, a little bit masochistic. One worth going through, for sure.Stanley Parable leaves one confused. You will never know, if you have gotten to the ending yet. Actually, there really is no ending at all. Or maybe there is, I don't know.I will tell you what it will do to you though. It WILL make you change your mind often. It WILL make you notice tiny, little details change, when entering the same room for the 50th time and it WILL leave you trying to figure out, if that change will eventually lead to another part of the game. It WILL leave you in a janitor's closet for at least 10 minutes and it WILL make you listen to the narrator mock you for sitting there for the whole time. It WILL try to kill you. It WILL make you kill yourself. It WILL kill you. It WON'T kill you. It WILL lead you to heaven. It WILL make you push buttons, or not...The only real problem with Stanley Parable is that it's too short.  Because who wouldn't like to walk through empty corridors for a tiny bit longer, while being mocked of and insulted by someone who controls you?Some people say they would like to have Morgan Freeman as a narrator of their life, I would prefer to leave this job to the narrator of The Stanley Parable.

												THIS GAME IS BEYOND INEGENIOUS, WHY WALKING AROUND ENDLESSLY THROUGH DOORS IS SUPERB. though on a serious note here the narrator watches everything u do and every choice you make is not yours to control rather it's the universe's way of saying this is your destiny and the like. But really it's a entertaining game that will immerse you in the life of ""The Office"" ya get it? u know that TV show... forget it then. I'd reccomend you try this out enjoy the scenery...I mean the atmosphere...no, I mean um THE GAME.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a first person exploration game developed by Galactic Cafe on the source engine. It follows a regular office worker named ""Stanley"" (whose job it is to push buttons on a keyboard) after all of his co-workers mysteriously disappear, and he starts to hear the voice of a mysterious narrator in his head.The Stanley Parable is at it's core an expermiment in player choice and how that effects gaming as a story-telling medium. It doesn't have any fancy butterfly effects it actually plays out more like a choose-your-own adventure book with preset paths and endings. With the player activating triggers by making choices that lead down branching paths toward one of a variety of endings.Beyond that core is a commentary on gaming and the medium that games present to a player, involving a main character with no personality beyond literally being the player, and a narrator (voiced by Kevan Brighting) who acts as a standin for the video game's developers. This story choice and meta commentary is neatly wrapped in surreal humor and wit, with the interplay between the players choices and the narrator's opinion on those choices being the focal-point of the experience, as well as the ultimate selling point of the advertisments. Yes, the narrator getting increaingly angrier the more you choose paths that don't lead to his prefered ending is a neat little cherry on top, but the humor also branches off into a variety of paths, involving anything from absurdly dark humor to surrealist nonesense and everything in between, it truley is a fascinating and involving group of experiences, that is worth the pricetag even in the face of how little guns you can use to shoot monsters and nazis.And if that doesn't have you sold, than the phrase 'Drugs and Hookers' is used in bitter spite at one point. Go figure out when.			"

												Taking directions in video games has become something we've all (generally) become resigned to; we read the manual, check out the controls menu, follow signs and hints in the environment, etc... In most cases, games follow a guideline and set limitations as to what extent you can deviate from the original plan or script, these rules becoming more lenient and expanded since the good ol' days of the NES and into the realms of MMOs and open-world exploration based titles. Still, seldom are you punished or scolded directly for wandering off the intended route; you may be given a time limit to return to the battlefield, come across enemy mobs too strong for you, or usually be met with an invisible wall or impenetrable barricade that artificially confines you. The Stanley Parable explores taking directions in rather clever ways, and while the game does have an impact regarding your choices, it tackles the subject from an angle of entertainment and comedy with less focus on inquisitive examination, and while I walked away relatively pleased in the end,  I was left hoping for a bit more education.The Stanley Parable is a game based on player choices and how a story can change accordingly, these changes being delivered and addressed by the narrator, Kevan Brighting, whose voice work is a highlight of the game. Brighting delivers all of his lines with a certain eloquence and gentlemanly grace, despite the range of moods he goes through as Stanley, the titular protagonist (and arguably antagonist, but we'll get to that later), shuffles along on his adventures. While the narrator doesn’t break his calm, reserved character despite your decisions, there are points where he has to become menacing, pleading or so sarcastically dry he could melt a glacier, and said eloquence is kept even throughout all these scenes. Since Brighting's voice is the one that guides you through the game's various routes, the fact his work is so clean, clear and best of all pleasant to listen to makes him a wonderful addition to a game that would've otherwise been about wandering aimlessly around.What intrigued me the most about The Stanley Parable was the Molyneux-esque aspect of the player being able to make choices that impact your progress. When you first start the game you're given an opening monologue about Stanley's job and how it's a heavily directed job with instructions coming to him via computer, but soon his incoming directions cease and he discovers that he's all alone in the office, and then the player takes control of Stanley. The narrator then tells the story about Stanley exploring his empty office, and eventually you come across two open doors; the narrator says that Stanley goes through one of them. If you follow the script, the story continues along giving you other chances to deviate from the intended script and the narrator will react accordingly. Following the script one hundred percent to the letter will have you completing the game in no time at all, rewarding you with a rather positive, if not insidious, ending... That is, if you follow the script. Let's rewind back to the first major choice Stanley has of entering door number one or door number two, and how the narrator dictates that Stanley chooses one, not the other - Or does he? Does he have to? The other door is there, wide open and leading somewhere else. The only thing stopping you from making Stanley go through the other door is what the narrator just said. There's a sense of mischief and empowerment of being able to deny the script and do what you please, even if your routes are clearly defined and refusing to follow said script makes you a nuisance more than an obnoxious rebel.This brings me back to the point of Stanley being both the protagonist and antagonist, depending on your choices. Regardless of whether you play nice or forge your own path, the story has to reach a conclusion, the narrator taking on different roles depending on your chosen route; he may resign in helplessness, be as confused as you are when assets being loaded in don’t fit the script or function, and he even becomes hostile and threatening when he tires of the foolishness. The different ways the story has to adapt to your decisions is the big draw and appeal to the game, but the massive flaw in The Stanley Parable is that once you go through a route and reach its ending, there is no point in going back to it. In fact once you find every possible ending in the game, there is practically no point in returning to it, unless you want to uncover each piece of the narrator's lines, find secrets or cash in on the achievements. Even then The Stanley Parable is quick to run out of things to do, giving it poor lasting power - Including some clowning around, I reached each ending, which had me clocked in at just over three hours when all was said and done. That's really the only thing that severely hampers the game, but at the same time I'm thankful that artificial time padding was omitted for a game that gets you in, offers up comedy and an incredibly well written and expertly voice acted script, then gets you out. The Stanley Parable certainly is not a replayable title, but as mentioned the lessons it teaches while being witty keeps it from overstaying its welcome and becoming a bore. I was amused and intrigued during my time with it, but I wished at times that the game was more informative to the player in an educational or logical sense along with its entertainment. For example, your choices have an impact on the narrator and the script, and because the story must reach an end, changes have to be made accordingly. While the results end up amusing, I had hoped there would’ve been a closer, deeper look on the matter from a game design standpoint. Of course, it’s a game about a man with a charming English accent narrating another man’s eventual subterfuge of the story, so intelligent, lengthy discussions on game design is not its goal. That said, if you're at all interested in logic and game design then The Stanley Parable is certainly worth your time, but only if the lack of major replayability doesn't have you turned off.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a first person story-driven adventure game that will amuse and bemuse you. As you wander though the office, looking for your missing colleagues, the game's mood and environment shifts in diverse, drastic, and impactful ways depending on the choices that you make. This fluid design will toy with your established expectations of how video games should function and progress.All of this is guided by the highlight of the game: its narration, which can morph from hilarious to poignant in seconds as the game reacts to your decisons. One minute you're giggling as the narrator is trying to find ""the story"", the next you're questioning whether there was ever real choices in the game, or if you truly have freedom in your own life. And to top it off, the game has multiple, and extremely different, endings that encourage replayability and leave you astonished every time. A thoughtful and well constructed adventure (in the truest sense), The Stanley Parable is a great game that will hopefully leave you as flabbergasted and pleased as I was when I was done with it.

												The Stanley Parable is one of those special games that burst everyone's bubble.Who is Stanley and why is he pushing the same buttons over and over because he is told to through a computer monitor? Well, enter The Stanley Parable where the narrator changes Stanley's life forever. In The Stanley Parable, there is no clear or concise story, you make your own story, at least from the handful of endings that are available. But you really don't know what the story is because there isn't exactly any. Is happiness a conspiracy? Well, there's no leaving the office building Stanley works at, so it's a possiblity. Some of the endings will drive you mad but make you laugh. The rest of the endings will make you cry and make you sad and depressed; because when you've beaten every ending, including the art ending.....Stanley becomes the useless protagonist.9.1/10			"

The Stanley Parable is a truly unique and totally awesome game / experience.The LESS you know about the game going in, probably the better so this ""review"" will instead be a short recommendation for you to simply play it.  The game is hilarious and plays like nothing else I've seen so it's hard to compare it to other games or even to define what genre this game would fall in.  Well, you just got to experience this for yourself.The game itself is very short with my play time at ~2 hrs to replay it enough to experience a fair number of the potential endings.  (After the 2hrs I was trying for some of the Steam achievements, which itself is hilarious as the game detects that too)One of the few games where I tell people ""you simply must play this"".  10 out of 10.

Astonishing level of fourth-wall breaking, and an environment so consistent (while still being pretty simple) that it will capture you for long hours.Look for secrets. There are lots of little details. Look for all of them. And then realise you've been excitedly going through the same hallway for a whole day. And it wasn't even Tuesday.If you've never played a videogame, especially in first person, don't start with this one. It would be like choosing 2001 - A Space Odyssey to be the first movie you watch.But if you have... then by all means, you must play The Stanley Parable. You have no idea.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a refreshing experience within the occasionally lackluster indie game scene. You will find no riveting plot or uncover any mysterious consipracies, as screenshots and trailers may suggest. The beauty of The Stanley Parable is that it plays, and perhaps even teases you, on what your expectations of video games are in the 21st century, and the way you interact with the in-game world. It is good to spend a few hours trying to uncover the various paths one can take to progress through the game, and discovering that it might not be fit to hold the title of ""game"" at all. Overall if you are looking for a short and interesting indie title, you should try out the Stanley Parable.			"

												i love kind of games like this cuz they have infinite possibilitys!! and i love easter eggs!!! here's my discription of the stanley parable and a few facts!!!The Stanley Parable is an interactive fiction modification (mod) built on the Source game engine, developed by Davey Wreden and released in July 2011. A high-definition remastered stand-alone version, including new story elements, was developed by Wreden and Source modeler William Pugh under the Galactic Cafe development team name. The remake was announced and approved via the Steam Greenlight process in 2012, and released in October 2013 for Microsoft Windows and December 2013 for OS X.While both the mod and the remake use the first-person perspective common to other Source engine mods, there are no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the player controls the protagonist, Stanley, through a surreal environment, with each step of the process narrated, voiced by British actor Kevan Brighting. The player has the opportunity to make numerous decisions on which paths to take, including going against what the narration is telling them to do, each choice leading to different narrations and endings. Wreden envisioned the game after considering that most major video game titles confine the user to its rules, and considered how to construct a narrative to challenge that notion. Outside of Brighting's voice work of the narrator, Wreden built the modification himself, initially as a personal project for his career goals but soon expanding to a wider release once he had shown it to friends and other players. The modification received critical attention as a new variation of creating interactive fiction within a game engine, and provided a thought-provoking narration to discuss with others on the nature of choice and predestination within video games.The remake grew out the experience, recreating many of the original mod's decisions within new environments while adding several more story pathways that could be followed. The standalone game has received similar critical praise from journalists favoring the expanded narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making in modern video games.			"

												The Staley Parable is a first person game where you choose paths for your story. Aparently there are more than seven hundred endings which are all awesome. Two of my favorite games are featured in this game, Minecraft and Portal 2 acting as part of one of the endings. The game is great as you don't have to listen to the narrator instead you my lead your own adventure disobeying the narrator. Probably one of my favorite games. I would highly recomend checking out and mayb buying this game for yourself as I truly enjoyed it and would like to share it with others			"

												An excellent adventure through narration that gives the player pause for thought about the limitations of choice while still having choice in a game.It's fun, quirky, and worth a few playthroughs to give the game time to have you come to your own conclusions about narration, direction, trust, and choice.There may or may not be skill trees, leaderboards, and/or exp, yet still in the end (or the beginning) I felt that I was left with a satisfying experience.

												Defenitly not your typical video game as in this game has many differences which make different from the others such as, breaking the frouth wall, many endings, and different references. And the narrator voice acting is just incredible. Recommended if youre looking at something than shooters. Though I felt this game could been tweaked a little bit more, I give this 9.5/10.  (I gotz the b room closet endingXD!!!)			"

												It truly is hard to put this game into words. At first it may seem like a simple game, you walk, go where you are told, and finish the game. But after a bit of playing, you start to find new ways to play the game, and find it to be much larger than you first imagined. It now seems to be a fun little game, with some silly moments, biting insults, and multiple endings. But as you play the game even more, you start to notice even more things. Like that as you were playing the game, the game was playing you. Every decision you make is manipulated by the game. From the first time you escaped, to your rebellious decision to take the door on the right, to every playthrough after that. You don't play this game, the game plays you.Eventually you notice something amazing. This isn't even a game. The name states that. It's something much greater than just a game, it's a parable. A parable is a story told to teach a moral lesson. I think this game makes a great parable. But, what lesson does it teach? You'll have to play to find out. "

I really feel you are hopeless sometimes Stanley."" *Long Pause* ""Stanley was still reading the review because he thought it was good, and that used a story feature from the actual game, to emphasis that the game itself is brilliant. He then recommened the review. Oh, I see. You hate me obviously Stanley. You can't give 3 seconds of your life and a slight muscle movement for this brilliant review writer! Shame on you Stanley, Shame on you"".			"

												I've played this game at once during a boring evening, and i discovered one of the greatest exeperience of all my videogamer career. Just play the game, challenge the game/narrator, explore every possibilities and find out every easter egg. And to make this feeling even more stronger, play it without reading ANYTHING about all the ending or easter egg, you can do it later, when you've already explore this FANTASTIC game. Just Buy it and enjoy.You do not play this game, this game plays you.			"

But really it's a entertaining game that will immerse you in the life of ""The Office"" ya get it? u know that TV show... forget it then.

												A lot of my friends have asked why I play video games at my age and with my job...Well, The Stanley Parable is one of the reasons.This game epitomises what gaming is about for me: it doesn't follow the usual formula at all, was made cheaply, easily and quickly, and features oodles of surprises and treats that aren't thrown in your face.Games like these represent what is so powerful about Steam and PC gaming in general: we don't have to put up with generics.  We have a slew of (cheap) unique games at our fingertips, and we would be foolish not to take full advantage of that.But, onto the game itself.  How to describe it? Imagine Fight Club, I suppose, if instead of Tyler Durden, the Narrator met Milton (from Office Space).  And then took acid.  And this was all narrated by the Monty Python crew.See, that's the real beauty of this game: the banality of the concept (an office worker) is offset by a message not unlike Fight Club (minus - mostly - the violence) and painted with a distinctly meta feel to it.It's the juxtaposition that really makes the concept of this game shine: our protaganist's apparently choiceless, linear line is thrown wide open (with, well, bizzare scenarios at times) by telling us we are not free to choose his ending...and then giving us the opportunity to do the exact opposite.I had moments where I was chuckling for a while, shaking my head at the absurdity of it all. Other times I burst out laughing.  Still other situations had me stopping to pause, genuinely questioning the implications of an event and how it related to my life.""Ah, but the cons,"" you say, and rightly so.  Well, it does feel short.  Which is a concern when it's so easy to pick up cheaper games that last (a lot) longer.  I would very much recommend that you wait for a big sale for this game, particularly if your budget is constrained. To put it into perspective: I reckon (without giving away spoilers) that I've discovered more or less everything there is, and I don't have much time invested into the game.TL;DR: a recommended game, a brilliant story, but not a game that will keep you coming back for more hours later.

In fact, I'm pretty sure everyone over the age of 20 has had dreams like this game. The Stanley Parable also has the best end credits scene I have ever witnessed - but I only witnessed it once and that was not when I beat the game. Play it on a Tuesday when you're home sick to unlock the achievement and spend all the time in the world with this game. Most of the time the Narrator is on your side. Most of the time.

												Well, this is a new one. A First Person game where there is no shooting or puzzle solving. Mainly just making choices and exploring every area is what this game is all about. I enjoyed the comedic dialogue of the narrator and the strange endings that transpire depending on the different decisions you make. It had alot of confusing moments as rooms tend to change each time you come to a dead end. Even though everything seemed pretty random, alot of scripted dialogue was put into the game and possiblities were many but still I feel there should have been more. But I haven't made a game so I could not do any better than this. For the price I paid for it, it was nice and fun to play. I think I enjoy more the reaction I get from having my friends and family play it. I definitely enjoyed markiplier's commentary while he played the game. This is a fun game to experience once and then have your loved ones play as well.			"

Two of my favorite games are featured in this game, Minecraft and Portal 2 acting as part of one of the endings. The game is great as you don't have to listen to the narrator instead you my lead your own adventure disobeying the narrator. Probably one of my favorite games. I would highly recomend checking out and mayb buying this game for yourself as I truly enjoyed it and would like to share it with others			"

												This little title is a masterpiece. Now you hear that every now and then about a game but this game isn´t a game...and yet it is.The thing is, you can´t explain TSP without spoiling some of the experience so I´ll just say this:It is a narrative experiement that asks very important questions, not only about gaming but, to an extent, about life itself.Bottom Line: If you claim to have a soul, you owe it to said soul to play The Stanley Parable.

												THIS GAME IS BEYOND INEGENIOUS, WHY WALKING AROUND ENDLESSLY THROUGH DOORS IS SUPERB. though on a serious note here the narrator watches everything u do and every choice you make is not yours to control rather it's the universe's way of saying this is your destiny and the like. But really it's a entertaining game that will immerse you in the life of ""The Office"" ya get it? u know that TV show... forget it then. I'd reccomend you try this out enjoy the scenery...I mean the atmosphere...no, I mean um THE GAME.			"

												Brilliant in the most puzzling way.I bought this game on sale this summer, and I kind of put it off until now. I can't believe I waited that long, because this is one of the most fun games I have ever played.Although it can get a bit confusing, I find that is what makes it fun. If you get this game, though, I don't reccomend reading any guides until you've had your fill of tooling around. To me, at least, it makes the suprising game much more fun.ProsFirst off, the price! I think this should be worth much more.The narrator has a personality, and will indeed say different things depending on what you do throughout the game.There are SO many different endings, and I'm currently trying to get to them all. That being said, it is a time-well-spent undertaking since each one (most of them, at least) eludes to a bit more of the.. ""Story""The story isn't actually a set one.The acheivements- take a look at them, real quick. The developers are genuises.Each of the endings gives you something different.Its freaking hilarious. That's the main thing.The creativity behind it all. Play the game to understand.Cons As I said, it can get somewhat confusing, especially for gamers looking for a straightforeward story.The story is pretty wavering. I still don't understand it fully.You get NO instructions at the beginning of the game, even though the controls are basic WASD and the mouse.At least 9/10, Please just give it a go. I've never laughed this hard at a video game before.			"

												The Stanley Parable is not really a game, then again it is.Then again its not. Oh, look, now its pretending to be an alltogether different game.But all in all, it is just what it is: The Stanley ParableTheres nothing quite like this again on steam, so this is a dangerous affair for your dollars.Lets start by being mean to the game, as seldom people are.I honestly dont think that this is a game as good as the combined review-score puts it, and I honestly dont think its a game that has a large variety of people that would really >get< where the enjoyment lies.What rescues the stanley parable from being a weird outsider in the games playground is its very witty yet completely relateable approach of humor and its coherent way of telling (or not telling, or corrupting) a storyline. That I think is the one reason really everyone could give it a shot if its on sale.With regards to the mechanics: You can walk, you can interact or choose to not interact, that all. Its clean, it works, it has no bugs that I know of, and theres nothing that needs to be added to it, theres no missing part, everything makes sense. The Stanley Parable will be as challenging for you as your mind bends it to be. The biggest mechanic of this game are your own thoughts, and its very controversial to which degree it even could be called a game. This is not a casual buy like its advertised in my opinion, because the fun part happens outside of the screen.In some way you will get exactly of what you dont know you will get.Which absolutely seems like another plus, because buying this game now sounds like poetry.--------------------------------------------------------------------------So the only question that really counts and remains is: Do I recommend it for whatever it is, having played the whole game?It somewhat depends:- If you want it for the fun joyride you maybe have seen elsewhere, I dont recommend buying it except on sale. Not because its bad, but because I think 11,99 is too much for just the fun parts of the dialogue and the running around. You will have seen a fair bit of the game after playing 5 hours. (A more casual comparison to movies of course makes this worth it, but im comparing it to games, ultimately its your call.)- But, and the reason theres ultimately a thumbs up on this review: If you actually aspire to enter the whole brute force of the stanley parable, engage in its problems and think about just what the heck it all could mean. And If you want to explore in the empty office building of the entity named stanley and face the crisis of not knowing whats fake or real anymore, then its the time to stop reading this review right now, butcher your funds and start playing the game.For everyone that has the time and lust to wonder on his hands, this is what you would want to buy.

												Introspective, hilarious, and dark, this is very much a game ABOUT games.  Above all, it's about the illusion of choice and how a game's narrative is constructed around that.  How does the Narrator control the story when the Player has agency to not follow his instructions?  Is a choice between two identical doors actually a choice?  Why can't these people just play my game the way I want them to?  The Stanley Parable is a satire, and an ""arty"" one at that.Be sure to play the demo, even if you plan on getting the game.  It's a completely seperate experience; nothing in it appears in the game proper.			"

The gameplay is smooth and you get to choose how your story ends to a degree (well more like the narrator chooses for you) and your choices affect the ending and sometimes even the look of the next playthrough. The acheivements are fun and some of them are hilarious with the narrator.

												A very short game... If you're a sheep.This game is very special, you can spend as much as 4 minutes and a bit or a few hours on this game. It's a kind of game that plays with the illusion of choice. What this game does is that it takes the 4th Wall, straps 20lbs of C4 to it, adds a sprinkle of thermite and lets it rip. But wait it ain't done with the 4th Wall yet oh no. It then fires 163613 jackhammers out of a cannon and a squirrel at it until that wall ceases to exist anymore. Donald Trump doesn't stand a chance against this game.You play as Stanley, or should I say ""Employee No. 427"". You sit in front of your 1980's era DOS interface CRT monitor and wait for instructions on which buttons to push on the keyboard. You are one of a plethora of generic employees who work for a corporation. What kind of corporation? I still have no clue. It kinda reminds me of the ""1984"" ad by Apple for their Macintosh.You are given instructions to follow by the narrator (a very amusing narrator I may add) of the game, but listening and conforming to those instructions is up to you, which also mean the consequences that follow for each instruction followed (or should I say not followed) are your responsibilty. It seems extremely linear at first, but once you realise you are the one controlling Stanley and not the narrator, the possibilities are endless.I aqcuired this game in the Summer Steam Sale for €2.39.Is it worth it? YesIs it up to you to decide if it is? Abso-****ing-lutelyMy rating? 7.5/10			"

												""Please die.""This game is the definition of ""mind♥♥♥♥ing"". Also, it is the first game I've ever seen that actually plays you, not in a funny 4th wall way like Portal, it actually go meta inside your head, messing with your feelings and driving you crazy.The Stanley Parable is a piece of art that unravels the true nature of game design and choice. The narrator does an excellent job at dragging you into Stanley's world, and you will actually feel your heart race even if you can only open doors and press buttons as gameplay action.There is only one caveat: this game will make you hate it, so keep calm and it's best advised not to  play it continuously in a single playthrough for extended periods of time (it is possible to ""beat"" the game and see all alternative endings in 6 hours of straight play, but that will make your mind weary).There is not much else to be said without spoiling the fun, it is already a classic and it is a must for any respectable gamer.

												The Stanley Parable is a fascinating commentary on game design that simultaneously informs and entertains. You'll navigate the drab corridors of your mundane office constantly accompanied by the delightful narrator, instructing and reacting to your every decision. Your actions dynamically impact the games story and can lead you to any of 20+ endings available. Throughout the 5 hours I spent exploring the game, I was always excited to see whats around the next corner and explore every corner of a world that richly rewards its players for taking the path less traveled. Watching my friends play was an equally entertaining experience. Highly recommended with the games brevity in mind. 8/10			"

												8/10Not sure where to start with this review, but I will say this: this game messes with your mind! In terms of mechanics, this game is incredibly simple. It is a walking simulator set in a bland office building. But, in a game like this, mechanics and visuals really don't matter. For this little game, all you need to worry about is the satirical narrator and your choices.The Stanley Parable is an extremely peculiar but hilarious game. The humor is witty and sarcastic, and on occasion, can be rather dark. Also, forget the fourth wall in this one; it is practically nonexistent. Of course, we have the narrator to thank for that. He is extremely reactive to the player's behavior and will comment on the strangest things. (Get the Door 430 achievement; that's one of the best pieces of commentary in the game!) However, he also has some moments where he will either rail on the player in a fierce rant, or seriously guilt trip him/her in a somewhat dejected manner. These rapid changes in his dialogue can be a little disarming but give the narrator more depth as a character (if that is how you see him), thus having the potential to affect the way you play the game.Despite its fantastic humor, the game's primary focus is on its philosophical topics. Most of the time, those topics dance around in the background and are alluded to by the narrator. Where the really shine is in the ""endings"". Each one, no matter how quirky or funny, has some sort of message to convey. Some, as would be expected in this type of game, focus on the nature of choices, and whether or not they matter. Others may touch on subjects such as the meaning of life or one's perception of reality. These ""endings"" can be incredibly thought-provoking and deep; one in particular left me staring at my computer for about 15 minutes in contemplative shock. And, when I describe it as a shock, it's not hyperbole.Of course, what you get out of said endings is completely up to you. How will you interpret the endings and what the narrator has to say about them?So, to sum it all up, The Stanley Parable is an extremely clever and philosophical game that is sure to keep the player's attention all the way through(?). It is one of those special games that can give you both memorable laughs and the occasional existential crisis! Enjoy!			"

												I'm not even sure what I played (or rather, am still in the process of playing).There is no right or wrong way to play this game. You cannot break this game. (Okay you CAN but that's somewhat hard to do.) The developers have thought of everything and have considered how you would react as a person, so they've added as much as they could. ""What if I revisit this ending?"" They considered that, too.This seems to be a game with an illusion of choice that's aware of that illusion. Or is it a game? Is it an interactive story? Can it really be a story? A walking sim with soul, really? And what of the narrator? Is he too, just an illusion? You're going to ask yourself a lot of questions. ""What was that I just experienced? I need to do that again. But what if I just go through this door this time?""I kept clicking. I clicked when there was no obvious objective and discovered that was the right way. Or was that the wrong way? The irritation I caused the narrator delighted me, so this seemed like the right way to play to me. Of course until I splattered against the pavement, causing him much horror and sadness because ""I must hate him"" for some reason.What's the downside? Well, it's pretty easy to get the majority of endings in a short amount of time if you're that eager to keep going because you're just that interested. There is a hard ending that will take hours of dedicated game play, but even that becomes simple once you realize that yes, the developers have even thought about ways to obtain that ending. You'll end up resorting to playing just to take a screenshot of every easter egg just to say you found it. Not a horrible thing, but replayability-wise, the game doesn't sink a huge amount of time.That's about it, though. Otherwise, allow me to join those adding their voices to the glowing praise to The Stanley Parable.The break room is truly a work of art.Truly.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a really great game when you have some time to spend on a fun and confusing game without a real purpose. It is a game basing on choices you make and the storyline is depending on that choices and changes with them as well. There are some outcomes that really are surprising and for some five bucks on sale it's really worth spending some hours in.Although if you are an achievment hunter like I am, I would say it has really easy ones, but they are really long and difficult to get if you do them the legitimate way. I did the commitment achievment and wasn't able to play anything else on a tuesday afternoon what really was an upsetting fact, but all in all I really enjoyed its basic gameplay and changing storyline. The narrator also makes this game what it is, so I can only recommend it.			"

												A wonderfully philosophical game that if paid the attention it deserves, will make you question just who Stanley really is, just who the narrator really is, and provide deep philosophical questions for you ponder, such as who is really in control of your reality, both as Stanley, and as whoever you are offline.It may not be who you think it is.There are no guns and no enemies to kill, no moon nazis or crafting diamond weapons on a crafting table with a hammer. Just philosophical deepness that is unsurpassed in any other game Ive played, but presented in wonderfully engaging way.This game is not for everyone. It is a very cerebral game at heart, that demands many more hours thinking about the story and how it plays out, than actually playing in it virtually.The voice acting of Kevan Brighting (Narrator) is also exceptional. It is above and beyond any video game voice work Ive ever heard. IMO, it is now the gold standard to compare other video game voice work to, hands down.I fully recommend this game to everyone.			"

												All I can say is, the game may look like Portal, and yes, it has a Portal feel to it, but don't go getting this game expecting Portal, because what you get is something completely different, but not a bad different.  Oh no-no-no.  This is a very good different.Basically the game is supposedly about making decisions...Which is true to some extent...But what it basically comes down to is you going down each different route one after another hunting each ending you can possibly find, whilst being narrated by a rather charming and witty narrator.  Who IS basically the reason you play the game anyway.Basically, if you enjoy intelligent humour and a video game that somewhat mocks other video games and film scenarios, then this is most definitely the game for you!  Whilst the game will sometimes hold your hand yo get you around, a lot of the time, you will find yourself wadering into a path you had never noticed the first time you went there before, even though it was there the whole time from the start.I would most definitely recommend this game!My rating: 88/100			"

												Introspective, hilarious, and dark, this is very much a game ABOUT games.  Above all, it's about the illusion of choice and how a game's narrative is constructed around that.  How does the Narrator control the story when the Player has agency to not follow his instructions?  Is a choice between two identical doors actually a choice?  Why can't these people just play my game the way I want them to?  The Stanley Parable is a satire, and an ""arty"" one at that.Be sure to play the demo, even if you plan on getting the game.  It's a completely seperate experience; nothing in it appears in the game proper.			"

												There's so much to like about this game - the humour and writing, the not-so-subtle commentary on game design, the hidden endings - yet perhaps the greatest strength of ""The Stanley Parable"" is its underlying heart. The ability to empathize with the titular Stanley as he fails or succeeds in various degrees is what ties the whole package together. Plus, you can blow through all the content in five hours or so, making this is a quick investment with a ton of payoff.			"

												Recommending this would depend on the price it was going for. At full price definitely not. This game is very short. There are multiple endings for replayability (when i say replayability i mean walking in another direction to hear the narrator say something different) though. It is basically a good waste of an hour, so that all depends on what price you would put on that. I would say wait for a bundle as anything else seems like overpaying especially the full RRP. Still, it is a game that deserves to be played at least once.			"

A game you could play in a few minutes, or a game you could spend hours on, and each time is a differen experiece. A linear story with a bunch of branching, and branches of those branches! I've yet to experience an identical run twice, and while eventually it will start to happen, just the initial first sit-down and run through of playing a few hours makes this game well worth it. The sound track and visuals are also truly amazing, with an incredible amount of thought placed into this product.			"

												I'm not even sure if we can call this a game, but if it IS a game, then it's one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly hilarious games I've ever played. It just likes to f#ck arround with you, to the point that you notice it, this game breaks the fouth wall as much as Deadpool, and it's probably as funny.As usual, let's start with the bad stuff: First of all, the price. The game nearly has no real gameplay at all, it's rather a weird interactive story...And yet it's priced 12€? Good thing I picked it up on sale, for 8€. Some might argue that it was still too much, but it was worth it for that price. I do recommend to wait for a sale. And that's it. That's the only bad things the game has, lack of gameplay, and a pricetag too high. What does this game do well?You start as a guy named Stanley, a man who's job is to push buttons. Wow, he already works more than the government. Suddenly, though, he got the feeling of...What? That's where you get in. This is not Stanley's adventure. This is your adventure, because you're Stanley, I'm Stanley, he's Stanley, everyone is Stanley. Well, except the Government, those guys are Doctor Rektus Retardus♥♥♥♥♥♥Evacuation II. You do what you like. You want to advance the story? Do it. You want to go and do what you like? Do it. You want to stay in your room and not play? THERE'S EVEN AN ENDING FOR THAT.That's the game's selling point. The fact that, in a story this dumb, and short, there's an amazing number or endings, some of them reaching high levels of originality, or just being rather surprising, and unexpected. Sorry, I just can't bring myself to spoil any of them (I did spoil the one about not leaving the room...But that's the easiest ending of the game, dude. It takes like 2 seconds). If you want to trully experience this game, DO NOT LOOK FOR GUIDES, DO NOT LOOK FOR PLAYTHROUGHS, DO NOT LOOK TO LET'S PLAYS, ONLY LOOK AT THE TRAILER, AND THE DEMO. The story of the game is pretty much 8/10 of the game, the other 2 being the amazing narrator, and you will have infinitely more fun if you don't expect any of that crap to happen.The game is NOT worth 12€, like I said. But in a 50% sale, for 6€? At that price it would be a SHAMEFUL DISPLAY not to buy it. It's your choice, Stanley. Buy the game, and have fun, or look yourself in the first room for eternity.			"

												This is one of those games which deserves to be avoided at all costs until you can pick it up for yourself. Why? Because the best part of The Stanley Parable is seeing things unfold with no prior knowledge of what you're getting into. It's a hilarious game, that's for sure. But it can also be un-nerving to the point of being terrifying, amongst other things. That much I'll tell you, but I won't explain why. This is also a game which can be very fun with friends, I think.

												""None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why they should.""Yeah well... You guys should play this! Is good game!It is not a game in the traditional sense, but a bit like a walk-and-listen-simulator. You are free to walk anywhere you want, and depending on your actions, the story will change. - That might sound boring to you, but it definitely is not. Although I agree that this game might not be fun for everybody, it was a lot of fun for me.			"

												There's so much to like about this game - the humour and writing, the not-so-subtle commentary on game design, the hidden endings - yet perhaps the greatest strength of ""The Stanley Parable"" is its underlying heart. The ability to empathize with the titular Stanley as he fails or succeeds in various degrees is what ties the whole package together. Plus, you can blow through all the content in five hours or so, making this is a quick investment with a ton of payoff.			"

												This game is just ummmmmmmmmm. I started playing not knowing what i was going into, and within the first 5 miniutes my mind had just been ♥♥♥♥ed.  This game is so well made with alot of funny jokes, that keep you going for along time. The game probally has about 3 hours of gameplay when you first play, but you can keep going back to without getting bored.The narrator of the game has a very well choosen voice which doesnt get repetitive, but just keeps getting better.If you are looking for a short game then i would defintly recomend this game!

												Toy with the role of narrative in video games, the illusion of choice, and with just how narrow objectives in video games really are while breaking the fourth wall in The Stanley Parable. It's a game for people who spend forever wandering and poking about in games, for people who try to break games, and for people who defy games' orders just to see if they account for it.That said, it's not without its faults. The most savage review of The Stanley Parable I've seen was by its own head developer and he accurately points out that TSP is complicit in everything it skewers for lack of ability to think of better options. Let's not throw the word ""genius"" around willy-nilly. ""Clever"" is more accurate. TSP isn't going to start a revolution in storytelling in games, in addressing the problems inherent in providing choice within pre-constructed environments, or anything of that sort. It's just very clever. For me, it was enough ""clever"" to be happy with the purchase. Your mileage may vary.			"

												A very interesting game, Stanley Parable is a game that makes you respond to the game. All the possible choices can lead to possible endings, though an improvement that could be made is more endings and more choices. This game is a choice to those who wants to choose choices, and of course they are some easter eggs that are interesting when they're found. A little note here is that this game is too short, and can easily be finished within 2 or 3 hours. Of course, there may be people who play it 24 hours + for an achievement, but this game is truly a story.			"

												This is one of those games which deserves to be avoided at all costs until you can pick it up for yourself. Why? Because the best part of The Stanley Parable is seeing things unfold with no prior knowledge of what you're getting into. It's a hilarious game, that's for sure. But it can also be un-nerving to the point of being terrifying, amongst other things. That much I'll tell you, but I won't explain why. This is also a game which can be very fun with friends, I think.

												A game that parodies games. This game isn't about the gameplay or graphics, it's about the experience. Through the game, you'll have to make choices, leaving to a particular ending. You can choose to obey the narrator or to disobey him, leaving to rather amusing dialouge. If you have a medium-tier computer and you do not own this game, you should doubt your life choices.			"

												First, that game has hilarious narration.When looked at from one side, this game tells a short story about desperate worker class employant Stanley, who tries to escape the evil paths that were laid out before him. The narrator tries to help you on your path, and will respond to your choices with often unexpected and witty behaviour. Like, he will go angry at you when you refuse to leave the nice and cozy broom chamber, or get desperate when you try to ruin his narration by doing the opposite he tells you to. Then it also mocks you, either with giving you useless rewards or just offend you for even playing it. Worth a pretty good laugh and also an extremely likeable setting and characters.When looking at it from the other side, the game offers a deep philosophical discussion about choice, and how it influences our every lives on a daily basis. How it appears to be unique, to be freely available to have, almost a right to everyone. And how different choices in games are compared to choices in real life, and WHY we play the games we play. Why we emphasize on freedom of choice in games so much, even though there is no true freedom in a game ever to be had. But does this really differ from what we face in life, or is it just different approach to it?If you want to, this game can ask you a lot of question, and maybe also give you some answers. But don't expect them to come to you black in white, as the game is simply a discussion about choice, it doesn't try to answer it but moreso allow you to see it from different angles and then decide for yourself what you really want to believe.The game IS short, and it emphasizes multiple playthroughs and secret-searching to find the more than a dozen hidden endings and paths. Also it might be frustrating at times or even call you a fool, but it ever does it with a clear intention. It is NOT a game about progress, as you keep starting over and over again at the same place (which for sure is also an intention to reflect on vicious cycles we tend to run into).But it is a lovely game, and surely made a dent into the history of gaming (and into a few gamers brains), and I can recommend it to anyone willing to have patience with a game that revolves more around yourself and does have probably the most hilarious narration and unique humour a game had in the last few years.Also, if you decided to play it I suggest you watching this video AFTER you played it:

DON'T watch it before you haven't played at least through the most obvious paths and endings, as it takes away a lot of the charm of trying to find out yourself what something means and also spoils quite a bit.OH, and PLAY THE DEMO before you play the game or decide to buy it. It offers completely different content but in the same way the original does and is like a chapter on it's own.Also there is the mod which the game is based upon, still freely available to download here if you aren't convinced yet: http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-stanley-parable8			"

(Atmosphere, world design, dialogue, humour)PLAY THE DEMO. Really, it contains different content from the game and still gives you a feel for what it's like.			"

												Once upon a time, a player bought a game called ""The Stanly Parable."" He enjoyed controlling Stanley. In a game where the player explores an area, and plays the story however he wants to play it, there was much fun to be had, but the best fun of all was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the game's narrator, who in turn trolled the player when he tried to earn an achievement by clicking on door 430 five times. Ah yes, poor ol' Stanley, who is at the mercy of two evil forces constantly fighting against each other; the player and the Narrator. But enough about, that. What did the player do when he reviewed the game?One day, the player decided to make a review for the game. He suddenly heard a voice in his head, telling him ""This game sucks! Click on the thumbs down!"" But the player decided not to listen to this voice, and instead clicked the thumbs up. Then the voice said ""Do you not realize who I am?! This is the voice of a snobby hipster gamer who complains about every single popular game, and any other game he chooses not to like just to look cool! You can't just defy me like that! Do you not know that people like me consist of the 2,176+ people that give this game a bad rating just cuz?! We will hunt you down! I'm one of those people you don't want to mess with, chump. I'm one of those half-witted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who do cool stuff like hating on Red Dead Redemption and saying that Gun is a better game, even though it's got potato graphics, a much smaller world to explore, and just less content in general. This game isn't even a game! It sucks!""But the player decided not to listen to this trivial whiner, and instead praised the game for what it truly was: an exploration game that allows you to test outcomes. He didn't expect it to be something it wasn't meant to be, like a shooter. He praised it for what it was as a game. And everyone lived happily ever after, unlike people who behave like this guy.

												A captivating adventure into the assumptions of game design itself. If you are a next-level game enthusiast, as in; you enjoy the discussion of what games are, can do, mean, etc just as much and maybe more than playing through games themselves; this is for you. Technically, The Stanley Parable is less of a traditional game and more of a choose-your-own-adventure… Or is it? Or are all games really just about toying out the desired/possible outcomes? These are the conversations the Stanley Parable evokes and it is less played and more unlocked like a puzzle. I’d actually prefer you to not read or watch any footage of the game if you can help it; for much of the game’s charm is in your brain’s reaction as you make decisions. Much of that tension is lost if the events of the game are spoiled, or almost as badly, if another person holds the responsibility of making choices instead of you.I’ve been far too vague, I know. You, Stanley, wander about a seemingly innocuous office environment listening (or not) to a narrator. The “game” is about making choices and unlocking the outcomes the designers have made for you. Some of these outcomes are unlocked obviously, some require a bit of ingenuity and others literally require hours of dedication. My suggestion is to dig into this game chillaxed out with your own preferred inebriation (drugs are bad kids, mmkay?) and find as much out for yourself as you can. After a few hours then start googling around, because the things you find yourself will have more value to you than the outrageous stuff you missed. If any of this nerdy♥♥♥♥♥♥sounds interesting to you, but it without hesitation. The Stanley Parable will spruce up the scholarliness of your Steam library like a PhD hanging on a wall next to a bookshelf.  "

												Looking for new references to make? Look no further. This game, because it is based in real life decisions, gives you the ultimate source of reactions to other people. About the game: This game gives you a sense of being powerful, and yet it turns out there is a plan for every decision you make. Definitely recommend it. Buy the game.			"

												This game is the ultimate in disobeying the laws of physics.  Some would say that it is like Antichamber.  Yet their sound must have been off, because of the Narrator, a deliciously funny guy who seems to have a vendetta against broom closets. If you are considering it, stop considering, start buying.

												A very satirical game. You play as ""Stanley"" who works in an office trying to find your coworkers. The main concept of the game is finding all of the different endings based on your choices throughout it.Pros:-Hilarious-Simple-Sarcastic-Multiple EndingsCons:Really shortNever updated with new endings			"

												Very few games have impressed me the way ""The Stanley Parable"" did. I was stunned to see I only played for 2.7 hours when writing this, because it feels like I spend a lifetime in this game, walking through the ever shifting and changing story, finding new paths with every turn.The Stanley Parable is about choosing or not choosing, following or disregarding the path laid out in front of you, and about one of the freaking best narrations in videogame history. And quite a few of the best jokes; I think the games that made me laugh the most were Portal 2 and The Stanley Parable. But not only laughter, also deep confusion, mindbending twists and moments of sadness are part of your way through the hallways.On a whole whether you should buy this game depends on what you want from a game: If you want hours upon hours of entertainment, this will not satisfy you. But if you value an interesting experience, even for a few bucks, this is definetily your thing! Plus, the time you actually spend with the game is quite a bit longer, considering how much you will have to ponder what actually happened before your eyes.Also: Did you get the ""Broom closet ending""? The ""Broom closet ending"" was my favourite!			"

												My first run through, I followed the narrator's advice the whole way through, and got that ending. It wasn't anything special, so I figured all endings were like that. Uninstalled the game that night. Reinstalled it several months later, thinking there was some stuff I was missing.Of course there was. Some of the fun in the game is in ignoring the Narrator and doing whatever you want to do. I have never had a game make me laugh so hard at the consequences of staying in a bloody janitor's closet several times throughout the game. There are many endings, and part of the fun is finding them all. Be adventurous, disregard the narrator, jump out seemingly innocuous windows - you are Stanley. Choose your path.			"

												The Stanley Parable is  breaking new ground,allowing the player to do, literally, anything.As I'm sure you're aware, this is a very hard task to accomplish in this economy,but the The Stanley Parable presses on, pushing the boundaries of what's physically possible with in games.I recommend you buy this game if you are interested in the following,Level design;Character design;One of the best social networks in a game;World domination;Some of the most in depth story arcs i've ever seen in a video game character;And puddin.So if any of those interest you in the slightest, I suggest you buy this game.No. I suggest you buy ten of this game.yeah, that sounds better,ten,nice even ten,good ol ten,ten doesn't want to go, but its his time now,but the universal will sing him to his sleep...Uhh...where was I?Oh yeah.To some up,world domination,10,buy this game, I highly recommend it.

												You think this is a boring game? You wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ is going one when you start in this creepy office, no one\'s there. And there\'s this guy talking, the narrator. What?But wait, there\'s more. He tells you what to do, what you can do, will you obey? Will you not? Make the choice, your story will change, again and again.Can you do it? Can you not? Is it the end? What? I asked myself all of the above when playing. And I freaking loved it. I laughed pretty much all the way, along with a WTF face.If you like twisted endings, beginnings, stories and paths...try this out.			"

												This has got to be one of my favourite PC games!! Everything from the fresh concept to the amazing narrative voice work make this a very enjoyable experience I think everyone should enjoy.Game Showcase-


YouTube™ Video: (Game Showcase)The Stanley Parable- Messing with the Narrator 

			Views: 10		

			In today's Game Showcase we take a look at The Stanley Parable. A game in which the narrator is trying to tell you a story, except you don't always half to do what the narrator says.		

      -------Summary at the bottom-------GameplayThe gameplay feels fresh and its very enjoyable. The narrator tells you what to do and you follow his directions, or try to change the story by taking a different route. The narrator adapts to what you do through his dialouge as well as makes snarky hilarious comments towards you for not following him in the beginning. The more you change the narration the more he becomes frustrated and the more its noticable in the dialouge. No matter what you do, it seems the deveopers were planning on you being able to do that. In one instance you can glitch through a window to where you thought you had broke the game and exited the level, but nope. The narrator picks right up telling you ""I bet you thought you could get out of here"" ""is this what you really want? is to leave?"". The game is however a little short but there are so many different endings some more complicated than others and some very hard to produce. This can keep you playing for long after, trying to see all the different endings and experience all the hilarious and clever lines the narrator has.GraphicsThe graphics are average, but nothing to special. Its built on the Source Game Engine so think other source games such as half life 2, counter strike, etc.. Levels are well designed and their are lots of different areas to explore and check out, but first you must figure out how to get to them :).AudioThe audio in this game is by far the best part. The narrator is hilarious and clever and will keep you smiling and laughing while you try to trip him up. The actor chosen to voice the narrator was a perfect pick in my opinion. His voice stuck in my head for days after. SummaryThe stanley parable filled my need for a fresh game. The clever game design allows for so many different endings that will keep it feeling enjoyable as you listen to the hilarious narrator try to keep up with you as you try to trip him up. If your looking for something that feels a little fresh and will give you a good laugh then this will satisfy that.			"

												I can't really say anything more than that it's a great game about the stanley parable without spoiling it, so I'll rather recommend downloading the demo. The demo is a bonus level, kind of a prequel too, to The Stanley Parable, so you'll get a taste of how the game is. If you like the demo, you'll like the game, if not, you probably won't like The Stanley Parable either, so what are you waiting for, download the Demo!			"

Short Version:THIS GAME MAKES BIOSHOCK INFINITE LOOK LIKE BAD FANFICTION. F**KING PLAY THIS GAME.Long Version:The Stanley Parable is a game about possibilities. Every time you restart the game, you enter a parallel universe where everything is (almost) the same except for which actions the player takes, among a few other random variables (I.E. whether the floor is covered in papers). The game's sole purpose is to examine the very nature of storytelling in video games, pointing out just how ""fake"" the illusion of choice is, and laughing at the player for thinking they have some semblance of control over each predefined story branch.It's literally impossible to go into further detail without spoiling something about the game. There's no real gameplay to spoil - hell, the player can't even jump. The only thing you can do is walk around, push buttons, and choose whether to go left or right based on the narrator's dialogue. Everything else that matters about this game is the ways in which the game sets up certain expectations and then subverts the hell out of them in some spectacularily ballsy ways. I'm honestly amazed that there isn't an ending where the game crashes to desktop.I don't care who you are or what you're interested in. All I know is that if you call yourself a gamer, you need to play this game. For the love of whatever-your-diety-of-choice-is, just play this game. You won't regret it.			"

												Similar Games:It’s fairly unique, although certain moments are reminiscent of Antichamber.The Good:The narrator’s voice acting is excellent; it’s easy to forget that it’s someone reading lines.Having an invisible narrator delivering an awesome performance has two distinct benefits to the overall game: 1) enabling the player to imagine their own version of the antagonist and 2) sidestepping having to model a visual representation that would live up to the player’s expectations. A clever move from a game design standpoint, whether intentional or not.Some seriously creepy/unexpected moments, even having played the mod version. One scene left me literally staring at the screen in disbelief.Triggered animations are perfectly timed – there are no “glitch” moments because you made it to an area before the game thought you would, etc.The game includes a “Disable Achievements” option! (Ed. note: this may have swayed my entire opinion of the game)The text on in-game computer screens balances between tongue-in-cheek parodies of corporate jargon and self-aware references to the gaming industry. Somehow, neither of these manage to break the immersion.The multiple “endings” vary immensely, and manage to pull the curtain back in satisfyingly different ways each time.The Bad:The “games are not art” crowd might dislike this game due to sticking with their party platform; they are wrong.Players who try to speed-run through the game will miss out on the excellent voice acting, and may actually cut off the narrator mid-phrase. This is more of a critique against speed-runners than the game.The loading screens kinda (barely) give away the concept of the game’s “ending.”The Writing:This is one of the most well-written games I have ever played. I was a huge fan of The Stanley Parable when it was “only” a HL2 mod, and the full game hits the same marks and then some.The game has a “Choose Your Own Adventure” feel, and does a great job of seamlessly adapting to virtually any action the player makes.The entire game manages to convey a sense of underlying dread, regardless of the choices you make – even the “happy” outcomes are never portrayed as being 100% certain.Did I make time to complete it:Many times, although (spoiler alert) that’s kinda “the point.”Recommended Purchase Price:If you’re a fan of unconventional games, philosophy, psychology, existentialism, spiritual ennui, fatalism, causality and/or intellectually challenging games that make you think about anything whatsoever, this is a must-buy. $11.99 is a STEAL.Reviewer:Mudlabhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

												Very creative game. clever writting filled with surprises. Really gives players a sense of ""choice"" for their own ending. However, this is a game that can only be played once for a few hours. Once you know the ending(s), there isn't anything worth replaying the game for unless you love walking in an endless cycle.Is it worth full price? No. But this game is definitely worth experiencing if it is on sale.  "

												You're paying for a 'sudden realization', not a game. A narrative and satire, not a game (but still a decent narrative. I enjoyed the narration for what it's worth. Kinda funny). Don't fall for the cryptic desciptions on steam thinking there's a mystery to solve that nobody wants to give away like I did. The concept is pretty clever and it has it's moments but The Stanley Parable is still overpriced for what it offers in my opinion. I didn't exactly know what I was paying for when I bought it, but I heard/read it was somthing amazing and this and that. I'm not usually swayed by those types of reviews but this one had some type of psycological lure to it I couldnt resist. The  demo didn't clarify the game for me but made me more curious, so I guess it served it's purpose (lol).... When I actually bought it I expected a challenge of some sort, and because I don't like to be spoiled I was reluctant to read some reviews labled 'spoiler' or watch many videos. When I realized the 'point' of the stanley parable was the whole spoiler nobody wants to give away I stopped playing, feeling the same way alot of other reviwers did. . I felt like I could have watched someone play it for free and recieve the message just fine.Moral of the story: Know what you're paying for. Really make sure you know what you're paying for...			"

												A rather clever game, though people saying it's brilliant or genius are blowing it out of proportion. Got it on sale for $3 and that's about what it's worth. I have about 7 hours on file but a couple of those are from letting friends play it, but I finished just about every ending in about 2 1/2 hours, and there is zero replay value once you've completed all the multiple endings. Imo not worth the $15 price tag because it lacks replay value but worth it on sale for $3 for those who like ""Mind f*ck"" type games or games that are 'different'.			"

												I picked this up on sale for $5.99, because I've heard good things and thought ""Only six bucks, why not?"". If I had paid the full price for this game ($14.99 as of right now), I'm sure I would have felt cheated and ripped off.Let me elaborate. The Stanley Parable is not a terrible experience. I say ""experience"" rather than ""game"" for reasons I will explain momentarily. The Stanley Parable makes some decent points about video games and video game narratives. There was some good work put into the project, and it does succeed in delivering its message.Here's the issue: There is nothing in The Stanley Parable that really justifies purchasing it. The entire lesson that it teaches (the very reason it exists is because the developers wanted to teach this lesson), could have been conveyed just as well (if not better) in a short video or a magazine article. You would gain just as much benefit from watching a walkthrough of The Stanley Parable as you would from actually playing it. The gameplay in The Stanley Parable is minimal. There are no items to collect, no secret doors to open, no objectives to complete, nothing to do besides listen to a voice lecture you. It actually makes matters worse that The Stanley Parable is well aware of how basic its gameplay is, and simply hangs a lampshade on the issue.As far as being a philosophical message about video games (and, in some ways, life itself), The Stanley Parable is great. As far as being a video game, The Stanley Parable is awful. It seems like The Stanley Parable is getting hailed as a form of highly intellectual entertainment that some people simply won't understand. The general consensus (whether the developers intended this or not) seems to be that if you don't like The Stanley Parable, it's because you simply didn't grasp its revolutionary and intelligent message. This is not true. The message, while interesting, is not complicated or highly intellectual at all. And if you didn't like The Stanley Parable, it's probably because you were disappointed with its basic gameplay and low amount of content.I don't recommend purchasing The Stanley Parable for full price. It might be worth picking up if you can snag it while it's on sale, but frankly, you might at well watch one of the many walkthroughs on YouTube. You'll get the same value without spending a dime.

He stared for hours trying to make it perfect, clearing lines and rewriting each sentence until it sounded like a beautiful poem... but it still wasn't right and he had had just about enough of the rewriting.

												Very interesting game. Or is it a game? I am, perhaps, still playing...or maybe I am not...I may never know. This game, if that what it truely is, might be appreciated by explorers and people who are entertained by Portal's GladOS comments.I beat the game in, I think, about 5 to 10 minutes. I then started playing, again, with different choices and beat the game...and beat it again...or did I beat it? I think there are some more choices to be had, I think I shall go back and try them.Personally, I really enjoy narrated stories which has narration changing based upon what the character is doing. So this game filled that slot perfectly.Also, if a person were interested in attempting to build a game, to test concepts, or what-not, I think this game provides a very good model.			"

												Play this game now. seriously!!. The Stanley Parable is unlike any other game I`v seen before mostly because it never gets old. there are many choices you face in the game for example I don`t want to spoil to much but in the beginning of the game you will face two doors depending on which you choose will lead you down a another path. But what really amazes me is that the game gives you the freedom to make the choices you want to choose, While other games usually have an invisible barrier of somekind blocking your path from certain hallways, in the Stanley Parable you are aloud to walk down those hallways. For example I was playing the game for about the third or second time looking for a differnt ending. I passed the door towards the end of the hall I always past. But then the idea ran through my head what if I could open it. I never tried it before because in most other games I had played I would try to open doors and nothing would happen. But to my suprise the door opened. In I stepped a broom closet. I don`t want to give away to much but the narrator after that told many jokes for example< ""there`s nother in there"" and ""oh I suppose next time you see your friends your going to ask them if they ever got the broom closet anding in the Stanley Parable"". To wrap it all up, this game is amazing I think everyone should enjoy the experience of the game that feels like it never ends.			"

Probably the best mod-game that ever made it through Greenlight.I have to admit, it was really weird for the first ten minutes or so -- and this is considering that it'll take something like two hours to check out every ending there is -- but I truly enjoyed the rest of the time with this truly fine made game.

The regular price is a bit high which is why I went during the sale for it, didn't regret it though. If you don't have this game (or liked the demo) BUY IT. Don't spoil yourself by reading the plot or something like that, you really won't regret it. Without any doubt one of the best games of 2013.  "

												You play the role of Stanley, the titular protaganist that seems satisfied with his extremely boring life. But ""play"" here is more of term for acting out a part than engaging in a game. The Stanley Parable is barely even a game, but instead an interactive fiction that entices you to go down the same doors again and again in the hope that you will see all of the games many endings. There's nothing to collect, no one to kill, and you can't even jump. You just turn down halls and go down doors. On papar, this may sound boring, but the way it's done is the charm of the game. The Narrator is reminiscent of Portal's Glados: you're never quite sure if he's your friend, your enemy, or your master. 40% of the games enjoyability is because of him and the voice actor who plays him. The rest of the enjoyment is deciding what path to go on or just finding new ones. Each of them means something. WHether it's poking fun at mainstream gaming tropes or telling you a sad story that may actually reflect your life, you'll genuinely want to see everything this deceptively complex ""game"" has to offer.

												So... the Stanley Parable. Trying not to be repetitive. Trying really hard not to be repetitive and overtly hip. It's a game that plays itself in more sense than one. At the same time, being the thing it is, it lets you in deeply, makes you have a very good look on what's going on. If it wasn't meant for you, you will stop playing it after 20 minutes at most. If it was meant for you you will stop playing it after two hours at most but what you will play in those two hours will not be un-played for a while.Bottom line, I think I love it. This computer screen makes me say so, anyway. But I kinda want to hate it, to love it even more.And that, I hope, sums up how I played it. You should give it a go.			"

Each play through last about 30 mins to 20 mins. Ive only played an hour and ahve completed 3 of the 15 storys, and have had tremendous fun. i will say that the more you disobeye the narorator the more fun it is. My only con is that i think its allitle to much money for how long it is. i would set the price at $10 but never the less $15 is a great price!

												To be utterly and completely honest and sincere, this game is hilarious, thought-provoking, mind-boggling, and revelation-enducing. The experience is one where you'd have to see it for yourself to experience the true wonder; where you yourself would form your own thoughts about the game whilst playing it. You can't get the full experience just by watching a YouTube commentary. Hands down, this game was an incredible ride and I've been looking forward to it ever since the release of the original Half-Life 2 Mod. BUT, once it's over, the magic is kind of gone. I know you're discovering new stuff every minute and when you least expect it, the game takes another turn to a road you haven't been down before, but despite the slogan, there really is an end. While there's no true definite ending for the Stanley Parable (that's for you to decide), the end of the content comes rather quickly. My suggestion is to not binge this game, or else you'd be getting closer to having nothing left. Unless there's an update, I cannot truly experience the same things in the same ways I did the first time. My verdict: Buy it and play it. However, buy it whenever this game is on sale. That is all.			"

												This game is an amazing piece of art. I bought it not really knowing much about the Stanley Parable. It just seemed mysterious and interesting. I have no regrets about buying this game. I love this game way too much! I totally recommend it to everyone. Yes, even you COD fanatics out there lol.			"

												This game is definatley amazing. At first I thought it was the worst game ever, but then I realised there were tons of more endings. This is fun, and you will spend hours replaying this over and over, trying to accomplish all the endings. I rate this 9.5/10			"

												This game is nothing short of pure art. From the minimalistic GUI to the stellar storytelling, Galactic Café hit every mark perfectly with The Stanley Parable. The many endings and paradoxes will leave your mind in mush, and the way that the narrarator describes Stanley, a boring social worker, as an amazing and exciting character is one of the many, many highlights of this game. It seems like you have so much choice in what ending you experience, but yet you have no choice. it's a story that will shock the mind and effect the heart. There are many many funny and interesting easter eggs that GC placed in each room, and it seems as if you find a new thing every time you play the game.10/10. Out of this world.			"

That's all I can say about the game.Now, I believe that every human being should experience this game, that's all I need to say really. Buy it. Now. Not sure if you want to? Check out the demo.

												This game questions every convention and stereotype of video game story-telling; and does so with an incredible sense of humour. Stanley's story plays out however you want it to play out, and no matter where you decide to lead him, the journey is hilarious and immersive. In fact, 'The Stanley Parable' to me is more immersive than expansive RPGs such as Skyrim or Fallout.If you're looking for a laugh, something unusual, or to question the plot of every game you've ever played, give 'The Stanley Parable' (my 2013 game of the year) a try. You won't regret it.			"

												The Stanley Parable transcends the concept of a traditional game.  There are many endings, yet there is no real ending at all.  You will make choices, yet you will have no real choice at all.  Sound confusing?  Well it should.  The Stanley Parable will make you question reality, the notion of free will, and the meaning of life itself through its witty, cynical sense of humor.  The narration is top-notch, keeping you entertained throughout this unpredictable journey.  There is never a dull moment.  You will always be discovering new things, adding to the replayability factor of the game. This is not a game for everybody.  You will likely either love it or absolutely hate it.  I would suggest trying out the demo.  If you enjoy that, consider purchasing the full version.  If not, this probably isn't the game for you.			"

												Okay look, the game is different. It is very different from anything you have played really. What one finds in a game like this is not a single story. There is no right way to play this game. On your first playthrough you will really discover the type of person you are. The guy who does as he is told or the one who does not. However, These are all things that you have briefly read by others about the game. This part is for you. I say this with love my brothers and sisters. If you get this game and bash it, then you are just as myopic and misanthropic as the narrator makes stanely out to be. This is a great physcological game. You need to challenge yourself to defy the narrator and thats where the beauty comes in. The narrator, is not your average narrator. He is trying to work with you in one story, against you in another, and for the both of you in others. You will make him angry, you will make him happy, you will make him sad. The true beauty in this game is the dynamic range of emotions the narrator will expirence when you defy him. Imagine being the swellest guy in the world and you just want to help others. You have to help a man that the unthinkable happened to and he cant figure out why and you are the only one guiding him. Would you blame him or trust him? Thats for you to decide. Will the narrator cry with joy or repent with mallice thats for you to decide and for you to relate to. All in all the atmosphere is great, it most certainly is the most unique game I have played. Lastly, If you listen to this game not as a gamer not as a story hunter but rather with your heart, open mind, and your life expirences you find yourself feeling a wide range of emotions that compel you to do one thing on one play through and another on the other. This game really finds who you, who us, who we, the stanely's are. I do beleive the original asking price is a bit steep but scoop this gem while it is on sale and you will never regret it.			"

												The Stanley Parable is an interesting game. If I told you why it was interesting that would ruin the fun. This is a game about discovery, though the story is confined. This is a game about choices, though your choices will not matter. This is a game with a rich story that you will probably not even get on the first playthrough.This game is a tragedy, a comedy, and a drama all at once.This is game is the story of a man named Stanley. And this parable is one to be listened to.This game is very genre-breaking, and ground-breaking, and just ""breaking"" in general. It defies commonality and shows us how games can cause us to ponder the bigger questions by posing them in a simple, easy to understand way. There are many great things critics could say about this game, but I will say none of those. I'll just reccomend it, wholeheartedly.			"

												This game has achievements. Achievements are a very important part of games. Without achievements, Steam is worthless. Without Steam, Achievements are worthless. As you can see, this validates not only The Stanley Parable, but also validates videogames as an art form.The game has a Broom Closet. Inside the Broom Closet are objects. There is not an achievement for the Broom Closet so bear in mind that the Broom Closet is not as valuable as some other paths.This game has multiple endings. I like multiple endings. It is like Deus Ex and that is objectively the best game of all time according to respectable people. The Stanley Parable is also liked by those respectable people. Some people do not like the Stanley Parable, but they are not respectable people.You must own the Stanley Parable to be respectable, to achieve and get an ending that you chose by playing it. This is not an option or an oppinion.			"

												Where do I begin.I haven't read any other reviews so I'm sorry if this sounds like a copy and paste of someone else. I just wanted to throw in my two cents.This game is amazing. If you are even slightly on the fense about this game, buy it. It -is- one of those ""hush hush"" games where people dont like talking about it because it could ""spoil"" whats fun. Honeslty, when i tell my friends to play it, they ask ""why?"" its really hard to tell them. Do I spoil the main aspect of it? do I spoil how many times you can... well... but do I??? things that wont spoil anything: well, you play a guy and you listen to a different guy talk the entire time, but you get that if you just watch the trailer for the game, its the same opening you get when you play the game. What I can say though, for sure, is just that its so imaginative and creative. You can tell the makers really had fun with this game. It tries to take you through several emotions and a lot of times they really did hit me. I felt sad, happy, confused, a little scared, it all just comes together to make me really enjoy the time i spent playing this game. I told my friends to get it and they thanked me for the experience.I give this game, a Go Buy It out of 10			"

Just everything, from the humor, to the well-placed voice cues, to the sometimes ridiculous, sometimes sinister narrator.

												Play this game now. seriously!!. The Stanley Parable is unlike any other game I`v seen before mostly because it never gets old. there are many choices you face in the game for example I don`t want to spoil to much but in the beginning of the game you will face two doors depending on which you choose will lead you down a another path. But what really amazes me is that the game gives you the freedom to make the choices you want to choose, While other games usually have an invisible barrier of somekind blocking your path from certain hallways, in the Stanley Parable you are aloud to walk down those hallways. For example I was playing the game for about the third or second time looking for a differnt ending. I passed the door towards the end of the hall I always past. But then the idea ran through my head what if I could open it. I never tried it before because in most other games I had played I would try to open doors and nothing would happen. But to my suprise the door opened. In I stepped a broom closet. I don`t want to give away to much but the narrator after that told many jokes for example< ""there`s nother in there"" and ""oh I suppose next time you see your friends your going to ask them if they ever got the broom closet anding in the Stanley Parable"". To wrap it all up, this game is amazing I think everyone should enjoy the experience of the game that feels like it never ends.			"

												What can I say to recommend this game? I....I think I'm in love. I never thought one of my favorite games would have such minimal gameplay. This game is absolutely pointless and that's one of the many reasons why it's so wonderful. Everything about the execution of this game is just brilliant. Just everything, from the humor, to the well-placed voice cues, to the sometimes ridiculous, sometimes sinister narrator. The team that made this game deserve every penny they made from it, and many, many more pennies to come. This is genuinely worth your time and money. Go buy it now.			"

												Easily my favourite game of 2013. I'd heard about the mod for years, but never got around to giving it a go, and I'm kind of glad I didn't, because it might have lessened the impact this game had on me. I'm also glad that I did very little research into the game or what it was about. It was the demo that got me. I'd honestly thought I'd never be surprised by a game again, especially not one based on a mod that had been sitting around for years. I hope games like this inspire more developers to ignore established genres, stop trying to make the next AAA franchise, and try something new. Gaming should always be about innovation and trying to create a unique experience with each title, instead of just sticking to established formulae.			"

												The Stanley Parable isn't a game. It's an experiment in the thought process of giving a player the illusion of choice; how games make people believe that they actually have freedom of choice and what they do actually affects the game when in reality, everything is pre-destined no matter what. If I were to say anymore, it would simply spoil the ""game"".The Stanley Parable is a must-play title that deserves all of the atention it gets. It's a mind-puzzler that really makes you laugh and think about what games actually let you do. Everyone deserves to ""play"" this title.			"

												This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley has an adventure dictated by his good friend, the Narrator, a charming Brit with a dry sense of humour and a fondness of shattering the fourth wall. Stanley has free reign to as he desires. He may disobey the Narrator if he so chooses. Consequences may or may not apply. The Narrator may throw Stanley to the wolves, or save him via Deus Ex Machina. Literally anything could happen. Stanley could be subject to a huge mind control experiment, or may find himself at odds with the Stanley Parable Adventure Line, or may even visit a museum dedicated to the Stanley Parable, built on the ashes of the fourth wall. A thoughtful parody on the nature of choice, and whether it exists in video games, the Stanley Parable quickly and voilently alternates between goofy, charming endings, and endings that will give you nightmares for weeks to come. The Stanley Parable offers something for everyone.			"

												This is a great game. You have choices and you don't have choices. But what matters the most is that it gives you the CHOICE to have choices and choosing to have choices is a good choice. I thought it was a bit short, but I also did not work hard to make the game longer when I could have. So as you're trying to choose between this and another game, just remember that you don't have true choice in most other games. And then as you realize that you are choosing to buy this game with your own choice, realize how cool the idea of choice really is and that is what this game is all about it.			"

												it is a good game but it's got loads of pros and cons. I'll say go buy this game because it's actually a good change. Like the narrator (i think u all know already) is quirky and trying to be funny. There's loads of options which is really good. Though on the bad side, it's obvious that this game started as a half life 2 mod and it's like playing gmod murder the whole time, where u are a bystander every single round. I still think this game is good and would recommend 7/10.			"

												This game is unbelievably good.  It dwells at the limit of what could be called a ""game,"" playing with the idea of ""choice"" in video games by smashing the 4th wall and establishing a video game as an allegory for free will, all under the watchful, winking eye of a hilariously deadpan narrator.  It stomps staid video game tropes willy-nilly and tries its damndest to guide you through an adventure of epic proportions.  But the real adventure is found straying from the predetermined path.  Or are you really straying?  What is the adventure?  Play it and find out.  P.S. check the broom closet every time.			"

												Very entertaining game. Worth a purchase if it's on sale in my opinion. It doesn't last long, but on the other hand it does last long. It's really all about how you play it, or want to play it. Then you start asking yourself... is this really even a game... or is it... my life? I now think this game is my life. As I'm typing this I can't tell if I'm pretending to be Stanley (myself) typing away at a keyboard imitating myself in real life or if I'm myself (Stanley) and writing a review of a game about my life. I don't want to type this review of my life anymore. It's confusing me. Is this what I do for a living? I can't remember. Oh, wait, yes I can! That is what I do! I write reviews of my life for a living. I must be tired today for forgetting such simple facts. Well, it was enjoyable playing this game while it lasted but I want to go back to my apartment and my loving wife.			"

												This game has a very unique sense of humor that is a blend of both American and British humor.  In this game you play as Stanley, a grossly typical office worker, who's job is to push buttons.  When Stanley finds that one day, all of his coworkers are gone, it is up to the player to investigate just what's going on.There are many endings that provide an entertaining conclusion to Stanley's incredibly repeatable story.  If you do not wish to simply look up the endings, you are entitled to hours of fun, searching for all the endings.The game is very short, but the it loves to reset itself once you run into one of the many comical roadblocks that you'll eventually find.  The omniscient narrator provides interesting commentary, as well as playing the role of a partner of sorts.  He'll comment on your decisions, (or lack thereof, in some cases) and will also give you certain ideas as to what comes next.The game is immensly enjoyable, but has one flaw: this is simply an hd re-release.  Instead of paying fifteen dollars, you can quite easily install the mod as long as you own half-life 2.  This version features nothing in terms of additions, save for the narrator.  You are essentially paying fifteen dollars for some mp3 files.  While he does add some flavor to the game, he can be rather arbitrary at times, and ruin one's immersion.  On a side note, some of the achievements are quite confusing and annoying, where others are hilarous to take part in.			"

												The humorous and intriguing demo and various 'trailers' is definitely what sold me on this game. Having really no idea what to expect as far as gameplay, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the actual game is very similar to others that I enjoy.Metaphorically, the 'normal' child of HalfLife2 to its crazier siblings Portal & Antichamber, TSP is not as straight forward as it seems in the screenshots. In fact... forward might not be the proper word at all. Perhaps, sideways is better. TSP is a game of replay. Not very long in any one 'game'. But you will be guaranteed to play for hours and hours exploring all the options. And of course, you will enjoy every moment figuring it out. A puzzle game with little rewards and high satisfaction. Keep Stanley alive... and find some company for him, will ya?Framed by a great voice over, at once humorous and maddening, The game keeps you smiling even as it frustrates. And don't worry. I'm sure you can 'finish' the game.... but can you finish it?Obligatory scoring: Visuals: Simple, nothing spectacular, but sets the proper mood and environment. No glitches found. Minimal interactivity. Small texture set, fitting the relatively 'small' game. 7/10Audio: Content - 10... Great writing in this game. No real soundtrack to speak of.Gameplay - well its really simple in essence.... so scoring here would be misleading. -2 for no jumping :POverall enjoyment - 9/10.Not a long experience... but a thoroughly enjoyable one!

												The Stanley Parable is a good video game. It's not very long, it doesn't require too much dexterity, and if you wanted to be reductive, you could call it a ""Walking Simulator.""But it's fun. It made me laugh, it made me giggle, and there was one part that made me feel genuinely like a bad person. There are also tons of secrets to find, which on some level, is kind of the whole point of the game, really. I actually ended up using a guide to find the last two or so I'd missed, and I don't regret it in the slightest. I'm actually a little surprised it only took four hours, because to be honest, it felt like I played this game all afternoon and well in to the evening, and I mean that in the best way possible. It's a good game to get lost in.			"

												It provides an experience no medium other than a video game could. The Stanely Parable couldn't be a film, a book or a radio drama because no matter how good they are, they lack two key things - participation, and the ability to restart. Only in games does restarting change anything. In The Stanely Parable, it has the potential to change everything, and keep changing everything, right up to the point where you realise that you are in fact changing nothing. This constant feeling of 'it's about this...wait...actually it's about that' is what this game centres around. You will feel trapped, liberated, antagonistic, companiable, satisfaction, guilt, unease and serenity, sometimes all within the same playthrough. It's not something that demands anything technical of you, but it is a game. It's quintessentially a game, and in a medium that often seems envious of film, The Stanely Parable uses the format to deliver something unique, and is one of my favourite experiences in a very long time.

												So to be truthful here, I will say when I bought it. I did not have high expectations that I would like it much.But, I was so wrong. This game is truely awesome, even though 'technically short' and not many over all noticable features.It does feature a ton of narrated content and possible decision choices as the life of Stanley.It amazes me, everytime I think i found all the narrated triggers for a certain path and had my giggles for that. I end up finding so much more with very cool trigger events that may not occur to us, due to structure game logic now days.Without giving spoilers, it is hard to describe the awesomness of this game. Buy it, play it, be curious and try to break rules. Find the awesome things you can do and get some laughs in at the same time.			"

												Not quite a game, but more of an experience. The writing is absolutely excellent and makes you smile with every ending you discover. The rather cynical narrator will berate you for disobeying him and get quite frustrated, leading to some hilarious situations. I think it is incredibly unique, and something everyone should at least experience for themselves.			"

The voice acting is fantastic. Great humor and many unexpected twists.It's all about choices and consequences. Not your typical Bioware-RPG-style choices and consequences. Real choices. And real consequences.This is a real game changer. In every meaning.An absolute must.			"

												It's not fair to call this a game, as far as it being a 'game' it has the simplest game play since clunky 1990s point and click adventure.It's fair to call this pure hilarity and entertainment in which the player can be completely immersed and the expansiveness of the game gives it some serious replay value. Don't play this game for it being a game, play it for one of the best experiences you'll have in recent years. Sadly to keep this review both contemporary without ruining just what The Stanley Parable is I can't really say much else apart from ""Just play it"".So there you have it, if you aren't one of the people who has played The Stanley Parable go play it - you won't regret it. I certainly didn't.			"

												Just.........The lights are so beautiful, and my girlfriend has now forgiven me for my difficulty in emotional connection and committment. I am now at her door at 3am, i still have the spare key and in my hands is her favorite coffee and pastry. She will be so happy, that such simple gestures of affection i have been too timid to express previously are now a sign of my transformation into the person she always knew was hiding behind the cold and distant mask. I open the door, my heart is racing and i am in a cold sweat, but i battle and defeat my fears and feel a warmth of excitement. As i reach for the light, i think otherwise, place the goods on the table and sneak into the bedroom of the small 2 room apartment. I slowly reach for the bed in the darkness, put my hand under the covers and lightly squeeze her warm thigh, I whisper to her that i will never forsake the feelings i have for her, and i nibble her ear like she always loved..... WTF THIS TASTES LIKE CHALK, OMG SHES A ♥♥♥♥ING WOT............................ :( of course i dont have a girlfriend, still in my fearful ways. Well, maybe some day :o			"

												Played the game for an hour and quit, and somehow I suspect I'm still in the game, as if everything I see in the real world is just a trick. Played the game for an hour and quit, and I feel like I'm trapped in the game again. After playing the game for an hour or so, I quit. I suspect the world has ceased to exist outside my window. Watched a random video of King Buzzo laughing, I think he's in on this. Played the game for an hour and quit, probably a restart is in order. Don't play this game, it messed with you. Seriously, I just played it for an hour and quit, and I still feel like I'm inside the game. Which I obviously am not. Still though, I'm not sure this is Steam interface I'm using now, probably just an elaborate hoax and I'm still in the game. I would probably quit the game after an hour or so, but still feel as if I'm playing the game. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I played for an about an hour, and even after I quit, I felt that somehow I'm still playing the game. I have to restart so I can quit.			"

												A clever critic/parody to the developer-player relationship and games as we know it, The Stanley Parable is a great experience that will make you laugh, think and play again over and over to try every possibility in the game. It relies mostly on exploration and interactions with the game are minimal, so if you're used to action games I suggest you play this with an open mind.			"

												Stanley this, Stanley that. Stanley this, Stanley that. Stanley this, Stanley that. When I set down to play this game, I didn't expect it to be the other way around. From the moment the reins of control, or the illusion of it, are handed to you, the masterpiece known as The Stanley Parable spins into motion. I've always tested video games, going back to where I started, finding a way out of maps, and generally screwing with whatever the devs have come up.But The Stanley Parable stood ready to accept what I had coming for it. When I was able to take my first tentative steps into this game that I knew almost nothing about, my first choice in this game about choices was to stay put where I started, and the results impressed both me and the rest of my house at 2 AM as I found myself unable to breathe for the next 30 seconds. Remember how I said that this game is about choice? Well it is, and isn't. There is no choice system like a Bethesda game, instead the choice system can be more or less described in the first evident fork in the road you encounter in this maze of a game. Two open doors in front of you, with a narrator expecting you to go through one of them. From there all hell can break loose, resulting in one of my favorite games of all time. -Gameplay: Walking Simulator 2013 best Simulator. 5/5-World: The omnipresent narrator is a delight to indulge and anger and having the game itself react and warp around you is an unparalleled experience. 5/5-Story: What story? Ah, that story. The writing and subtle jokes and references may fly over most people, but for those who understand then The Stanley Parable will prove to have one of the greatest story-shaped holes in existance. 5/55/5 no really buy this game what is this game even about I am on fire please send help.

PROS:+ simple & fun gameplay+ hilarious narrative+ interesting level design+ original game concept+ multiple endings (& semi-endings)CONS:- a bit short (base) game time- some achievements are extremely hard to get- limited action possibility (although it probably would not work otherwise)Comment:The Stanley Parable is one of those games that stands out, a game that you will remember. It is a first person narrated interactive adventure and it is LOADS of fun. I heard about how good it is from various sources but I hesitated towards buying it as I thought it would not be my kind of game. But it is ... it is my kind of game ... and most probably it is your kind of game too. Because it is very well scripted, nicely exectued and even makes you think about the mechanics of modern games. About how the achievements have no real meaning and about video game cliches. When talking about achievements I have to mention that this game is merciless to achievement hunters. Especially 3 achievements require either file editing, computer time tuning or just plain luck. Base game took me about 6 hours, the extra 25 are for one achievement. Overall this game was well worth the price and while being a bit limited in what you can do it still offers a different view on video games. I recommend it!			"

												Gameplay: The Stanley Parable constantly subverts many of the tropes established by AAA video-games, to mention them here would be to spoil their inclusion, all I will say is this; the game is marevellously deconstructs the very essence of contemporary video-game design and the way in which many players are lured in by cheap tricks and superficial incentives. Fortunately this is not done in a pretenious or off-puting way, rather with subtlety and entertaining enthusiasm.Story: The plot is absolutely incredible, and best experienced with no prior knowledge.Graphics: Influences from many Source games like Portal 2 and Half Life 2 are clear, although the game has a rather unique visual style of its own. The environments are nicely detailed, lighting is top notch and there are several instances of visual trickery on an M.C. Esher level.Re-playability: There are over a dozen unique endings and many small details to find throughout the intricately designed level(s).			"

												Odd doesn't even begin to describe such an experience. If you haven't played the Stanley Parable yet but you are absolutely certain you're getting it, I would reccommend you stop reading this ""review"" at once, as I have a feeling this may somewhat ruin the experience I previously mentioned earlier for you. I would want anyone whom begins to play this game to have absolutely no knowledge of what lies within it.Now- the only people that should be reading this are those whom are uncertain of whether or not they're getting this and the rebels who'll do as they damn well please.If you try and look up what other people think about this game, I find they just state a bunch of contrasting hypocritical statements about it to try and endorse the strange factor and make you want to buy the game even more- but rather than waste your time and do that I'm just going to explain how I feel about it and what it is, so hopefully you walk away with some knowledge, despite being warned in advanced about how it may ruin the initial experience upon purchase. I mentioned that the experience you get from playing this game was odd- I do not want you to think that I mean that in a negative respect. It is strange, but in a good way- not exactly the sort of whacky forced strange people have become acustomed too these days, but a somewhat intellectual twine ontop of a seemingly endless amount of optional storylines. You play as Stanley, an officer worker and with the help of the narrator you make your way through the short story and get to the ending- seems simple, yes? The cliche is that there's the freedom to disobey whatever it is the narrator says so that you can potentially mess up the entire story and branch off from it. The substory branches are surprisingly long which is why I almost guarantee you'll play through this game more than once, just in a different way- you'll be so curious that you'll want to know what happens if you did A instead of B and vice versa. The games humour overall appeals to me immensely. The narrators voice and tone fits perfectly with the silent little character that is Stanley. Small little things such as the free demo, achievements and the reaction from the developers when you try and obtain the unobtainable achievement via the console take a great part in making this game as appealing as it is.  I feel as though however for what it is, despite the quality, is highly overpriced- even when put on sale. A must buy when cheaper for those whom are the curious type.			"

												This is a story about a man named Stanley. As a story, there is no rich or innovative gameplay, you simply take the role of Stanley during a story about Stanley, narrated by someone who is decidedly not Stanley. Stanley's story is a good one. At times it can be cheerful, frightening, sad, and frustrating, but it is well-written and well thought out.I loved 'The Stanley Parable', but if you expect to compare it to another game on steam between five and fifteen dollars, you might come away with mixed feelings, just like some of the other reviewers have. If you purchase this title knowing that it's a story, I'm confident you won't regret it.			"

												Groundbreaking, brilliant, an excellent narrative, non-linear, puzzle like adventure. Both the demo version and the game are worth playing since the two have different story-lines. The gameplay, through surprising, is a little lacking, through.The more you get daring with it, the more the Narrator, AI and interactivity feels alive. Whether you pursue or undergo the Stanley story, you will need some basic measure of imagination to make any part a whole and fill in the blank yourself to get a real gut-wrenching and complete experience. If you can feel and have even a silver of imagination regarding SF, supernatural or horror, then the story will be there, more clear, strong, and real than many indie exploration games. It won't disappoint you. [LOW SPOILERS] The only thing that makes the game interesting and keep you from feeling discouraged are the mysterious natures and different behaviors of the Narrator. Whatever or whoever you see it as, it is difficult to know if the character of The Narrator changes depending of your choices, or if they had already reached secret conspiracies, sentience, and/nor hopes and your choices just push it to reveal. That adds up to the mystery and keeps encouraging exploration and curiosity, to the point that it helped me accept not reaching a solid One True Ending and still feel a sense of completion.If you don't count yourself, there are three characters present and able to interact together, two of them being eloquent and lovable disembodied voices. Even the developers aka The Line, the Confusing Schedule and the whole office building can be relatively counted as a independent character. In that way, the Stanely Parable may be considered part RPG.			"

												This might be my most glowing review yet. The Stanley Parable is probably the most philosophically important game made to date. It ask questions about story, narration, authority, and freedom. The narration is witty, piercing, and expertly delivered. It leaves you asking fundamental questions about the nature of almost everything you might take for granted in life, and does not attempt to alleviate this unease with comforting placebos. I recommend it to intellectual gamers, you know who you are, who play games, not to escape reality, but to approach it from a new perspective. It's not for those looking for a challenge or wanting something to zone out to. But, if you're willing to let The Stanley Parable shake you to the core, it will almost certyainly fulfill that promise.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a game much in the same vein as Dear Esther or Gone Home in that you won't be fighting anything, you won't be really doing much of anything, but that's the point of the game. You'll get a few solid laughs out of the game and will find yourself playing through all of the possible outcomes, but don't expect to really have your mind blown or anything.It's fun while it lasts and does its best to offer critiques of modern society, gaming and life, but a lot of it feels a bit forced. If you haven't learned the morals found in the Stanley Parable yet this game will be amazing to you, but otherwise you'll just find yourself nodding in agreement.			"

												This game reminds me a bit of the movie ""Groundhog Day"".I must admit I didn't read what TSP was all about. But it got me hooked, as soon as i discovered, that it has more than meets the eye.Following a certain procedure is easiest and best way you think, but this game will teach you a lesson.Doing the opposite of what the narrator says is the key to success.Btw. i just love the narrator. Without him, the game wouldn't be as entertaining as it is.So what are you waiting for ?

												.I would rather say ""Just f**ckin buy it!"", but that would not do the game the honor it deserves. It is a game about games. The more games you have played, the more you will appreciate it. For it will surprise you, know what you will do, say no, say yes, say nothing at all. It is a very ""meta"" game, but not in a negative way. It takes all the experience we learned in our years of gaming and just says ""lol what are you doing"". In a very fancy way of course, with one of the greatest narrators in video game history. And I have played a lot of videogames. The gameplay itself is rather thin, but it is an experiment and a story (ha!) that you can ONLY experience in a videogame and you should definitely not miss it. Absolute recommendation.			"

With a smart and provocative plot/design questioning freedom in games combined with hilarious lines and a good voice acting, Stanley Parable was one one of the funniest and craziest games I've ever played and a really interesting one. Many times I found myself doing silly stuffs desperately trying to fill my urge for a new ending (There are o lot of them), a new joke or just an unexpected result.A unique experience, hilarious and my favourite game of 2013.Also, don't forget to play the demo even if you have the complete game.

												This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley has an adventure dictated by his good friend, the Narrator, a charming Brit with a dry sense of humour and a fondness of shattering the fourth wall. Stanley has free reign to as he desires. He may disobey the Narrator if he so chooses. Consequences may or may not apply. The Narrator may throw Stanley to the wolves, or save him via Deus Ex Machina. Literally anything could happen. Stanley could be subject to a huge mind control experiment, or may find himself at odds with the Stanley Parable Adventure Line, or may even visit a museum dedicated to the Stanley Parable, built on the ashes of the fourth wall. A thoughtful parody on the nature of choice, and whether it exists in video games, the Stanley Parable quickly and voilently alternates between goofy, charming endings, and endings that will give you nightmares for weeks to come. The Stanley Parable offers something for everyone.			"

												Well well well, a game without combat? What's the point then, right? I mean, what good is a video game if we can't live out a not-so-deeply buried desire to murder people with a wide array of weapons, vehicles, and vehicles with weapons? I mean come on, nothing else is fun. I just simply cannot fathom how a game could possibly be called a game without shoving a sharp object into something squishy or sticking C4 and blasting with rockets what isn't squishy. I also don't know why people insist on playing games that make you think, and not with mind bending puzzles, but provocative subject matter. I don't play games to ponder the nature of existence! I play to mindlessly press as many buttons as I can, and to do so in a better order and timing than another player miles away that I'll never meet. I play to prove that I'm better than you!......what's this? This game is actually entertaining? No way. There is no way that a game set in an office building could possibly be fun until it catches fire and the aliens attack after I headshot all the zombies. And why am I playing as a white-collar nobody? I can't do anything but...push buttons.....push buttons........buuuuuuuttoooooonnnnnnssssss.........So, you made it through my horrid rant of satire, as you can probably guess, I LOVE THIS GAME. I'm so relieved to know that there are still devs out there who are trying new things without packaging it with something tired and overused. Every aspect of this game is the antithesis of what the big-wig empty suits in the mainstream developers' table think a good game makes. This game reminded me why I play games, to be ENTERTAINED, and by the gods above, does this game deliver. Okay okay, I'll be fair. The gameplay is almost non-existant. You walk, push buttons, and can crouch for seemingly no reason other than maybe another camera control. You can't even jump. But, are we here for action? Not really, we're here for comedy, we're here for surrealism (that doesn't reference a certain girl with a blue dress and a rabbit), and we're here for some new perspective. This perspective, however, can honestly hit a little too close to home. The game almost doesn't want you to play it, the main character speaks volumes of this. His job is pushing buttons, just like yours is while you play ANY game. His path is up to you, but the game loves pointing out that no matter what you choose to do, everything you decide on has been mapped out long beforehand, teaching the player that these notions of ""freedom and choice"" within games is essentially a delusional fantasy, that no matter what you choose, your options are predetermined, your actions well anticipated. Every game has walls, visible or no, they are there. And the narrator eats that up. Indeed, a game that subtley reminds you that you're deriving pleasure and a misplaced sense of achievement from some light thumb excercise is like a girlfriend casually bringing up her horse-hung/body-builder/rocket-scientist/senator ex-boyfriend while you're trying to get intimate. But somehow, I don't mind because that guy ended up in the electric chair for war crimes and hey, she's with me now, so win! Bottom line: There will be plenty of people who just won't understand this game, or what's supposed to be fun about it. These people have a poor sense of humor/irony, no self-awareness, and are xenophobic to mind-blowing proportions. It would be one thing to say it costs too much, or it's too short, or it's too repetitive, all these things are true to varying degrees. BUT! Anyone who says this game is ""bad, horrible, boring, stupid, gay, pointless"" or any other dismissively cynical criticism should be ignored. Only idiots will not enjoy this game, because idiots do not like being reminded that they are idiots. No, The Stanley Parable isn't very long, or lasting in replay value, but it's a great way to feel like somebody spiked the coffee in the employee lounge with a mild dose of LSD and Stephen Fry-esque wit.MMMM. PROS: Equal parts funny and provacative, a unique game with genuine character and an identity all it's ownCONS: A tad overpriced for some, especially since you'll probably play it for one weekend and only break it out when you want to psychologically profile a friend while you share a few laughsIf this game gets sequeled, I will buy it. If they call the sequel ""Hubris"" to better showcase the core concept, I'll buy a copy for me and every friend I have. That's right, a whole 3 copies.			"

Each of your choices can completely change the ending, leaving you with many possible endings and ideas in your head. The narrator, as I'm sure you heard before, is comical, seroius, and helpful (depending on how you look at it). Although the game is short, you still keep trying to figure out everything and it brings you back into the fun (high replayability). I surely do recommend this game, even though it is $15.

												It's impossible to describe what's interesting about the Stanley Parable without stealing its thunder. There's nothing really like it. This is a game for people who are intrigued by the idea of really *thinking* about why we play games. It's for the kind of person who likes talking about philosophy with their friends - and you'll want to talk about the Stanley Parable with your friends, too, if you're that kind of person.All of this makes the Stanley Parable sound very dry, but more often, it's hilarious, or confusing, or provocative. Sometimes, the Stanley Parable will make you feel bad about yourself for playing the Stanley Parable. Different people will find that different parts of the game affect them more personally, but any way you slice it, it's something special.			"

												I liked this ""game"" if you can call it that but it is not for everyone. Once you played the different possibilities the chanches are you will not play it again anytime soon. I would not pay 11.99 Euro I bought it at 3.59 Euro so you should wait if there isn't a discount.			"

												A sarcastic game about video games nature. With a smart and provocative plot/design questioning freedom in games combined with hilarious lines and a good voice acting, Stanley Parable was one one of the funniest and craziest games I've ever played and a really interesting one. Many times I found myself doing silly stuffs desperately trying to fill my urge for a new ending (There are o lot of them), a new joke or just an unexpected result.A unique experience, hilarious and my favourite game of 2013.Also, don't forget to play the demo even if you have the complete game.

												EXA sat there beginning to question how to write a review of The Stanley Parable. ""Was it a good game"" he asked. He did enjoy his experience of The Stanley Parable, I mean he played two straight hours of it, non stop, and only had to stop, to write the review. But he questioned would others like to have the same experience, would others enjoy the game, would others read his review and based on his review, make a purchase. Was it important that he wrote a review. Then he began to realize, why was there a narration, its as if he was in The Stanley Parable himself, and the narrator began making his choices. EXA tried to deviate from the review. As he became conscious of the narrator, the narrator decided it was time to restart the review, again.EXA sat there beginning to question how to write a review of The Stanley Parable.			"

												The Stanley Parable is a hilarious critique of one of the biggest issues when it comes to game design, the issued of forced player interaction being the only way to further progress the game. We've had hilariously awful cases like these such as the one in Call of Duty where you had to ""Press F to Pay Respects"". Seriously, who in the development studio thought that was a good idea? Space, time, everything in the game is literally frozen and nothing moves forward until you finally decide to press that one key on your keyboard. That kind of game design is cringeworthy and immersion breaking. Stanley Parable decides to have a laugh with it.Here, you can either do what the game tells you to do (well, what the narrator tells you) which results in short linear story that is ironic and self-aware, or you can go out of your way to troll the narrator and either outright refuse to do the things he tells you to do or do the complete opposite which results in hilarious writing and some absolutely bizarre locations and situations.Its only con is the short length and lack of content. It'll take you about 3 hours to get to experience everything the game has to offer. Whether that is worth the full price of $15 is up to you but it is definitely worth picking up on sale or in a bundle.Full review:

												The game is full of choices, many, many choices, and you will relive Stanley's life over and over again in one of the most mind-bogglingly hilarious meta games ever made.This is one of those games that you will want to show to your friends, and then they will want to show it to their friends, and suddenly all of these strangers are coming over to your house to play The Stanley Parable, drink beer, and roast chicken. No, seriously, this game has spawned literal potlucks at my house. Instead of watching the superbowl, people came over and drooled behind the glowing screen of my computer as they watched the next victim step up to play the plate and drown themselves in the world of Stanleys mind. ""Oh,"" you and your companions will wonder, ""What hallway will they go down this time? Will they find the closet? Will they escape? I wonder if they will just stand around doing nothing.""  Then, when they finally discover the meaning of life, you watch as their reality crumbles into nothingness, a sheer endless point in space and time where nothing and everything revolves around Stanley. Then everyone argues about what Stanley is, and a war breaks out, and no one even touches the delcious marinated chicken you worked so hard on.Yes, as you dive into the stale corridors of Stanley's workplace ignoring the existance of delicious, cooked meat, your mind will wonder as you wander down hallways living the life of the stupendously wise and all-knowing Stanley. Will you ""win?"" Well, it all depends on what you believe is winning. For me, I took home in a closet and counted the dots on the ceiling. It was wonderful. I finally felt I had a purpose. Yes, you too can find purpose with The Stanley Parable. Download it now and instantly make your dark and depressing life brighter in these hard times.10/10 (Over 50 hours on record, mostly played offline so it's not recorded)			"

												This is one of my favorite games. The game presents you with choices and the narrator will tell which choice is the ""correct"" path. You can choose to follow his directions, or ignore them and go about your own way. There are so many directions you can go, and so many secrets. The narrator gets snarky if you ignore him and his lines will keep you laughing for a while. If you have doubts, there is a free demo that really shows what the game is like. There isn't any fighting or action. Just walking and listening to the narrator's comments. But trust me, it's worth it. Like other games, I would wait for a sale on this before buying. If you enjoy comedy and 4th wall breaking, you will love this game.A note for players: check out the broom closet after the meeting room and stay in there. 8/10			"

												The Stanley Parable is like that one crazy ex-girlfriend that left a mark on your life. Every now and then you can still hear the echoes of her nagging or condescending voice that gives you chills. You can still feel her trying to compress everything that you love, to drive out what makes you unique. The pressure and anxiety of having to deal with her every day was only intensified by the fact that you couldn't simply walk away. Things weren't that easy, they could never be that easy. She had her hooks sunk into you and all you could do was writhe, hoping that the pain would eventually end.And yet at the end of it all you wouldn't trade the experience for anything, because it taught you what true horror looks like. However a part of you wonders how things would be different if you didn't have that lasting scar on the back on your mind, the ever present sting of a wound that may never fully close. Sometimes you just stare off blankly and wonder how things got so chaotic, how things spiraled to where you are now. You wonder how many pills it would take to end it all, or maybe a small incision straight up your forearm. How long would take before the darkness consumes you and pulls you into the cold abyss? What would your final breath feel like?I believe I may have digressed. Great game, give it a shot. "

												 The Stanley Parable follows a letter cruncher who, one day, becomes unhinged at the drudgery of his existence and proceeds to murder every single human being within his workplace. Stanley comes-to staring at a computer monitor and the video game becomes navigating the hallucinations of his drifting, part lucid mindscape, narrating his own progression toward some self-appointed / meaningless objective in a somewhat sarcastic, yet deadpan tone.  You might be wondering, ""Wow, these are the most bland hallucinations I've ever seen. How can you call walking around an immaculate / vacant office space a hallucination?"" Well, considering Stanley's *actually* stepping over the dismembered corpses of coworkers and employers alike, ignoring the arterial spray that's painted the inside of most every cubicle; along with the entrails that he's ticker-taped down the corridors, smearing excrement into the carpet as he's gone, well... Anyway, Horror Game of the Year. Purchase it and recall to mind the context I've detailed for you for full effect.			"

												Amusing little story-based game where you, Stanley, must follow or disobey the Narrorator. He seems to have a witty comment on everything you do, from 'breaking' the game to entering a broom closet.. and staying there. There are a large number of secret endings and even things to find through out the game, even if it seems to be the same run through each time. Definatly one of those games you drag your friend over and try to impress them with the smallest of finds.			"

												This game messed with my head, and it looks great. It should be considered by indie fans but it is pretty short, you should probably wait till it's on sale to buy it. If you don't have a problem with the price tag, go ahead!			"

												You all decided to buy this and clicked on the add to cart button.... no, there aren't any other options available, stop looking for a way out and click add to cart... look, you may not like me and that's fine, but this isn't something you can control so just press the damn add to cart button already.

												OH NOT ANOTHER CHOICE. To reccomend or not to reccomend? that is the question. And the answer is yes, now i want to make something very clear, this is not a game review this is a review of a peice of art. This game is about choices, lots and lots of choices and obviously these choices affect how the game plays out but the joy of these choices is that you dont even know if they matter anymore, after all, there is no choice is there? we're all just playing out specific roles that our kindly masters in the dev team are giving us, or does it matter? If u go against the narrator's will and drive his work to ruin, is that enough? Or is this all part of his story, is it all predetermined? Find out.......Stanley			"

												An absolute must play for anyone who's into games. Saying anything about what The Stanley Parable is would lessen the experience, so just trust me that it's an experience you have to have. It is very short, so maybe wait for a sale. It is one of the most clever, witty, and funny games that I have played in a long time and everyone should play it			"

												The Stanley Parable is an elegant, witty experience that you'll keep playing until you've experienced the myriad of endings. The narration is top notch, as is the story. (or lack thereof, sometimes.) With that said - I bought the game for a few dollars in the Steam Summer Sale and had all the endings complete within four hours. There's no way I'd spend $25 on this game, which I believe is what it was listed for. Don't pay more than $10 - Wait for a sale!			"

												The stanley parable is a very...how shall we say, intriguing game. The mind ♥♥♥♥ery of the game is incompreshensive and will just have you staring at the screen in awe, fear, questioning of reality and apsolute laghter. The structure and mustery of the game has you always wondering waht to trust your instinct? the crazy british guy in your head atempting to manipulate your every move? in the end you just have to decide what is reality and what is the mere illusion of the game 9 out of 10.

												A simple game yet so so beautiful!+ProsDifferent story line nearly all the time.Good looking and would not melt a not so good pc/laptop.The voice of the narrator is very soothing but can change easily.-ConsSome of the narative is unskippable meaning you have to wait sometimes a while to progress.
