												Here is a real review made by a real person who actually played the game, because there aren't many of these on this store page:This game is not bad.  This game is competent.  The controls are solid, the gameplay is challenging and, honestly, fairly good.  However, it is very basic, very repetitive, and very dependent on having people to play with.As of right now, there is nobody to play with (you'll need to rope in at least one friend) and the price does not reflect the value of the game.Pick this one up for 5 bucks or less, and then buy some gift copies for your friends so that you actually have someone to play with.  You'll have a couple of fun hours with it before you get bored.  That's the only way I could recommend this one.			"

												Gameplay design is solid, like if Torchlight had a baby with the Souls series and fell into a cave of Nethack, doled out in single-servings.  The game's difficulty curve is pretty much a flat line and will well wait for you to ""Git Gud"" enough to take on the enemies/combinations it throws at you.This game is great if you want to play with yourself or one friend.  This is why I don't reccomend this game.  It fraudulently advertises 1-4 player co-op multiplayer.  This comes with the implication it should be as responsive as the mechanics demand.  Unfortunately, it does not.  Once you throw a third or, god forbid, a fourth, the game simply can't handle it.  500-3000ms response times don't work in a top-down twitch action fighter.   Perhaps these devs should ""Git Gud"" and finish chipping their netcode into something that resembles a finished product.  Unfortunately it took me 8 hours to get to the point where we convinced another unfortunate soul to get this, albeit on sale, in order to join us, so it appears we've been scammed outta 10 bucks.Would reccomend for solo artist masocists  if it's ever on for 75% off again.

												Three of my friends and I bought this game. We played for a few worlds and, realizing we weren't having any fun, we all returned it.K2C might be unfavorably compared to an N64-era Gauntlet mixed with the dungeon exploration style of The Binding of Issac. Though the concept sounds good, K2C doesn't deliver on the promise. Instead, you get a slow-paced, depth-free, pressure-free game with overly-cramped rooms prone to wall-clipping.Though I admit that another player may like this game more than my friends and I did, I'd be willing to bet any wager you'd care to name that this game will not resonate with even its biggest fans for any longer than it takes to beat it.

												After 45 hours in this game I feel I've played enough to write an honest review.This game is mediocre in most respects, but does one thing very, very well. The combat is extremely well designed. It's fast paced, but also greatly rewards stategic play, quick thinking, and using your environment to your advantage. It's fun, but also takes a great amount of skill. The enemies are challenging, but their attacks are almost always avoidable (with only a few rare exceptions). The difficulty comes from the enemies having interesting and challenging mechanics, not by simply giving them lots of health and damage. Both the player and the enemies die in only a few hits, making the combat about very careful positioning, timing, dodging and strategy, rather than it being about DPS, armor, gear or any stats. In Kill to Collect, when you die, it's because you made a mistake.The combat is so good, that despite most other aspects of the game being nothing special, I consider this to be one of the best games I've played in a long time. It's hard to adequately describe it in words or showcase in a video, you pretty much have to play to understand.Other things I like about this game:- The four characters all feel significantly different from each other in their style of fighting, but are all fairly balanced.- It has co-op, while almost every other rogue-lite does not.- Basically no time wasted on dialogue, travelling, sorting items, or anything else boring. You will spend 90% of your time fighting.- The music is good and suits the atmosphere of the game very well, although like all game music, you'll probably want to turn it off eventually.- Daily challenge missions with a leaderboard let you compete with others for daily high scores.Things I do not like:- The aim assist. Although necessary for this type of combat (especially for newer players), sometimes it can be a major liability. At this point, I'd say at least a third of the damage I take is aim assist related, and that's a conservative estimate. There needs to be a button to toggle it on or off.- The player base is very small. It can be very hard to find people to play co-op with using the in-game matchmaking. If you want to play co-op, you'll need to have friends, or add people off the forums.- The hit detection is host-side, rather than client-side, making it difficult to play with friends from another region due to lag.- Currently, due to how the difficulty scales, co-op can be significantly harder than solo.- The ""Hard"" difficulty is exactly the same as normal, except you get only 1 HP. It's definitely hard, but it feels also a bit lazy and causes some balance issues. This problem is not as bad as it sounds though, because most players can't beat normal difficulty.- A couple combinations of enemies, or modifiers on certain randomly-generated bosses, can be a bit unfair or frustrating (or at least feel that way). They are fairly rare though. Example: shielded kamibots, or a boss with heal, damage reflect, shield and super teleport.In it's current state, I highly recommend this game.  As a bonus, the developers are still adding to this game. They also read the suggestions people make in the discussions, so hopefully over time the list of things I don't like will shrink!If anyone disagrees with anything I've said here, or any information is outdated/irrelevant, please leave a comment.

												This is a four player co-op game  or a single player game if you are like me and don't have friends, that markets itself as a roguelike, but I'm not so sure I think that's correct. You might be able to get away with calling this a roguelike-lite, or saying it has some roguelike elements I guess, but it sure ain't Nethack or anything close.The four playable characters are all a little different, and each have a standard attack, a special attack, and a movement ability. You also have an ultimate power that charges up as you kill things. There's only one of the four that I really don't like, which is fine with me.There isn't any leveling up, or long standing character progression. You can earn a currency that you spend to upgrade your character, but the abilities you can pick from are randomly selected and only offer you a pair at a time. These upgrades only last for the current bounty mission you are on, so your character restarts back at square one each time you play. This isn't really an issue, just thought I'd clarify that.You can unlock certain kits, which let you give small customization bonuses to your heroes, though. For instance, the medic kit starts you with two medkits. Some kits might start you with a secondary weapon, or various other power ups.Each bounty you clear earns you points that go toward unlocking these kits, titles, skins, and various things like that. The overall progress is account wide, not per character, which is nice.The game is pretty fun, but I can't speak as to how good the co-op is, because I don't have any friends oh god whats wrong with me.I should also say that for whatever reason, this game runs pretty bad on my system. A lot worse than I'd expect. I have everything on the lowest setting, including res and the framerate is pretty awful. I don't know what the deal is, but it might be something on my end. "

IntroductionKill to collect is a co-op multiplayer (or singleplayer) experience with cyberpunk attributes and some rather interesting and unique level design implemented into each mission of the game. The game is rather fast paced, and focuses upon combat more than anything else in the game.Quick NoteApparently the game is tagged as Rogue-lite/like which I don't 100% agree with. The game has some elements of this sort of genre but I wouldn't tag it as that, I know that the tags are made from the most popular by steam users but it's just something I had to say.IntroductionKill to collect is a fast paced, cyberpunk themed addicting game that concentrates solely on the combat but does well with presenting everything else as well. The combat is elegantly designed which has had a lot of thought and process gone through how every move works.  The combat combines fast paced with quick thinking and strategic play in order to outsmart your enemies and kill them easier, the game doesn't rely on how fast you can spam the attack button which is a very good think to have in a game like this. Because who really likes mashing a button to attack with bare minimum combat system? The environment of the game itself is well thought out and presented, you can actually use this to your advantage to kill your enemies easier and quicker.With this sort of combat system, it won't be easy. The game seems to take a lot of skill (especially in single player as all the enemies will walk towards you) which definitely would require you to be able to talk to your other teammates in order to get good at the game and be more strategic with your attacks.The difficulty of this game comes from the enemies that you encounter throughout each of the rooms that you go in before you get to the main bounty. Some of the enemies are plain and simple, but as you get further into the game the enemies start to develop a more interesting and challenging mechanics that will make the game a bit more harder for you. But the way that they do this isn't like other games similar to this, they are not given tons of health, damage or defense boosts in order to make it difficult. Both you and the enemies die in a couple of hits, this makes the combat system more difficult and makes you focus more upon timing, dodging and careful positioning of each of your attacks in order to make them the fullest and most effective that they can be. You will know when you have made a mistake, because you will be punished harshly with either death or low health.The progression with each of the characters that you play as needs a bit more work. It does feel a bit meh and doesn't really feel like you are progressing in the sort of way that you would expect to do throughout the game. I feel like even though there are only 4 characters in the game, that they could of expanded a bit more on the sort of characters that you could of played as. For me, the first hour of the game was me testing out the characters and what sort of combat style there was, and for me personally they all just felt dull and not really that interesting all together. A few more characters in this game would add to a bit more variety to the game I think.The game's graphics are so bright and vibrant, I feel like it brings the game to life and really helps with the fast paced that the game is going for. With the cyberpunk theme it really hits the nail on the head for the game all together. With all the characters being fairly bright and colourful, as well as the walls and everything else in the game it really sets a high standard for the game if you're just watching the trailer to see if you like this game or not.Pros+ Elegant combat system+ Fast paced and strategic thinking+ Nice difficulty throughout the game+ Very colourful and vibrant colours+ Steam achievements and trading cardsCons- Needs more characters to vary it a bit- Smallest combat mistake could lead to quick death- For the asking price, it's a little steep in my opinionResult / Final ThoughtsKill to collect is well worth your time, even though the game itself may be a bit steep for the current asking price it still does well when it comes to the interesting combat and gameplay. The graphics are superbly presented and done, along with the characters. If you can get past the fact that small mistakes could lead up to death or low health, and that the game will require skill thenRating: 8.1/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.

												2016-July-03Quick Rundown:------------------------The good: Gameplay mechanics are solid, if a bit simplistic.The bad: Exceptionally difficult to find others to play with.Verdict: A hopeful 6/10 in its current state. Fun for a quick romp but disappointed about not having enough friends to play with. Interface, matchmaking, and netcode need a few tweaks.Potential: 8/10 with a solid-buy recommendation if matchmaking gets an overhaul. Once the multiplayer community gets up and running, -Built on the Unity engine, Kill to Collect is a 1-4 player skill based top-down brawler of sorts with an 80's neon/cyberpunk theme and music to match. KTC is an action-oriented tactical brawler with a good degree of challenge and a high skill ceiling, button-mashing wont serve you well here. The basic premise of the game is that you (and a group of friends if lucky) delve into futuristic / dystopian slums with the goal of hunting a bounty (boss) and clearing the place of its riff-raff. Along the way you will find one-time use heals, shields, powerups, deployables (such as mines), and even swappable ammo-based weapons as you make your way through the floor. At the end of each section you are allowed to take a break in the rec-room and spend some of the chips you've accumulated to buy yourself permanent upgrades, replenish your health and ammo, stock up on items, or purchase a different secondary weapon.There are 4 character classes in Kill to Collect, and while they all feel fairly similar, they do each have their own strengths and weaknesses from being a slow-ish and tanky shotgun brawler with a Juggernaut-like ultimate ability to a crazy shock-staffed, jetpack-wearing, turret deploying crowd control character. Each of the four different classes has their own set of abilities that work better or worse against certain enemy types in a Gauntlet-esq manner, but are still similar enough so as to not become obsolete when used in solo play. Due to the nature of these differences, the game really shines in multiplayer when you can combine these with allied abilities, but thanks to a small playerbase, finding a multiplayer game can be quite difficult.The brawler-esq 3rd person top-down combat in KTC is broken down into an exceptionally simple set of attacks and moves; A basic attack, a special knock-down attack on a cooldown, an ultimate ability on a kill-based cooldown, and a limited ammo-based interchangeable weapon. Additionally each character has their own dodge ability from a steerable and fast moving jetpack that can be used to knock enemies aside, to a short ranged blink which can teleport to the other side of an enemy (admittedly a bit fiddly), and of course a fairly plain-jane dodgeroll too. The special attacks for each character feel similar, but do impart different effects on the enemy from armor breaking debuffs which make an enemy take more damage on their next hit to stuns and knockdowns which in some cases are only effective against certain types of enemies.An upgrade/unlock system of sorts is in place, but its incredibly simple and very linear. Basically, as you collect bounties (score) from playing and beating levels, you unlock skins and new loadouts which allow you to change the two starting items that you begin the game with. Loadouts are a fairly minor thing overall, but do influence the early-game. Unlocks for golden weapon skins are attained by completing objectives based around using those weapons, but these golden weapons dont appear to have any gameplay impact, nor can these skins be disabled.. so any uniqueness of each weapon's texture/color is basically lost after you've completed its associated task. Pieces Interactive definitely could have done a bit more with this system while maintaining balance and keeping power-creep at bay. In its current state these systems feel a little under-developed and disappointing. Collected bounty is basically just a measurement of how much you've played.. a global score of sorts; you dont use it to buy unlocks, loadouts, or skins, they just get unlocked when you reach a totally linear and arbitrary amount.Ultimately the crippling factor for Kill to Collect at the moment is that its missing its multiplayer community. Its a solid game which needs more players. They've done a really good job with core fighting mechanics and balancing, and aside from a bit of peer-to-peer lag, the multiplayer mechanics feel pretty good. Revive systems are in place to keep the flow of the game going and reward players who are good by keeping them revived or bringing them back after locating or beating special rooms. The increased number of enemies in multiplayer offer additional challenge, and there is plenty of chaos and opportunity to work together to make some fun and exciting things happen based on the game's various knock-back mechanics and ragdoll-physics. If there was a stronger multiplayer community that allowed you to find games whenever you wanted, I feel that this game would offer a significantly higher value for its cost. As it stands, I cannot recommend Kill to Collect at its full price unless you absolutely love this type of game, or have a group of friends to play with. If you enjoyed games like Spiral Knights, then this will probably be something you will find familiar and appealing. Though due to the simple combat mechanics and lack of complex interactions in single player the game can feel a tad samey after awhile, having a friend or two to play with may make all the difference.Final thoughts: Pieces Interactive needs to step up their marketing department and get people playing their game. Its a good title that gets put down all too quickly due to the lack of community to engage with. Single player delivers a couple of hours of good challenge while multiplayer offers some exciting, funny, and tensely rewarding moments. Sadly unless your friends own the game, theres almost no chance of finding a random multiplayer pick-up game to join at this time. Kill to Collect is a good game that Id enjoy playing with friends and with random people, sadly it will be difficult to convince friends to buy without an active multiplayer community and with such a flawed matchmaking system in place.Pros:- Good visceral core combat mechanics.- Decent player character and enemy variety.- Has single player modes, offers a good challenge.- The kind of game that truly shines when played with friends.Cons:- No multiplayer community as of 2016-07-03. Finding a random MP game is impossible.- Cant do anything but sit at the host screen while you wait for someone to join.- Host-side hit detection means that players will feel some lag / sluggish feedback.- Cannot disable autoaim for keyboard and mouse controls.- Maxes out GPU clocks, even when minimized and vsynced. (Radeon 7850)- Title is no longer receiving support. No contact or fixes from developers 6+ months.			"

												It's almost a good game, but it's not. I basically have the same complaints everyone else does. Movement and attacks are a little clunky, meaning sometimes you have no options but to take a hit. It seems like a skill game, but there's a large luck component to it. The soundtrack seemed nice, if you like that kind of music.			"

												This game is... a cute and little puppy, I'm sure there are some bad, ugly people in the world who don't like it for stupid and obscure reasons - you know like people who love war or don't like chocolate - but I'm also sure noone could say this game isn't good.As the finest chocolate this game isn't something new, or elaborate, but it's sooooo sweet... I coud never call this a masterpiece, a work of art, or stuff like that, becuse this game is something... both small and, as I already said, not really new, but also perfect in what it is.First thing, there's basically no plot, but that isn't a big deal, the setting is well put and straight to the point: It's a cyberpunk world, you are a mercenary, a runner, call it as you like, we want some crooks killed, here's your target, this will be your reward, go get them!. And BAM! You are in this map, killing things to open the way to your wanted criminal, no wasting of time, just fun.It's a top-down shooter with a skill-based gameplay which reminds MOBA games, and it is hard. Marvelously hard. When someone says It's hard about a top-down shooter you imagine a bullet hell, but this is not the case, the gameplay isn't erratic, everything is clean, solid, and accurate, if you play it at Hard difficulty as an enemy hit you, you are basically dead. If you smash the buttons you die, if you don't take care of your positioning you die, if you don't notice a threat you die, if your mom screams something at you, you die. You can use a lot of different tactics to clean a room but when you do a mistake you lose. This will change if you play at Normal difficulty, of course, you will have more health and there'll be room for mistakes, so the game allow you to chose the kind of experience you want.Everytime you'll die, you'll have the feeling ""I did that mistake"" and you'll get better, the game is clean, it's not chaotic, there's no fate involved, no RNG mechanics, the game never cheats, it just requires skill and this makes it such a rewarding experience.This is a roguelite kind of game, when you die you restart, but it's based on short missions, as I said, so you unlock the new mission after completing the previous one, then you can select the mission you want even if you die. Anyway the maps are randomly generated, so it never feels too repetitive to restart a mission. Anyway, it's hard, and after you die, and die, and die multiple times in a row, no matter how hard you tried, it drains your energies, so, speaking about how I feel after some playing, I could want to stop after 2, 3, 4 hours I'm playing... uhm... but maybe it's not strange in any case? By the way, I could want to stop playing this game after some time, but that doesn't last long, this game is something you'll want to come back to.Conclusions:If you are not a bad person and you like chocolate, you will like this game. If you usually like top down shooter, roguelite games, or just beautiful games - yeah, there are people who like bad games out there, check your facebook - you will love this, and if you have someone to play it together it will be great.So just buy this, the price is fair, and if you don't like it you can still ask for a refund and I'll owe you a beer in our next lives, just don't die too soon.

Kill to Collect ... for?KtC is a rogue like game like Isaac and other more ""well-known"" games which are basicly the same. You go down the last corners of streets, killing bad guys, collecting stuff and more.So...should i kill them or they me?Tbh, KtC is a hard game, a very hard game - even on ""easy mode"". Its not only that the game is hard, its also the game plays so dang hard too: Nearly every character feels very slow. They attack maybe ones per second (the fastest one sure attacks faster but makes nearly no damage and has nearly no health...) that it actually makes nearly no fun to play this game alone, i tried to play with all 4 characters and only found for me the...""engigirl"" (i duno the name now) pretty good since i can build small turrets, avoid enemys and stun them.Still even her main attack is so ♥♥♥♥ing slooooooowwwww. I mean, a normal guy/girl would swing a staff but in this game she swings it -only- vertical (so you can only hit things close infront of you...) ones per attack which means no combos or like, also the delay between you actually hit the attack button and the damage output is also kinda ""castlevania"" like. You press the attack button and maybe 0.5 seconds later, you actually hit a enemy.That actually makes it again hard to attack and avoid attacks since after a attack, your character needs a short time to recover. I mostly ended up in a ""cat and mice"" play, if i had the room for - which simply means i poked the enemy ones, avoided, poked again, avoid, and again the loop. Fun? Not really, since some enemys can lay mines and others can stun you, giving them the advantage of actually crowd controll...Again, for what do we ""collect""?If you win or lose a mission, you get... or earn some credits. Sadly, you actually cant buy stuff with them, you only unlock stuff like, titles, skins & some basic start gear. No new characters, no new weapons, no new power ups, no new levels, nothing like. So it makes nearly no sense to ""go collecting"" stuff anyways.The end of the storyI actually refund it. Its to hard and makes no fun playing it alone. In Multiplayer its even more hell since more bullets and more things to avoid and taking care off. The difficult is way to high that the game ""could"" actually make some kind of fun. The characters feel way to slow somehow and the delays feeling like youre all the time in the disadvantage and not even close to be in the ""same levels with the enemys"". Avoid it if you think it is a good rogue-like game and look better for another one, this game might looks great on display but it feels like you go boxing against Mohammed Ali...			"

												Pros:- Great scenery- Simple skill-based mechanics- Difficult, but not impossible- An absolute blast when playing with friendsCons:- No local co-op- Horribly difficult when playing alone- Online matchmaking is broken, and the developers haven't responded to any Steam Forum discussions on the matterConclusion:With broken matchmaking and no local co-op, you'll need to coerce three of your friends to buy this with you and set matches up yourselves. If you're lucky enough to do so, the game is tons of fun and you'll wonder why it never went viral.P.S. There is a ""Kill to Collect LFG"" Steam Group, though it seems fairly inactive.			"

												This could have gone from being a good game to a great game if it supported local co-op instead of online only. I can understand what they were trying to do, but this game just isn't popular enough to find anybody online.The gameplay itself is simple, yet satisfying. It plays like an action rogue-like with tactical movement. The four characters each have interesting abilities and don't feel the same. The game isn't very deep, but it will provide a quick fix for procedurally generated action. If you like isometric action games in which button mashing will get you killed rather than a good score, this is probably right up your alley.			"

												This game is brutally difficult, even on Easy. I don't have the patience for it. You can take only a few hits before you're dead. Even though health packs drop, they barely heal you. There are bullets flying around everwhere while melee attackers are trying to kill you. Often times, the only place to dodge the bullets is either into a melee attacker or a land mine. Eventually I just decided it wasn't worth the effort, so... uninstalling.			"

												It has no local Co-op which is strange because all the players charracters share the same screen. Also something about the gameplay doesn't feel right, hit boxes are hard to get a read on and animations seem clunky. Some of the characters feel very similar (most have a dash and a knock back ability.) I also didn't like how punishing the single player was. I'm sure that could be fixed with more people but I'm not interested in convincing anyone to buy this game.			"

												Get ready to die... Often, while you're having absolutely great time. Thats how i would describe Kill to Collect in a nutshell.This has been a great year so far and we've seen plain awesome indietitles after another and this one for me ranks among the best i've tried. Game itself can be played either in co-op mode or as a single player mode and both includes three difficulties and three modes to choose from. 4 Different classes who all have their own unique skills and playstyle. The gametitle might already be a bit revealing, but yeah, your objective is get the bounty done, which means you have x- amount of floors to clear beforethe bossbattle, and thanks to the roguelite-aspect, if you die at any point of the game, you're forced to start from the first floor and there's varietyof different enemies that wants you dead at any cost. For the daring there's even added Challenge rooms which yields extra number of rations that you canuse on the saferooms to upgrade your skills before venturing forward. These are levelbased and will reset if you either die or complete the contract.The game's mechanics are fairly simple to learn, you have 2 basic attacks that you will be using, ability to dodge and 4 slots where you can collect any drops that will boost up your chances of making it out alive. That said it's still fairly easy to make fatal errors.The detailed steampunk world and perfected soundtrack/audio are topnotch and i enjoyed both, (Especially the soundtrack) tremendously.But i would say that this game as fun as it is, relies heavily on co-op, and thats how it should be played. For it's price it can provide fun for you and anyone you're playing with for a long period of time. Kill to Collect is just that addictive.			"

												This game is amazing on multiplayer. It has this Arcade Cyber Punk feeling. Best thing is that is really hard at some points because of the random generated enemy function but not impossible, you just need to learn the timming on the characters and you will give them a good fight.The OST is pretty neat, just listen to ""Felony"" by Tokyo Rose on the tubes and you will have a small taste of this great musical score. Synthesizers FTW!Amazing replayability: 9/10			"

												This game is good. It's basically a cyber punk version of Gauntlet. It's good fun but I strongly recommend roping in a friend to play it. The difficulty curve is so high but the right kind of challenge. It frustrates you just enough to challenge but make you want to come back for more. You guys should definitley give it a go the more people who get it the more online community there will be with it.			"

												Overall it is a fun arcade game.  The music and asthetic produce a decent atmosphere. The enemies and their variation provide a very nice effect where you really need to try and stay aware as you dodge attacks, expend resources, and make your own attacks. The main problem is that other players cannot join midgame.  I beleive the reason for this is that there isn't a way to dynamically scale the ammount of enemies or size of rooms during gameplay. This makes it difficult to find games.			"

												Edit: Looks like around 50% of people find my review helpful.  Lines up with the 57 score this game received on Metacritic.The art, audio, and general idea behind the game are fantastic.  I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes, but I found myself feeling like 80% of the game was missing beyond that.  The lack of character progression is a major flaw that I feel like takes away from the game.  The combat is incredibly unforgiving, and even on easy with two veteran gamers we were struggling to make it through the first two levels.  You don't feel like you are accomplishing anything, and you're not rewarded for moving on.  It's like the game may strive to be something that is difficult, but there isn't any real challenge - you're just prohibited from getting hit more than a couple of times each level - which really prohibits the ability to run around and have fun and causes the game to be mostly centered around dodging minor ranged attacks beacuse only a few hits and you'll be starting the level over.The medkits restore 1 health point, out of the 8 or so that you have.  Taking damage is pretty much something you can just not avoid to do. The first bounty ended with a boss fight stating she had the ""Super Teleport"" ability, which meant she just hopped around the room.  It wasn't any different than any of the standard rooms had been before, and left me feeling totally underwhlelmed. Having convinced a friend to buy this game so we could play to together like we had ""Meltdown"" or other rougelike or dungeon cralwers and neither of us could stand it at all. Maybe with additional development and some major changes the game could be worthwhile, but as it stands - I wouldn't bother.			"

												I so wanted this game, and in the last seconds of the Steam Summer Sale I bought it. So far, the game is more fun to play with a controller than a keybord. But it's soooo lacking to me. Granted, I've only played by myself and have only done 3 missions thus far, but I keep getting a currency that I don't even know what to do with. Maybe I haven't been playing long enough or need to do more online for that currency to work..? I'm not sure, I just know that I have a lot of it and nothing to spend it on! But i""ll keep playing the game untill i get to the bottom of this currency thing.			"

												6/1/2016I have to say, I was really excited to get into the neon soaked hunting shoes, but I\'ve had a bit of a problem when it comes to multiplayer. After reading up a bit on the problems others are having I honestly feel a bit let down. I know the match making will come along shortly, but as of right now Single Player isn\'t cutting it. Not many people I know have the game so I would have to rely on Match Making to really enjoy the game in the vision in which it was made. I like everything from the soundtrack, the visuals and the gameplay. I just need the Match making to get fixed. Either way, I\'ve recommended the game to several of my friends. Hopefully I talked the game up enough to get them on board so we can have some real fun.			"

												""I can only conclude that Kill to Collect is an awesome game, that is best played with four friends. If you each pick the right character and coordinate your attacks, your team will be unstoppable. It is possible to play Kill to Collect on your own, but keep in mind that it will be somewhat more challenging as opposed to playing the game with four people. So, however you look at it, Kill to Collect is a very good game; the graphics, the characters, the soundtrack, everything is inspired by 80's cyberpunk and is completely awesome! If you're into coop roguelikes, Kill to Collect is definitely a game you will want to try!""For more reviews, event reports and other epic stuff, please visit DumeeGamer.com! "

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupDisclaimer: The copy of this game was provided by the developer for review purposes, yet it doesn't affect my review in any way.Few words about the gameKill to Collect is an amazingly addictive rouge-like game, placed in cyberpunk universe. You're in control one of four Hunters and your goal is to clear out multiple levels out of any enemies you'll encounter. Invite your friends, create a team, think of some good strategy and... Kill To Collect!Advantages - Big variety of enemies - Layout of levels is randomly generated - Awesome soundtrack, perfectly fit to the theme of the game - Great replay value thanks to all unlockables and customization options - 4 characters to choose from, each with their own unique set of skills and play style - The difficulty is hard and it makes the game more rewarding than it looks like - Up to 4 players co-op mode is well made and lets players think of some nice strategies to pass the levelsDisadvantages - The story is really not clear or even visible and doesn't bring too much into the game - In story mode, game can be too challeging, which might lead to being stuck - Edit: When one of your co-op friends disconnects / looses connection with game, he automatically leaves the game with no possibility to join back until the gameEdit: Chat window only appear after opening it, it doesn't show up after new messageSummaryI'm really into this game right now. Yeah, it is a bit repetitive if you're dying over and over again on the same level, but it's quite rewarding when you're finally able to get to the next lever. The main theme of this game, along with music, totally bought me - cyberpunk to me is the most amazing thing that could ever happen to games. Thanks to big amount of ways to combine all boosts, upgrades and weapons, ensures us that we won't get bored of it too quickly. The only thing that I wish to be upgraded, is an amount of playable characters or at least some additional skills to use. But except that one thing, it's a really good, I could even say, a great game, I heavily recommend it, even if it's for single player only. So yeah, now I'm going back to finish another bounty and hope one day I'll finally git gud and stop dying.Personal score8 / 10If you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

+ A very nice and colorful cyberpunk theme with an amazing soundtrack+ Gameplay is pretty fun and quite challenging as you are encouraged to kite or dodge enemy attacks+ 4 unique characters all with their own unique abilities and special attacks+ A variety of ""special weapons"" and power ups + 4 Player local and online co-op- I felt like the game was lacking a ranged character, melee requires you to get too close and often get hit by projectiles- While still decently fun, I felt like the game is truly geared towards 2-4 players, and playing alone can be a bit overly difficult especially at later stages.

			MY final review on kill to collect with a final score out of 10. Kill to Collect is a cyberpunk roguelike co‐op that is designed by Pieces Interactive. Please Like and Subscribe if you enjoyed!		

Value vs objective for this game is as follows:Value: I got roughly 4 hours of gameplay, priced at $22 canadian, thats roughly $5.5 dollars per hour, and in today age that  isn't exactly the best value.Objective: Rogue like collecting mulitplayer game.... Well you don't really collect, everything is a limited use, the rogue like character builds are almost non exitistant. It's really hard to make fun builds with only 2 random choices per upgrade. The multiplayer match making is really bad, I couldn't get a single player to join my game. So we played 2 player, and this game excells better with 3 to 4. So the game fails in terms of objective, however its SUPER fun action combat game when played MULTIPLAYER. Final Score: 7/10			"

												NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.==========================================================---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------==========================================================Kill to Collect is a single- and multi-player 'rogue-lite' action game in a dystopian cyberpunk setting.You play one of four bounty hunters who spend their time delving into the deeper floors of Earth's last city, Geoshelter Alpha, in search of their prey. And when they find them? Well, they kill to collect, obviously!==========================================================----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------==========================================================Graphics - The graphics all have a great cyberpunk-like feel to them, with dark backgrounds combined with bright neon and flashy weapon effects, and the character outfits, while mostly looking a little silly, fit the atmosphere well. Enemies are a little bit boring and samey across some levels, and are basically made up from two groups: robots and humans. The graphics are a little small, though, and with no zooming available to focus in on the action, I found it difficult with some enemy models to see the animations clearly enough to predict their attack timings.Graphics options include the usual detail level, full screen / window mode, and resolution settings, as well as a number of advanced features like SSAO, bloom, and antialiasing. I played in full HD with everything set to maximum and experienced no problems on an aging gaming laptop (485m video card), but others have reported some issues on much newer hardware. The developer is looking into it, but from my point of view, it runs like a dream!Sound - Music is nice enough: a sort of heavy rock-type beat with electronic melodies. In any case, it fits the game well and doesn't get in the way. Sound effects are similarly good.Gameplay - The game has three different gameplay options, each able to be played in single player mode or cooperatively with up to three other people: Story Mode (a campaign, including a minimal tutorial), Challenge (fight your way through eight levels as quickly as possible), and Free Hunt (do any bounty, without the story mode's extra story bits). Ultimately, though, each mode boils down to the same thing for each level: descend to a lower floor of the city and fight your way through room after room of bad guys until you come to the boss: your target. Then collect your bounty.The game structure within each bounty takes a room-by-room approach that is similar to other games such as the Binding of Isaac, although with none of the unique encounters of that game. Each floor consists of a number of isolated rooms, and enemies from one room can't travel to another. You progress by wiping out all the enemies in a room, after which you can unlock the door to a connecting room and do it all again. You're rewarded on completion of each room with 'tech', one of the game's two currencies, and you receive a bonus if you complete a room without getting hit by an enemy. When you reach the final room of the level you're awarded some food stamps, the other currency, and can then spend your tech and food stamps on random items that only last until the end of the current bounty.Occasionally you'll find chests in some of the battle rooms, which can be opened to reveal random one-use items or temporary weapons. These are fairly few and far between though, and are usually (always) found in 'challenge rooms': rooms with a much higher number of enemies than normal rooms. Upon completing one of these rooms you can open the chest and grab the loot inside.When you complete a bounty -- and also if you fail at it -- you receive a reward for the number of kills you made through the level, with a bonus for killing the bounty target. This then adds to your progress in various 'loadouts' (equipment with which you can begin a level), titles (simply a name), and outfits for your hunters. There is thus some limited customisation and progression available, but it's a hard slog for what seems like not quite enough of a reward.It's fun to play, although it is more frustrating than it should be, as dying in single-player mode seems to take you all the way back to the start of the first floor of the bounty, even if you've reached one of the end-floor rooms that is supposed to respawn you there. Because of this it took me over an hour of play just to finish the first proper bounty after the tutorial, because I had to do the whole thing about seven times.A few niggly issues brought the game down a bit, though. For starters, the game is essentially a twin-stick shooter using left hand on the keyboard for movement and right hand on mouse for aiming and shooting. But the default keyboard and mouse controls just don't work in a frantic situation, as they make it impossible to use items like medkits. Unfortunately it's not very easy to make it better with the choices available for keyboard configuration, either; I've only managed to improve it slightly by mapping the middle mouse button. The game does claim to have full controller support, which would probably work much better. I haven't had a chance to test that yet, though. The mouse aiming also sometimes doesn't work quite right, leaving your character swinging off at some weird angle well away from the direction of the mouse pointer. The lobby and menu interface is also a little quirky, with a bit of searching required in order to work out how to activate or use any rewards you win.The story in the game is enjoyable, if a little derivative, but the text really needs a bit more attention. There are some very awkwardly worded sentences that just don't flow well, and numerous grammatical errors as well. The four characters all have different background stories and in-game abilities, but without extra characters to open up or more customisation and progression available, it feels like it's not quite enough.I say Kill to Collect is a 'rogue-lite' game as it includes random dungeon generation, and some degree of random drops (although in this case they're not enemy drops, but rather sporadic chests and end-of-floor shops with random equipment), but it doesn't include any of the mega-loot options like a true rogue-like game. There is only very limited character modification available, and mostly only temporary progression.==========================================================-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------==========================================================Pros:+ A great atmosphere; a good cyberpunk feel+ It's great fun most of the time+ Single player and cooperative multiplayer+ Achievements+ Trading cardsCons:- Keyboard and mouse controls don't work well in frantic situations, which are common- It's very frustrating sometimes- Most character upgrades are only temporary; a permanent upgrade tree would be a fantastic addition- No one in multiplayer yet==========================================================--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------==========================================================Re-reading this review it looks as though I'm being a bit down on Kill to Collect, but that's just because it's almost fantastic; it just misses out due to those little niggles I mentioned.But it is still a very good fun game. I highly recommend it.8/10For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here! "

												A easy to learn but hard to master game, that excells in co-op.This game is all about its combat. Combat itself is quite demanding but rewarding as you get better and better down the line. The games main strenght lies within its coop-mode though, this is due to the good interplay between the different characters that players can choose from. So grab this for a few friends if you get it, well worth its asking price for sure (and now it is 25% off as well!!)			"

												Kill to Collect is an excellent top-down/isometric rogue-lite hack-n-slash, I highly recommend this game to those that like these kind of games or want something fun to play.The controls are your standard WASD to move, left click to do a main attack, right click for a strong attack, space to dodge, and keys to use items and ultimate attacks.  You have 4 characters you can choose from to use, each one has their own unique style and play fairly different from eachother.  There are secondary weapon pickups that you can find in the levels or purchase them from the shop, they have limited ammo and can only be refilled by picking up ammo cartridges.The gameplay is fairly fun and interactive.  You get to move your character around and attack enemies.  There is some skill involved where you have to learn the enemy attack patterns and fight accordingly.  But most of the time you're just kiting enemies and counter attack with a slash.Also I would like to mention this game is a ""rogue-lite"".  If you die in a level you have to start over from the beginning floor and you also lose whatever items and power ups you purchased.  Also after you beat a level you start from scratch again in the next level.  But there is permanent progression after each death or passing a level you get exp/credits, these go towards unlocking character skins and titles.My only gripe is the pacing of the game, it is kind of slow.  Imagine MOBA-like movement, but you're actually controlling the character manually so everything feels like slow-motion, sort of.  I'm assuming this was chosen because they wanted combat to be more ""tactical"", but I feel there are other ways to go about this.  For hours:price ratio, if you can look past the slow-pace of the game you will definitely get your money's worth and much more out of this game.  But I feel though the full retail price is too much for the current game, I would wait for a discount.Overall this is still a good game to have in your library collection eventually.  The combat and characters make it very fun and you just want to come back for more.  I hope this review helps you decide whether to purchase the game or not.			"

												Addictive little rogue-like dungeon crawler set in a 80s neon Cyberpunk style not unlike Far Cry Blood Dragon. You finish floors by going room to room (kind of reminded me of Dungeon of the Endless) and kill the enemies inside that room. Since you only have a very limited amount of hits you can take and not a lot of chances to replenish it, you have to be very careful when fighting the very varied enemies. Tactics and timing is absolutely necessary to succeed and this is where the fun is. The four different playable characters allow interesting combos with each other to kill enemies faster which is necessary on harder difficulties and levels. Kill to Collect combines this with randomly generated elements and and a credits reward system even when you fail which makes it all that more addicting. I can absolutely reccommend the game if you like a challenge and the idea of a co-op rogue-like interests you.			"

												Definitely one of the best hack n slash rouge-likes out at the moment! I had so much fun playing with friends :)+ Feels like the slashing is on point, killing enemies is very rewarding+ Nice art style+ 80's music is sweet+ Perfect for short, intense bursts of play to chillax after work Feedback to devs:* More variety in the music (not sure if there's more than one track playing in the background?)* The game is sometimes a bit laggy?* I feel like some kind of bigger overall progress is missing? It's a lot of fire and forget at the moment. It would be nice to have a big picture of your progress or improvement...it just feel as if there's some kind of ""depth"" missing atm? Compare to the newest Gauntlet.All in all: having tons of fun, hoping the devs will work more on the depth of the gameplay :)			"

												An enjoyable hack-and-slash romp through randomized dungeons. Also features unique characters and quite a variety of enemies. My only complaint thus far is the lack of long-term customization or progression, but it's a nice coffee-break style hacky-slashy experience.			"

												Kill to Collect is a fun and unique bullet hellesque game, featuring a lovely art style. The game plays like most dungeon crawl/bullethell style games in the fact you are progessing levels filled with  bad guys to fight a boss. The game has its own charm and gameplay elemets but it really is fun to play in challenge mode, where you have one life to make it on the leader board per day. Some issues with the game are the lack of characters, powerups, and  special weapons. With games like Binding of Issac, Dungeon Souls, and Enter The Gungeon i expected a TAD more on release for this game. Also the sound design and sound track could use a bit of love. All in all this game is awesome, fun and pretty, if you are looking for an addition to your library this isnt a bad one.			"

												Kill to Collect is an absolute gem and a must haveRoguelite set in a steampunk world with kickass soundtrack and four badass characters. You can either play by yourself or co-op with up to 3 friends. The different modes and difficulty will provide you with a lots of hours of fun and challenging gameplay where your goal is to complete bounties.Controls are easy to learn, but it is still easy to make mistakes thanks to game's mechanics, if you die at any point, you will start from the first floor.Beautiful colourful graphics, detailed enemies and floors. Real eyecatcher.Overall;Great game that offers a lot of fun for its price highly recommended!Graphics 8/10Sound 9/10Gameplay 10/10			"

												A very challenging and fun game that is just oodles of fun with friends. You'll probably find that one character you like and stick to it, but overall each character plays in a different and unique way, its just a matter of finding your play style. Think Castle Crashers but drenched in neon, gore and and a kickass 80's synth track.			"

												  I'll try and keep this short since I'm certainly not a professional reviewer.  Before I start I want to say that Kill to Collect is easily one of the best games I've played in years.It has some flaws, but the pros far outweigh the cons. I'll shortly list those before I do an in depth review.  As an aside, I'm not sure if I have to clarify that I was given a review code for this game because I was given one of four from a friend who needed to test out the co-op aspect. So, I did that.Pros: Game in absurdly fun.         Music is great.         The enemies are varied and creative.         Very nostalgic.Cons: Difficulty is dodgy.          Level design can be confusing.          Occasional bugs and wonky hitbox detection.  I'll do the Pros first since this game deserves that much. First I'll give a quick rundown of the basic idea.   Kill to Collect is in essence a dungeon crawler. You splatter your enemies across the wall and floors until you find an elevator to the next floor and do the same process. Don't let that trick you into thinking the game has no depth. It has an passable cyberpunk storyline but the gameplay is honestly why we're all here.  At the end of each floor you can spend two types of currency you gained from that floor. Credits are awarded for performing well in the rooms and are used to purchase consumables like personal shields or more secondary weapon ammo. Food stamps are an oh so delicious reward for completing the various challenge rooms through the floors and are used to buy semi-permanent upgrades for your character. Anything you don't spend is saved for the next floor, and after clearing every floor in an area you're thrown into either a boss fight or a few waves of enemies. Once you clear that, it's on to the next area in the story.  The game is absurdly fun: It's absurdly fun! I have 14 ish hours by the time of this review and about 12 of those are in co-op. The characters are all interesting with different movesets for varying playstyles. Each one has a Basic Attack, a Special Attack, an Ultimate, and a Mobility move. On top of that, they each have a unique trait incorporated in their moveset to further cement their 'role' in the party.  Music is great: The music very well done and atmospheric. Atmospheric may not be the correct word but it helps me personally get in the cyberpunk mood. Although it isn't something you'll (likely) be whistling at work like Zelda or Final Fantasy, the music is appropriate and on point with some bumping techno music for one level, and crunchy guitar music on the next.  The enemies are varied: Every area you enter has it's own flavor of baddies, with some levels catering specifically to a certain type like a robotics uprising having only robotic enemies in that area. Outside of those special occasions you'll encounter a pretty range of enemies from punks with axes and laser pistols, to robotic drones and large mantis like robots with claws. You may notice a few palette swaps to indicate enemies with AI but more never hurt anyone.  Very nostalgic: This is the point I most wanted to emphasize because I haven't seen any other reviewers mention this specifically. The game is almost over the top nostalgic for oldschool dungeon crawlers like Gauntlet or most prominently for me, the Loaded and Reloaded series. I see the word Roguelite being tossed around but I feel that's doing a disservice to this game based on the amount of trash 'roguelike' games being pushed out lately.  And now the cons. I'll reiterate that I played this game when it was technically in beta, but I've continued to play it after the full release and these are the problems I see still persist.  Dodgy Difficulty: There are currently three difficulty modes while I write this review. Easy, Normal, and Hard.The difference between easy and normal was literally imperceptible to me outside of beginning with slightly more HP.The difference between Normal and Hard however is like night and day and may deter anyone from ever trying it out.On hard mode you have 1 health point to begin with, and close to everything will kill you in one hit. Learning to use your weapons effectively is paramount and is what I consider to be the way the devs intended KtC to be played.  Confusing Level Design: This one is tricky because it could very well be just the group I played with.The literal level design is very simple and straight forwad with every floor being comprised of a series of rooms, roughly square shaped with different floor hazards like pitfalls or robotic turrets and vats of acid.  The real problem stems from the questionable color choice on some the floors and enemies. Very frequently my friends and I would find ourselves in a situation where the enemies and floor would be so similar in color that you couldn't tell anyone was even there until they killed you. In particular, it's the red flooring and red enemies that caused issues for us.  Bugs and hitboxes: This is easily the most frustrating part of this game for me. The hitbox detection felt so on point for many of the bad guys I encountered, but a couple in particular seemed to be wildly innacurate. In particular the little robotic probes and the sword and shield guys. There are times when you can easily be outside their range and still be hit by their attacks. It's especially frustrating on hard mode since that death can feel very cheap.  The occasional bugs weren't terrible but should be mentioned. On the loading screens, we would occasionally lock up and have to Alt+F4 out and restart the game.   There is another bug where your characters will seem to magnetize to one another and go launching off at breakneck speeds wildly. It caused a few deaths and can lead to you trying to avoid working together and just clear a little corner of the room each so you don't get too close to one another.  I know I said I'd try and keep this short, but honestly Kill to Collect is firmly one of my favorite games to play now and I had a hard time not rambling about how great it is. If you liked Loaded or Reloaded, give it a shot.  Oh, I don't know how to format on here, this is my first review. Sorry if this posts in a weird way.			"

												Not impressed with this game at all.  Been a gamer for 20+ years and I'm unable to get past the first level.   The difficulty is far too high if you're playing single player - and not in the fun challenging way - perhaps it's easier in co-op - but if you're planning to play this single player only then save your money.On the plus side it does look good - great music and seems like it would be fun playing co-op			"

												Hello, thanks for reading my review for Kill to Collect.You control a hero through arena like rooms against a group of enemies, clear one room go to the next, until you find the exit to the next floor. There are challenge rooms with more difficult groups for more rewards, at the level exit you can buy upgrades for your heroe, more attack power, speed, faster skill reload you know the drill. The controls are very smooth, if you learn the enemies attack patterns you can go on and on without loosing a bit of your health bar. Your heroes have 1 direct attack skill, a special skill like stun and an ultimate. All 4 available heroes play different. The grafics look nice, more comic style, the music is excellent. Your level upgrades are not persistent, they are lost when you start a new mission. You can get permanent perks for credits earned by the missions. Those are starter kits, like more medipacks or some power ups when you start.You can play online with up to 4 players. No local coop.If you like twin stick arena shooter like smash tv, this is a very good addition to your collection. Have a nice day.			"

												Kill to Collect has some things that are awesome, some things that are good and a few things that I think could be better.First of all the music and the title screen are amazing and set the tone of the game imidiately. This is a colorful yet violent game with an interesting world that takes you deeper and deeper below ground. The good stuff is focused on the core gameplay: It feels nice to shoot robots in the face with a shotgun, to dodgeroll out of danger and use all the abilites at your disposal to Kill each boss on your hitlist. The soundeffects also help sell the core feel of the game.The things that could be improved on are things like the tutorial which feels uninspired and disconnected from the rest of the experience. I also thing that the enemydesign and upgrades could use some work, since they feel like they have been mostly copied from other titles instead of going in the same direction as the rest of the game. Having a dystoption setting with lots of color is really cool, I wish that there was a better synergy between that and the upgrades etc. Overall Kill to Collect is an entertaining game that shines brightest if you play it for fun with a few friends over Skype. It can be very hectic, adrenaline fueled and entertaining all at once.			"

												Let me start by saying, that this as in me actually writing a review for a game is an incredible thing on its own in this times because I am such a lazy person right now.But the Gameplay of Kill to Collect evoked the urge to express myself, besides grinning like a maniac once i cleared a particularly nasty room. (Ask my girlfiriend... it's a creepy sight to witness). I realy enjoy playing throw the roguelike and twinstickshooter genre alike and love games likeNuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon and hyper light drifter, which are great games, so when I realized this has been able to up the gameplay even more it came as quite a surprise to me.Highpoints:the controls are slick meaning you have no useless keys to use, just 3 for standard attack, one cc ability and your Ultimate, 1 dodge and 4 consumable slots and they are spot on in the responsivity department.the AI in this is so darn fitting, caster avoid you making it hard to get rid of them first, Ranged units kite you, all of them avoid area dmg from environmental hazards. The different enemies have such a distinguished set of behaviours making every room a unique challenge.You can use the rooms against the enemies and feel smart about yourself, the first time a purposefully threw myself into a pit, hanging onto the ledge to avoid a bounty bosses spinning attack, then jumping back up and cutting him to pieces... I felt great.the sound is great, ability and impact sounds are well done.giving you exelent feedback, when an attack is coming etc.and the graphic and physics in this nail the feeling of beeing a skilled contractor doing incredible stuff, into place.The only room for improvement i see is,in the worldbuilding, the feel of the world so to speak could be stronger. maybe add the ability to walk around in the bounty bar and talk to ppl in there for some banter ( stay awhile and listen ).to make everything more coherent. and little things, like a toggle for aimassist.I shall finish this with a big thank you to Pieces Interactive for making this Game and thus making me very happy , so thx guys!P.S.: I apologize for my rather weak formal abilities when i comes to writing in english.

												Don't buy music often on steam, but this one has a solid selection of tracks from various artist like Dynatron, Daniel Deluxe and Midnight Danger. A solid purchase if you're into new retro wave. The price is rather steep, but you get a fun game for free on top of the album. If you're not into videogames you are probably better off picking the tracks up one by one from bandcamp or somewhere like that.			"

												A gem of of a game, really easy to control but hard t master. This game is a light roguelite because you can customize your character a bit but you have no way to improve their base power through progression. The design of each character is diverse enough to play differently with various timing and area of effect of four actions (basic attack, stun, ultimate and dodge). Planning to kill multiple enemies with environmental damage is satisfying.Graphic and soundtrack are fitting and vibrant, so much COLOR!Highly recommended for both solo and co-op.			"

												This basically plays like Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance on hard mode, except there's no leveling up to lower the difficulty. BG:DA is one of my all-time favorites, so that's a great thing! You must avoid taking damage at almost all cost, so you need to master dodging. So practice solo a bit before joining the fray, and you'll stay alive much longer. Don't expect a story-heavy RPG that allows you to out-level and out-gear the enemies - this game is pure skill.			"

												I grew up on 80's ""Double Dragon"" & 90's ""Streets of Rage 2"", so I love games like this. If you enjoyed the newer reboot series such as ""Double Dragon Neon"" or ""Gauntlet"", you should definitely check this out.""Kill to Collect"" is an isometric beat-em-up.  The four different characters play very differently. Each mission is procedurally generated.Playing on Hard difficulty level, I cleared the first mission. The second mission has different adverseries. Hard difficulty is super hardcore because you start off with 1 hp, so perfection or near-perfection is required. I found myself swearing at the screen many times.In addition to Story Mode, there are procedurally generated, daily challenges, which you can take part in, to see if you can make it to the top of the Leaderboard.You need to use a controller, since it is very difficult to hit diagonals on a keyboard.I love the music, I just wish that there were more music tracks. The dialogue made me laugh a few times.Gameplay video:

												Honestly the first few hours of the game are good. Solid gameplay, the music is amazing, the controls are great. It's fun until you actually put time into it...Then you realize the game is made with little care or effort. The game has glitches that have not been fixed (I see forum posts about the same issues from 3 months back which the devs saw and did nothing about). It also gets incredibly difficult towards the end, with boss combinations similar to early Diablo 3 (shield, clone, teleport) that make it nearly impossible to beat unless you have a full group of friends. I feel like with a responsive dev team this game could be great, but it doesn't seem like they want to put the effort into it.TLDR; The game almost requires a group. With a small community, this is difficult. Buy it if you have some friends willing to play with you. The game has minor glitches. Lacks dev communication.			"

												Fun, but it's over-priced for the market.There's no community, so expect to play this alone. Also, the game is a little unbalanced with bad-guys. Stun shield's a little OP against certain hero classes. So, you are locked into play other characters, just so you can progress--so, not the best game design.			"
