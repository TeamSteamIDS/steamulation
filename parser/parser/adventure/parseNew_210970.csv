												To start with, a word of caution - If you do not enjoy trying to understand puzzles, you will not enjoy this game. Note I say ""understand"" instead of ""solve"", because the distinction is important. Solving a puzzle is rewarding to anyone. It's easy enough to appreciate getting the solution after struggling with a puzzle for a while. Games like Portal make great use of this. Portal is about finding the solution that will let you move on. The Witness is different. The Witness is a game about understanding puzzles. Understanding a puzzle is about more than just finding a solution. It's about knowing how the puzzle works. It's about knowing what makes a solution a solution.  You could be shown the answer to many of the puzzles in the game and be immediately and totally stuck on the next puzzle. Why? Because you didn't understand the puzzle. You don't understand why that solution is a solution. Without that knowledge, you cannot move on to the next puzzle. You may even have to go back to a ""solved"" puzzle in order to try and understand it better. Understanding requires questioning. Understanding requires probing. Understanding requires observing. You will be questioning, probing and observing every panel in the game, and indeed, the island itself, all in an attempt to understand. If you do not enjoy trying to understand puzzles, you will not enjoy this game.If, however, you have a love for discovery and understanding, this game will entertain that love in a beautiful and fulfilling way.

												This game is amazing, but not for everyone.  As has been noted, it is a fiendishly difficult puzzler.  It has garnered many negative reviews, mostly from people expecting it to be a puzzle-adventure game, which it is NOT.  It has suffered in it's comparisons to Myst, but it really isn't like that at all.EVERY SINGLE PUZZLE consists of drawing line-path through a grid or symbol.  Every one.  Nothing else.   Every interaction with the world is triggered by drawing a line-path through a grid or symbol.  You cannot interact with the world in any other way.  The environment itself often plays a key role in the puzzles, whether it be clues to the puzzle lurking in the environment, or driving the solution of the puzzle itself.Yet... and here is why the game is great and totally worth the $40 price of admission... something subtle starts to happen to you as you complete puzzle after puzzle.   HOW you solve the puzzles -- the thought process required arrive at a solution for each -- starts to take on meaning and become metaphoric.  There is a palpable sense of MEANING in the puzzles you solve, and that is reflected and reinforced by ALL the environment details and art and media snippets found on the island.   The game begins to speak to you in a language you have learned by playing the game.   And the sum total of THAT experience is profound.  It's not like anything I've ever experienced in a game.Except perhaps Dear Esther.  In Dear Esther you did nothing but walk around, look at stuff, and listen to an intermitent narrative as meaning started to emerge. In Dear Esther, you were an observer.  That game TOLD you a story.   In The Witness you walk around, solve puzzles, look at stuff, and begin to understand WHY you're solving puzzles and what it all means.  This game SHOWS you a story.  It adheres to the old writing adage, SHOW not TELL.When it all comes together -- and HOW it all comes together -- is both intangible and epic.If you're the kind of person whom what I've tried to describe makes sense or is appealing, you'll love this game.  Otherwise, you'll hate it as many reviewers here apparently have hated it.  There's very little in between.			"

												I cannot begin to describe just how saddened I am by ""The Witness."" I had been anticipating it for so long, but ultimately it's been an awful let-down.The short of it:The Witness delivered on its promise of beautiful visuals and challenging puzzles, but while it contains thoughtful (albeit ""borrowed"") philosophical content that's beautifully presented, ultimately the promise of a deep mystery to be uncovered was a bold-faced lie. The game had been hyped for years, and ended up so depressingly disappointing to me that In the end I could barely bring myself to finish it. It is a glut of repetitive, meaningless, storyless puzzle-solving in an otherwise visually compelling environment that would’ve had the exact same impact on me had it been on the iPhone with pixellated 8-bit graphics. It wasn’t a game; it was a task. And it wasn’t one I felt any satisfaction from completing.The description on the store states the following: ""You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.  You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home.""Every word of that is a lie, designed to draw you into an ultimately banal and repetitive walking simulator peppered with puzzles.The long of it:I was anticipating playing The Witness literally for years, having followed the developer's blog from very early on. A rabid Myst series fan, I was chomping at the bit for another story-based puzzle game to sink my teeth into, especially when it was described as an island setting where you arrive without any understanding of why you're there. When it came out, I bought it instantly, literally purchasing a new gaming PC at the same time so I could experience it on modern hardware. (I was overdue for an upgrade anyway.)The visuals are very pleasing to the eye in a bright and surrealistic way that walks a fine line between obviously unreal and bizarrely realistic. The lack of close-up shape and surface detail and overpowering color saturation mixed with believable reflections and lighting feel similar to the graphics of Team Fortress 2, oddly enough. Imagine if Aperture Science and a 5-star gardener with a degree in genetic engineering combined to create a manicured environment as an amusement park: Voila, you have the island from The Witness. It’s a wonderful environment to behold, and was clearly an exhaustive effort to create. There’s definitely a great deal of enjoyment to be had discovering the scope of the island and all its nooks and crannies.The other area that the developers obviously spent a lot of time was the development of the puzzles themselves. Their logic is devious, challenging, and will require you to drag out a pencil and graph paper (or your chosen digital alternative.) There can be a high degree of enjoyment obtained from deciphering their cryptic composition, and the game does a very good job giving you just enough education on the rules to let you figure them out and reach that euphoric ""eureka"" moment. For a time it was wonderful, and at one point I even said to myself “If this could go on forever, that’d be great.” However, I was working off of the assumption that there would be a gradual revelation of the mystery of why I was there on this island, or at least some hints as to its purpose. As time went on, my heart sank deeper and deeper into despair as I realized that assumption was utterly and painfully wrong. It's clear they spent their efforts on the logic behind the puzzles and graphics engine, with no thought at all into building a reason for the player to actually _care_ about solving any of the hundreds of diabolical mazes strewn all around. I can’t say that I hated playing this game, because I only hated it after I realized that everything I was doing was pointless. Up until that point, I was loving it.The only content which can possibly pass off as having “story elements"" besides the unnerving statues strewn about the island are the live-action movies you can “unlock” by solving certain puzzles, all of which hail from a wide variety of sources and eras. Some are absolutely beautiful philosophical discussions on the nature of reality, human understanding, science, God, and cognition. Others are pure avant-garde art which can be thought-provoking, but ultimately only carry whatever meaning the viewer chooses to ascribe to them. Their most common feature, however, is that the game developers didn’t make a single one of them. They’re all from existing documentaries, interviews, and TED-like talks, and while I respect the developers’ inclusion choices, they took absolutely no effort to incorporate into the game. There is one exception of original content, but it's so banal and drawn-out with no visual component that I nearly threw my controller in anger when I realized after sitting and listening to it drone on for almost a full hour that it's only message was: ""people like puzzles."" The rest of the island is so devoid of meaningful story content that I found myself desperately trying to find and unlock all of the videos just to hear a human voice break the soul-crushing silence of the soundtrack-free environment. Indeed, the historical quotes and video excerpts are treats to someone who takes pleasure in philosophy and literature. However, if Jonathan Blow thought he could insert the words of great minds into his puzzle game to have them magically imbue it with deeper meaning, he's either deluded or just plain lazy.This brings me to the thing which depresses me most: The Witness has no story, period. It's a beautiful venue with no party, no music and no people; a concept that actually has literal representation in the game at one point. After anticipating it for so long, the most powerful emotion I felt after completing The Witness was nothing short of betrayal. It felt like Jonathan Blow built it to lure in the kind of people who liked the games it was supposedly ""inspired by,"" only to troll them with a game that itself has no more mystery than a book of sudoku puzzles. I felt like I’d been duped and lied to, and the “secret” ending doesn’t help one bit in changing my mind, nor was it in any way original. In fact, it made me even more angry, because it is one of the single oldest (and worst) cliché endings one can ever possibly use. You've probably guessed what it is just by me saying that...In the end, The Witness has only one point: People like solving puzzles even when there’s no purpose to doing so. It literally even *says this aloud* during the most disappointing piece of unlocked content. If you’re the kind of person who just wants to use an expensive PC to do maze puzzles, The Witness is for you. Aside from that, it’s nothing more than a walking simulator set on a beautiful island that would serve as a great demo for the Oculus Rift. The remaining ""meaningful"" content can be much more easily acquired from the original authors, or YouTube.I'm waiting for Obduction...			"

												I was really on the fence about this one... But in the end I have to just ask myself, how much did I enjoy playing The Witness? The answer is... Not so much. But I am quite aware this game is a quality product, shockful of stuff to look at, and beautiful words and imagery. It's a bit heartbreaking to give it the thumbs down then. It obviously took a lot of thought and effort to design those puzzles, repetitive as they may be...I'll start with what I enjoyed: The island is beautiful, colourful, and meticulously crafted, filled with details to find with your eyes and marvel at. There is at least 1 hour of quality video in the game, metaphysical and philosophical speeches and movie clips that I wouldn't have watched if they weren't in the game. I enjoyed those. I enjoyed the theme of the game and the feeling of awareness it's trying to convey. This appeals to me tremendously.However, it's a puzzle game... And while I don't generally enjoy puzzle games, the first Myst game is one of my favorite games. Just last month I was watching a conference from one of the guys who made Myst, and he said one of the core concepts of Myst was ""No arbitrary puzzles"". Indeed, in Myst, most puzzles make sense within their world. They are different from one age to the other, from one room to the other, they feel like they belong where they are... It's almost as if you're trying to understand how the people who inhabited these ages lived in order to solve the puzzles...... However, The Witness is an ode to arbitrary puzzles. An ode to one very repetitive arbitrary puzzle. It developes an incredibly clever Sudoku/coding/pathfinding mini-game that you have to decode, and puts it EVERYWHERE. Sure, you often need to observe the superbly clever environments to figure out the code to these ""puzzles on a pad"", but in the end, almost all of your time in The Witness will be spend looking at these pad puzzles. There are hundreds of them.One of the intelligent things The Witness does is teach you its complicated puzzle-solving language. It does so magnificiently. I thought that, once I'd learned the language, I'd feel great and power through the puzzles.  Nope. Knowing the code is not enough. The game keeps hammering you with more complex forms of the same puzzle, with arbitrary difficulties thrown in. Often times you know exactly what you are supposed to do, yet you have to spend 10 minutes doing it, trying going different paths and whatnot... It's hard to explain without spoiling the puzzle system itself... But that's the key of my displeasure; you understand you're supposed to split these coloured pips from these coloured pips, you have to trace a path through it all... But the path never works, it's blocked by various things, it's annoying. The puzzle isn't hard because of the awesome code you decoded, it's hard because of the ""pathfinding"" element. And that element is always the same, over and over and over. It quickly became tiring, frustrating.I wanted to love this game. And in many ways I do. I thank it for the journey and its philosophy. But by the 15th hour, I couldn't take the puzzles anymore. I'd recommend The Talos Principle over The Witness. Like Myst, The Talos Principle also had the benefit of having an intriguing story. And some of its philosophy was engrossing also. I also hit puzzle fatigue in The Talos Principle, and it also suffered from arbitrary puzzles... The two games share that problem when compared to Myst. But it seemed less extreme with Talos, especially because it was backed by story.So in the end, I don't necessarily ""not recommend"" The Witness. But you really, REALLY have to be a puzzle-game fan in my humble opinion.I do commend it for doing what it wants, with no compromise. I tip my hat off to the team behind this challenging and visionnary game. This alone almost makes me want to give the game a thumbs up.  But... I didn't really feel good playing the game because of its puzzles...			"

												I've just started playing and I was enjoying the game up until I stumbled against a color based puzzle. I'm colorblind and this game can not be completed alone if you are. there is no indication on such probleme on the store page and no colorblind mode in the game. I understand that it might be difficult or impossible to make the game accesible to anyone but at least put a warning up front. If you are not affect by such probleme, go for it, the game is really good and promising.As for me, I'm ... displeased because I can't enjoy this game.			"

												There is a general dichotomy I have noticed when people talk about The Witness. There are people who adore the game, and there are people who hate it. There are people who view it as a pinnacle of the artform, and there are people who think it's pretentious garbage. Me? Personally? I find The Witness to be a brilliant game. But you might disagree.The majority of The Witness is solving puzzles. A vast majority. They are good puzzles. They are thoroughly engaging and clever puzzles. Some of the twists on mechanics are outstanding and mindbending. Almost all the puzzles are designed in a way that make solving them impossible unless you understand the mechanics. An amount of the puzzles, unfortunately, are designed in such a way that kind of throw colorblind people (in certain, specific areas) and tone deaf (or deaf people at all) people under the bus. Even if you aren't one of these, there is a possibility to get hung up because you don't pick up on what the designer wants you to pick up on, whether it be the perception of shapes, the perception of mechanics, or perception of the world. These, while often fun, put a lot of expectation on the player to perceive things like light and sound the same way as the designer, which is quite a burden for the player to bear. (Also, the ship puzzle sucks. You'll understand if you play it.)Do you like puzzles? If you don't, do not play this game.One thing I greatly appreciate about The Witness is how much of a learning experience it is. Many puzzles are based on rethinking mechanics you already thought you understood in completely different scenarios. In certain moments, I audibly exclaimed something like ""Oh man!"" at the new way I looked at things.The other percentage of the experience consists of walking, and listening to audio tapes, and occasionally watching a video. The audio tapes are usually some thoughtful quote for you to chew on. The videos range from really interesting to... uncomfortable, honestly (four of them are neat, two of them are... just strange.) The Island itself (the location of the game) is colorful and beautiful. There are plenty of nice sights to see, and mystery to ponder, even if theres no real answer. It's a little boring, all of it, but it's pensive quiet time, and serves as a set for the secret second half of this game.Because there's this other half to that percentage. I have a love-hate relationship with this half of the game.  Without spoiling anything, I will call them ""secret puzzles"". They are not necessary to complete the game, and serve (unfortunately?) no mechanical purpose other than gratification. A lot of them are easy to find, but many are so out of nowhere and convoluted that it feels more like a directionless scavenger hunt. It might be the case that these secretive puzzles are intended to bring together players outside of the game to trade secrets (a la Zelda on the NES, or PT), in which case, the game succeeded. And that being said, some of these secret puzzles are jaw-dropping, even if I couldn't sleuth them out on my own. They are creative and unique, evoking those ""Oh man!"" responses frequently.The Witness is a good game. If you don't like puzzles, don't play it. If you do like puzzles, maybe play it. (This review kind of sucks but I wanted to say something. Whatever.)			"

												I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the ""helpful"" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)As other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't ""fun""; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than ""fun,"" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.Insofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).The only objective drawbacks I can think of are:1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.From what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...The intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.The Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.The island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.Because you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.There's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.Being an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.If I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.			"

												So many negative reviews for this game recently, and they don't make any sense to me. This game is not about instant gratification, it is about learning how the world works and paying attention to the language it teaches you to use. There are surprises galore, and they just keep coming. I truly believe this game to be a work of art, a labour of love, and a beautifully enjoyable experience. It won't be for everyone, but for players who want something cereberal, rewarding and surprising, and an experience which doesn't lead you by the hand and show you exactly what to do at every turn, get it get it get it! 10/10.

												I always have trouble when thinking about how to suggest The Witness to friends and other players; not because it's not worth your time and money, but because it's so hard to explain what makes it so special and why everyone should at least give it a try.There's no need to lie though: one of the main obstacles with suggesting it is that, at its core, The Witness is a puzzle game; your interactions in the game are exclusively limited to puzzles.And yet, it's so well crafted that it may be among the best puzzle games ever made to date.In The Witness, you wake up on an island that you're free to explore, accessing the various areas through completing hundreds of so-called ""line puzzles"" that are scattered everywhere.There's no tutorial. There's no pointing arrow. There's not even text, save for the subtitles of various unrelated audio logs you'll find on the island, which are mechanically (but not thematically) unrelated to what you're going through. The Island and its puzzles, via design and balancing, are everything at the same time: they're your tutorial; they're your test; they're your guidance. The whole island is your puzzle, your chest to crack open and treasure to pillage. Progress is your goal, your tool and your reward at the same time, one thin line after the other.After a brief and enclosed area that teaches you the very basic mechanics of interacting with puzzles, the world will open its gates and start teaching you how to progress via the puzzles themselves. Each area will present you with new rules without stating them, together with easy puzzles that serve the purpose of letting YOU, the player, the guest of the island, infer the rules on your own. As you progress through the areas you will start to understand the game's language, what it tells to you, and your mind will start deconstructing a new puzzle or even rule before you even start actively thinking about it. But where do I go in this game? What do I do? You do line puzzles. The world will let you know how. The world will let you know where to go. Without saying a word, of course. Go out and explore. Find out for yourself.The Witness is many things: a journey, a journey inside a journey, an excellent exercise in game and level design, a maieutic process of self-teaching and inductive learning, a beautiful still piece of colorful vistas...What The Witness isn't, is being a game for everyone. We all have videogame genres that we can't stand, and puzzle games seem to be at least disliked by a vast portion of gamers, if not even hated.And yet, The Witness manages to reach such high moments, to have such elegance in its design and progression that if you'll ever have to try out a puzzle game to see what the fuss is all about, it's this one.Do you know that feeling when you finally solve a problem, or a puzzle in a game, and it feels really good? That ""ooooh, yes, finally... I got here all on my own! Suck it, game!"" feeling?Now imagine that feeling being distilled, purified, made into a crystal, polished and put it inside a 30 to 40 hour game for you to partake of its beauty.The Witness is this, and more.

												I begrudgingly choose not to recommend The Witness despite some excellent puzzle design because I feel that the majority of gamers (myself included) will not have the patience, stamina or desire to complete the grueling puzzles in this game with no reward other than a feeling of accomplishment for figuring out the solution. I completed the game only out of pride and curiosity to see if there was any kind of big reveal at the end. I was disappointed.Ultimately, whether or not you will like this game depends on your philosophy about what a video game should be. If you haven't watched the Youtube video titled Jonathan Blow: How Mainstream Devs Are Getting It Wrong, I suggest you watch it before dropping $40 on this game. Blow is the lead developer for The Witness and Braid, and his philosophy about games is that they shouldn't be designed to be fun. Rather they should be designed to instill a particular emotion in the player. He also detests hand-holding by the developers, opting for an approach where the game lets players discover everything on their own. These principles are on full display in The Witness. Much of the game is not fun. It is often brainwracking and frustrating. The emotion he wants you to experience through this process is that ""eureka!"" moment from discovering everything all on your own. For some, that experience might justify the price.However, I disagree with Blow. I understand his desire to use video games as an artistic form of expression, but ultimately when I play a game that has over 600 puzzles and easily over 20 hours of gameplay, I want it to be a fun experience. I contrast his philosophy on game design with Sid Meier's. Meier would take an interesting concept and attempt to develop it into a workable game. He would have testers play the game over and over, making changes each time, based on player feedback, until it was fun. If he could not make it fun for the majority of people, he would scrap the game. Jonathan Blow doesn't do this. Fun wasn't a design consideration in the Witness. Therefore, he decided not to incorporate anything into the game that might distract from his themes of exploration and discovery, despite the possibility of making the game more enjoyable for the majority of people. So what we have in the end is Blow's vision of what he wants the game to be, as uncontaminated by player opinions as possible.It's too bad because if these well conceived puzzles and pretty open world were incorporated into a suspenseful plot where details were revealed after solving each area, I would have really liked this game. Sadly, there is no plot here, and for the majority of people the puzzles alone probably aren't rewarding enough to motivate you to slog through it without resorting to guides on the internet. Thus, I only recommend The Witness for those who just really enjoy puzzles or who are willing to play a game despite it not being an enjoyable experience much of the time. If you do decide to get this game, take my advice: savor it slowly. The puzzles are much more enjoyable if you do them a few at a time, rather than binge-puzzling through entire areas. If you get stuck on a puzzle, minimize frustration by taking a break from the game or exploring somewhere else for a while. And the puzzles in the ending area are the worst in the game. They are all either extremely difficult puzzles, or they are easy but unoriginal, tedious, and annoying.Pros: Experience of discovery and exploration, beautiful scenery, clever puzzle design.Cons: Hours of frustration, no plot to discover, ending puzzles are terrible, and the ending itself isn't great either.EDIT 3/10/2016: Many people didn't think I clearly stated my personal opinion, so ""(myself included)"" was added to the first paragraph to make it clear that my overall experience with the game was negative. I also clarified a bit in the paragraph which contrasts Sid Meier and Jonathan Blow's design process.			"

												It's brillant. It's deeper and more challanging than it looks at first. It has roughtly two halves that feel very different. The first part is very interesting, satisfying and engaging. You have to be willing to explore a bit and leave areas to come back later when you know more about their rules. A big part of the game is to figure out the rules that govern the different types of puzzles. Almost all puzzles in this game involve drawing lines, or drawing lines in mazes. Many puzzles are simple, equally many require some thought, some are engaging in the sense that you have to interact with the environment in order to solve them, some are tricky in the sense that you're not given enough information to solve them at first, or you have to be very observant about your surroundings. With persistence you can figure them out. A small minority is overdone and a tad too obscure so the solution is borderline arbitrary even if you know all the hints.  Overlapping series of very similar ambient sound samples of drops falling in the environment paired with an invisible symmetry line and light filter interactions all supposed to be hints? That's overdone in my book and condemns some puzzles to become a community effort on reddit requiring real work to solve. Even if it is true that all of the elements have been encountered in isolation before.  Puzzle difficulty should not scale through obscurity alone. The Witness does this sometimes, but thankfully only a very few places are guilty of this. A slightly bigger minority of puzzles pretty much requires you to actually take notes, and solve the puzzle off-screen. Mostly on puzzles that can switch state somehow, and you only see one state at a time on-screeen. The puzzle requires you to integrate all possible states in order to solve it. I generally think a puzzle game like this should strive to be on-screen solvable. If the game had a graph-paper note-taking/experimentation tool it would be perfect.The second half of the game is optional and is the equivalent of a pixel hunt in 2d games of old, but with a third dimension, and sometimes timing or moving parts added to the mix as well. This part of the game does not respect your time and effort, and there's no adequate reward except to have found them. Think finding a 100 flags in assassins creed. Things are hidden, you have to find them. The one hint you get is roughly the direction a thing is hidden and what it looks like. I think that second part is too expansive and sometimes things are too cleverly hidden. It's a scavenger hunt that is fit for a reddit effort, not a single-player experience. It's also not engaging your intellect. Merely your patience and perseverance. And therefore I'd rate that second part, although the idea and the execution are both brilliant in my opinion, as too repetetive and unrewarding to be present in this abundance. It goes overboard by not engaging the intellect and imaginagion of the player as much as celebrating the cleverness of the developers. Which is simply unnecessary. I have the deepest regard for the competence in puzzle design, environment design, art direction and the resulting visual coherence. I've never seen these things done so well in a video game before. 10/10 on these fronts.The narrative ambience is remarkable, and will be a polarizing issue for players. You love it or you hate it. There is no straight narrative but rather a collection of ideas dealing with modes of knowing, modes of inquiry and other aspects that shape our understanding of the world. It's a reflection on how the game was designed and how the player is interacting with it, uncovering how it works. In my opinion the narrative ambience is accomplishing its goal rather well, especially once you've seen a sizable portion of the material. Many people would prefer a straight story though.    Piece of advice if you want to play: go blind. This is a game about the plasure of finding things out. Incidentally, find 'The pleasure of finding things out' on youtube. Watch it. If the ideas resonate with you, so will the ideas in this game. If you progress far enough, you'll even find 'literal' pieces of that in the game. If you opened the corresponding door legitimately, that is without using a guide, you should be reminded about the chess analogon and 'castleing'. And how you found out about a curious new rule, and had to apply the idea to the door puzzle in order to open it.			"

												NOTE: Some puzzles may be difficult/impossible for the hard of hearing or color-blind.That being said, this is the king of all puzzle games. If you want a game that will throw hundreds of incredibly varied, deep, surprising, challenging puzzles at you for dozens of hours on end, you must buy this. I'm 32 hours in and I'm still excited to unravel the next few mysteries of the island. It helps that the game is gorgeous, so even when I'm stuck on a puzzle I can enjoy the scenery.If you have a puzzle-loving friend, I highly recommend plugging in a second mouse and playing through together. A second perspective really helps with some of the harder puzzles, you will be able to play longer without getting puzzle-fatigued, and you can share in the excitement			"

												The Witness is a game about perspectives.The stated objective of The Witness is to explore an abandoned island and solve puzzles. The real objective of The Witness is to gain knowledge, and understand why things are the way they are. In my time playing The Witness, I became a scientist, an architect, a cartographer, a mathematician, and an artist. The Witness feels perfectly crafted and manufactured, to its own detriment. The Witness is difficult, and uninviting, and intentionally so. The Witness is not an accessible game, and shuns players who are colour blind or hard of hearing at different points.The Witness's inaccessability doesn't feel like an oversight however, when playing The Witness you will feel like the game doesn't care about you as a player. It will not assist you if you will need help. At points it feels like The Witness is laughing at you. But after a long fight, I won against The Witness. And the laugh I had was so good.			"

												Summary: The Witness is an unconventional game that everyone should play, but they won't.I won't lie. It didn't take very long for me to feel frustrated and underwhelmed with this game. At first I wanted to give it a mixed/neutral score (ignoring the fact that Steam lacks the common sense to give us that feedback option). My general impression was that the ideas were creative, but the execution came up short.One of the challenges that either the player or The Witness has to overcome (depending on your point of view) is that the rules aren't going to be explained. If your idea of a good puzzle game is knowing your objective, and just demonstrating what you know, then this game isn't for you. Or is it?What I would argue is that The Witness was very deliberately designed to do something besides just be a game. The witness ISN'T about puzzle mechanics. It's about problem solving in general. It's about facilitating the change that takes place in your brain when you don't know; don't have a clue, but start asking questions; start testing ideas.The Witness wants you to learn how to think for yourself. Not because your avatar has a backstory. Not because there's an achievement to unlock, or some time to kill, or even profit to be had in the business behind it. It just understands that thinking is very much the most fundamental part of being human. And maybe, fewer and fewer people are actually doing it (whether it be a side effect of technology, flaw in social and educational systems, or some other cause or influence).Played correctly (without a walkthrough, video, backseat gamer, etc.), the Witness seeks to cultivate your desire to confront what you don't understand, to foster confidence in your inate ability to figure things out, and to instill passion for knowledge by appreciating your own progress.The Witness is not a conventional game. Expect to be disappointed if that is the lens through which you try to judge it. I wish everyone had the open-mindedness and patience to play it. (And the ability, but that's another matter).			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did.I'm a fan of Jonathan Blow and I LOVED Braid.The Witness ticks all the right boxes for me: beautiful artistic graphics, open world exploration, puzzles to solve, etc.However, this game was never ""fun"" for me.  It was repetitive to the point of being monotonous and frustrating.  There was never any ""ah-ha"" feeling of genius, just solving the same puzzle over and over (with some slightly changing rules).So far, I've ""only"" played 11 hours and activated 2 lasers (~100 puzzles), but I have to say I'm done.  I can't stand to do yet another maze puzzle!Will others love this game?  Absolutely.  It's just not for everyone.EDIT: I wanted to add clarification for what I've done in the game.  I'm more of an explorer type so I wandered around and saw every major area in the game.  I also built-up an understanding for most (if not all) of the rules in the game.I understand the rules for hexagons, squares, ""tetris"" blocks, ""stars"", etc.I did symmetry maze puzzles, tree branching maze puzzles (two major types), sound maze puzzles (which were TERRIBLE), hedge maze puzzles (probably the best ones in the game), color tinted maze puzzles, object tracing maze puzzles, etc.  (Basically 11 hours of nothing but maze puzzles.)I went completely through the ""treehouse"". I climbed to the top of the mountain.  I unlocked pretentious videos.  I unlocked pretentious audio recordings (one of which was 8 minutes long!).  I took boat rides around the island.  I feel that I have a pretty good idea of what this game offers and it's simply not for me.			"

												One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Even ignoring the stuff that would count as a spoiler, the panel puzzles have far, far more depth than you'd think at first glance, and uncovering the rules for how they all work is a challenging but very rewarding experience. Plus the game is absolutely beautiful.I have a notebook full of sketches and drawings I was using to help solve some of the harder puzzles, even went as far as to physically make some props for some of them. That is a sign of a great puzzle game.			"

												The best way I've ever found of reminding myself how dumb I am.Many puzzles require a kind of lateral thinking which is incredibly satisfying when you work out the correct approach and suddenly realise what seemed impossible is trivial. It's frequently frustrating and unforgiving, and if you're not good at mental spacial transformation tasks then it'll be much harder still, but the lack of hand-holding and incredible level of challenge serve to make it more satisfying.Finding an especially clever solution or approach can actually make you *gasp*.

												The Witness is a first person exploration puzzle game that is highly remarkable for a variety of reasons, some of which sadly can't be discussed easily (or at all) without risking spoilers.For those of you considering the game, please take this to heart and limit or (preferably) just abstain from looking up more info about the game. Many reviews contain spoilers at some level (including the top reviews)! The forums and community hub also do (even though there is a Spoiler subforum, there are still spoilers in the other sub-forums). I will try to keep this review as spoiler free as practical.First and foremost, The Witness manages to evoke even in a seasoned gamer like me, the sense of wonder I felt when playing games like Myst for the first time.That is, among other reasons, because the game is a gorgeous piece of virtual art. Most of us are no longer easily impressed by pretty, expensive, mass produced graphics. This is more than that.While indeed technically excellent, the world (well, island) of The Witness is crafted in a way that feels something like walking around in a masterpiece painting (or series of paintings, as there is considerable environmental variety). Aside from the overall beauty, there are so very many wonderful details to admire. I don't think I have played any other first person 3D game that approaches this level of artistry.Second, the gameplay, which consists primarily of exploration, puzzle solving, and a sort of scavenger hunting is surprisingly enjoyable.The classic CD-ROM game Myst is perhaps the closest comparison and the biggest inspiration for this game, but The Witness is much more accessible, less frustrating, more beautiful, and, I think, more rewarding an experience.It is a game of epiphanies, repeatedly producing quite nice feelings of accomplishment in ways that not many games do, even most puzzle games.This is largely because the puzzle solving mechanics are never directly explained to you, but the world presents you with ample visual and symbolic clues to make your own inferences. This is the core design principle, and, to me, indeed a key selling point.Based on preview videos I saw initially, I had significant reservations about the seemingly simplistic puzzle mechanic. Simple it is indeed, but it is presented in such clever, varied, often challenging ways that it never really felt tedious or overly repetitive to me (although, I am quite good at puzzles). And, yes, there is somewhat more to this than solving 2D puzzles on flat panels.Going into more details about the mechanics would spoil the sense of discovery that is the highlight of the game, so I will not, but I will say that this game will exercise your mind in a wide variety of wonderful ways.It's not an easy game. While getting to the ""easy"" ending can be done without much effort, the game holds substantial challenges for those that wish to take them on.During my playthrough, I ended up using three sheets of graph paper and taking numerous private screenshots for future reference. It's that type of game - the type of game (almost) nobody has dared to make in decades.It takes maybe a 10-20 hours to reach the easy ending, and another 10-20 to reach complete the second achievement. However, there is quite a bit more to do, and doing all of it, even with a guide, would take quite a lot longer.So, to those of you wondering about the $40 price point, the game has plenty to offer to justify it.Conditional RecommendationI highly recommend The Witness to the right audiences. The trick is determining whether or not you are the right audience for the game.Reasons you might not like The Witness:* You have a sensory deficiency (colorblind or deaf) - see Sensory section below for more details* You dislike puzzles.* You dislike thinking.* You want your game mechanics clearly explained to you rather than having to figure them out based on clues/cues.* You need games to have a coherent, ""traditional"" story. What is the game about? If you really must know, it's about epistemology* You would be overly uncomfortable exploring a mostly static world with only some environmental audio, but mostly no music.* You want to be able to do everything in the game without help (note: help is not necessary for the achievements, though some may need it).* You want to be able to do everything in the game in a reasonable amount of time (note: again, not a problem for the achievements)(including this in spoiler tags so others do not inevitably point it out in comments)* You can't stand being ""lectured"" on religion/science/philosophy/art/whatever. This isn't a required part of the game. If you don't like that sort of thing, you can ignore it, but if you do, you will be partially ""missing the point""There is a common complaint that, despite what I said, and despite the overall positive reception, that the core mechanic of the game (drawing a line) is too repetitive. I worried about this initially, but I after having played the game, I think it's fine and surprisingly well done, though perhaps not without some arguable flaws. I guess I have to mention that here because it's such a common complaint, but ultimately if this sounds like a concern to you, the only way to find out if it works for you or not without spoiling the game is to actually play the game for yourself.Besides these warnings, I highly recommend it to anyone else.Misc. NotesThe game is actually ""optionally"" DRM free. The Steam version can be run without Steam, if necessary (although mixing offline/online may cause problems).Buying it at the Humble Store will give you a choice between DRM-free only or Steam key only..The game looks nice on High settings, for which you would need to meet the moderately high recommended requirements. I haven't tried it in lower settings, but I've seen some people say that the game loses a lot when settings go lower, so the experience won't be as nice.Is this game ""indie""? I would say so. Here's a relevant quote from Jonathan Blow (from Reddit AMA):""I am not disappointed with anything from the game. If we had shipped it early, I would have been -- I would have stories like you hear from most game developers, ""well, we originally wanted to do X but we had to de-scope the game because it was obviously too ambitious"", or, ""we tried to do Y but we just didn't get it right and then we had to ship"". No, that is not how we work here. We built an ambitious game and we made sure everything was good and then we shipped it. When you aren't being forced to ship by a publisher or by financial constraints, you can feel free to make the best thing that you can.""A Spoilerful Review by Someone ElseIf you've already finished the game, or are for some silly reason resolved to never play it, then this is another review I'd recommend that discusses the nature of the game in a way that can't be done without spoilers:http://www.gamesradar.com/eureka-moment-what-witness-story-really-about/Sensory InfoThere are sections of the game where puzzles are sound and color based. If you have a sensory deficiency, you will not be able to finish those puzzles on your own. But, you could look up the solutions in a guide.Specifically, the sound puzzles are: in the forest area where there are speakers attached to trees, etc, near the puzzles and for one puzzle in the shipwreckThe color puzzles are in the greenhouse area on the sea facing side of the mountain and a few also in the village area "

												I want to recommend this game for its puzzles and its use of meta-puzzles. The interface is exceptionally clean and elegant, one of the best I've seen in any game. The landscape is carefully designed and rewards exploration. If you enjoy solving puzzles, you will not regret buying this game.As a game, this is a great success, in my opinion. And as a piece of software, too.However, there are some serious drawbacks, in my opinion. The first and worst is, while I can intellectually appreciate the aesthetic principles underlying the art style, it is not to my taste. I found the color palette, in particular, distracting and annoying, rather than soothing. And there is a sterility and artificiality to the whole environment that made me weary.The second problem is, thankfully, an optional experience. And I am grateful to the developers that they made it optional.  There are interactive memory cards scattered around the environment. When you click on one, a famous quotation is read/recited. I recognized many of the quotes from my university days and my own personal reading over the last 60ish years. The quotations are not unconnected to their surroundings. But I find them tedious and pretentious. After the first few, I stopped clicking on them all together.The other problem I have with the quotations is that they are all taken out of context. Context is extremely important in all areas of communication., but especially written communication. Taken out of context, quotations become sound bites that are carefully chosen to support the chooser's ideas and beliefs.  I would encourage any player to explore the quotes you most enjoy outside the context of this game. "

												Extremely disappointed by this game given all the glowing reviews this game has received from various media outlets. It is confusing precisely why these critics had given the game so much praise considering just how repetitious, tedious and deeply unsatisfying these puzzles are to solve. This review is coming from someone who has completed and immensely enjoyed the original Braid, the Portal games, and the Talos Principle + its DLC.  All the puzzles I’ve encountered so far have the same basic structure; you trace a line through a maze governed by certain constraints and rules that you need to discover. The discovery of these rules is an application of the tools of the scientific method; you’ll begin by formulating a working hypothesis about how to traverse the maze, then you’ll test your idea by applying the rule to each of the series of thematically-related mazes that follows. Almost always you will find that you will need to revise your working-rule in favor of some deeper rule, going back to previous puzzles to figure out the commonality between a series of mazes. When nearly every puzzle you encounter is actively trying to defy your expectations, repeat this process puzzle after puzzle (ad nauseum) and you’ll soon begin to see just how frustrating and unfun these puzzles are to complete. Often you’ll be on the last puzzle of a series just to find out that what you thought was true is in fact incorrect, leaving you dumbfounded at what to do next. Sure, you’re free to walk away from the puzzle, but you’re disincentivized from doing so since – after returning -- you are likely going to forget about what the hell was going on in that problematic puzzle in the first place, forcing you to recapitulate the entire tortuous and stressful process again under the mind-numbing electrical droning of the panel upon which the maze is displayed. These puzzles are also difficult, both logically and cognitively. You’ll be applying deductions in formal logic while storing complex patterns in visual memory, mentally rotating them and retracing them onto the maze panel. Better for puzzle games to be too hard than too easy for sure, but mentally exhausting for the player.  Well, the pay-off to solving these puzzles must surely be worth it, right?! Well, sometimes you’ll be rewarded with something tantalizing – e.g. a staircase descending somewhere mysterious or a stark change in scenery -- only to find that it is locked behind a door with yet another puzzle panel, this time with alien symbols upon them. Other times seemingly nothing happens -- at all. Or, perhaps you will be given a long, boring audio recording of a quote/monologue voiced by some pompous sounding ♥♥♥♥. Yay! Not even your experience of the feeling of insight will be a satisfying reward for you because that too becomes so routine that is becomes boring and banal. The sheer profundity of your epiphanies will begin to wane after your 11th insight. There’s not much to do in the world other than the puzzles or taking in the visual scenes of the beautiful looking art-style. No discernible story, no ambient soundtrack, limited ability to wander through the world. I cannot recommend this game at all (unless you are a masochist). Maybe if you are a puzzle fanatic you will enjoy this game. I seriously considered getting a refund but decided to give the game a chance to unfold and prove me wrong. I had not experience any of the “brilliance” this game has been ascribed, so perhaps I am missing something that only shows up later in the game or in areas I have not explored. What I think most critics call brilliance is little more than the fact that some puzzles extend or are transposed into the wider world; something which merely requires one to be more observant of the surroundings the puzzle is situated, not genius. Update:  As a point of reference for how far I got into the game when this review was written, I played ~8hrs and completed 124 puzzles + 11			"

												I will always adore a clever puzzler. The Witness is the embodiment of clever puzzling. Sure, it will not be for everyone. In fact, the exact things people tend to dislike are the things I absolutely love about this game. A very simple idea, a grid panel, yet you get presented with dozens of different ways these panels have solutions that really becomes not the same repetitive puzzle, but an exploration of ideas.I did not find it repetitive. In fact, around every corner I would get blown away by how different a new puzzle could feel. The island itself becomes a part of the puzzle and you get to know so much of it intimately. There are no tricks, no cheap shots, in fact some of the more irritating moments you may realize is you overcomplicating the whole thing.An extraordinary amount of love went into crafting this game, and once you dive in and realize that it's not giving you the same thing over and over, but that it's trying to show you a world from perspectives you may not have expected, it will become a world you really want to explore. I thoroughly enjoyed my time on this island, found it well worth the $40, and could not disagree that for some it is just not going to be your cup of tea.			"

Even after 50 hours of playing, I'm still continuing to discover things that blow my mind. I really don't know what else to say without spoiling anything about the puzzles. I'll just say that at LEAST 95% of this game would be impossible without the island. People who are claiming that the island is useless are just plain wrong, and almost every single thing in the environment is placed there for a reason.Also, people who are claiming that it's a ""walking simulator"" or a ""$0.99 phone game"" are completely wrong as well. It's obvious that they haven't gotten past the starting area. If there actually are ""phone games"" like this then please point me in their direction. I'd love to purchase them.			"

												SPOILER WARNING.I have never seen a game that hated its player so much. I don't mind how challenging it is. I really don't. I perservered and in the end, I finished it. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy myself. It was baffling to me that the game would do arbitrary things and then be deathly silent while I tried to figure out what just happened. I don't like how it guesses your solution to a puzzle and then puts another obstacle in the way just to make you frustrated. I don't like how it preaches esoteric themes about humanity and then scoffs at the player's humanity. I don't like how it builds itself up to be ethereal and high-minded and then....doesn't fill in any of the plot gaps. I have so many questions still. Who is my character? Why are they the only one not turned to stone? Why did everyone else turn to stone in the first place? Were those giants in the quarry? Why are there giants? Why are the giants doing the manual labor? Are they enslaved? (The giants were so strange to me.) What's with the huge scene in the castle courtyard? Why do I feel like I'm simultaneously in the 21st century and the 14th? Why is there an eastern temple when everything else seems incredibly western? Just.....what happened? At all??Look, game, I've taken Philosophy 101, I know the whole ""I think therefore I am"" garbage. Don't spike my curiosity with this elaborate, beautiful, story-telling scenery, then ignore it, and instead condescend to me like I'm a freshman in college. I am just.....so disappointed. I feel like if I straight up asked the game what the story behind it all was, it would snort and go, ""Like you'd even get it."" Don't bore me with lectures about peace and love and humanity, and then have no humanity to give.I have to say though, only when the end of the game flyover came around, and it started undoing and shutting off all my hard work, did I realize the game hated me. It straight hated me. It thought I was an absolute piece of garbage and it had no respect for me, my time, or my humanity. I am exhausted by The Witness. If someone asked me if I recommended it, I would tell them, if you like puzzles, go ahead and play it, but go in knowing that the game hates you and everything you are. Don't expect anything but frustration and confusion. Discovery and accomplishment may happen, but they are completely overshadowed in the end.			"

												The main thing I think this game suffers from is over promising. Had this been sold for half the price on the basis of ""I've thought up some interesting mechanics to stick into a maze/grid puzzle, here's 500 or so of them"" I'd have probably quite enjoyed solving a few dozen of them. The problem is that The Witness promises intrigue and a story which it nevers delivers on.The puzzles are okay but being limited to just pathing a line through a grid means that solutions at times are pushed past what is reasonable and mechanics are introduced which are just plain bad. There are parts to game where you need to use sound to solve puzzles but this isn't always made obvious and later in the game some puzzles have their difficulty increased by using flashing colours and disorienting, moving grids. A bit cheap for a thinking-mans puzzle game.The game does have some nice sections and some of the more enviromentally based puzzles are satisfying but they can't make up for the lack of depth or the missing narrative which gradually saps your enthusiasm. The environment is pretty, and the world design is interesting to discover but I can't help wishing they'd given us some way to interact with all that beauty.I think most players will walk away from The Witness thinking what a great experience it could have been but feeling short changed by the promise of solving the larger mystery of the world and not entirely impressed by some of the games tricks for artificially stretching the difficulty of the puzzles.Additionally, I found it very interesting to look through the other negative reviews of this game and notice how many others that don't usually review games have made the effort to express their disappointment of The Witness. I know hype sells but the blurb in 'About This Game' saying ""discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home."" is basically a bare-faced lie.			"

												This is my game of the year 2016, hands down. It might even be my game of the decade, let’s see about that. While it can certainly be said that this game is not for everybody, if you’re one of those people it is for, your mind will be blown more times than you knew it had the capacity to.Indications that this game might be for you include:  You enjoy using your logical mind. You find beauty in elegance. The idea of entering a mental dialog with someone who always seems to know what you’re thinking appeals to you. You like not to be patronized by the media you consume. You find a list like this more helpful than an enumeration of game features. "

												I see a lot of negative reviews from people who are missing a key peice of the puzzle with only 1 or 4 hours played. There is way more to this game than what those people think this game actually is. Layers of mystery stacked on top of one another and once you finally understand you'll just want more, and the game offers way more at every step. Nothing is what it simply seems on the first impression. And for your own sake of discovery, experience, and enjoyment do not look things up or look at guides, let the game take you onto an adventrue. If you get stuck becuase you don't understand something, simply move on to another area.			"

I finished The Witness in that I got to the main ending. After experiencing the ending, I had to ask myself if I really enjoyed my time playing this game. In short, it's complicated.I will say that I didn't know much about The Witness before playing, and I did this somewhat intentionally. It did something I have never seen done in a game in that it's almost anti-linear. I guess you could describe that as open-world, but even most of the open-world games I've played had a clear path you were supposed to take (especially those that don't give you access to the entire map from the beginning). The Witness silently encourages you to explore your surroundings. I would look around my immediate area and complete line puzzles until I would get to one I coldn't solve in a reasonable amount of time. Once here, I would walk away and find a new area to work on. The Witness is interesting in that you almost were required to do this, as some areas are unfinishable until you have learned certain puzzle mechanics from other areas. Since I didn't have any prior knowledge on The Witness, I was definitely disappointed to learn that this game is 95% solving line/grid puzzles. If that isn't what you are into then I do not recommend this game at all. As I progressed through the various types of line puzzles, I thought they were cleverly designed and made in a way so that each type felt new in a way. This kept me from getting too bored. What I did not appreciate was the difficulty. After finishing the 'tutorial' area for a new puzzle type, I would feel a sense of accomplishment that I figured out something new. Then I would face the inevitable ""oh wait, maybe my initial assumptions about these puzzles were wrong"" feeling, and I would go back and figure out my mistake. Once I got past that though, I was frequently met with the same frustration. I would have a line puzzle in front of me, I would know how to go about solving it, but I just couldn't find the right path to do so. It's similar to how I feel while playing a lot of point and click adventures. I have a platform thats too tall to climb up to, I have a rope, now how do I proceed?!The Witness is absolutely beautiful, and it upsets me that there is no badge for this game. I would have loved to see the backgrounds that could have been made. Every different 'puzzle area' had it's own look and feel to it, and I loved the beginning of the game when I was simply exploring everything.There is basically no story in this game at all, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. You can make up a story in your head, but what this game presents to you is too vague to give you anything concrete. This is my main problem with The Witness. Nothing about it felt fun. I would enjoy the lovely colors around me, but eventually I'd have to trudge around to find out where the puzzles were. After solving a puzzle, I'd feel satisfied but then the next one would be waiting for me and that satisfication quickly disappeared. I'd find audio recordings where the voices would just read a quote from a noteworthy person from history and some artwork drawn by who knows. I marched on despite all this. I did the majority of the puzzles without much help, and I got to the mountain. Once I got there though, all shame went out the window. I just wanted to get to the end of the game, and once again the game throws me more line puzzles. And for what? Is this some kind of challenge to see if I was paying attention to the hundreds of other puzzles I solved before? Am I supposed to struggle through them and eventually feel smart and good about myself that I did it? I don't find that rewarding. I will say that I'm glad I didn't waste the time going through the mountain puzzles given what the ending was like. The Witness is engaging, and that's why I played for as long as I did. However, it's not entertaining or fun. I won't think back and say to myself, ""playing through that was so great"" or ""I can't wait to play that again in 2 years"". That is my opinion. I can't give this game a thumbs down though. I want people to play this game because I think it's the kind you'll either love or hate, which means discussions about it will be interesting.There are no jump scares, although the whole time playing I felt like something was watching me. Kind of creepy.			"

												I did not enjoy this game at all -- I found it to be pretentious, hackish, and overpriced.  I'm going to avoid spoilers because it is still a relatively new game, but the best thing that I can compare it to is a book of 700 sudoku puzzles.  It's fun to sit down and do a few on an airplane from time to time, but doing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle just feels like tedium -- especially once you've figured out the basic logic and just need to work through 5 or 6 possibilities and do some process of elimination.In addition, the game tries to ""spice up"" the puzzles from time to time by putting them on flickering screens or wrapping them around columns.  Doing so doesn't really add anything to the game.  A flickering screen just means that I have to whip out video recording software (or just spam take screenshot) and leave the game to solve the puzzle.  A column means that I have to pull out pen and paper, diagram the puzzle, and keep going.Fortunately, the puzzles are all well designed and fair, in my estimation.  I didn't find any bugs or have any correct solutions rejected, which speaks to an impressive amount of testing that has gone into this game.  Unfortunately, there are just too many of them for the relatively few ""ah-hah"" moments that you get from figuring out new mechanics.There isn't a story or any real motivation to what you're doing.  The island begs a lot of questions, but never answers them -- worse still, the experience isn't even fleshed out.  I can live with a story that doesn't get tied up nicely at the end, but the story that you can see on the island feels like a 10 page exerpt from the middle of a 300 page book.  There is no beginning, no ending, and no progression or change whatsoever.Finally, there is a collection of short audio logs scattered throughout the island and a few longer ones too (anywhere from 3 minutes to over an hour) on whatever Jonathan Blow felt like including in the game, presumably things he has found enlightening.  It's heavy handed zen that feels completely out of place.  There is a particularly egregious instance of this late in the game (minor spoiler follows) where an optional puzzle requires you to listen to an hour long lecture to receive completion credit.  Mercifully, you can walk away from your computer and let it complete on its own a-la the Braid cloud.As a fan of puzzles (I've attended many MIT mystery hunts on competitive teams), philosophy, and good 'ol Braid, I'm really shocked that I didn't enjoy this game.  But the fact is that I didn't -- playing this game felt like a chore.  I've only gotten the basic ending, but I've been put off by this enough that I don't have any interest in digging deeper myself -- I've youtube'd the rest.All in all, The Witness tries to pass itself off as a 40 hour, near-AAA title by making 700 variants of the same 20 basic puzzle rules.  This struck me as mostly annoying and not very challenging or creative.  This game could and should have been condensed into a 10 dollar, 50-puzzle package with an accompanying book of quotes and lectures that were particularly influential in Jonathan Blow's life.It's hard to believe that this got universal acclaim by all of the pre-release reviews -- maybe it's just me?  Who knows.			"

												I've been waiting to play The Witness since it was announced. I wanted to like it. I really did.But I didn't. Instead, it was a huge disappointment.If you listen to me, maybe you can avoid the same mistake. Or not. Maybe you'll love it. This is just my opinion, after all. Let me explain.The problem I have with The Witness is this: It's not fun. The island itself is wonderfully crafted. I haven't seen an environment this colourful and well designed in a long time. You can tell that a lot of love went into bulding it, making everything line up just right or cast shadows in the perfect spots to do some fantastic perspective tricks. Maybe some branches will look like a pair of eyes, or maybe some statues will line up just right, that kind of thing. And while the island looks small, it feels absolutely enormous. You can go from one end to the other in a few minutes, but each area feels huge. The aesthetics of the different zones are absolutely beautiful, too, with each area having a distinct colour scheme and biome. The glowing wires that link all the puzzles together are really cool, as are the lasers that shine from each finished area. Visually, it's amazing.There are some areas that I saw but never went to. Locked doors I never opened. A whole underground left unexplored, and many more hidden things that I didn't notice and certainly don't have the drive to seek out. The island holds lots of secrets.Unfortunately, the island also holds lots of dull, lifeless line puzzles.A puzzle game lives or dies on the quality of its puzzles. The Witness, without doubt, contains more puzzles, and in a higher density, than any other game I can think of. The game does a fantastic job of training you and making sure you understand how the different rules for each puzzle work, and all without a single word. It's just a shame that they're not fun.You see that trailer up there? Those line puzzles in the first 20 seconds or so? That's it. That's the game. Hours and hours of doing that. You might have seen people sarcastically quoting critics, saying ""It's nothing but line puzzles!"" And they're right. No matter how you slice it, every single puzzle is based on drawing a line from a start point to an end point, usually on a grid. Usually there are some rules to follow. Maybe in some you have two lines, or maybe you have to group colours together, or maybe the grid is a different shape, that kind of thing. It doesn't matter. The beautiful world is wasted as you run around looking at lines and grids on a screen. Or maybe the grid is on a wall. Or maybe on the floor. Maybe it is the floor. It doesn't matter. There is no variation. I could print out every single puzzle in the game and staple them together and miss out on absolutely nothing.When're not puzzling, all you can do is walk around the island in silence, searching for line puzzles or audio logs. And there's always a puzzle lurking somewhere, ready to jump out and bore you to death. Your reward for finishing a line puzzle? Another line puzzle. Maybe that line puzzle you just did will open a door to some more line puzzles. Maybe it will move a platform so you can get to even more line puzzles. Or maybe a panel right next to the line puzzle you just solved will pop open revealing yet another line puzzle. It's endless. And even though each puzzle is unique, they don't feel it. Each puzzle blurs with the one before it, an endless stream of the-same-but-different. As soon as you complete a puzzle, you either follow the wire to the next one or watch another screen with another puzzle turn on, over and over without end. Another grid, another line. There was exactly one ""A-ha!"" moment for me: the hedge mazes. These were easily the best puzzles in the game. Why? Because they're just barely connected to line puzzles at the end of them. Scattered around are audio logs and videos of some people spouting philosophy and Zen teachings. You could try and listen to them, but why bother? There's no story.There's an allusion of one, I'm sure - A logo shows up again and again on various items  - but there's nothing to give it form.After a few hours of lines, my initial enthusiasm faded rapidly. I went from, ""How do I solve this?"", To ""Oh God, not another one"". The puzzles quickly go from being novel to being a chore, and some puzzles will shut off if you fail them, requiring you to go back and re-solve the previous one to reactivate it. Some of the puzzles seem to exist for no reason, too. There are strings of puzzles in some of the areas that just end. No follow up, no shortcuts, nothing. The puzzle chain just stops and leaves you wondering why you just did all that, especially when the skill that it teaches you is never used again. After 10 hours, I'd had enough. At first, I started looking at hints to see if I was moving in the right direction. However, boredom quickly gives way to frustration, and I used a walkthrough to find how to get the remaining 3 of 7 lasers to get to the final area, and then to get through final area itself, where the puzzles start at incredibly difficult and end at impossible. And when you beat the game, what do you get? A vague idea of anything that happened? Nope. Game over, the end. Finally, the biggest problem I have with this it is the price. £30 is absurd. Avoid this, unless, after reading all that, you're still convinced you want it, wait until it's much, much cheaper. Like, 1/3rd of the price.Despite all that, I don't hate The Witness. It's not a bad game! It's well put together and the island is nice to look at if nothing else. It's just not the game I thought it would be.If you want to play a better first person puzzler, go and buy either:The Talos Principle or Fract OSCOr hell, even Myst "

NOTE: This was initially a negative review. In hindsight, I later changed it to positive.The Witness is definitely a game that you'll either love or hate. For me, it was a love-hate-love-hate journey.When it started, I was captured by the environment, the design, the colors. The puzzles looked smooth and fascinating. Everything was mysterious, and the promise of a hidden narrative pushed me onward. That was love.After a while, I realized that the promised narrative (and I say promised because the Steam's misleading description clearly promises it, by stating ""You don't remember who you are, [..] but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home"") is a failed promise. There is no narrative here, other than what you might imagine by yourself, as if looking at a stone cold sculpture. Solving puzzles has almost no consequence. Many little things I didn't care about before (like some puzzles requiring millimetrical positioning in the world, but the engine not supporting analog joystick movement) began to annoy me. That was hate.I moved on. I decided to ignore the missing narrative, to try and just enjoy the puzzles, and the dedication with which the island was crafted. It worked. There is so much richness in The Witness' island, and so many relations between elements. Like that one statue which, if looked from the right perspective, wants to hold hands with a farther one. It's like a beautiful alien mechanism that pushes you to find its deeper connections (only later I realized those connections weren't really meaningful and mostly random, which can still be a beautiful thing but, you know, it depends). That was love again.Finally, I reached the last part of the game. And the puzzles (and the misleading narrative) decided to troll me more evidently. Instead of implementing new ideas, they used dirty tricks like flashing lights and colors and glitchy monitors. They were trying to hurt me, physically. To solve one batch I ended up nauseous. To solve another my vision became blurry for a while. And mind you, these puzzles are not skippable: you HAVE to hurt yourself to go on. Every game developer knows you don't do flashing lights and colors, because on a wide range of people they can have really bad effects, and the eyes are a delicate thing. That was hate, again.Then there was the ending(s). I won't say anything about it to avoid spoilers, but let's just say that, when I connected the dots, I realized that The Witness is just a big FU to players, possibly to humanity. Its anti-philosophical philosophy sways from intellectual frigidity to adolescent depth, from incoherent nihilism to detached positivism, and is overall like a Möbius strip, rolling over itself without anywhere else to go. The Witness didn't have anything to say, other than that it hated me.I never wrote a negative Steam review (other than for the horrible Godus), and I thought I'd write this while still recommending the game. Because, as I mentioned, the island is beautiful, and most puzzles really cool. But then I thought about it more. Yes, I did love part of this, but at this price (please note, I was initially a big supporter of its high price), I can't recommend a game that hates you, and cheats you into believing there's a narrative which is not there. So. My two cents.EDITIt's been a few days now, and I decided to change my review to positive (while leaving my previous words untouched). When I initially finished The Witness, I was angry and very annoyed. In hindsight though, the game's merits feel bigger than its demerits. Sure, I still believe it's a carefully and beautifully crafted empty shell (I'm not really sure if it wanted to be more but couldn't, or if it decided to embrace/show its own limits with frustrated anger) with an overall FU message, but it has a lot of potential, and I hope it will pave the way for better games, both as a culture and as a media. Also, as I mentioned in the review, most puzzles, even if inconsequential, are really good. They have a great learning curve, are well connected to each other, and never feel frustrating (except the ""I want to physically hurt you"" ones towards the end).So. The Witness is, in my humble opinion, a glorious puzzle game on possibly the most beautiful virtual island I ever saw. Other than that, even if it fails at being more, it still shows such potential that it's a game you should play, to see it for yourself.			"

												I think at this point I've seen pretty much all of what The Witness has to offer. I still have about a dozen puzzles and a bunch of obelisk ""lines"" to find, I think I've gotten close to the full experience of the game, if not the full experience of the game. I really would love to recommend this game, but in the end I just can't.Let's start with the good stuff--the presentation and ambiance of the island you're on is wonderful. It's a gorgeous environment with all sorts of hidden nooks and crannies to find and explore, and innumerable easter eggs to find. Many of the puzzles are quite clever, and the way The Witness slowly teaches you the ""language"" of the puzzles bit by bit is great. It's a really good example of how to allow the player to learn the rules of the game on their own in a satisfying manner.However, there's one critical flaw to the Witness that keeps me from recommending it: It isn't really very much fun.I love puzzles in general, especially ones that require creative thinking, and rarely ever get bored doing them. But by the time I reached the end of the The Witness, I was pretty much fed up with it. I was sorely tempted to just look up puzzle solutions online, not because I couldn't solve them, but because I wanted it to be over.Part of the problem is the puzzle design. While each puzzle has its own ""rules,"" they're all fundamentally the same--trace a line through the correct pathway on a panel.  The Witness does an OK job of using the environment in tandem with the panel puzzles, but there's really only so much you can do with this formula. It gets repetitive extremely quickly, and honestly this type of puzzle is more suited to a mobile platform than a full-fledged PC game. This leads to the second problem--the island is horribly disjointed and lacks cohesion. With nearly all of the ""meat"" of the game contained in flat panels sprinkled about a three-dimensional world, an inordinate amount of time is spent running from place to place trying to find the next puzzle. In many cases there doesn't even seem to be any reason for the game world to be there at all.What's worse is that there are some puzzles you won't be able to solve upon initially discovering them--and since there's no sort of map to mark places to come back to, there's a real risk of not being able to find places you want to go back to, or at least waste a lot of time trying to do so.In a way, that pretty much sums up The Witness in general--a pointless waste of time. After finishing the game, the optional ""challenge"" achievement, and unlocking the videos in the windmill (though I have yet to watch them) I didn't feel any real sense of accomplishment or satisfaction, just a vague sense of ""that's 20 hours of my life I'll never get back.""If you want to get a good mindbending puzzle game with a good variety of puzzles, a beautiful aesthetic, and an interesting story to boot, get The Talos Principle. The Witness feels like a wannabe Talos Principle without any of the understanding of what made that game so good. It's a shame because The Witness isn't that far off from being a good game, it just fell a little bit short.			"

												Sometimes you just might be in the mood for a game that will make you feel stupid. And sometimes those stupid people will stop playing less than 2 hours into the game and post a negative review complaining about how difficult the game is.I had to take a picture of my screen with Snapchat and use the paint tool in the app to solve the last 5 100 puzzles I just did.WORDS OF WISDOMIf you're stuck on a puzzle you don't understand the mechanic of, skip it, and come back later. There's no point in trying to brute force it, because there will just be more difficult versions of it beyond the door it unlocks. You will eventually learn how to complete it, at which point you can return and complete it with .Also, if you reach a platform that moves you to a place it seems you can never leave, try to solve the puzzle on the platform in a different matter.Initial ReactionReally though, the bottom line here is that this is a massive puzzle-filled game which competes with the likes of the Portal franchise and The Talos Principle. If you're going to go ahead and sum up this game with, ""so it's just mazes"", then I'm going to go ahead and sum up Portal with, ""so it's just portals"". This is an atmospheric puzzle game through-and-through. The visuals are stunning, despite the complete lack of options related to them, which probably came about as a problem resulting from an indie developer trying their hand at creating a game engine from the ground up rather than using something already established like Unity, Unreal, Crytek, etc... If this game is ""just mazes"", I dare you to try and beat it without the assistance of somebody else. This game is hard. And while mazes are the core mechanic, just like portals are in the Portal games, there are plenty of twists on the mechanic that help change things up just enough, just like in every single other game with a core mechanic that is branched off of.And after looking over a whole bunch of the other reviews, I'm really confused because this isn't a situation like Amazon's reviews where people can just willy nilly review products they didn't purchase. These are all people who legitimately purchased The Witness who are giving it negative reviews. Are these based off of reactions from watching trailers? Did people want another Braid? Where's the audience that gave The Talos Principle a 96% on Steam? This is The Talos Principle on steroids. This is The Talos Principle if the entirety of the game's content was open from the beginning, and you accidentally stumbled onto the last few puzzles of the game.Don't chalk up the game's length to whatever amount of time it takes you to beat the game after having solved the first 5 puzzles on your own, and eventually breaking down and resorting to the use of a guide. These is Dark Souls-levels of difficulty and eventual satisfaction after having accomplished something you never thought you would. This is easily one of the biggest and most difficult puzzle games available on Steam at the moment, and don't let anybody convince you that it's nothing short of great.This game is currently sitting at an 89% on Metacritic, and a 76% here on Steam, with various well-known critics like IGN, Destructoid, Telegraph, and Guardian giving the game perfect 10s. This game is a big deal, and hopefully the Steam userbase, being mostly populated by gamers playing a crate-opening simulator, recognizes that this is far more than just a bunch of mazes.After 10+ HoursOnce you've hit a certain point in the game, everything just starts to click. You begin to realize how crucial it really is to just straight up abandon a difficult puzzle and come back to it, especially if you feel like you're just brute forcing the thing at that point. This game turns into a unique kind of Metroidvania game right off the bat, in which every path is available for the player to explore, but the player soon finds out that some paths are more difficult or even impossible when compared to others. The game doesn't provide you with a unique ability that allows you to double jump up walls, or turn into a ball and roll through tight spaces. Instead, the game offers you the knowledge to go back to these difficult areas and know what you're doing through the use of little mini-tutorials that don't feel like they're holding your hand at all. They feel like they take the same approach that the start of the game does. They feel natural, which is once again why I must stress the importance of abandoning unfamiliar puzzles until you learn how to complete them later on.This is as much a maze game as Dark Souls is a combat game. Sure, it's a pivotal gameplay mechanic, but it produces a much wider range of puzzles than I've ever seen before in a puzzle game, and you can't just take the word of someone who's put 1 hour into the game and called it quits.SummaryPros and cons of the game's release-day content.Pros 600+ puzzles, with a very steep learning curve. No handholding or boring filler content. No individual part of the island feels like wasted space. Nothing feels too similar either. Every area you visit is unique. Each individual puzzle takes a long time to solve, massive sense of accomplishment. Amazing visuals and sound design. Interesting overlapping story supported by hidden tape recorders with well done voice-acted dialogue. Difficulty curve set up like a unique Metroidvania, in which every path is available from the start, but you may not have learned enough about the game to proceed down certain paths until later.Cons Lack of any real options other than V-sync (there is no FPS limit) and standard ""high"", ""med"", ""low"" presets. You're never going to beat this game. "

Product received for free
												A game about understanding puzzles rather than just solving them.If you have a craving to know why a puzzle works like it does, you will like this game.If you however only seek to do puzzles just to solve them, this is not it.Some win/lose aspects about the game are sound based puzzles as I myself have bad hearing.As figured they weren't any puzzles I could enjoy.There are also some puzzles that shift colours like you are on LSD.They are few but they are there.The game feels rewarding as you play it but sadly does not have any satisfying endings.Achievements also seem to be bugged somewhat as it didn't trigger for me.Great Game "

												Ok, let's get the main things out of the way:-this is a puzzle game in which after solving a puzzle you get rewarded only with access to more puzzles and the sense of accomplishment -there's no story to speak of -there's no gameplay to speak of apart from puzzle solving and exploration, which only helps you find more puzzles and take kickass screenshotsSo yes, it all depends on the puzzle design. And this is where it surprised the living bees out of me, because in spite of all that's written above this game turned out to be very fun and addictive.The secret is, obviously, in the puzzles. They're quirky. They're inobvious. They're varied. They require you to pay attention to your surroundings and sometimes to think creatively. They're not too hard, at least those that you need to solve to get the base ending, but they make you feel smart, and make you feel like you've achieved something by solving them. But yes, there're much harder ones in the game too, they're just optional.Remember the first Portal? Remember those puzzles that seem unsolvable, but then you think about them for a couple of minutes and arrive at a solution? Well, the Witness basically embodies it. This is pretty much controlled creativity, and that is what makes this game so addictive. A typical puzzle in the Witness is like this: you see a panel with the puzzle, you think, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is so hard and/or impossible to solve, I'm gonna quit the game now. After five minutes you go back and attempt to solve it. You realize that it wouldn't actually be all that hard, there's a pretty straightforward way to solve it, but, oh no! O cruel heavens! It's blocked. It forces you to think of the alternatives. You try something that is bound to fail once, twice, and then you get an idea. You try to realize it, and on the first or the second try you most likely solve the puzzle. Hooray, you clever you. Now go and repeat it with the next one - and this is important! - not really a harder one. The difficulty of the puzzles is pretty much universal. There're really simple puzzles, sure, but they're there to teach you the rules. Nobody explains you the rules in a human language. You figure them out yourself, by solving puzzles. This is nonverbal communication Jonathan Blow is so fond of. and this makes the game very accessible and very interesting. Whatever language you speak, it's mostly irrelevant, you'll still be able to finish the game. You'll miss on some philosophical quotes, but for me they didn't add all that much to the experience. And you'll learn a new language, a language of a line going through mazes.The puzzles are divided into logical and enviromental, and you'll have to figure out yourself which are which. There're several zones with different kinds of puzzles, and within those zones the puzzles usually go from easy to slightly not easy, in fact not easy at all, in fact, they are hard as ah nevermind, solved it. Also, the puzzles are very local: if you know the rules behind each symbol, you'll be able to just go ahead and solve everything the location has to offer on the spot. But knowledge is often not the case, so you have to go somewhere else and find some puzzles you can actually solve - most often the tutorials for the symbols - and then return and say, yah! It's still not easy at all, but at least I know how to approach it now. Unless those were the enviromental puzzles, and you had to find something relevant in your surroundings. In which case the puzzles are still as mysterious as an emerald doughnut.So this is the Witness, a game where you're rewarded for solving puzzles with feeling clever, and this is somehow enough. If you're able to enjoy originality and quirkiness, and are not too demanding about the presence of the plot, please, do play this game. It's basically like believing in six impossible things before breakfast. Except all six start at the big circle and go through a maze the right way while not crossing themselves.P.S. Interpreting colours correctly is a big part of the game, so if you're colourblind, do safely ignore it. There're also puzzles based on sounds, but they're optional for the base ending, though encountering them may be frustrating.			"

												The less you know about the Witness the better the experience will be, so as soon as you've decided to dive in I recommend you immediately stop reading any reviews and start playing. I can personally say that this game is the greatest puzzle game I've ever played, but a quick look around online shows that it is a bit divisive. I don't think this game is for everybody. Players that expect some revelatory story moment or huge twist upon solving a puzzle will be disappointed. Instead, you gradually discover how the world of the Witness works in a series of subtle moments. I feel like the Witness is for people who are intrinsically curious, and want to understand the world around them for the sake of understanding the world around them.To me, the world of the Witness feels like an much smaller version of our world and, by extension, the player's time with the game feels like a miniature liftetime. When you first start the game with (hopefully) no prior knowledge of the world, you are basically a newborn. You play with the immediate environment around you, poke stuff, click stuff, and try to make sense of the basics of the way the world works. After a few hours under your belt, you'll have an understanding of the world at face value, and may even get a little cocky, thinking you've got the game down. However, after spending 60+ hours with the game, I can look back at my 10 hour self and laugh at how little I actually understood about the world of the Witness, how naive I was, and how much more I had to discover.Then you'll reach ""adulthood"", where you don't know everything about the world but you've begun to see the deeper secrets of it, and you have enough experience to start to wrap your head around the scope of the actual game. You'll reach a point where you realize how much more there is to this place, and for me that was one of my best memories in gaming. If you stick with it for hours after that, you'll eventually get the ""reward"". That reward was when I felt confident enough to say I had a good understanding of the Witness. Puzzles that used to take 30 minutes now took 30 seconds. The island that felt so huge and overwhelming at first I now knew like the back of my hand. I looked at things in a completely different perspective than I did at the start. The game makes you feel like a genius. Maybe not a genius in real life, but a genius in your Witness life. I still have a lot to go before I solve everything the Witness has to offer, and to be honest I probably never will, but I've never had a game that respected it's players ability to discover and learn as much as this game. The Witness is in a class of its own.10/10			"

												This game can't be completed if you have hearing issues / color blindness. To my knowledge that is not really been talked about at all and there is no warning prior to purchasing. Now I'm out money and literally have to resort to looking up puzzles that I just physically can't complete. What a sham.			"

												Seven and a half years after the release of indie darling Braid, Jonathon Blow is back for revenge with another puzzler: The Witness! This newest game is in many ways quite similar to Braid: the puzzles themselves are (for the most part) very well thought-out, the visuals are interesting, and the rest of the game is a complete mess. Braid was a much shorter experience, though, and a lot of the really stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥didn't show up until after you beat the game and received access to Blow's attempt at a plot (really just an infodump). The Witness, being much much longer, gives the player plenty of time to think about what went wrong during the making of this game.The majority of the game's puzzles revolve around the use of various symbols that each denote specific rules that must be kept in mind when solving the puzzle in question. Black and white dots must be separated, tetris blocks must be drawn into the grid, and colored balls must be grouped into pairs. I wouldn't really call any of these spoilers, as the way the game introduces these symbols makes it fairly obvious what their specific rules are. As the game progresses, these symbols are combined and used in increasingly more complex ways, and I would say that this is the one part where The Witness isn't a complete failure. The way that the difficulty progresses feels very natural, and I never found myself stuck on any one puzzle for a very long time. It is when the game deviates from these mechanics that things go downhill.Several areas of the game choose to completely forgo these symbol-based puzzles, with often tedious results. The environment-based puzzles are never difficult: Blow obviously realized that during the development of the game, so the way that these puzzle mechanics evolve just makes them more annoying to solve. For example, one area's gimmick is that you have to listen to bird calls and map out puzzle solutions based on high, medium, and low notes. As you progress through the area, the bird calls begin to get interrupted by other noises, such as wolf howls and jackhammers. Instead of making the puzzles more difficult to solve by increasing their complexity, The Witness chooses in these cases to just make it take longer for the player to get the information they need. Again, these environmental puzzles become extremely tedious: you already know what you have to do, but some silly gimmick has been added that means the puzzle takes five times as long to solve as it should.The game's final area has its own share of problems, which I'll put in spoiler tags. It seems as though our pal Jonathon ran out of ideas for the last hour or two of the game, because most of the puzzles you encounter are extremely simple, with stupid one-off gimmicks that, like the environmental puzzles, add zero real difficulty. Some of the puzzles are at weird angles, some are overlayed with a checkerboard pattern, and some spin around in circles. Considering how long this game has been in development for, I can't believe that these puzzles were kept around.Another problem lies with the way that the puzzles are integrated into the game's world. Most of the game involves solving a series of puzzles, each on its own separate panel, which then unlocks a door to the next series of puzzles. Granted, these are very good puzzles, but it rarely feels like I even need to be on an island at all. In only a few instances do these puzzles have any impact on the world other than activating machinery: in the treetops area, for example, the puzzle panels that you solve slowly form bridges that you use to cross from tree to tree. A few puzzles can be solved in more than one way, and depending on how you solve them, the direction of the bridge changes. As it stands, though, there exists very little relation between the game's puzzles and the game's world.The final major problem, I would say, is the issue of player motivation. The only draw here is the puzzles; if you do not love solving puzzles (in fact, a specific type of puzzle), there is zero reason to buy this game. There is no plot, no lore, nothing exists to motivate those who maybe aren't so keen on the puzzles but want to learn more about this strange island that they're on. In fact, Blow decides to further exacerbate things by dropping audio logs all over the place. No, these aren't recordings made by the people on the island who all apparently turned into statues: they're quotes from famous scientists, artists, and thinkers of the world, telling you about how amazing the world is and how powerful we all are! What's worse, there exists a hidden theater where, by inputting the correct puzzle solution, you can watch unrelated video clips that I guess were meant to ""blow your mind"". Of the three that I found, there's a clip of James Burke talking about how science is the greatest thing ever, one of Richard Feynman talking about the hierarchy of the universe and why he studied physics, and the ending of Tarkovsky's Nostalghia taken out of context. Really, all of these clips and quotes and whatever other♥♥♥♥♥♥was thrown into the game seem to have no purpose for being there. Blow just wanted to sound smart by having a clip in his game where an astronaut talks about how cool space is.I went into this game deliberately avoiding any information I might find (hopefully I don't ruin the magic for anyone reading this♥♥♥♥♥♥. I knew that there were two possibilities: either there was a really interesting backstory, or there wasn't. Not knowing which of these was true meant that, at least for most of the game, there still existed within me a small glimmer of hope that The Witness would end up as something more than a collection of interesting puzzles (not counting the environmental puzzles, ♥♥♥♥ that). It was only during the game's ending, when you fly around the island, disembodied voices say a few unrelated words, and then the game closes itself that I realized that I had been duped. Since I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of the game, it didn't hit me as hard as I would assume that it would hit someone expecting more, but it was still a pretty big disappointment. The Witness just doesn't seem to understand what it wants to be. If you took away the entire island setting and turned The Witness into a traditional puzzle game with a level select system (a la SpaceChem, Mario's Picross, World of Goo, etc), you would certainly lose very little. Sure, I enjoyed exploring the island, but it never felt like a necessary part of the game to me.So, while The Witness is interesting purely as a collection of puzzles, it makes very little effort to justify the existence of its island setting. Outdated concepts such as ""plot"" and ""lore"" are superseded by audio logs talking about how cool our planet is. While 50-60% of the puzzles are very well-designed, the rest involve gimmicks that only serve to bore any competent player. Despite the game's flaws, I did enjoy it. However, I would only recommend it to those interested in solving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of puzzles.Taster's score: C-<!> PUZZLE FIENDS ONLY <!>			"

												Oh boy, here we go...The Witness is probably the hardest letdown for me this year.  I wanted to like it so badly and there's stuff here to enjoy, but in the two hours I spent with it, I enjoyed the first 30 minutes, and flailed around helplessly for the rest of the time.  It starts out with clever 2d-maze puzzles that slowly wean you into learning the rules of each puzzle without explicitly telling you the rules.  You learn what certain symbols on each puzzle mean through trial and error, but the trial and error is guided so that you aren't simply thrown into something that you have no idea what to do with.That is, until the opening segment ends.In the first few puzzles you come across, you are intentionally given a puzzle that you aren't equipped to solve, and this is for a good reason.  You learn to walk away from stuff you don't know and come back when you've learned more.  Along the path, you learn those new rules and then return to solve the once unfamiliar puzzle and you feel accomplished. However, after that puzzle the game stops being a linear path and becomes more about exploring to find the puzzles in a free and open world, and using visual clues in the environment to solve them.  And here is where the game's most brilliant aspect becomes it biggest failure.  When you come to a puzzle that you can't solve, you have two different choices: you can look around in the enviroment for clues, or walk away.  However, the environmental clues are not always apparent: they can be inconsistent, overly subtle, and they even intentionally mislead you on occasion.  In the first half-hour of the game, I solved about 30-40 puzzles.  In the subsequent 90 minutes, I solved FOUR.  And two of them were completely by accident.The problem I have with The Witness is that walking away is a legitimate thing that you are supposed to do.  But you are never told WHEN this is the thing to do and, as a result, you may end up walking away from a puzzle you were well equipped to do, or you might spend an hour on a puzzle you didn't have all of the information for.  The Witness is so damn inconsistent.  Sometimes the answer to the puzzles is in the environment, sometimes all the info is on the 2d puzzle itself, and sometimes the info on the puzzle is incorrect and you are supposed to use visual clues.  It is a constant cycle of ""Am I just not getting it, or have I not been taught this pattern yet"", and that is the LAST thing a player should be feeling in a game about puzzles.The true pleasure of puzzle-solving is the moment when the pieces finally fit together in your head and you think ""Aha!  I've finally got it!""  When you aren't given all the pieces to solve the puzzle, however, then you feel decieved or led on because you couldn't have known any better.  The Witness thrives on this feeling, and I could never tell whether I was missing information, or just not smart enough to do it right.  NO puzzle game should not make you feel that way, and because of that, I can't recommend The Witness.			"

Product received for free
												A great puzzle game with a very discouraging first 2 hours. At first you'll say, ""Surely the entire game won't be solving mazes?"" And it is. But 4 things happen along the way (no spoilers):1) There's dozens of rules for how the mazes work that you'll need to teach yourself, unlearn, relearn, and combine.2) Some mazes make physical changes to platforms that you need to navigate and the multiple solutions to a maze is how you select the position.3) The mazes get REALLY hard. Like, ""10 minutes of poking at it, take a break and sleep on it, graph it, run around the map staring at it from different angles for 5 minutes, go do some other puzzles, come back, AH HA, poke at it for 10 minutes, solved!"" hard.4) There are puzzles absolutely everywhere that you can't see until you know what you're looking for. And then you get paranoid seeing bits and pieces of them, trying to make your hallucinations connect together into a complete puzzle.Through all this the game becomes pretty excellent and is constantly surprising when you least expect it. The major puzzle areas are pretty open to tackle in any order. The island itself looks great and there's some amazing visual surprises that are fun to discover. Everywhere you look you have to wonder if you're seeing all the hidden layers.There's hidden recordings and videos of real deep quotes/essays. Some are interesting and some are sort of philosophically embarrassing. This is the weakest part of the game for me, but they can be ignored entirely. I think they're just things that Blow finds inspiring and that's fine. I feel like I have my own interpretation of what the game is saying, but don't believe there's a plot or story to be uncovered. It's just a self contained exhibit to interactive art. The ending has a tiny bit of meaningful closure, but I don't think it works as a climax or reward. The whole final section is intersting, but a little obnoxious with how it indroduces difficulty.It played it a little at a time over many months and love many parts of it. It's got some of the most mind blowing and beautiful things I've ever seen in a game. It has literally made me say, ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥ I JUST GOT WITNESSED,"" several times. But its for a very niche audience of people who will have the patience for the puzzles and revelations. But it has its flaws: slow start, meandering VO, meh ending. I recommend it. If you gave up on it early I recommend you go back to it occasionally to see if it clicks. If you love classic puzzle games like Sudoku and Picross, this is once of the most insanely polished package of puzzles you'll ever see. If you hate those kinds of puzzles, stay away.Thanks Mr. Blow for pouring your life into this game! The craft and dedication shows, and there's nothing else like it.			"

												I finished The Witness over the weekend, even though I've only completed about 82% of what the game has to offer. I went into this with preconceived notions, complained a bit about its price, etc., but over time, it became a definite Game of the Year contender for me.It respects the player's intelligence and ability/willingness to figure things out without hand-holding, and it gave me a lot to think about regarding my own curiosity, biases, and existence.It's rare for something to completely surprise me, but The Witness is no ordinary game. I can't recommend this one enough. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that's as creative, surprising, and disciplined as anything I've ever played.I've been asked by some friends how it compares to something like The Talos Principle. This is a good question, and both games deal with philosophical issues, like what it means to be human and the persistence of what we leave behind. Both games are great, but overall, I liked The Witness more. While the puzzles are arguably not as spatially complex as Talos', I think the ones in The Witness are more focused. There's more story content in Talos, but a lot of The Witness' lasting appeal is in how the player digests its clues and fills in the gaps. I realized earlier this week that this game, which is pretty much built around a single game mechanic (drawing a line from one point to another), kept me completely engaged the entire time, and even as I type this, all I want to do is jump back into it.

												I highly reccomend this game so far, but it's not for everyone. This is a game about discovering how things work by paying attention to detail and forcing yourself to let go of preconceptions.Like in real life, here things don't always are as simple as they seem.If you like solving puzzles for the sake of it. This game is for you.Up to the point I am at, there's no ""story"" to the game that I know of, but the game does have a message. Which you can guess from several audio logs you can find around the island and also there's a ""hidden"" room in the island that adds to the message.There's little to no reward other than having the satisfaction of solving a problem each time you solve a puzzle. If you're the kind of person who needs a story to feel personally invested in a game, or need eye candy to keep the interest this game probably is not for you. This, I think, helps construct the message I think the game is trying to convey.			"

												This game starts off fantastically and with amazing promise. Unfortunately, it should have ended about a hundred puzzles earlier than it did. The game is at its best when it is challenging the player with new mechanics, new perspectives, and new ways of thinking. The art is beautiful and the game is a real pleasure to play early on and well into the middle. Sadly, as the game draws to a close, it runs out of good ideas and instead starts to simply torment the player with distractions, flashing lights, and motion sickness. I had to quit partway through the ending section because of nausea. If there were an option to recommend the first 90% of the game, I would. But the horrendous disappointment and pain of the ending forces me to give this one a thumbs down. Such a shame, really. The game would have been perfect if it ended sooner.			"

												Not worth the $45. I very much enjoyed the puzzles and the way you had to work to discover their mechanics, and the world is very nice to look at and and explore at first, but by the time I reached the endgame and had discovered just about all there is to be found I was left feeling dissapointed that I spent so much money on what felt like it should be a typical $15 indie title. I was shocked to hear that this game took 7 years to make, because it feels so empty outside of the puzzles.The game sells itself as hiding a deep and profound story, the hidden mystery of the island that waits to be discovered, but the truth is that there is nothing substantial behind the pretty visuals. When I first explored I was fascinated by the strange people turned statues and eager to explore what had happened to this strange island and why I was brought here. What little answers there are, that the island is just an inception-style constructed dream that you have entered for an unexplained purpose, are unsatisfying and completely disconnected from the world you explore and any clues you can find, only becoming apparent in the hidden ending.You can pick up audio logs throughout the world, but they also explain nothing. The quotes about religion, science, and discovering the truth of the world feel utterly unrelated to the actual game content, other than that you are discovering ""the truth"" about how to solve puzzles. Their only purpose as far as I can tell is to make the game seem artificially deep and profound. The secret hidden audiologs also contribute little to the absent plot, they are only scenes of the voice over people debating which quotes to put into the dream.The store page description is a complete lie. ""You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home.""Reading this after completing the game I'm shocked. Memories? Clues? Who I am and why am I here? The game does not even attempt to explore any of this.Other than the core puzzles of the game that open doors or lead you to the main ending and the challenge area, the puzzles feel compeltely pointless. There are extra puzzles off the main path that seem to do nothing when they are completed. At first I thought I was discovering some secret that required investigation, but in the end it turns out they do absolutely nothing. The environmental puzzles, an interesting surprirse when first discovered, also seem to do nothing, and don't provide any further insight into the non-existant story.If you really like puzzles and don't want anything more than that, you will probably enjoy that aspect of the game. but I would recommend waiting for a drop in price before spending so much money on this game.

												After seeing only negative reviews on the front page for this game, I felt I needed to chime in.This is a thinking man's game.  If you cannot appreciate meticulous detail, subtle hints, painstakingly hidden environmental details, or are not inclined to perfectionism, this game is not for you.  Many reviews I've read apparently have a hatred for puzzles, which is 95% of what this game is about.  If you are easily frustrated and despise the idea of learning interesting new mechanics, well, why did you think paying $40 for this game was a good idea?If you require instant gratification, this isn't the best use of your time and money.However, if you're like me, and have a deep appreciation for brain-benders and don't mind being stumped on a dozen different puzzles at once, you need to get this game.  There is a perplexing draw to the whole experience - the promise of an overarching puzzle within a puzzle within all of the other puzzles you're solving.  It's not just about navigating several hundred mazes.  It's about what you learn, what you feel, how you think, and the way you process the sights and sounds of this precisely engineered world.  There are times where you will break the fourth wall for yourself and think, ""How did they program that?"" yet remain in awe of the task you've just completed.That's really what I appreciate about this game.  I haven't felt this satisfied with a gaming experience since the original Dark Souls.  I'm reminded heavily of that game's brutal difficulty when going into it as a brand new experience.  This game draws multiple parallels despite being a wholly different genre.  In Dark Souls, after defeating a notoriously difficult boss after numerous attempts, the feeling of victory is nearly unrivaled - that is, until you play The Witness, and solve a series of puzzles over the course of an hour that leave you feeling like a genius.  It will require plenty of intuiting, and the occasional figurative slamming of your head against a wall, but nothing in this game requires brute force.  It is all learned, it all builds upon itself, and it all, majestically, simply, cohesively... works.Some of the later puzzles will really test your ability to navigate intimidating labyrinths as you plot every scrupulous step.  I was stubborn in my tackling of such puzzles, as I never wrote anything down or made diagrams until much later.  Side note, I would recommend writing things down and making some diagrams.  Maybe take a picture of your screen.  Or don't, like me!It doesn't hurt that I'm playing on a 55"" 4K TV with a 980 Ti.  The attention to detail, regardless of the painterly overtones, is not lost on me.  While plain from a distance, up close is where the magic truly shines.  The color grading and art direction going from different zones of the island are incredible, evoking a totally different feel within seconds of traversal.  Were I not to enjoy the puzzles, this game would still be a joy of a sight to behold.This game is this generation's Myst, no doubt about it.  Playing this felt like I was touring Jonathan Blow's synapses, and getting a glimpse at how beautiful the human mind can be.  Without flattering the developer too much, I think of this game as a genuine gift to gamers worldwide, and its fastidious creation over the last 7 years or so is without a doubt a labor of love.So, I have a lot of high praise for this game, but it's not quite perfect.  If I were to complain about anything, it would be the lack of exposition, and the really-quite-terrible audio logs: Strewn and hidden about the world are different tiny recorders you can activate, and each one is narrated by a person reading a quote by someone who sounds really full of themselves, and loves hearing themselves speak about things that sound smart but are in fact common knowledge.  There are quotes from religious authors, astronauts, Albert Einstein... and they're all grating, and frankly, weird.  After I time I stopped activating the logs because they were intrusive and annoying to my experience.  I actually hate this aspect of this game, but thankfully it's optional.  I didn't find my first one until about an hour or two in, so it was a cool surprise, which rapidly devolved once I realized how utterly lame they were.  I'm sure they thought this was a good idea, but in practice, I thought it was pretty awful.There hasn't been a single puzzle I haven't enjoyed solving (except for the really easy ones which are not challenging).  I don't think you can ask much more of a game that entirely revolves around such, but the developers really did go above and beyond, and made the otherwise mundane into a masterpiece.

												This is maybe the best game ever made. Its non-verbal communication of rules is perfect. Never does this game require you to guess what the designer was thinking. It always gives you the tools needed, and all the puzzles are fair. That said it is still challenging. The final challenge in particular is a brilliant test of your fluency of the rules you have learned from exploring the island. This game is long, deep, and extremely rewarding. The world is beautiful, the mechanics are fun, and the final hours of the game are astounding. It is the most flawless game I have ever played, and also the most engaging and fun. It has been a year since I played it, and now every other game I play feels amateurish. This is a true masterpiece, perhaps the pinnacle of human accomplishment in game design. I only wish I could forget it so that I could play it again without knowing its rules and secrets and then again experience the wonder and joy that no other game can match.			"

												My feelings for this game went up-and-down before settling on dissatisfaction. The gimmicks did boost my interest, but often wore out their welcome since they weren't built upon to become something greater or meaningful.The most challenging part of the panels in this game is figuring out what the rules are for the symbols & gimmicks. Once those are figured out, the puzzles themselves are often fairly easy to solve. It does have a few good moments throughout & towards the end, but restrained itself from becoming overwhelming.Overall a so-so game, offering a variety of gimmicky line puzzles that often lack in fun & challenge. There are some other things that may seem fun at first, but can become tiring.			"

												The Metroidvania of puzzle games. Rather than learn a new skill to access previously unavailable areas of the game, you acquire knowledge. That knowledge is quite literally a key to exploring the island as a door is only locked to you if your understanding of the game mechanics does not yet include the symbols on that particular door. It's an entire language to discover and that journey of discovery goes hand-in-hand with the exploration the island. At first the gameplay does appear to be nothing more than walking up to display panels and solving 2D maze-like logic puzzles and admittedly it is disappointing... at first. It's not until you really set out and explore the island that the true scope of the game begins to reveal itself. Yes, there are a lot of logic puzzles and they can be frustrating. However I've been to quite a few areas where I'm solving the puzzles within the environment itself and only using the panel to enter my answer, proving that I've solved it. The game appears to be quite the investment as I'm six hours in (as of writing)  and feel that I've only begun to unravel the mysteries of the island. There are many symbols I've encountered yet don't understand the rules behind them because I still have a lot of the island left to explore. Based on what I've seen so far, I'm really looking forward to seeing how the game continues to evolve.			"

												Very well put together puzzle game in the family of MYST.  Difficulty of puzzles ramps up well within each section, I was never either frustrated or underwhlemed.  After finishing a playthrough, I immediately started again to hunt for things I missed.Really a stellar puzzle game.			"

												The Witness is a brilliant game and a master class in level design.  It is a rare gift, a game that offers the player moment upon moment of triumphant discovery and insight, of the kind that makes you feel delighted and satisfied.On the surface, the game is about solving line-drawing puzzles on panels you find throughout a beautiful island.  By solving them, the game teaches you a language without ever uttering a word.  It's the most amazing feat of tutorialization I've ever encountered in a game.  You learn by trying, failing, and succeeding.  Unfamiliar concepts are introduced and combined, and you find yourself applying what you've already learned to approach and understand new unknowns.  It's organic and masterful.But that's just the surface, that's not the real game.  At some point-- and it's different for each player-- you'll discover something.  I won't spoil that moment for you.  But when it happens, your mind expands.  And the island-- which is rather small-- suddenly seems much, much bigger than you thought.  That's when the genius of the game truly reveals itself, and you realize just how meticulously the island has been crafted.  Virtually everything has a purpose.  If there's a promontory you can climb or a spit you can walk out on, chances are good there's a reason.I also found the game to be visually stunning.  Its vibrant palette, carefully-designed architecture, and soothing aural landscape made it a pleasure to wander and explore.I cannot recommend this game highly enough.  However, there are some things you should know.1. There are puzzles that you probably cannot solve if you're color blind.2. There are puzzles that you cannot solve if you're deaf, or playing without sound.3. The game doesn't give you a score or other external carrot to encourage you to continue playing and solve things.  It does have some tracking mechanisms in-game, and one of them cannot be completed without finishing The Challenge.  You won't encounter The Challenge until very late in your game experience.  The Challenge is highly controversial because it is timed, where almost nothing else in the game requires speed.  This upsets some people.4. There is no story.  There are provocative aspects of the island that hint at a story-- statues, recordings, and videos-- but the game never really delivers one.  This upsets some people. None of these things should stop you from playing this singular, astounding game.  My greatest regret about The Witness is that I have already made all its discoveries.  I envy you, for whom that magnificent experience is still to come.			"

												Here's a quick summary: If you're feeling puzzled by a puzzle game, they're doing something right.On the surface, Witness is your standard puzzle game. The very first puzzles are neither hidden nor complicated. Big yellow squares with a very simple maze. But as you play through the starting level, you are confronted with a sharp difficulty rise.Then you get out of the first zone and you find whole new mechanics. Suns, tetriminos, colors, sounds, logic. Suddenly, a simple 4x4 grid never looked so full of possibility and potential puzzles.And then, you'll be walking through the beautifully animated island and you'll see something that looks... odd. And when you realize what you've been walking past, and unlock the mystery of the black pillars that dot the island, the whole world changes. You'll be looking at it all with whole new eyes. Not just the island, but your home, your kitchen, your garden, you'll see circles and lines and puzzles in every room of your home. And that's when this game goes from a good puzzle game to quite possible the best puzzle game experience in history.The Witness knows what to focus on, and what not to focus on; what to give you, and what you have to figure out for yourself. If you find yourself frustrated or confused, it won't give you a hint. Instead, it encourages you to try a different zone and, chances are, you'll be hit with inspiration.The Witness is hopefully the flagship of a new wave of puzzle games that don't hold your hand and tell you that you're smart, but instead lets you flex your brain and get inspired in order to prove your smarts.If there's one complaint, it's a good one to have: WE WANT MORE. When the ending arrives, it feels confusing, like there's a second level that we skipped. Everyone here agrees, we'd play another three islands if they were available. We hope that Joe Blow and Thekla Inc release DLC or a sequel, because we are definitely hungry for more.			"

												As you explore this game, you gradually come to realise that every single pixel you see has been placed with utmost care and precision. No wonder this came took so long to make.This is a game about understanding puzzles, not just solving them. It’s also got some very nicely voice-acted quotations about philosophy, spirituality and science.I can tell there’s something very special here, even at a stage where it feels like I’ve barely, BARELY scratched the surface.

												So let me start off by saying that until I recieved this game from someone as an early xmas present, i had never heard of it. I was told not to look it up and to just start playing, so I did, I now feel like I'm the perfect kinda person to play. Someone that knows nothing of what to expect, being thrown into something so perfect. I love puzzle games no matter the kind and I'm not sure there is or ever will be one as good as this. I have been told theres over 600 puzzles, so even though I've reached Endgame I'm only about halfway done and I fully intend to play this game until theres nothing left. Then maybe start over, yknow? Cuz why not. I experience a little lag in some visually heavy areas but my PC is also kinda meh, kinda full. I realised when I finished the game that there were whole areas and buildings I never even saw and maybe i took a few too many boat rides instead of walking around. All in all, I've recommended this game to quite a few people already and I'll def be spreading the word more. Blow's done it again, a beautiful, timeless work of art.			"

												The Witness is a beutiful looking game with a unique mechanic that teaches you as you go along, but without using words at all.  It's like a cross between Harpo Marx and a cryptic crossword, but with shapes and colours instead of letters!It seems, initially, like a small island, but there are many, many more layers than are first apparent.  It's a pretty big game and will take dozens of hours (at least) to get the full experience.The puzzels have been very cleavery designed and (eventually) seem to keep you right at the limit of your intellect.  Depending on how your brain is wired, you might sail through some things than others find difficult and get stuck for a while on things that other people find easy.  Chances are though that you will, usually, find the last few puzzles of each section a head-scratcher, at least for a while.Personally, I find the spatial (pattern, colour, position) challenges easy, but the logical (chess-type) ones more difficult.  The unlocks in the Ewok-style section were a particular nightmare for me and I confess I cheated a couple of times by looking up solutions on-line when it all became too much.  For some of the others, I persevered but only got the solution by sheer fluke!  That may sound as though it's a frustrating and unrewarding game, but that's not so.  Sometimes those ""WTF, how did that work"" solutins are a major revelation and you suddenly see how to move on to a new large section of the game.  When those great ""Ah-ha!"" moments come though, it's really satisfying and you feel wonderful.Overall, a firm recommendation from me.  Stick with it, even through the tough times, or just wander away to another part of the island and try something different and new: or you may find that what you just learned will help you unlock another puzzle that seemed impossibe before.8/10 for me.  Would have been highter, but the game sometimes made me feel so cross and stupid that I switched the PC off!  Get it though, especially if on sale.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. I want to. I really wanted to like it overall.But no.Nothing happens. There is no reward but puzzles; and when the puzzles are over there is nothing.The world is amazingly detailed, it's perfected, it's layout is fantastic. The puzzles are good for the most part. But they lack grounding, their context is flimsy and unsatisfactory. There is no plot. Scattered disappointing meaning in vague texts (audio and visual.)I can scarcely believe myself that nothing happens. But it's true. You beat the game, barely anything happens. You beat the hidden challenge, absolutely nothing happens. You beat the entire game and collect everything and nothing happens. If the is the message I don't want to be a part of it, but if you find a game where nothing happens and where the narrative point might be just that... then this is the game for you!			"

												This game is utterly beautiful. It's simplicity and freedom are what hooked me immediately and the constant hints at some big reveal at the end are what kept me playing. The island is riddled with statues, recordings, and items left behind like something happened here and you want to find out what.While some of the puzzles can be irritating, for the most part they are incredibly well designed. There were puzzles used in this game like I've never seen before. It constantly blew my mind... until the end. This game has, hands down, the most dissapointing ending I have ever experienced. I'd love to spoil the end just to keep you from playing, but I won't just in case you want to simply experience the expertly designed puzzles in this game, but don't expect anything more from it. However if you're looking for an interesting story from this thing, you're going to be dissapointed, dearly. All there is for you here is a bunch of existential crap mostly from late 20th century philosphers (at least that's what it seemed like to me). Thekla built a beatiful, geniusly designed game here, but they failed to back it up with any ounce of story especially when it leads you to believe there will be something for you at the end when there truly is nothing. I do not recommend this game.			"

												I truly enjoyed playing The Witness.  There were a number of puzzles that made me laugh at myself for not seeing the forest for the trees or vice versa.  There were also hard won victories over puzzles that seemed impossible at first, but just took a better understanding of the rules.  I also quite enjoyed several accidental discoveries of easter eggs or of different types of puzzles on the island.  One's perspective became so very important.  It was a wonder to see how many types of puzzles could be constucted from a simple grid and how the types could be combined.  And all this without a manual.  I must admit I had to brute-force my way through some puzzles and relearn what it means to be patient.I had been anticipating the release of this game for some time, but understand how complex it must have been to get the puzzles just right and provide enough clues for players to figure things out on their own.

												The Witness is a masterpiece, but this fact is not apparent when you first begin to play the game. It takes time (and a certain conceptual leap) to realize the true depth of the game. You can't see this in the screen shots or the trailer. The negative reviews for this game are rife with users who posted their review within a short time of beginning the game and have not ""gotten there"" yet.. many likely quit before they ever did.The game also has a couple of ""image problems"" that prevent would be players from appreciating it's potential.  It's most clearly visible play element is a series of line based puzzles that look like complicated versions of an average maze game. These puzzles are not the whole game. In fact, I would go so far as to say they are more of a form of misdirection to prevent you from realizing what is really going on in the game for a time while eventually steering you toward the first realization. Don't judge the game only by these puzzles, really.  The game is very spoiler sensitive, so you get lots of vague reviews like mine that tell you it's amazing but don't tell you exactly why because that would ruin it for you. This is also why the screenshot and trailer don't better show the depth of the game as it would spoil things. On that note, I strongly suggest you not look at any guides or online discussion of this game before or while playing it.I expect this game would have been far more popular if it didn't have these the aforementioned image problems.. but they are issues inherent in the design and not something they could have fixed. The game is all about conceptual leaps. To solve the line puzzles you need discover the rules based on previous puzzles and experimentation. To find everything you must look closely and notice similarities and details. This applies to more than just the one ""certain conceptual leap"" I mentioned earlier. There's more than just that. The game is just a series of surprising realizations.And that ends another vague review. Note, if you can 100% the game (Your save game will read ""523, +135, +6"") with no online help you should be thoroughly impressed with yourself. If you still have a negative opinion of this game at that point, you may have some psychological defect that requires medication and should seek help.P.S. My play time is short because I played the game off-steam but purchased it a moment ago, mostly to post this review.			"

												The Witness is a puzzle adventure game set in an open-world and built around solving grid-based puzzles that are spread around the landscape. The puzzles require you to draw a line from a starting point to an end point. As you explore the island you will be introduced to new symbols that place requirements on how the line must be drawn. You will need to explore the island to find areas that ease you in to the new mechanics and symbols. There is no item collection or inventory, so progress is gated only by your knowledge of these mechanics.Paying close attention to details in the environment is critical to progressing through the game. Most of the game is hidden in plain sight and you just need to look at things from another point of view. Highlights vs shadow, positive space vs negative space, foreground vs background, color, reflection, even sound, you will eventually change the way you look at each scene because the game makes use of it all. There are over a hundred puzzles that are hidden in the world that you will walk past dozens of times before you look at them in the right frame of mind. The observation-based puzzles are absolutely masterful and by far the best part of the game.Another chunk of the puzzles are purely based on learning the logic of the different board symbols and mastering them. This was the part of the game that I disliked the most. I found a few of the mechanics very frustrating to work with which made progress through certain areas slow. What made things worse in comparison was that many of these sections were there only for the puzzle boards and they lacked the same relationship with the environment that most of the other puzzles had. The environment didn't play into the puzzle board, and the puzzles didn't change the environment short of enabling the next puzzle.Thankfully when all was said and done the excellent observation-based puzzles far outweighed the puzzles that I hated. After spending hours scouring The Witness for the last of the puzzles, I've found myself doing double-takes at familiar shapes both in other games and in reality. It was worth it.			"

												Pros :+Great unique artstyle that is easy to look at and enjoyable+Something to do everywhere you go (no downtime between puzzles)+Simple mechanics+Unique concept of Environmental Puzzles+A great amount of contents to explore+Easy to lose yourself in the realxing mysterious environment of the game+Rich story (that you should discover and tell for yourself)Cons:-Lack of a good theme music at some points-If it's not for you, it's not for youFinal Verdict 9/10The Witness is a great game realy great game, I will not go into detail of how the puzzles work or are and leave the discovery to you, but if you like to find puzzles, learn them, solve them and then find more with different variation of the same simple mechanics while wondering around enjoying the beautiful eay-catching scenery. Don't hesitate, this game is for you.The game doesn't force itself on you you can rush and finish it in about 3 hours but don't get fooled, every step you take, every location you can go has a mystery and/or puzzle within. I'm 30 hours into the game and I still find things within this game that blows my mind (and they are not neccessirily puzzles sometimes just a scene) and make me just stare at them for couple of min.Full Price was a bit high for me, I got it 50% off and I'm happy with my desicion. It's worth for what I paid.A unique must have game.			"

												Don't let this positive review confuse you: this game might not be for you. This game is brilliant, but to some might appear too ""artsy fartsy"" and pretentious. Yes, this game is 20+ hours of line puzzles, but this base mechanic is so well thought out I personally never got tired of it.What makes Jonathan Blow's sophomore attempt so great is the genius design of the world. I won't spoil one key mechanic, but when the player discovers it, they'll think: ""How did I miss it?"". The island's design also promotes walking away from a puzzle when confused- which will happen a lot. If this sounds tedious to you, you might not enjoy playing this game.My only real complaint with this game is the playtime. Johnathan Blow and reviewers claimed ""80-100+ hours"". But for me it only took 25 hours to fully explore the island, including beating the challenge all without any guides.			"

												I appreciate The Witness for its great style and elegant design, but cannot recommend it as a whole.The puzzle aspect is well-designed, but not really clever. It simply doesn't bend the mind and bring the same levels of satisfaction like truly great puzzle games do, such as Blow's earlier Braid. There isn't enough substance behind the mechanics to keep things interesting. Latter half feels more tedious than anything, endgame puzzles introducing artificial difficulty with flashing or moving images are straight-up annoying and insulting, and the atmosphere of the island is as cryptic as it is pretentious - I say atmosphere, because there isn't much of a real story.Definitely not a complete faliure, I don't regret experiencing it, but ultimately it's pretty underwhelming.

OverviewThe Witness is an interesting game. I never played Braid, nor do I know much about it, so I came to this without zero knowledge of Jonathan Blow’s previous work. Whether that works for or against someone, I don’t know, but what I’ll say is The Witness is definitely an adventure.To start, I suck at puzzles. I played Sigils of Elohim, had my fiancé help with me most of them. My brain just doesn’t work like that. But from reading all the info on The Witness, I had to try it, so I bought it at launch. My first thought was, this is an indie game? At $43.99 (CAD), it’s definitely not priced like an indie game. I was a little hesitant, but my willpower lost and I bought it, and it has not been a bad purchase in the least.In the roughly five hours I’ve played, I’ve gone through several areas; symmetry island, orange forest, the hedge mazes, tree monastery, marsh, desert, quarry, and I’m now heading off to whatever location is next. I’m enjoying what very little information is given in the audio logs you find, but I’ve only found three so far, so there’s definitely a lot more to go. I’m refusing to use a guide and so far have been able to get by without.ProsPuzzles all follow the same basic idea (line puzzles), but the variety is excellent and the sheer amount of them will keep you playingFiguring out how puzzles work (using light that casts a shade on the correct path, or aligning your view to a distant object) is the best part, in my opinionBits of story you get from the various audio tapes is interestingThe world is beautiful in its simplicity, and is a joy to exploreSound effects do a great job of immersing you, even ones that aren’t part of the puzzlesThe lack of music works quite well in the game’s favorConsI’d have liked at least a little bit of info or backstory on why we are here and what we’re doingYou can’t jump, not even slightly, and there are invisible barriers everywhere, meaning you have to walk along the path, and if you need to go down or up, you need to keep going instead of slightly adjusting your locationI’ve yet to get to the end, but with two achievements and being single player, it doesn’t seem like there’s a lot of replayability once everything is solvedSummaryThe Witness is an excellent game. It’s an excellent experiment, as well. The puzzles are one part of the game, and in order to solve them, you need to figure out how they work, and that’s the real fun. Does this particular tree with its leaning branch indicate a path I should take? Or is this particular tree a red herring, designed to screw with me and further complicate the puzzle?Jonathan Blow has crafted an excellent world, one I can’t wait to finish exploring. If you’re a fan of puzzles, you’ll enjoy it too. Try not to use a guide unless absolutely necessary, as that will detract from the very point of the game.			"

Posted: February 7, 2016
												Overall, I enjoyed The Witness; though many people have complained about the puzzles for various reasons, I think they are all brilliantly designed. The most impressive thing about the game to me is how well the game is able to stick to its core mechanic; the game never lets you, say, go back over an existing line you've drawn. The Witness has one base mechanic, and commits to it, and still manages to make deep and complex puzzles out of it, and that will not cease to impress me.The problem with The Witness isn't its puzzles, but the game that contextualizes them. The issue is as follows: Almost all of the puzzles in the game effectively have one solution. Maybe you can have a line in a slightly different place, if it's a symmetric board you can obviously mirror your solution, but in a practical sense, there is only one way to solve most of the boards in the game. Yet, to complete the game, you have to complete sequences of these puzzles, one after another; you cannot skip any, nor can you complete them out of order, and often, failing a puzzle will force you to re-solve the last one.In a game like Portal, you have to complete every puzzle, but each puzzle has multiple solutions: it's much fairer to require the player to solve each puzzle if it's more likely that they'll find a way to get through it, even if it's sub-optimal. In a game like TIS-100 (I'll try to think of a better example I promise), each puzzle is incredibly difficult, but you can skip a few here and there: the game acknowledges that there might be a puzzle you get stuck on for no good reason, and allows you to try your hand at a different puzzle instead. The Witness is the worst of both worlds: the puzzles that will confuse you, with the frustration of being stuck on it so having to stare at it for way too long. Note: You *can* leave and go to puzzles in a different area, the main issue is that getting around the island takes way too long; the game has a fast travel system that's slower than just running everywhere. Even if you do leave, you'll still need to solve the puzzle that stumped you eventually.It took me a little over 10 hours to ""finish"" the game (the rest of my playtime is on a challenge area; more on that below), and I consider myself to be pretty good at puzzle games. I said I enjoyed my time with The Witness, but I'm someone who is desperate for puzzle games that present me with an actual challenge, and The Witness sated that desire. If you share that sentiment, you probably already own the game, or know that you want to; for everyone else, I would certainly recommend many other puzzle games before this one.I said I would discuss the challenge area, but I lied; I really want to tell you about the ending. Not spoiling it, but I will tell you that completing the game resets everything. It's like starting all over again; the game even goes as far as to reset your settings to the default. For a game with a huge amount of hidden secrets and puzzles to explore, this seems absolutely insane; I had left a dozen or so things half-finished when I went to the end, assuming I could just return to them later, and then I was plopped back at the beginning. Not only did this completely kill my interest in exploring the mysteries of The Witness, it solidified my view of The Witness being nothing more than good puzzles in a bad puzzle game. The only reason I played more was to solve the challenge area, which is probably my favorite part of the game; a series of randomly-generated puzzles you solve in a time limit. It's right before the end of the game, so I needed to replay several hours of content to get back there.			"

												Huge fan of Braid and been following this game for a long time. Can't recommend:-Draw a line through your numpad (start at bottom left of one and end at top right of 9) where multiples of 4 are grouped together, 2 multiples of 2 are grouped, the number of turns you make must equal at least two other numbers in a section added together, and all the numbers in a particular section must be a prime number when added up. Sound fun? Not for me, and that's what some of the puzzles in The Witness are like. To be fair, some puzzles are really interesting and utilize the environment in cool ways. No problem with these. Others are like that example, just too logical for my tastes. I found myself knowing what the rules to a particular puzzle was, but having trouble figuring out the exact pattern it wants me to have. It's a bunch of trial and error until you get a line that works with the conditions you already know about. Like an overly complicated Sudoku. It might be hard and challenging, but not interesting to me at all.-The design goal was to capture the ""ah ha!"" moment, but the annoying part is that it forces you to have these. Meaning, there's no grey area. You either know it or you don't. In a game like Portal, you can clearly see if your idea will work or not, just by looking at it. You can get halfway through an idea, see it wont work, and go from there. There's a system in place that you slowly begin to understand. In The Witness, there is no system in place, you will either know exactly what to do or are completely lost.-Returning to the game (or a puzzle) later will completely suck because you'll forget the specific rules to certain puzzles. Later puzzles require you to know the rules to previous puzzles, so your only option (if you happen to forget) would be to resolve the earlier puzzles. I'm not interested in backtracking through puzzle ideas.-There's no way to tell if you don't know what to do. You might just not have all the info you need. There might be a puzzle on the ohter side of the map that tells you how to solve this one. There might not. No way to differentiate the two.-Traversing the overworld is a pain. There's no reason to have a run button, why not just always be running? You can't fall off of heights and everything is on predetermined pathways. Meaning you have to zigzag through a pattern of rocks on a hill instead of simply going up/down hill. There's no accessible minimap, so if you want to go back to a puzzle, you need to remember where it was or just run around until you find it. -You pretty need a pen/paper or some type of image program. There are puzzles that require you to flip images, rotate them, and so on, which can get kind of tedious (but is sometimes a little cool).-There is a ton of puzzle saturation. A lot of the ideas repeat themselves with minor variation, and in a game like this, it's more interesting to know what else is out there, not what's already been done.			"

												(When/If this issue is resolved, I will consider changing this review. Thank you. Being TOLD when I can or cannot play a $40 game is a dealbreaker.)I wish I was playing “The Witness” at this moment. Very much. But I’m not, because I’m currently offline, and it won’t run. Just as reported previously. And the error message again reads, “no internet connection”.WARNING to anyone considering purchase. It may load offline. It may not. Most likely it will do some of each, as BOTH copies I purchased have done (or not done) to varying dergee when I attempted offline play.Because of my considerable interest in this game I succumbed to misinformation from DEVs and childish insults from the community to try it again after obtaining a refund on my original purchase; that it was guaranteed to run offline at the time of my second purchase (and if fact, as was my first copy. Clearly!) Little doubt that if I had little enough self-respect to follow this discussion after this post, I would be told, as I was told then, that I am wrong, and my claims make no sense, and even that I'm stupid. Even though I type this sentence while LOOKING at the “no internet connection” message on my other half of my screen, produced after clicking on the PLAY button for “The Witness.” Over and over and over, as also noted in my previous report. It may well be true that “The Witness” does not test for internet access. But it DOES test for Steam, and STEAM apparently sometimes tests for internet access. (Gee!) And if that check is performed, “The Witness” WILL NOT load. Of 800 games I own on Steam, no other offline-playable game has acted in this manner. How is that NOT the cause of the game, and thus the responsibility of the DEVs? (But there aren’t many of us left playing offline, so it’s really no big deal.)So next time one of you “braniacs” in the Steam community (including the DEV who offered zero support or consideration, and asked no questions) wants to tell someone how much you know…..…please remember, you don’t. Prove it instead by asking the right questions, rather than making assumptions based on ego. OK? Everyone will benefit in some way.(I just want anyone following after me to not be deceived or manipulated as I was. Buy if you wish, play if and when you can (as, at best, I may continue to do.) I made a mistake of misplaced trust, and I’m prepared to live with it. You others should at least have more information than I did, if not more choice. And please, always trust the evidence of your own eyes and experience.)You have my $40 and whatever bizarre personal satisfaction some of you may have derived from my gullibility. I consider this a permanent parting of the ways. Had I been treated more courteously or professionally by any party involved, this posting might very different. As well as any possible interest in any future projects.At least endeavor to learn something from this regrettable and avoidable experience.			"

												The games that really changed my life as a gamer can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and The Witness is one of them.It is crazily hard to explain what's so extraordinarily ingenious about The Witness without revealing the core mechanics that you absolutely have to discover by yourself.I'll mention what many others have already said before : The Witness isn't just an open world with puzzle screens on it. It's much more than that. Without revealing anything, the whole island itself was designed in a very special way, and the more you progress, the more you realise that the puzzle screens are just a mere appetiser before the main course...Graphically, I have nothing to add. If you watch the trailer, you'll understand what I'm talking about! In The Witness, you can stop wherever you want and face any direction, and you have the viewpoint of your life. Vibrant colours and natural environments are mixed with a true mastery of art direction, and I found myself just looking around and saying out loud ""This is beautiful"" at least a hundred times.And for those who would still doubt it, the game is totally worth its full price ! It will give you so much more than you would expect. Well, this review is very short, because I believe a good review for this game has to be vague enough to intrigue. Special thanks to Jonathan Blow and his team for making this piece of art! It really holds a special place in my heart. Whenever he decides to develop another game, I'll buy it eyes closed no matter the price. I would give anything to re-experience The Witness and be surprised again like the first time I played it.

												A game that needs a ""Neutral"" or ""Mixed"" rating, between ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"". I'm voting ""Not Recommended"" purely because this game already has overwhelmingly positive reviews, merely as a counterbalance.The Good:- Remember the first time you played Portal? Remember that brain-opening moment when the concept of a ""portal"" finally clicked, and changed from an unfamiliar and abstract concept to a tool as natural as WASD? ""The Witness"" has that moment, over and over and over again. To put it another way, this is an adventure game where you collect keys and combine inventory items to open locks - except the ""keys"" are abstract concepts expressed in symbolic language, the ""locks"" are puzzles (with varying degrees of literalness), and your ""inventory"" is your brain. Puzzles that look incomprehensible at first will become merely baffling and tricky a few minutes later, and then suddenly near-trivial with a bit more experience.- Adequately describing how pretty this game is would trigger Steam's profanity filter. It's one thing to look at screenshots and video footage of the game, and another to freely walk around inside an impressionist painting made three-dimensional.The Bad:- If you've played Braid, you may remember a ""puzzle"" involving waiting for two hours - real-time, not game-time - for a cloud to move across the screen, to collect one of the stars needed to reach the game's ""true"" ending. Well, that style of ""challenging puzzle"" is back, and in greater numbers. Many of them are ""optional"", but there are still times where you'll need to backtrack and circle around a very long way to get over a very short distance, or repeatedly cross a mechanical bridge that takes almost a full minute to pass over a mere six-foot gap - unless you're on the wrong side, in which case, get ready for some cardio. I have a callus on my pinky now from running everywhere - in retrospect, I should have just wedged the ""Shift"" key down with a toothpick. In this game's description, the phrase ""This game...treats your time as precious"" is used, and it's a straight-up lie.- Without referring to guides, there's a very good chance that you'll reach the ""boring ending"", and entirely miss out on about a third of the full game, which contains actual clues as to what's going on as well as giving you the key to the ""true ending"". However, because the gameplay is so concept-based, reading those guides runs the risk of spoiling chunks of the game , depending on where you happen to glance on the page. Also, the ""boring ending"" gives the impression of wiping your progress and starting over, which might be rage-inducing until you discover that you can still reload earlier quicksaves (which you may never have interacted with up until that point).The Meh:- The game seems to want to either communicate or trigger some deep insights into consciousness, spirituality, the process of science, escapism, and the relation between gamers and gaming as a medium. At times, this gradual unfolding of deeper mysteries turns into a tedious slog to get to the next good bit, which may or may not be all that good. However, the ""good bits"" do exist. Eventually. Your Mileage May Vary.The TL;DR:- This game is a Spam sandwich, made with the finest fresh-baked artisanal bread, fragrant and toothsome, garnished with a tomato rose so intricately carved that it's practically non-Euclidean. And a big ol' slimy hunk of Spam.(buy it on sale)/10			"

												I don't normally review games, but I felt I should for this one. First of all, if you are expecting a game like Myst, reconsider buying this. Here's why:This game has a simple story to it and what seems like many questions will go unanswered. The questions you do get answers to will not be as extravagant as you'd hoped.There really isn't a storyline to this game. It is more about experience. This is crucial to keep in mind. I went into this game hoping for something with a deep storyline and was quite disappointed.That being said, In my opinion, this is a very well-put together game. I love the art style and I love the rule discovery aspect behind the game. It held my interest. I did enjoy playing the game, but was not to happy when it ended. I can't recommend this game to anyone simply because I feel it suggests the possibility of something, and then reveals it is not.			"

												A somewhat Myst-like experience in a zen-like environment.Pros:* immersive graphics - calming, well designed island* sound - plays a very important role in the game* use of environment as part of the ""solving of puzzles""* challenging - but not too serial. you can move to other puzzles if you are stuck on one.Cons:* puzzles are not varied like Myst. They are all about a grid and different rules to win.* audio recorders - you will find them in the game. They seem pretty high brow and don't help the theme.* I think the storyline (and unravelling it as you solve puzzles) could be much much better. * price - its not way over priced but its pretty pricey. I would think a $29 price (CDN) would be more fitting to the game.Overall a great game for someone who is all about puzzles at your own pace that has an immersive environment and is rather challenging.

												The Witness' game design alone is already unbelievable.Not a single word, spoken nor written is used to convey neither the base nor any of the advanced mechanics.And yet everything is easy to understand and learn.The Witness is a puzzle game that not only has tons of ""Aha!"" moments, but also a lot of moments that just completely surprise you and blow your mind .It cannot be understated just how creative Jonathan Blow gets with this base concept of maze puzzles.From   the enviroment blocking your ""pointer"" to  your maze puzzle being what creates a walkway, so that you have to solve it in a specfic way to proceed  or  your puzzle being a tile of a larger puzzle, that affects what the conditions for said larger puzzle are , this game simply never stops surprising and amazing.

												Over 500 puzzles? More like one puzzle five hundred times. By the way is it possible to just tell a story? Can anyone do that anymore? Does every first person adventure game have to have an incredibly vague, introspective narative? Also the game doesn't like some graphics cards which causes the frame rate to drop to single digits when walking through certain sections of the island. I don't fault anyone for enjoying this, but I certainly didn't.			"

												Right from the start, it's clear how much time and effort the developers spent trying to make their seemingly limitless supply of maze puzzles feel fresh and exciting with each new iteration. It's clear how much time was spent trying to create a gradual ramp up towards the elusive ""eureka moment"". That moment when you've been struggling with a puzzle for 10, 15, or 30 minutes, and all of the sudden you say ""OHHHHH!"" and you solve it in 3 seconds. I imagine that if the developers of The Witness ever watched me play this game, they'd be incredibly disappointed.My problem with this game isn't that I never got the eureka moment. It's that every time I got it, my ""Ohhhhh..."" was quickly followed by ""that's stupid"" or ""so what?"" This game is plagued by a constant feeling of ""so what?""-ness. The Witness has no plot. The Witness has no characters. The Witness has nothing to discover that doesn't already exist in your own imagination. You'll wander from puzzle to puzzle, erroniously believing that the next puzzle will reward you with some new revelation, or at least a general feeling of ""Oh, wow!"" But the harsh truth of The Witness is that the ""eureka moment"" is the games only reward. The only reward it has to offer is that you did it. You solved a puzzle. And no one had to hold your hand to do it. You did it all on your own. Gold star.For some people, this will be enough. But for me it certainly wasn't. I was constantly looking for something to sink my teeth into; A story that I could pick up the threads of, even if it was only a hint. I desperately needed a reward beyond my own sense of satisfaction. But sadly all I found was a tape recording with a quote from Albert Einstein. And after several hours of guiding lines from point A to point B, I was quite over this game. To be honest, it really is quite a shame, as the puzzles are occasionally fiendishly clever. But they simply aren't strong enough to carry this game on their own merits. The game just lacks real substance. And for all its avant-garde pretension, it ends up feeling incredibly hollow.			"

												While starting generally strong the puzzles quickly cease to give you anything particularly interesting to challenge you on an understanding front, a number of the areas are also just plain boring types of puzzle.The game's primary hidden objective is also increadibly dull and uninteresting.It has some cool mystery and hidden things but the generally dull feel of the puzzles leads me to regret having paid anything close to the release price.

												A game that looks pretty but is paced with some of the most counter productive puzzles I have ever 'witnessed'. This game will have you wandering then wondering some more as you are met with puzzles you thought you knew how to do but then are told otherwise as you hit dead end after dead end.It feels as if the designer is trying to beat the player, rather than give us a fun and challenging experiance and most fustratinly the puzzles are not fun nor are they statisfying to complete. The game tries to come across as organic so that you can learn the controls fluidily but instead its a mess leaving me confused to why i got a puzzle wrong and somtimes even worse I am confused of how I got a puzzle right. The pacing is no existant and the goal of the game is no where to be seen which sadly to me makes the game come across as pretentious due to my inferior mind not being able to understand the experiance I am suppose to be going through.The game aslo has the habit of badly paced puzzles aswell, by having the first easy (so you understand the mechanics) then the next will add in elements that your simply not prepared for. Who knows my IQ could simply be too low for this game or maybe my expectations were to high but overall I was very disappointed.			"

												This game is totally pointless, literally.  As others have stated, this game has no narrative.  Most of the puzzles are fun and interesting, but some rely on extremely obtuse and obscure clues.  Unless you are willing to spend a day or more on a single puzzle, a walkthrough guide is essential.  But worst of all (SPOILERS beyond this point) the game ends with no resolution or context.  The puzzles do not fit into any sort of plot or setting or reason.  After solving the final one the game literally erases all your progress and just closes itself.As someone who was attracted to puzzle games (and computer games in general) by Myst and Riven, I cannot support or recommend a pointless time-waster like The Witness.

												This game is absolutely far too shallow for it's asking price. There is a beautiful environment but no direction in it. The puzzles seem clever at first, but quickly they even devolve to simply throwing frustration at you (extremely slow moving water in puzzles where you need to adjust it to see reflections, white noise on puzzles that depend on audio cues, etc.).The environments look beautiful, but there is almost nothing to them. The world is there, but there is no reason to discover anything in it. The puzzles are there, but they just get more and more frustrating with less and less of a feeling of accomplishment for completing them.The puzzles are little more complex than what you could expect to find in a free game anywhere on the internet. Some cleverly use the environment, but those seem few and far between. Several more (especially the light puzzles) generally use the environment to a much more frustrating than entertaining degree.The game is not rewarding at all. There is nothing to gain from exploring. There is no goal you are working towards. Even the puzzles themselves give no satisfaction. This whole game comes across as a scam. I'd say it's hardly worth any money at all, let alone the absurd $40 price tag for such a shallow game.			"

												A series of boring 2D puzzels with little to no rewards for solving them. The overworld was pretty to look at, but with no way of interacting with the environment it just came across as superficial. I could have gotten the same expirience by buying a book of mazes. However one of the worst aspects of this game is that it constantly throws pseudo-intellectual quotes about the nature of God and science at you, as if random, out of context Einstein quotes will somehow make it seem smarter than it really is.

												The Witness is phenomenal! It is probably the best puzzle game ever made - easily better than Portal and the likes! It also is wonderful for playing with a group of friends, your kids, your partner, whoever.You walk freely around an island and solve puzzles. The game is open world, so you can never be stuck - if you have a problem somewhere, just continue somewhere else. The island is probably the most precisely and skillfully crafted level in the history of video games - 8 years of development time and it shows. The puzzles and their places on the island are simply amazing. Whenever you start thinking you've got the hang of how things are working, the game will blow you away with a totally new and unexpected (and plain beautyful) insight. These moments of epiphany will leave you stunned, grinning and repeatedly saying ""Mr. Blow, you magnificent bast*rd!"" (he's the head game developer).*** DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND NEVER, EVER LOOK AT ANYTHING THAT COULD REMOTELY BE SPOILERS FOR THE WITNESS!NO FORUM THREADS, NO YOUTUBE VIDEOS, NOTHING, NOT A SINGLE SECOND; TOTAL RADIO SILENCE. THIS GAME CAN BE SPOILED INCREDIBLY EASILY WITH ONLY A FEW WORDS OR A SINGLE PICTURE. IF YOU GET STUCK SOMEWHERE, NEVER LOOK UP THE SOLUTION, JUST GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND YOU WILL BE SURPRISED HOW A FRESH LOOK CHANGES THINGS AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID NOT ""CHEAT"".IT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT (BOTH THE GAME AND NEVER LOOKING UP SOLUTIONS)! ***			"

												This game is a perfect example on why a simple ""Yes/No"" system is a little too barebones for this kind of video game. I would recommend this game to certain people, but only a select few that I seem to not be part of. The puzzles included in The Witness are interesting and creative, but they are the same general concept of a maze with different gimmicks and ways to come to a solution that require some out of the box thinking. Only an hour in and I found a house where the layout was the solution to the puzzle on the back door. And a lot of times, the puzzles build on the ideas of the previous idea and lead to a series of puzzles with increasing difficulty so you can, as Jonathon Blo put it, understand what the puzzle is saying. There is also a lot of free form design choices that allow you to go where ever and attempt puzzles in many areas on the island at any time, but I have some gripes about that (along with many other parts of the game). Exploring is pretty fun portion of the game, however, as the world seems ""frozen""  with many neat and interesting set pieces to examine and how those scenes end up leading to a puzzle with a new idea behind the solution.However, for all the good in the game, it comes with aspects that rubbed me the wrong way. The most minor of gripes I have is the walking speed is pretty slow and the sprint is an alright speed. By itself, the speed isn't bad, but the openness of the game means you'll be in for a great amount of wandering and backtracking, and that means time spent walking from A to B where you've already been. And wandering is a big part of the game since there is no story nor direction, at all; or at least within the first hour of the game. This means the big hook for the game is the puzzles for you to solve, the mazes. There are audio logs, but they seem pretty small and kinda hard to find. I really feel like the setting has promise and there was something interesting that transpired, but it requires a large drive to find anything about it. The puzzles themselves seem creative, but the issue have with them is the series of puzzles that are presented. Some of the puzzles in a sequence will turn off if you don't get them right, but can be reactivated by redoing the last puzzle in the series. This means you have to think about the puzzle and prevent brute force attempts, but get it wrong or test an idea and you'll be walking back to that last puzzle. And with the walking speed, it adds up how annoying it is that I am being punished for trying something in a puzzle game. For me, this killed my interest as I was constantly running back to the same puzzles, speeding through the solution, going back to the new puzzle, and repeating if I get it wrong. And the fact that the core aspect of the puzzles never change, it can get a little daunting as you go from maze to maze with no explict story given, or frustrating if you get stuck at a puzzle and have to go find another to do. And even with the very open areas, sometimes you'll come across puzzles that haven't been activated, so that means finding one that is turned on. It can be a little tiresome if you follow a line of puzzles to one end, only to realize that it's the wrong end. Also, J.B. included something that becomes impossible later. And that really rubs me the wrong way.So, The Witness. Should you get it? Maybe, depends on if you like iterations and new ideas blended into the same core puzzle gameplay and if you don't care about hand-holding whatsoever. Like with the way Braid was a platformer, this is a exploration game with mazes. It is difficult to say yes or no for such a niche game such as this. That being said, the big thing is, Braid was $15 and this is $40. So, the question is, is it worth the $40? I say no to that price: the puzzles are interesting but don't offer enough variety to make up for the lack of story telling present and there are too many things that make me unhappy about the game, or I just don't have the mental capacity and critical thinking to really enjoy this. But if you can work with finding new ways to solve the same sort of puzzle, then perhaps you can find this brain-bending puzzle game up your alley. A good baseline is, do you like Space chem? If you do, this game might be worth looking at.			"

												This is a tough one. I personally had a great time for 95% of this game - many of the puzzles are extremely clever and the island is just so beautifully crafted and rendered. Other reviews are wrong on one point - the puzzles are consistent to their rule set; I completed the game without looking up any solutions and never had an issue figuring out any of the ""tricks"" after putting some effort in. I agree with everyone who has lauded the game's ability to teach and combine concepts by only showing and never telling.However, would I *recommend* it? If you're a fan of puzzle games like me, then yes, I think you'll have a good time. But the pleasure of this game doesn't really go beyond the pat on the back you can give yourself for solving some tough logic puzzles. While the environment does play an ingenious role in many puzzles, I can't help but feel it missed some opportunities. The coolest part of the game (no spoilers) is relegated to a tedious game of ""I Spy"" that has no real reward or consequence.My criticism here is the same as with Braid - though doubly so this time. The slight nods to some kind of underlying story or profundity come off as disconnected pretentiousness. Come for the puzzles, stay for the puzzles - there's no story here outside of the developer felating himself like a freshman in philosophy 101.And the puzzles were fun. It was genuinely thrilling to unlock the next door or find a new area of the island. But behind those gates were always just more line puzzles.For me, the game only barely outstayed its welcome. By the final area, I had had enough of The Witness's line puzzles for one lifetime. But the time I did spend, I personally enjoyed very much.			"

												There was a slow-burning joy in playing through this game. Looking back on it a couple months later, I think it's one of the best experiences I've had. Full stop.  To be sure, this isn't for everyone, and much of the gameplay is solving maze puzzles with increasingly complex rule sets, starting conditions, and interactions beween rules. You end up exploring each rule and the interplay between different rules. In doing so, I was amazed at how many different moments of epiphany are crammed into these mechanics and into the island setting. Almost none of the puzzles are truly hard in hindsight; when it clicks, a surprisingly simple answer tumbles out of the rule set. In that sense, it's more like exploring the consequences of puzzle concepts than solving puzzles (and that is a good and novel thing).Outside of the puzzles, I'm impressed by the deliberate and thoughtful design: the unique architecture of each house/treehouse/installation, the sound effects and cues for all types of puzzles, the feel of the cursor in the puzzles, the hidden details of the island--visual puns isn't quite the right phrase--that are unrelated to any puzzle. Congratulations to the team that put this much effort into the world and the mechanics. I know I couldn't have noticed everything, but rest assured I was looking. p.s. If anyone is wondering why my hours on record are so high, it's becasue I return to re-run a certain challenge. I don't beat it every time, but it's still satisfying long after I first completed it.			"

												Pros:-It introduces concepts and rules with very brief experimental puzzles to guide the player without tedious tutorials.-It has a definitive and vibrant graphic style that helps simplify the nature of the puzzles.-You feel smart after completing puzzles and figuring out the formula to solve them.-There are a lot of environmental puzzles to solve and find that are completely optional and fun to discover.Cons--Everything drags out way too long.-Every puzzle is basically the same with slightly different motives.-Solutions to puzzles are so extremely vague or time-consuming that it feels like guesing is the only real option.-There is no story. It's made up of ""deep"" and artsy poems by characters you don't even know.Full opinion:Part of what made me dislike this game is the exaggeration of how great it was. I had heard about this game through tons of positive feedback over how amazingly smart it was and how the creator of the game was a mastermind in his craft. This only leads me to believe that my time spent on this game would be a fantastic and memorable gaming experience. It wasn't. I feel like half of this game shouldn't even exist, unless, it was optional or a harder difficulty. I really don't understand how so many people were stoked on this game.It seems as if every set of puzzles in every area had a pattern of  ""let's figure this out"" to ""okay i get it now"" to ""oh god there's more."" Just as the puzzles became managable and at the peak of their difficulty, it would open up a whole new set of puzzles with even more ridiculous challenges. And instead of feeling like I had overcome obstacles with my intellect and hard work, I just felt like I had done a list of chores. Especially considering every single puzzle is the exact same with a slight spin.Pretty soon, it felt like the creators had given up and decided that they could keep players invested by just including more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I had beaten Myst, one of the greatest puzzle games of all time, and have a total of 10 hours spent on it. The Witness took up 20 hours of my time, and I hadn't gotten to all the optional areas and puzzles. Most of it feels like a waste of time, and I found myself tempted to look up solutions because I didn't have the energy to continue. To me, the price of this game does not equal the time spent. I'd much rather play a short and actually FUN game for the same price.This game is just a gigantic vague mess in an attempt to sound and look deep and artistic. It wastes your time by giving you way more than you can or should ever chew. While most puzzles start off very interesting and unique, they always end up overstaying their welcome and introducing the most ridiculous ways to make a fun puzzle frustrating. This game might tickle some people's fancy. But I would highly recommend just playing Myst.			"

												The Witness is one of the best games I have played. I couldn't sleep for a few nights just because I was thinking of some puzzles I couldn't solve at that moment. You start the game without any proper knowledge of its puzzles and you learn more and more as you progress in the game. I spent 23h playing The Witness and still didn't solved everything (but reached end game). Don't be afraid if you have no idea what some puzzles mean and keep exploring. There is different zones to learn basic for each type of puzzle. I will try to avoid any spoilers in review. PROS  Graphics.  The game looks very nice, with the small details everywhere. Without anymore words just appreaciate the view:


Still amazes me 
A Screenshot of The Witness

 Puzzles.  All puzzles follow same path: from A to B but there is plenty of different rules and ways to solve those puzzles what makes each of them unique enough. In that 23h I used guide for 3 puzzles (yes I was stupid and tired), 2 of those puzzles was so easy that i wanted to bang my head to something because of my inability to think in that way. Third puzzle... I don't know and to this day I feel cheated by developers because i have no idea why it was solved that way (there is possibility that I will find out later in the game). Game contains more than 600 puzzles so you will spend lots of time solving everything without any help. Controls.  Sometimes puzzle games fails because of bad controls. Here you can't fail with controls and it is simple. NEUTRAL   Game world.  Game world is really nice and detailed, everything is fine but i found it a bit crowded. In the begining sometimes it is hard to determine where one zone ends and another one begins. And map layout is a bit confusing. You will spend some time figuring everything out but once you pass that stage everything is fine. CONS  Learning curve.  Yes there are huge learning curve in game and it comes with the layout of a map. At least once in a game you will feel lost. There will be plenty of puzzles you have no idea how to solve and no knowledge where to go to learn about those puzzles. CONCLUSION  Despite few drawbacks of this game like learning curve it is a great game. Eventually you will reach a point where you will have knowledge of all different solving systems and even with taht knowledge you will have to sit and think for a while looking for a way to solve some puzzles. For me it was most enjoyable game at 2017 so I do recommend this game.Caution: if you have poor puzzles solving skill be prepared for big challenge.For more reviews visit :  Gabzys the Curator	If you like it join group and follow me.

												Jump into a game that will slowly challenge your mind in a very well done way until you stop playing and don't pick it up for a few weeks until you forget how all of the puzzles work and have to look them up all online.			"

												Like all good puzzle games, you can be stumped on something for days then feel like an absolute genius when you solve it.  And the island is so open that if you DO get stuck, you can just move onto another area and come back later.It looks absolutely gorgeous too.			"

Warning: Playing this game intensively may cause hallucinations, over-analaziation, paranoia, pattern-seeking-urges and the need of♥♥♥♥♥♥urine) jugs...It is truly an enjoyable game, the equivalent of having many tablet/mobile puzzle games in one open-world, which at times, is dependent to that environment. It requires you to think in perspective, to pay attention, to learn, to evolve...to think. Sometimes if you can't figure something out, you'll just try some trial&error, if you consider yourself weak, you'll just ask someone or check a tutorial for help. The level design is truly nice, the ambient sounds are soothing, everything is really calming (until you get annoyed by a puzzle, of course). Probably the lack of voice acting is a good thing, but the level limitations are sometimes confusing/annoying...I mean, what must one do if someone wants to jump off a cliff?! In rest, pretty much everything else is intuitive. Armed with a sharp mind, patience and time, one can truly enjoy this game.			"

												I really really wanted to like this game. And some of the things this game does are brilliant. It looks great, sounds great, and is full of interesting and often well-implemented ideas. There have been some breathtaking ""eureka"" moments where I understand a new puzzle concept and have to marvel at its ingenuity. But the last ten percent is what brings it crumbling down - little game design annoyances like the decision to not include a simple jump button and thus making climbing a three-foot ledge a major obstacle, or how some puzzles force you to re-complete the previous puzzle every single time you make a mistake, or the often unweildy in-puzzle controls which are sometimes slow and other times too fast, or the fact that a wrong answer turns your mistakes bright red even in color-sensitive puzzles, or the feeling that I somehow know less about this island now than when I started... It's a game that is alternately fascinating and infuriating, satisfying and completely obtuse, stupidly easy and then immediately heinously difficult. If Jon Blow ever puts the game on sale for a significant amount, which probably isn't likely for a few years at least, then consider buying it and trying out the game for yourself. It's not all bad, but the bits that are bad soured a majority of the experience for me.			"

												This game is fantastic! Its a puzzle game that requires you to think outside the box in every respect. From the trailers, it may look like the only thing shown is a simple maze puzzle, and you might think ""how complex could that possibly get?"". The answer is: Very!Pay attention to EVERYTHING, because it all might be relevent to the puzzle/puzzles you're working on. It could be the way the grass grows in a certain area, the way shadows hit a certain object, the angle you're looking at something.. no holds are barred when it comes to how creative some of the solutions to these puzzles are.Some people may be dissapointed that this game is not quite the ""adventure game"" they were expecting, and they're right, its not an adventure game its a pure puzzle game.It's not Myst, its The Talos Principle. I'm 12 hours in and I've had so many satisfying moments that I can only give a full recommendation.			"

												The Witness is pretty much ""The Puzzle Game"", in a too literal way.Most of the game consist in a series of puzzles that progress in this fashion:1.- Solve a puzzle so simple that's almost impossible to fail, not really understanding it.2.- Solve a variation of the same puzzle, now deducing what's the rule that makes the solution valid.3.- Apply it to a more complicated version of the same puzzle.4.- This next puzzle seems impossible to solve. Re-evaluate your assumptions and find out the twist in how the rule can be applied.5.- More complicated version of the same puzzle.And some times:6.- A new rule is introduced. You don't know how it works and it's hard to deduce. Go find the tutorial progression for that rule in another part of the island.Most puzzles are pretty cool and make your brain click a lot. However, some times you'll find an isolated puzzle that combines ~3 rules and ~7 conditions in a complicated way that crosses the line of what you can mentally solve, making a direct deduction of the solution impossible and forcing you to consider every partial solution you can think of and try out combinations until you find out a valid one that satisfies every rule and meets every condition. It's not so bad that you can't find the solution if you insist for a while (probably), but it will be out of spite or pride, not because you are really enjoying it. Luckily, these are the exception, not the norm.Sadly, the final series of puzzles before the ending is pretty underwhelming, with puzzles that are either a complicated mix of previous rules or a not so complicated puzzle presented in an obnoxious way, like the it will be moving, spinning, changing color, or you can only see one section of the puzzle at a time, basically forcing you to draw them on a piece of paper and solving them there.There's also a fair share of environmental puzzles in which you don't have to logically deduce the solution but to find it or reveal it using the environment in different and imaginative ways. These are generally cool, but in some instances they walk a bit too close to the edge of BS or plain obnoxiousness.There are also some optional patterns that can be found and activated through the island. Making things align to reveal some of them is really cool, but trying to find them all is probably a lunatic path paved with patience and frustration.Maybe the most disappointing thing is that the island itself serves little to no purpose. There's no interesting interconexion between areas, no substantial change, no big reveal. There are panels with puzzles, solving those puzzles get you access to more panels, and some times you activate a bridge that let's you reach even more panels.There's barely a hint of a story, not enough to even understand what the title is referring to (if it's actually referring to anything) but enough to make you miss a proper one. The game also tries to convey some messages, but it does so in a confuse and pretentious 2deep4u way in which nothing makes more sense or has more meaning than what you are willing to pretend it does.Overall, it's a really good puzzle game, almost the perfect puzzle game, but feels like it should have been more.

												This game's precursor, Braid was good. Braid was fun. I felt rewarded when I figured out how to get the little guy to his destination. It was charming and it had a clever story. With each level I completed, I felt progress and reward. Sure, some parts were fiendishly difficult but I felt a real drive to get past there because I felt like it was worthwhile. So of course, I figured the witness would feel worthwhile. I was wrong. The witness is an empty lifeless string of dull and obscure puzzle boards. The world sometimes plays a part in the puzzles but often in ways that are just stupid and obtuse. Some people might read that and think ""ha ha you're just butthurt because you're not smart enough.."" I'm smart enough, I finished braid with all the secrets, by myself. The problem with the witness is, there is NO MOTIVATION. no narrative. Just some stupid statues posed in a 'quirky' way and some random quotes from philosophers that have no real relation to the game world. Honestly, these quote feel like this game is trying to redeem it's lifeless shell with some borrowed concept from the talos principle; but the talos principle had a very strong narrative that was weaved through conversations with Milton.  This has no real interaction. The player has no real effect on hte world, it's just window dressing. It's window dressing for a series of obscure logic puzzles. If I wanted to do that, I'd take a rubiks cube with me and go on a hike. At least then I'd get some exercise and fresh air. Then there is the price.  Seriously dude, Jonathon Blow. That is freaking greedy. You're not selling half life 3 here.  It's a gimmicky puzzle indie game. Get over yourself.  Damn waste of money.			"

												Let's just get it out there: the game is a waste of time. You've probably read the reviews praising it and how it's immersive and wonderful and the kitchen sink. For me it is not. If you like puzzle games, get a proper one. If you like Myst, Riven or others of that series, don't buy this one. This is nothing like them. No matter how much people refer to those.I was waiting for this game based on the comments from people. Never really checked it out or any gameplay videos. Finally a bundle came with this game in there. Bought immediately. Now thinking that it's a good thing there were many other games in the bundle since this isn't worth the money.I've solved almost 300 puzzles already. And I'm yet to have any feeling of accomplishment. The game doesn't give you anything. You run around, try to figure out how to solve puzzles. Then you solve them. Just to solve some more. And more. Of the same single puzzle, with slight variations. Over and over again.Sure, you get a laser up. So what? Why do I care? What does the laser do? Nothing for me. It's just there. Puzzles after puzzles to get to puzzles after a puzzle. Nothing else.The island is big. You will run around a lot. That makes the game long. Not that it has a huge amount of content, just the fact that you'll run around. You can't jump. So you have to run around some more even though the area you want to go is right in front of you, but it's a meter too low. So run. Run run run.Nothing in the island means anything to me. There is no meaning. Why am I here? I don't care. Why do I do these puzzles? I don't know. They don't do anything. There is no feeling of purpose.And immersive? No. It's just a colorful island. Since I don't have a purpose or a goal I can't be immersed.Then there's the videos and audio files. I don't care about them either. They don't relate to anything in the game. They seem to be there so people will spend even more time in the game, without actually accomplishing anything.I like puzzles. Just not the same puzzle 500 times without accomplishing anything or feeling like I am doing something worthwhile.I'll still finish it. And hate it. And have no idea how some people have spend over 50 hours in this game when it clearly doesn't deserve it.If you find this on sale for $5 it might be ok. More than that... No.			"

												The Witness is the single best invoker of the Tetris effect I've ever seen. For those who don't know, the Tetris effect is what its called when aspects from a game start bleeding over into the real world- such as seeing things moving down after playing Tetris for a while. With The Witness, you start seeing patterns everywhere. And I mean everywhere, especially where they don't exist. The game trains you to look for these, and unraveling some are very satisfying.Oh and the primary method of puzzles? Outside of a couple select (thankfully short) areas, I thoroughly enjoyed solving them. They may all be line puzzles, but there are so many clever twists on the formula scattered throughout, especially in the endgame. Having to come up with a solution to a puzzle that not only meets the explicit requirements but also the implicit requirements to progress was the most fun I had with the game, and the final area has so many of these types of double puzzles.The final challenge is a timed gauntlet of random puzzles that I got on the second try, with one entirely new gimmick added in that's not spelled out anywhere else. I feel like this was meant to be much harder than the endgame, as it comes after, but it played to my strengths as a player.Anyone who tries saying this game didn't need an overworld and should have been a level select game is missing at least half the point of the game. Yes, the core puzzle type would work well in that context. But the catch here is that so many of the uses would be ruined by a level select, or outright impossible. In fact, the core Tetris effect reason is why the island works so well, even if walking from one area to another can be a bigger hassle than necessary sometimes.			"

												Is this game worth buying?  (bullet point review)First I'll say I think its not perfect, and I wouldn't give it a 10/10. There are, after hours of play, some things I don't like. I did not like the sets of puzzles which relied on listening to shrill and annoying audio samples to solve. I would like the environment to feel more alive. Where are the fish, insects, birds (wink wink) , small mammals? I suppose I can forgive an indie studio for not having the budget to elaborate on complex animal ambience.Onto business.If you are looking for a game ...... which challenges you instead of rewards you.... which isn't bugged to hell or released in alpha as most 'full releases' are these days.... in which thoughtfulness is encouraged, instead of time-destroying grinding or farming for e-stats.... where you walk away from it feeling happier than when you sat down.... which doesn't conspire to get you addicted like many modern games.... which feels like walking into an art gallery, where ones shoes should be removed upon entering.... with actual depth. Not the fake depth of grinding to level whatever, but the depth of discovering and understanding complex practical and philosophic puzzles Witness presents you with.... in which 'sleeping on it' is actually a legitimate method of solving the puzzles.... where you will walk over a piece of ground a hundred times, not realizing it is the missing piece of the puzzle.... which you can show your family and friends.... which doesn't feel like watching a Michael Bay film.... which is bad by 2016 standards (no perks, leveling treadmills, no addictive hooks, no farming, no worrying about it while you're at work, no peer pressure, no achievements, unlockables, no pay to win, no DLC).Then you have found a game worth playing.I won't tell you to like Witness. It is not for everyone. The price feels steep at $39.99. I do believe Witness is worthy enough for you to take a chance with it, and after 10-20 hours of play, deciding then whether you like it, or not.Just as a wine collection needs a few fine bottles, your Steam Library needs The Witness.

												The Witness starts strong enough in the way it eases you into its mechanics. For a few minutes, it's satisfying, and the world feels pleasant to wander around in. Gradually, apart from the novelty of a few clever ideas, it spirals downward into a meaningless monotony where the exploration begins to feel like a chore between tasks and the obtuse puzzles cease to be rewarding.Often, a new rule is introduced that makes sense, until put in a new context where your understanding of the rule no longer applies.  Other times, a new rule is introduced in a very open-ended puzzle that is hardly conducive to learning how it works. As a result, many of the puzzles become guessing games instead of actual brain-teasers. There are also numerous kind of neat puzzles that are incredibly straightforward, but are made time-consuming by requiring a lot of walking back and forth through the environment, and ultimately, they lead nowhere.The Witness looked dull to me when I saw the trailer--just a bunch of line grids inefficiently laid out on a colorful landmass.  I gave this game the benefit of the doubt because I loved Braid and figured there must've been some appeal that I was missing.  Playing the game sadly met my initial expectations.  It is impractically empty and repetitive considering its size and its price tag.I regret waiting over two hours for The Witness to get interesting, because the friend who graciously gifted this game to me will not be able to get a refund.-After viewing other reviews of this game, it bothers me to see so many say, ""If you like puzzles, you'll love The Witness,"" or something to that effect.  I love puzzles, and The Witness disappointed me.			"

												""This is just a dumb grid based puzzle game that could be a free app"" is what I typically hear when I talk about The Witness to anyone that has NEVER played it. Key word there is never... This game is much more than any dumb old free puzzle game on the apple store, this is an incredibly well developed, immersive, difficult, interesting, and different kind of puzzle game. The game's main mechanic may make the whole experience seem very lacking at first glance, however, when you are in this world you realize how these 2d puzzles interact in their 3d environment and feel like it makes sense in the world presented to you. With every new puzzle you learn how to conquer them by good game design, the game literally has you teach yourself how to beat each one of these puzzles so that when completing even simple puzzles you still have a great sense of achievement opposed to a tutorial line guiding you through how to solve puzzles with mechanics foreign to you. This game is worth any puzzle lovers time and is worth the 40 dollars. You will get your money's worth.			"

												The Witness is a masterpiece, though it's not for everyone. If you enjoy games which reward exploration and experimentation, there's a lot to love here - but even then, the game asks a deal of patience of its audience. You will often come across puzzles which you are ill-equipped to solve. The brilliance in the design is that all of the puzzles are entirely solvable with the mechanics available to players from the start of the game; the only real limit on the player is their knowledge of the rules. There are no explicit tutorials, but the knowledge is available to be discovered across the game's beautiful island setting. If that sounds a bit vague it's only because I want to respect readers in the same way that the game respects its players, allowing them to explore and discover for themselves the many secrets of the island. As you might expect in a game from the designer who brought us Braid, the narrative is very much open to interpretation. This is a game wherein nothing is explicit, and if you require that external drive you may feel rather lost. It helps a great deal to to come into this game with a willingness to think, to be confused, and to keep exploring all the same. It's worth noting that colourblind and/or hearing impaired players may have difficulty with some of the game's puzzles, as they rely on an array of sensory clues. I encourage those affected to do more research before diving in.It took me about 25 hours to reach the end of the game, completing a fair deal of the optional puzzles along the way - though I suspect the remaining ones could easily take another 5-10 hours to get through, if not longer. I abstained from turning to the internet for advice the entire way through, and I strongly recommend that other players do the same. The game tells you everything you need to know if only you persevere - and the sense of achievement that comes from overcoming these challenges alone is great. Trust the game; it is fair, and it does want you to succeed. All in all this is one of the most impressively designed games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. There is sharp intent behind every aspect of its construction - to a level that often feels absurd - and the result is an incredibly unique and fulfilling experience.			"

												Do you remember Lost?I mean, I don't; by the time I was aware of it, the show had gone on too long for me to start from the beginning, and I was never very interested in it anyway. Largely, my impression of it was and is that the writers started with a few interesting mysteries, but then, in an effort to seem clever, just kept adding more and more ""inexplicable"" (read: more or less random) events without actually answering the previous questions. By the time it ended, nothing made any sense - the attempt at depth and intrigue had landed more in the realm of obtuseness and pointless confusion.That's The Witness in a nutshell.There are two major flaws with this game. The first, as previously mentioned, is that nothing even tries to make any sense, and that this is heralded as fascinatingly clever instead of frustratingly lazy. The second is that the puzzle gimmick really does wear out its welcome.The first hundred or so grids with various rules and layouts are interesting, even fun. It's a mechanic I haven't really seen anywhere else. The second hundred are okayish, but after a certain point, if you've seen a hundred and seventy-five, you've seen them all. The three hundred or so after that? I started looking up the answers in guides, not because I needed the help, but because I was bored out of my mind solving the same damn thing over and over.I really wish this game had done more to let the player feel like they were actually impacting the environment. Sure, doors open when you solve the puzzles on them and whatnot, but can you imagine how awe-inducing it could be to see the island actually change around you in response to your progress through the game?As it is, I feel that another, different type of puzzle should have been introduced about halfway through. It would have kept the extant mechanics from feeling stale, and could have been combined with the grids to produce new puzzles. My favorite part of puzzle games is the ""eureka"" moment, where suddenly all the clues align just right in your brain and voila, there's the answer, right in front of you all along. The Witness... doesn't have that. At all.But on the whole, that's a lesser crime, compared to the complete lack of explanation or justification for anything on the island. Listen. I would have been totally fine with this if the game had billed itself as, say, ""A journey across an eerie, beautiful island, with few distractions but plenty of moments to savor."" That'd be fine. But no - to copy and paste directly from the description: ""This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious.""Let me repeat that, a little louder for the people in the back: ""This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious.""In my experience, that's exactly what this game doesn't do.There aren't even any spoilers for this thing, besides puzzle solutions. There's nothing to spoil. Here's what happens when you finally reach the end of the game, the thing all of these mindbending puzzles have been leading you to: the camera pans around the island, showing off a lovely view of every single puzzle you did being wiped clean, doors closing, machinery shutting down, and then desposits you right back in the hole you started the game in.That's what you get, for putting all that work into this game. I don't think the message ""you wasted your time, you sucker,"" could be any clearer. The obelisks don't do anything either, and you can't finish them all in a normal playthrough. As in, it's literally impossible.If you like this one specific type of puzzle and you're willing to do just that and only that for zero reward, go for it. Otherwise, save yourself forty bucks and don't bother.			"

												Don't bother buying this game, especially if you are running an AMD card. The game itself is great, but it's extremely unstable (crashing every 5-30 minutes on my R9 380). After the last crash, I've completely lost my save game and am forced to start from the beginning. If you check the forums, the devs aknowledge wide spread stability issues, they claim they are waiting for AMD to provide support. SAVE YOUR MONEY, wait until the game actually works.			"

												I feel like doing chores, not playing a game.After 4 hours of playing, I got three laser beams fired from the first area, the sun temple, the maze, and watched a video in a windmill. I'm still not satisfied with any puzzle yet. The first area puzzles make me feel like I went back in a discrete mathematic or a programming class. Solving them by logical thinking is not that difficult, but also not a rewardng experience. I felt like those problems are more suitable for computers, not for humans -- the puzzles are so dead that I should ""let dead people do the work for me"". I understand that the designer intend to isolate pure logical puzzles on board first so that the players will not get frustrated. And because the players have to be skillful enough with such logical thinking (so that they will have less problem later in more advanced courses), there has to be many of them -- repetitive and boring puzzles. This is not a flaw in the design but a consequence of the choice of puzzle made by the author. The sun temple puzzles are more to geometric. However after the first set of puzzles on the surface, the rest of the puzzles stackup more overhead to the player, not fun. First set: 1 reflection, second set: 2 reflections, 3rd set: 2 reflections and a translation... It was like I'm working with a series of mathematical evaluations each evaluation is getting more complex because there is another multiplication term stacking in the rear. How to solve that? I need to do similar process of computation again and again and again, then translate it back into control sequence for the game. The newly introduced gimmick/ideas are not bad but doesn't worth additional chores. The maze puzzle area also has the same problem of ""pain > value"".Overall, the puzzles are like multiple sequences of math excercises presented in a book across chapters. Apart from that, I sometimes find it difficult to locate a starting puzzle of a series. Tracing wire is not fun at all... Braid is a lot better. The witness lacks of both atmospherical and emotional punches. I gave a thumb down not because the game is not good. If it is not made by the creator of Braid, the game deserved a big thumb up. I had a very high expectation for this game to be so much better.			"

												The Witness is one of those rare games that made me pick up pencil and a piece of paper in order to solve it. And I think that's awesome.It boils down puzzles to the very core: simple logic. That might sound boring for some, but I was fascinated how a simple concept of drawing a line from A to B can have so many clever variations.I liked how game without any hints can teach you how to solve different puzzles and how subtly it says ""don't guess, you'll know the right answer"". It's simply brilliant, can't recommend this enough.			"

												This game is by far one of the best pure puzzle driven games I have ever played. With a little over 6 hours played I would estimate that I have done about 1/3 of the puzzles this game has to offer and I am still compelled to return.  Here is a breakdown of the good and the bad of the game and why I find it so amazing.Graphics -The graphics of this game are beautiful but very stylized and not overly detailed up close. So, the real draw is how the art is used. Much like World of Warcraft when it first came out, the graphics were not amazing per say, but the sheer artistic vision realized through the graphics is what is impressive.Sound -The sound in this game is designed to keep the tone and feel of the game relaxing and peaceful. While I may not be the best puzzle solver in the world, I am no slouch. There were many times already that I had to think both deeply and creatively to get a solution and the background sound was enjoyable and was not disruptive to my train of thought.Gameplay -I have read many reviews of this game and yes... the game is a ""puzzle maze"" game. Most (not all but most) of the puzzles are all presented on boards for you to interact with. However, to say that this game is just one type of puzzle and boring because of it is like saying the Louvre is just a building full of paint covered canvases (yes I know there are other forms of art there but you get my point). While the game starts out with VERY basic puzzles, they not only get harder later; they evolve and branch out into a myriad of different themes.Story -Since I am only about a third of the way through, I cannot comment on the overall quality of the story, but it is definitely there for those who are paying attention. That is one thing which may be a problem for some: this game may not fully be about ""the story"". What I have experienced instead so far is more a sense of cohesiveness. Each area of the island has different coloring, temperature (artistically), and culture so that there is a feeling of uniqueness to each area that maps to different puzzle mechanic themes. Despite this, there are several game elements that tie each of these unique zones into a clear whole.Nits -So is the game perfect? No. There is an oddly clunky menu (mostly irrelevant). The textures for the game close up are not amazing (as I hinted at before). There are some poorly designed terrain elements like solving a puzzle to move a small ""bridge"" across water and having it take an eternity EACH time you do it is silly. Also, the movement mechanics are a bit primitive, so you are sometimes forced to walk around obstacles in the environment due to the inability to even slightly jump. These are not intentional barriers that serve a purpose in separating different aspects of the game; they are just unintended bumps in the road. Finally I have a pet peeve for quasi pretentious quotations from great thinkers that are not directly relevant to the environment and there are plenty of them in the game.So, why is this game amazing?The answer is the game's skill at teaching and how it does it. The way the game is set up, each themed area teaches you more and more about the puzzles and how the function. It is not a tutorial, it is not an explanation; it is a journey of discovery as you are confronted with iterations of the same puzzle theme that are increasingly abstract or complex. Never have I seen a game before that is more elegant in using a self-educational model to greater effect. You then get to go back to areas with more hybrid puzzle themes with a clear understanding of how these dozens of mechanics work without anyone uttering a single word to explain. "

												Holy Ship! This Beach is incredible!Before I downloaded the game I was reading the reviews about how All Of The Puzzles Are The Same. They are just grid maze puzzles. (I couldn't believe that there could actually be just  hundreds of the same grid puzzles so I Purchased the game).Sure-Nuff! Hundreds of the same grid type puzzles. I almost wanted my money back as I was reaching the two hour mark but Thank God I didn't.This work is absolutely Fantastic! The longer you explore the island, the more that you learn and discover. Let me explain:In those 1st two hours I came across some of those maze type grid puzzles that made Absolutely No Sense At All. (That was what made me think about getting my money back)But behold! After exploring the Island for awhile, I learned something that made those 'No Sense' puzzles....make perfect sense. Then it was just a matter of solving them.It was that 'eureka moment' when I realized what this game was all about and how complex and vast this game was going to be.The Island is huge and there are So Many places to explore that just the exploration itself will take quite some time; not to mention trying to remember where everyting is.Then, of corse, there are the puzzles themselves. Wow, this isn't going to be a cake-walk either.Some are easier, of corse, but some are vastly complicated (But Very Logical).An Example:I came across a puzzle that made absolutely No Sense At All so I left it and continued exploring. About 10 hours later I discoved a part of the Island that explained the puzzle that I was stumped on. Now I understand the puzzle so I head back to it. OK, so here I am back at the puzzle and I Now Understand what it is all about and what I have to do to solve it. Hee, hee, but now I have to solve it!I worked on it for well over an hour, gave up, and turned the computer off.The next morning I was sitting on our deck and thinking about the puzzle and the answer hit me like a brick.I ran inside and solved the puzzle in less than a minute!That is just a hint of what this game is all about. There is a ton of exploration and a ton of puzzles to solve.Sometimes you work on a puzzle for a long while and when you finally solve it....Nothing happens 'as far as you know'. You feel let down.Later you may realize what solving that puzzle actually accomplished and you get that atta-boy feeling.Other times, when you solve a puzzle, there will be instant gratification.I wish that I could go into more detail to explain the vast wonderous intriging complexities of the game but I don't want to take a chance of spoiling anything for you if you decide to play.     If you are the type of person that thinks matching three or four of like colored or shaped objects to make them vanish is a puzzle, don't even waste a penny of your money on this software masterpiece.If, however, you are a person that likes the puzzles on MillerWorldInc or some such puzzle site then Don't Even Hesitate For A Second! Purchase This Game!I know that the 40 buck price tag seems steep but I have to tell Ya, from what I've seen so far, you are going to get a fantastic ride for less than 50 cents an hour.  Is it like Myst? Not really, because there isn't an intwined story involved.  Is it like Portal? No, Portal was more linear.  Is it like The Talos Principle? Kinda, because you have more freedom of movement. But, take those three and put them in a blender and you May have an understanding of what 'The Witness' actually is.If you like to explore and solve puzzles....Get this from Steam NOW!  "

The Witness is not a game about solving puzzles, but rather about learning how to be able to solve puzzles. Broadly, it's a game about being perceptive, about teaching and understanding, and about discovery. Devoid of wordy descriptions or rule explanations, The Witness invites players to learn naturally while adopting a mindset of attentiveness.The ingenuity of the game comes from the fact it takes the ""solve line puzzles on grids"" mechanic and toys with it as much as possible, squeezing absolutely everything out of it. The grids themselves serve as an input method, a means of interaction with your environment—the game is much more than hundreds of line puzzles on an island. Through these puzzles, however abstract, The Witness does not only (greatly) challenge players, but also incites real human emotion—glee, annoyance, excitement, hatred, wonder, elation.The Witness is an ideal example of how a game should be—while it may only appeal to a relatively small subset of players, it appeals to this group greatly, rather than appealing to many players mildly without being overly impressive to anyone. It does not try to please all players, and actively rejects the ""low risk–high reward"" mold common to the modern video game industry. It's also not every game that necessitates you to get a notebook of graph paper to solve puzzles, or at least exit the game window to visualize your thoughts using Microsoft Paint.So, why ""The Witness""?The P versus NP problem, a major unsolved question in computer science and branches of mathematics such as complexity theory, asks: ""Can every problem whose answer can be checked quickly by a computer also be solved quickly by a computer?"" The definition of a problem in NP (e.g. puzzles in The Witness) is that, given a candidate solution, there exists a way to verify that the solution is correct in polynomial time. Reiterating an earlier point, The Witness is more about the discovery of a verifier as opposed to finding an actual, specific solution to puzzles. In mathematical terms, such a verifier is called a witness. The game involves you, the player, searching for the witness to various puzzles.Blog post about this game, with pictures: http://elifessler.com/games/blog/posts/the-witness "

												Do you like maze puzzles? Do you like hundreds of maze puzzles in a row? If yes, then you might enjoy The Witness.If, like me, you aren't completely enthused with doing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle with nothing to break up the puzzle-puzzle-puzzle stream, then this game probably isn't for you. I've been told that there's a subtle ""plotmosphere"" somewhere in the game, but to be honest -- no matter how great that subtle plot might be, I'm not willing to sit through a million of the same types of puzzles. (Yes, I know they end up slightly different. But in the end, they're all still maze puzzles.)I got pretty sick of the Talos Principle too, but that one had more variety in the puzzles and an actual story that was driving me forward. The only thing The Witness really has going for it is beautiful graphics. (And, if you like maze puzzles, it has a lot of them.)			"

												Bought this game after watching the giant bomb quicklook. I was a huge fan of braid and really looking forward to Johnathan's next project. I'll be honest here. I'm not sure if this is all there is to the game, but if it is, I have no idea what he spent the past 8 years making. Sure it's a great, challenging puzzle game, but that's it. It's just puzzles. There's not much else. The puzziles do get interesting. This isn't a ""snake simulator"" like some others have said, but at the same time, the game is fairly predictable and repetitious.I'm going to keep playing and will update my review if my opinion changes, but thus far, I'm not seeing much content here. Beautiful? Absolutely. Challenging? Sure? Engaging.... ehhh.... we'll see. So far, I'm not so sure this one has staying power. Maybe next time John?[EDIT] Played a few more hours, got to the section with the trees and the bridges and just couldn't take anymore. So many bridges, so many repetitive puzzles and...  I hadn't figured out some pre-requesite so now I have to back track... Sigh. Desperate, I cheated and watched a few videos. I'm sorry guys, after seeing a few spoilers, it doesn't appear I'm missiong out on much. This game is beautiful, but that's it. There simply isn't much game here. It's mostly 2d puzzles with a few environmental/perspective puzzles towards the end.			"

												I went into this fairly recently, months after all the hype. I knew nothing apart from people thought it was good and a puzzle game. I was fairly casual in my pace, taking a couple weeks of going back here and there to finish it up and roam around the island, and I loved it.This is a beautiful setting, and brilliantly made. I didn't like all the puzzles types, and may never 100% it, but I love it all the same. I would highly recommend it as something to dip into every now and then, with some music in the background and just to see the world and try and wrap your head round some of the puzzles. Then if you get stuck, don't beat yourself up, just come back to it later or have a look round the environment. The little hidden things really make it truly great.			"

												I'm conflicted on whether to recommend this or not, but ultimately I could only recommend this to somebody who wants a hard lesson in anti-climax.If you like hard puzzles, where the reward is more puzzles, this could be the game for you. I really enjoyed the puzzles, but found the game around them to be a disappointment. The fact that some puzzles are obscured in the environment, needing you to stand on a particular angle to see them, or needing you to reach a certain moment in a video and connect them to something external means that completing this game fully is an exercise in frustration and time-wasting.The game is full of mystery, but I found no satisfaction in the ending even though I searched and watched the other endings on Youtube after deciding I wasn't going to pursue 100% completion. The popular interpretation of the game's secret ending feels like a cop out. "

												For people who like stick puzzles and pretty views. On a more serious note, this is not a narrative driven game experience. People looking for a strong story wont find it, but in many ways this game is rather genius. I don't want to spoil it, but the experience, at least what I have so far, is from how you learn and approach the different challenges in your own way and time.  Leaving and returning to different challenges is built into the game design, but overall I have to say I really like this game. I get that the game is trying to be a metaphysical or philosphical approach to learning, and understanding rules and progression, and that might be why people don't like it. I think it's like learning a language. If you use a walkthrough for a particular puzzle, you might figure it out, but you won't understand the rules for the next one. If someone translates a sentence from another language, you might know what that sentence means, but you have no idea how it was constructed in a certain way.I never played Braid, but as a puzzle game, this really is eye-opening. As of writing this review, I'/e only seen a ""very conservative"" amount of what the game has to offer, but there is a lot to the game, and there is plenty of going on with the ""island"" itself, you just have to look for it in the right places. The only issue was the lack of any sound-track, but I think it's warranted given the isolated island setting of the game.			"

												It's hard to explain why this game has become one of my favorites in such a short time. The Witness is visually striking, even with minimal texturing and obvious facets on objects. The attention to detail, though, seemingly from every angle and every position, leads to many astonishing moments, beautiful vistas, and moments of epiphany. The puzzles, while challenging and sometimes frustrating, are fun and build upon their rules and concepts until I had to resort to graph paper and a pencil to keep all of the possibilities in mind.If you enjoy games with little obvious direction and no definite goal, but which rewards exploration and attention to detail, with a large dose of simple seeming, yet complex puzzles to solve, then this is the game for you.

												Although some puzzles you will be guaranteed to be stuck on, the vast majority are fun, incredibly well made and are the perfect difficulty. My advice, if you get stuck on 1 in particular, especially if you believe you know the rules and have it well thought out, look it up online and cheat. Don't let 1 puzzle frustrate you to the point of not wanting to play the game again. Fortunatley i'm not too bothered about cheating if 1 eludes me. That being said I can spend a good 10 minutes just on a single puzzle!The environment is a joy to explore and the level design is very well built			"

												It's not a bad game but I wouldn't reccomend it for two reasons. I got motion sickness and it's a bit repetative. By repetative I mean that even though the puzzles themselves are varying difficulty they are very similar in design and very 2d. Feels like just walking in a 3d world to get to and start a new 2d puzzle.I expected a bit more after all the positive reviews and I thought it reminded me of ""The Talos Principle"", but this game feels a bit simplistic in design (the puzzles are varying difficulty though, and absolutely a challange).

												I want to start this review by saying that if you are here, you were lucky enough to find a review without any spoilers. Which is a really big deal considering the game. Yes, I have read many reviews before writing this one and most of them contains spoilers. Kinda sad considering people read reviews to know about the game playing experience, not to ♥♥♥♥ing ruin it completely. And it makes me wonder, do these people that wrote negative reviews really had The Witness gaming experience? Or maybe they just got their experience ruined by spoilers themselves... or maybe the game was just not meant to be played and liked by those people?Two things you have to know about this game and this is where every negative review fails: This game is about exploration and puzzle solving. Nothing else really. What did you expect? Also, it does it perfectly. It does it in it's own way. There are similar games out there such as Myst, The Talos Principle and the Portal games, but it's still not even close to what I felt during my playthrough of The Witness. It is an astounding puzzle game where you WILL have your mind blown in many different ways. Keep in mind that this is not your typical videogame. It is a puzzle game, and a hard one. You will enjoy progressing if you enjoy learning stuff. It is a very mature game that almost feels like working sometimes, but who said working has to be boring? Everything, and I mean everything in The Witness is beautiful. Environment, puzzles, design, colors, sound, details, gameplay... Everything is there for you to admire, feel, experience and forget. To make you forget about your life for a moment and completely fill your mind and thoughts with puzzles. But after, when you will go out, you might end up seeing the real world differently, seeing more of it's beauty. That's just what The Witness does.Nothing more has to be said and keep in mind that reading more reviews WILL ruin your experience. The game is all about it. And going in spoilers free is the way to go if you want to live something fun and worthy. I would give it a good 9.5/10.Also, a little bit of precision for some of you that might now know : Jon Blow is the director of The Witness and his last game Braid came out more than 6 years ago. So I want to precise the fact that I did not like Braid that much. I am not a Jon Blow fanboy. I am not brainwashed of any sort. To me The Witness is a masterpiece and a very inspiring game. This game is so beautiful. It would inspire anyone that does art, or doesn't.			"

												Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm not the best puzzle gamer out there. In fact, I struggle with some of the more basic puzzles in many games. My mind just doesn't function like that. However, a friend of mine had suggested this game as a great puzzle game. He said, ""It will challenge you in ways you've never been challenged before."" He was right on many different levels...but this isn't necessarily a good thing.Let me talk about a few of the things I thoroughly enjoyed about the game.First, the visuals. I really enjoyed the artwork of the game. It reminded me of a lot of indie games with hand painted visuals. Second, the lack of music. Throughout most of the game, the lack of music was serene in a way that allowed me to keep a level head while struggling with many of the puzzles (I ended up adding in my own classical or jazz music to help keep it serene). Third, the idea. Don't get me wrong, abstract puzzle games infuriate me to no end. However, there is something eloquent yet simple about the puzzles in this game. The idea that the game doesn't give you much to work with and you have to figure out the majority of the information yourself is a fascinating idea.Now, let's move on to why I can't recommend this game. In spite of the pros this game has, it comes with one major flaw that made the game far less enjoyable for me; the puzzles. Even though I said the abstract ideas were intriguing, the actual puzzles themselves left a bit to be desired in my opinion. Each puzzle is set up like a grid in front of you. You zoom in on the puzzles, and you have to figure out where to draw the line(s) and get through it like a maze. Certain puzzles come with sound clues, visual clues, patterns, symbols, lighting, colors, and/or a myriad of other obstacles or problems. Even though there is a strong variety of puzzle difficulties, each one feels so much like the last with a different variable. I'm already not much a fan of math or any of its forms, and each puzzle felt like a math equation that required solving. If I'm really going to delve in to a puzzle game, I enjoy the more physical puzzles that you might find in a Legend of Zelda game, or Portal 2. Overall, if you're a fan of very abstract puzzles, and the tedious task of doing the same kind of puzzle for hours on end, then go ahead, puck up the game and enjoy your time. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game as somebody that really struggled with everything the game had to offer. Cheers!			"

												I didn't absolutely hate the game, but as I got further and further in it, I started not caring whether I solved the next puzzle or not. Sometimes I would discover a door and I would care until I opened the door the puzzle was blocking.  For the most part, I learned that most of the doors just led to shortcuts through the world and really didn't reveal anything. Sometimes the doors  led to videos on philosophy and science  , but those weren't very rewarding as they didn't really give you insight or reveal what you were doing on the island.Many times I'd be presented a puzzle where I knew I could solve if I pulled out yet another sheet of graph paper and worked it out, but simply didn't feel like it. So I ended up quitting, playing something else and coming back the next day until the same thing happened. It turns out that is exactly how I approach sudoku or maze puzzle games on my smart phone. Binging on those is exactly what playing The Witness started feeling like. So I got through to the ""easy"" ending in small doses. Fortunately with everyone complaining about how bad the easy ending was, I was already prepared to be let down. So it wasn't shocking.The puzzles in the mountain almost made me stop completely. The only way Jonathan Blow could make the puzzles any harder were to  make them spin and flip and move around . That's when I felt he stepped over a line from intellectual challenge to using cheap tricks to make them harder. It's one thing to present a gauntlet that makes you think outside the box with all you've learned, it's another to have someone jump in front of you waving their arms while you're trying to solve a puzzle. Having to look at those puzzles was unpleasant. Giving your players headaches and motion sickness is not good puzzle design.Interestingly enough, it wasn't until AFTER the mountain when you can access all these hidden areas you could see through locked gates and inaccessible bridges you saw overhead did the game become fun again. I'm currently going through those puzzles, but I'm yet again, approaching it as I would the sudoku and maze puzzles (Flow Free) on my cell phone. A couple of puzzles at a time and then moving on to my other games. I'm using the same method to find all the environmental puzzles too. I'm simply in no rush to see the other endings.The only reason it's worth $40 to me is I enjoyed exploring the Island and the game has lasted a long time. It was a ""pleasant"" way to pass the time, but the game itself didn't knock my socks off.  Talos Principle still remains as my all-time favorite puzzle game.			"

												Tedious and without reward, The Witness tries desperately to capture the spirit of something much grander than the sum of its parts can deliver, but fails at virtually every conceivable turn. Offering only occasionally interesting puzzle mechanics that long overstay their welcome, pseudo pensive and ultimately pointless commentary in the form of purposefully abstract quotes delivered as if read the night before by failed art students, and agonizingly slow video clips picked straight from the brain of a teenage philosopher, all to pad the corpse of a treatise written by someone that values the appearance of thought more than the content of thought, and culminating in the weakest non-ending ever laid to disc.If you've ever had anyone attempt to convince you that their well trodden ideas are deceptively deep, you've experienced the bulk of The Witness and the rest isn't worth anyone's time.

SPOILER-FREE Video ReviewThe Witness was well worth the wait. It's a beautiful puzzle game that continues to surprise me and exceed my expectations with every hour I put into it. Don't be fooled into thinking this game is ""Just doing mazes"". The mazes are the blank spaces for you to write your answer, understanding the world is the actual puzzle.If you enjoyed Braid or any of the other complex and deep puzzle games out there like Antichamber, The Swapper, FEZ and the rest, it's very likely you'll enjoy The Witness.

												Let me start off by saying this game isn't truly bad. The game's scenery/art style is beautiful, but there's no motivational factor in doing the puzzles.  There's practically no story besides you being on a weird island in the middle of no where. In other puzzle games of this sort (Portal and Talos Principle, are two good examples) There's a very direct story on what's happening (In Talos Principle it's not very direct, but at least they leave a trail of audio tapes explaing the mystery of why you're there/what's happening). Many of the puzzles in The Witness are well thought out and make the player think, even though all the puzzles are based off the same 2D line puzzle logic, but if you wanted to just solve 2D line puzzles in a nice enviroment you could grab a sudoku book and play outside.

YouTube™ Video: The Witness - First Impressions 

			Views: 13,403		

			These are my first impressions of The Witness for PC. This is not intended to be a full review. Please keep that in mind when deciding weather or not to pick up the game.		

Summary: While The Witness is beautiful game, it boils down to solving a series of mazes presented to the player on digital panels. If you strip away this games production values, it's nothing more than a very well executed puzzle game that you might find on a mobile device for around $5. I simply can not recommend this game at it's current price, not to mention that many will give up in frustration due to the games opaque design and difficulty. If you want a more detailed explanation of the game and it's mechanics as well as my full opinion please watch the video.			"

												I'm 20+ hours in and still haven't finished the game yet (i've unlocked 5 lasers so far).Positives: Non-linear progression. You can solve puzzles from any area on the island.  Maximum satisfaction for solving puzzles. The game doesn't hold hands or show anything at all. The only information you get is that you are alone on a strange island (and this information you got from Steam :D). This is different from other games that at least show you a tutorial and explain things around with a tutorial level. The Witness tries to teach you like how kids learn how to walk and then lets you go on your own. Beautiful scenary and art all over the island. It is definitely a screenshot magnet. A great game for your brain, your eyes, and your ears as some puzzles require all three to be sharp ;).Negatives: 20+ hours in and I'm not sure about the story. All i've got were recordings and some deep hints about life and existence. No animals or other form of life apart from trees and plants. This made it too lonely and sometimes boring. I feel that's why the game had to look extra vibrant and colorful to compensate for the fact that you are alone. Inconsistent puzzle punishment. Some puzzles would ""shutdown"" if you get them wrong while others don't. In fact, most of the puzzles I solved didn't punish you if you got them wrong. So I don't understand why some of them punish you while others don't. This is annoying for people who care about symmetry, consistency, and simplicity. The game has all those 3 traits everywhere apart from this aspect which annoyed me.Final Thoughts:I'm still not done with the game and will continue to play whenever I have time. I think it is a great puzzle game with amazing game design ideas.Some people complain about the puzzles being to hard or the game not teaching you why your puzzle logic is wrong, however, those people didn't realize that the game actually teaches the puzzles and how to solve certain patterns but in the right area. Some areas combine knowledge from different patterns and those areas do not provide indication or help on why your puzzle logic is wrong.If you like puzzles, art and a challenging game then this game is for you. If you like simpler games with less brain fatigue then this game is probably not for you.			"

												Although difficult, The Witness is worth playing to behold its exceptional trickery created largely thanks to the stellar world design. Each corner of the world has a new challenge and the training process is always flawless. The well-designed maze puzzles are going to retrain your brain and make you look at things from a different perspective. Not all players will find their way to the crippling selection of final puzzles, but many will discover a few of the devious and wondrous solutions. Just finding one is more than enough reason to play, and the delightful solutions may spur players to solve more because all the answers are there to discover. The most important rule to remember in The Witness is that it is not a race to discover its masterful workings. So take your time and learn something new. Learning is reward enough and there is no finer game to demonstrate its power.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

												I did not *enjoy* The Witness, but I do feel I have been enrichened by experiencing it. The game has, as advertised, made me think deeply on a variety of issues, and is a deeply insightful and well crafted experience. However, the game also involves a great deal of mentally taxing tasks, and because I am a programmer by profession, and have to do similarly challenging and interesting tasks on a daily basis, the game felt unduely laborious to me.If you have a similar background, and would wish to avoid such an experience, then I suggest that you try the game for a couple of hours and base you decision on that. Otherwise, if your job does not involve the mental equivalent of heavy lifting, I would highly recommend The Witness to you.			"

												LOL WTF?!No... seriously. I just had one of those moments, bursting out in loud laughter from pure joy while playing this game, figuring out and finding something I could do that I previously had no idea was even possible, that I didn't even think should be possible, but yet it all still makes some kind of weird sense. It was freaking amazing. To tell you anything more about it would be to give too much away.This game is beautiful, intriguing , and compelling, weird, abstract, and logical. It makes you think outside of the box, sometimes literally, but in a way which still makes sense once you change your perspective.This game is NOT just about mazes on a panel, though there is a lot of that and it is a main game mechanic. It's about what you do with them and how you learn from them to interact with and better understand your environment, your world that has been masterfully and meticulously crafted for your enjoyment.If you like challenging, involved, and sometimes frustrating puzzles that occasionally blow your mind (no pun intended), you have to get this game, and shame on you if you don't.That being said, I have to somewhat begrudgingly acknowledge that this game isn't for everyone. Some may even hate it, perhaps even for some of the same reasons I love it. This seems destined to be one of those games that many either love or hate. I'd say that it's a safe bet that you'll at least be quite fond of it if you're into logical, challenging puzzle games.Well worth the full asking price and then some, in my opinion.Enjoy.			"

												After short of 32h I am done with The Witness and ready to do a review. And when I say done I mean it. I didn't just beat the game but I made sure I had done every piece of puzzle and discovered everything there is to discover. I didn't use any help and would guess that I could have finished the game in half that time. So one thing is certain: claims that the game takes almost 100h to completely beat are ridiculous. Unless you require 15m to button your shirt that is.So what does the game have to offer? Without spoiling anything, the game does just as it says in the title. In a sense it makes you the witness of its world. But you really trascend beyond that to become an observer even borderline detective.The puzzles are all based around the concept of drawing lines through grids or mazes, but according to a set of rules that are not written anywhere. Yet you have eleven distinct areas harbouring one or two sets of puzzles meant to introduce one or more rules. This is the way you progress in knowledge and along the ""story line"". And by ""story line"" I mean fulfill the requisits to open up the final area, where you'll be tested on what you've learned. The best part to me though was to discover the nature of the game's secrets and then go hunt them down. Some require you to be incredibely observant, others require you to be patient and some require a complete understanding of all the puzzle types' rules.This game is definitely playing in the same league as Portal and The Talos Principle. It is beatiful, smart and will test you like I have only seen The Talos Principle do.What I didn't like, were the tapes you can find. Their content is mainly boring and feels out of place, because it lacks continuity. But it's not the main course, so who cares? The game would have been the same without, imo. I enjoyed the fact that secrets were catalogued according to areas, so that you can keep track of them, but I didn't like the fact that some of the secrets were hidden in a separate challenge area that is tricky to uncover. Actually, my grief is that it has many exits that you can see and taunt you, but only one well hidden entrance, which requires several steps and conditions to unlock. I would have prefered to have no secret in it. It made the catalogues seem off and foced me to look forever in areas I thought I would find them, while they were actually underground...Final word of warning: do not play this game if you are colour blind or epileptic (obvious I know). Some puzzles rely heavily on colours to be solved and you would just be unable to finish the game. Same goes for deaf people as some puzzles require sound.Conclusion: I enjoyed it, felt it was worth my money, even fully priced (rare for me). I defenitely got a challenge out of it and felt rewarded most of the way with a few eureka moments here and there, which is all that is needed in a puzzle game. I give 9/10			"

												Not a game for everyone. You have to be willing to move on and accept you can't solve a puzzle until you've gathered more information around the island.This game will take some patience, but if you enjoy being stumped, I think this game offers a lot of really great logic puzzles that consistently build on top of each other. Some of the puzzles that depend on abstract concepts (like extracting information from environment art) can feel obtuse, especially in some cases if you are color blind.The art and core mechanics of the game shine incredibly well. Without getting into spoiler territory, the implied story is great if you don't mind having a considerable number of loose ends. I believe the intention is to have thoughtful discussion with friends afterwards about the mechanics and the loose story.			"

												Engaging and brilliant. Like an eye opening walk through a false wood, where suddenly a miniscule pattern of the overall quiltwork becomes obvious to you. You then trace that pattern, and expand it into deeper and more complex systems, slowly piecing together how the entire world works. This is where you get hooked, that excitement of figuring out the next small iteration that you're already oh-so-close to seeing clearly. If you love the feeling of personal discovery, of learning the rules of a system through your own analysis, experiments, and processing, this is a must play. If you're not sure what that means, and are hesitant to pay the full price without knowing, I recommend checking out Blueberry Garden, as it's under $5. If you find yourself enjoying discovering the rules of that world through your own experimentation, The Witness is a massive and much deeper expansion of that feeling.			"

												I can only recommend this game to people who has the patience to stick around for a puzzle in more than 5 minutes. The graphics are beautiful and understanding how to solve a certain set of puzzles is for me a very rewarding feeling. Even if sometimes a puzzle may take 1/2 hour to an hour to crack.The plot is however a really hard nut to crack since it is told by very subtle details seen around the island and through different tapes and videos scattered everywhere.The way the game forces you to rethink the way you think about old solved puzzles in order to understand the rules for later puzzles is something I don't thing iv'e seen in any other game before, almost every detail you see or hear in the game is there for a reason.I would recommend this game for anyone who has the patience for a harder than average puzzle game.

												If you like your puzzles difficult, densely packed, and well designed, the Witness is a wonderful game. Be warned though that if you need story, context, or variety in your puzzle format, the Witness can be to some a tiresome slog. The game has beautiful clarity of purpose across every connected component of the location, puzzles, and mechanics, but that purpose is beautiful delivery of puzzles. There's not much in the game but walking around in silence, and dragging lines across your screen.Its best feature is the difficulty ramp, one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's engagingly difficult, but with variety as well - you at times go from working through a difficult puzzle for 30 minutes to burning through an easy sequence of 5 in under a minute.Throughout the content I've seen (more than 20 hours worth, about a main-story-and-a-half worth of puzzles), the design in the Witness has so far never felt unfair. While I very much liked both the Talos Principle and Fez, they both felt to me like their difficulty spiked somewhat in the later, optional puzzle content. The Witness never has for a moment to me (though admittedly, I'm not done). In addition, the brilliance of the many independent puzzle sequences is that being temporarily stumped is just an opportunity to go explore and solve puzzles elsewhere.Again though, if you need a story, context, or a fundamental variety in mechanics to get you through the 20+ hours of difficult puzzles - and I really wouldn't blame you - best hold off.

												The Witness is likely to be my favourite game of 2016. I love that there is no compromise and hand-holding in the sense that we most often see in modern games. Here you gain knowledge on how to solve the line/maze-puzzles by learning and by trial-and-error. There will be many hurdles on the way for the average player but the best moments in The Witness are found along the road rather than at the ending (which can still be great, given the right conditions, especially for those that have been observant to the buzz around the game during the weeks before launch). I have had goosebumps several times and literally stopped and laughed and applauded towards the screen when figuring out something I had been stuck with for a while. The game design is in this regard second to none. You will feel like a genius.This could probably not have been accomplished by a too large development team, risking that the overall vision would start to diverge. So when stuck, do what you can to avoid spoiling the game by looking up solutions. Go somewhere else on the island and you may find a sequence of easier puzzles that also may lead to revelations for how to solve the ones you left behind. I admit to have consulted a walk-through myself, but after I had first reached the ending and solved almost 500 puzzles. You may solve far less puzzles and will still be able to reach the ending. I am still playing, approaching 600 solved puzzles, due to that there are more of those great moments to be found. The colourful graphics looks pretty as well, running at a smooth 60fps. Then there are all these weird things scattered around the island that together with great sound design (no background music) adds a certain ambience to the experience.In conclusion, The Witness is a rare gem, utilizing the environmental design and other video game-unique features to present you with something truly amazing. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has passion for video games and who can live with it not always being a cake-walk. In truth we will probably not see a puzzle game as good as this one for many years to come.			"

												It looks like Myst. It acts like Myst. It definitely isn't Myst. If you come to this game hungry for narrative, for explanation, for deeper meaning, you will (probably) be disappointed. It is a rumination, a meditation, and a careful, well-metered learning experience, speckled with puzzles and a few hidden secrets. When you bring Myst to the game, it is not the game that fails, but you. I recommend it, but only under the condition that you understand: it's simpler than it might seem, and more beautiful and peaceful for that simplicity.			"

												This is a game that's masterfully done. It hasn't been out for that long, but I have played it for about 30 hours. First thing's first, yes, there's only one kind of puzzle. However, that puzzle evolves in such a way that the puzzle never becomes boring or repetitive. Now, there will be those who might disagree with this, but if you don't want to sit down and solve puzzles, puzzle games aren't for you anyway.The graphics... Oh my God the graphics... So nice to look at. And they don't really need to be for a puzzle game. But this beautiful island they've created affects the gameplay and mood in such a fulfilling way. Really well designed.The secret videos that you collect I absolutely loved, and the different sound bits here and there really makes you want to find more, listen to more, watch more.Now, gameplay-wise I have a few problems which I will be listing down below:1) The sound puzzle doesn't fit into the game. It really sticked out to me like it belonged somewhere else but not in this game.2) The end game puzzles are a bit too complicated, and I think it damages the overall flow of the game in general.3) I believe all your progress shouldn't be erased when you complete the game. I wanted to finish first and then go back for totems, but now that I have lost all my progress I really don't think I will go back to do all those puzzles I have already done, again.Overall, a magnificent game.

												I have more or less ""finished"" this game after 38 hours of playtime. I have some non-puzzle content to wrap up (e.g. hunting down audio logs), but am mostly done with the meat of the game at 515 (out of an alleged 523) puzzles solved. I have achieved both of the games only achievements and experienced what some would call the ""secret ending"".What an excellent game this is.The basic mechanic - the line puzzle - is utilized very well. Maybe half of the puzzles involve symbols on the puzzle panel that you must divine the meaning of in order to proceed. The other half present you with effectively blank slate of a panel and expect you to figure out the pattern it wants you to trace. The line drawing is therefore an input mechanic for puzzles solved ""externally"" from the panel itself just as much as it is a way to solve puzzles that present themselves to you with no frills.The world is split into several puzzle ""hubs"", and from about 5 minutes into the game you are set free on the island to pursue them in any order. Most of them are independent of each other, but a few leverage knowledge learned from other areas. Eventually you will be expected to combine techniques and puzzle language from each hub area in the games most challenging and rewarding puzzles.The island itself is gorgeous and beautifully realized. It is one of the single most meticulously designed video sets I have ever had the pleasure of exploring. Nearly everything on the island is placed with purpose.If I had to complain, it's that the plot is mostly insubstantial; wispy and tenuous. Given some of the messaging within the game itself and the philosophies it describe, this isn't a true negative but I imagine some people will be disappointed. The puzzles and exploring the island are truly their own reward and the very loose narrative provide just a small bit of flavor.If you remotely enjoy puzzles then do yourself the favor of buying this game.

												Not a traditional adventure game.  In The Witness you interact with the environment entirely through puzzle panels which use the maze style shown in the trailer.  The island itself serves as a backdrop, a place to explore to find puzzles, and a place to give clues to those puzzles.  The puzzles are well designed, and every new symbol is introduced with a tutorial area  with one exception (If you find a symbol you have no idea how to deal with, chances are you haven't found that tutorial yet).  I highly recommend the game to puzzle enthusiats everywhere, particularly those who are fans of the pen and paper classics.As a side note:  If you suffer from colorblindness, or are hearing impared, you may not be able to finish the game, and will definitely be unable to 100% it.

												This game is simply stunning - the art style and island itself is a lovely, serene place. The optical illusions and visual easter eggs make exploration a true pleasure and there were a number of times when I just sat back and admired the view. In a time when dark and 'gritty' games are the norm it's also refreshing to see such vibrant colours.The puzzle system can be infuriating and a few times I found myself struggling to make logic leaps or getting answers but not understanding WHY they were correct, but for the most part I thought the tutorial system of puzzle learning was pretty effective and felt very rewarding. The lack of any narration or explanation of what was happening or what you needed to do made the experience extra calming - you really do work at your own pace. You can stop and go to another section without feeling guilty or stressed about how many quests and objectives you have left to complete: the whole island is quite happy to go on without you, and it will all still be there when you're ready to try a section again.If you enjoy puzzles and looking at things that are pretty you should definitely buy this game!

												The Witness is a game of exceptional puzzles... But I would not call it an exceptional puzzle game. The puzzles, and the way this game promotes learning are outstanding. But, the thing about The Witness, is that it's not a traditional ""game"" experience. It focuses entirely on the puzzles, and does not include other aspects you often find in games, like a variety in mechanics, or story. The sole mechanic of the game is interacting with the puzzles, and the entire story is hidden behind the ending. Therefore, your experience of the game will be a loop of finding and completing more puzzles. I have a video discussing this for those interested -

			The Witness is a great puzzle game, but in this video we look at some of the strengths and weaknesses in its design. On this channel, your discussion and feedback is not only welcome, but encouraged!		

The Witness nails what it aims to do. The thing is, what it aims to do is not for everyone. If you are a fan of puzzles (not just puzzle games), I highly recommend playing this game, you will likely love learning about the puzzle rules and experiencing how much there is to discover on the island. However, if puzzles aren't your thing, you may not enjoy playing this one. That said, you still might want to look up some things about the game. Even if you don't enjoy its puzzles, you may find the design of the game fascinating regardless.			"

												The witness is an excedingly challenging game, but not in a fun way. Game that are challenging in a fun way have puzzles that really make you think. Puzzles that challenge your mind to look at a situation in a new way and that leave you feeling acomplished when you finally solve them. The Witness does do this at times, but a good portion of the challenges presented in this don't fit that criteria. Instead of making you think in a new way, they challenge you to be at just the perfect angle to make the puzzle work. You know what needs to be done, you just have to spend 5 minutes getting the exact right spot. Or the puzzle will flash in a series of colors that leaves you with a headache so that you can only do one or two at a time before having to take a break simply because it hurts your eyes. It's not fun, it's frustrating and leaves you feeling upset and argavated because you just want the game to be over!Portal is challenging in a fun way. Myst is challenging in a fun way. The Witness is not. If this game goes on sale for $10 or less, then I'd say go ahead and check it out if you're curious, but the $40 pice is a total ripoff.Edit: Btw, my total play time is actually about 10 hours. Whenever I'd get frustrated I'd normally just leave the game running in the background while I went and did something else. I didn't realize steam would count that as time played.			"

												I went into this game thinking it would be something like an island escape room, like a prettier version of Myst. It isn't. It is a game that manages to be stylistically wonderful, but also focuses on a prime question: Can you become fluent in a language without any outside help?This game is a series of puzzles, but the point is to learn the language of the puzzles. Just like learning a language, you will feel accomplished when completing a task only to faced with an odd colloquialism that feels like it breaks the rules. In the end, each puzzle you finish feels like an victory, and, in the end, you walk away feeling like you actually learned something, like you're better for the experience.I love this game, but it must be stated that this is not Myst or an escape room game. This is something wholely different, something unique and wonderful.			"

												A decent puzzle game with some frustration trying to figure out the often non-obvious puzzle rules with plenty of cleverness within the grid puzzle limitation, and lots of easter eggs; many of which were intellectual and philosophical trash of the smug ""look at how much smarter I am than you"" variety (though some of them were good and some were inoffensive). The best part of the game was the beautiful island and art, the worst parts were the puzzles with timed elements (especially the randomized challenge run puzzle, don't even bother) or required precise positioning to see the solution. Don't get me wrong, I liked the puzzles that require environmental manipulation or positioning to see the solution, that was pretty neat and clever, but certain ones required a level of precision that is extremely challenging, requiring lots of trial and error. If you find yourself hitting a wall, try and look up the defined rules in a guide before just looking up the solutions, as the puzzles tend to build on each other. If you don't fully understand them you may have trouble with later puzzles.Overall, I recommend getting this game on sale if you enjoy tricky puzzles, not really puzzles games as there is little game to this. If you are a Myst fan, I'd warn you that the puzzles are all grid based with little to no environmental aspects, and there's not really any lore or story, just audio logs and videos of philosophical and scientific talks that you could find on youtube.P.S. - Both endings are stupid.

												I was extremely excited for The Witness, having followed its development since it was announced in 2009. I wanted to love this game. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the game that make it pretty terrible in my opinion. First, the island, while hauntingly beautiful, is not really the star of the game. When playing The Witness, you simply move from maze panel to maze panel, and you can pretty much see everything and easily get anywhere you want if you solve nearby maze panels. There's not much of a feeling of adventure or even ambiance. Everything's quiet and empty. After a few hours of playing the island lost its charm and I wished they had just put the puzzle areas right next to each other, or given you a much faster sprint in order to quickly get between puzzles.Second, and more importantly, some of the puzzles are extremely frustrating to the point that they're unequivocally not even the slightest bit fun. I'm not sure whether Jonathan Blow wanted The Witness to have a reputation as an essentially unbeatable puzzle game, or whether he was just a poor judge of how hard the puzzles are.Of course the island has a few essentially impenetrable secrets that nobody will be able to beat without looking at a walkthrough, but you don't need to beat everything to get the ending. What I take issue with is the main series of puzzles that you face frequently and that you need to beat. Some of these puzzles are really clever and require you to be observant of your environment and think. These puzzles have a ""Talos Principle"" kind of vibe that I really like. But the game goes much, much too far in giving you problems to solve with incomplete information.  The most egregious offenders are the maze panels which deal with symbols indicating increasingly complex unspoken rules about how you must solve the maze. These get ludicrously complicated and there's zero explanation in-game about what any of the symbols mean. Somehow people have through sheer brute force divined the meanings of each symbol and shared them with the Internet, and you'll need to cheat and read that info to make much progress. Until you do, you'll wander around the island shut out from most areas. When you do, you'll laugh, because it's so comically implausible that anyone would be expected to figure them out on their own. And it's not just the symbols; the game repeatedly fails to provide the player with enough information to reasonably beat the puzzle. There are dozens of puzzles that don't give you quite enough information to nail down the exact maze path; you'll spend literally hours dragging your mouse guessing different paths because there are many possible permutations or transformations which could all equally well be the solution. Sometimes the game is smart about this and lets you enter a variety of solutions, but that's not always the case. You're going to be clicking and dragging a lot. This is not fun gameplay by any stretch of the imagination.There are some really fantastic puzzles buried in this game, but it's not worth it. I will not sit in front of my computer for hours blindly guessing and probing to make sense of the world. The Talos Principle and Portal/Portal 2 are perfect examples of games which introduce concepts fairly, and have puzzles which are solvable in your head by simply thinking through them. Even if the puzzles get very difficult, there's no dumb trial and error involved. That's the kind of puzzle game I want.			"

												The Witness is one of the most divisive games you will ever encounter. To put it simply, to get satisfaction from the experience you need to be a hardcore puzzle fanatic. I don't mean puzzle fanatic in the traditional sense, either. The hundreds of puzzles scattered across The Witness' beautiful world are relatively one-dimensional. Instead of providing diversity through various methods, it uses only line puzzles. All variation is derived from the rules of these line puzzles, which are indicated by small icons.In total, the game makes no effort to feel rewarding, or even substantiate its world. It's quiet, 100% puzzle focused, and can most be compared to a puzzle book you can find in a store. At $40, it's a risky proposition for the average consumer. In my case, it was a dissasisfactory experience despite the beautiful visuals and polished design.			"

												One of the most mystical, magical and wonderous games I've ever played. The less you've seen of the game and the less you use guides etc the better. The game teaches a whole set of complex machanics all without words and it makes you feel incredibly active and engaged because of that. The game is incredibly open too; stuck on a puzzle perhaps? Just walk away and take in the environment, something new may catch your eye and send you down a new rabbit hole.Easily one of the best games I have ever played; gets a little tedious if you're looking to 100% the game but there are moments here that I wish I could experience for the first time all over again.9.5/10			"

												TL;DR: If you like learning and want to understand the puzzles rather than just solve them so you can move on, than this is the game for you.The Witness is a game that has many challenging obstacles to overcome, but it is also fair if you have done your homework. If you just rush through the early puzzles, it might bite you later in the♥♥♥♥♥ I see the game as metaphor for the process of learning.And it is also an astonishing game set in a beautiful visual and acoustic environment in which you can stop and take a deep breath for a moment to relax your mind after a hard challenge. For me it is not something you want to rush, it is more a game you want to experience with a comfortable pace so you don't end in a state of tunnel vision. And if you sometimes look to your left and right you can discover something amazing that might get you to say “This game!” with a grin in your face. "

												The Witness is a meticulously crafted puzzle game that uses and expands on one single puzzle design concept.Every puzzle in The Witness is solved by drawing a continuous, non-overlapping line from a starting point to an end point. The puzzles start simple, such as navigating a simple maze, and slowly become more complex, adding symbols to the two dimensional puzzle board that changes how the entire puzzle must be solved.The world of The Witness is made up of one entire island, with no loading screens, and many types of environments all co-existing seamlessly. The island contains many secrets and details that you won't notice at first, but slowly over time you will discover their meanings. Puzzles are strewn across the island, typically grouped together with a common theme. You will need to solve simple tutorial-types first, before moving on to harder puzzles. If you get stuck at any point you will typically want to walk around and explore more and come back later. Some puzzles really stumped me for a long length of time, until I came back with a fresh mindset. Many puzzles will require you to use the environment around you, which made things quite interesting. Some of the puzzles in the game had mechanics that I did not enjoy at all, and actually had a very hard time doing. Some mechanics were over-done and tended to not do anything interesting, but still existed in quantity, which became tedious feeling. In many ways I would have preferred less puzzles. For all the others, I really enjoyed them, especially this one area where you are forced to do puzzle after puzzle in order to actually progress forward at all. There are over 500 puzzles, and many are quite difficult, especially near the end of the game. This game is downright challenging, but can be tackled slowly over time.The island is mostly open to exploration, but many areas you will find “locked” until you learn more about how to open them up. Because of your ability to wander the island, it’s entirely possible you find puzzles that are over your head, leaving you the feeling that the game is just too hard or obscure. A person that stumbles upon the puzzles in the perfect order of difficulty will likely enjoy the game much, much more, and find it easier to play through.The game as a whole can feel overly perfected to the point of feeling dead. For example, you can’t even jump at all. Being in a three-dimensional environment without the ability to jump from one ledge to another feels really bad… many times you’ll walk around and get stuck on a corner briefly and have to reposition. That being said, the game isn’t designed for jumping…. If you could jump even a little bit in this game, the entire thing would be broken… this is how specifically crafted everything is. The most interesting thing about the island are the secrets hidden in plain sight... there are a ton of puzzles that can only be accessed if you're very observant or have heard about how to get to them. The entire island is very interconnected which is an amazing feeling compared to level design of every other game. The island's use of colors and patterns is extremely creative, as is the visual play on player ""perspective."" If you’re an experienced player, you can look at any screenshot from the game and pretty much pinpoint where they are on the island based on colors and uniqueness. That’s incredible.Another design choice was to have no background music. I heard about this a lot prior to playing, about how all of the sounds come from you or the island itself. I thought this was clever, but in the end I really feel like a well-crafted soundtrack would have actually benefitted the game. Many times I was stuck solving a puzzle for a length of time, and I would just hear some repeating ambient sounds, which made it feel like I was taking much longer on a puzzle than I actually was. Music would have really set the mood for each area of the island that you visit, as well.The biggest letdown was the lack of a REAL story. There are audio logs and video recordings hidden very scattered around the island, and they seem to talk about more abstract ideas. You will find them so sparingly that keeping them in your mind while playing is pretty much not going to happen. A real narrative would have been appreciated, and would have helped deliver a driving force into completing the game. Currently, your only motivation is to ""solve all the puzzles"" and ""hope to unlock more areas."" Near the end of the game things get interesting, but there ends up not being much meaning at all… the ending of the game was the absolute biggest letdown of the game… a game that takes 20+ hours of puzzles and leaves you going… “is that it?” I got a lot of enjoyment out of The Witness, but it isn’t a perfect game, and in its strive for perfection it comes off not evoking any real emotion or strong feelings. I’m extremely impressed with the design and details of the world, and the challenge that the puzzles bring for how simplistic they are. If you love puzzles and figuring things out, there’s a TON of content here for you. This is the closest game in the style of MYST you will find. If you don’t enjoy those things, then this game doesn’t have anything for you at all.			"

												I always recommended the game just for the amazing artistry and envrionmental design. The colors are outstanding and vibrant. It's almost more enjoyable of a game, just to go walking around and taking in the sights. The main reason I don't recommend the game, is that the puzzles aren't nearly as rewarding enough. The game has a few insightful points to it, where the puzzles do allow you to watch some interesting videos that are, again, insightful.I also give the thumbs down because the cost-to-fun ratio is really off, in my opinion. At most, it's a $20 USD game; so if you are still interested, hold out for a sale. You get dropped into the game without any kind of tutorial or direction. While I can appreciate that; I don't feel like they pulled it off right. I found myself in the 'middle' of puzzle sets all the time, making life much more harder for me. The game does try and 'teach' you how the puzzle sets work, as they're all different, but if you don't start off right at the beginning of a set, you'll have a really big headache.They really missed out on a lot of areas where they could make the game more enjoyable/rewarding; like completing a puzzle changed/restored part of the world, or something, or unlocked more clues/insightful events. Even some kind of Stats; like when I solved a puzle, if it was able to show me how I rated among everyone else that played the game, that would be cool. This game is better off being an IQ Test for the top 100 IQ's in the world. It's pretty hard and it's going to make you think. Get your Advil ready...			"

												Myst, The Talos Principle, Antichamber. If any of those call to you, this game evokes a blend of those.I played for the launch evening far into the night, and will be hungrily back for more. Those ""Eureka!"" moments are a drug.How the game starts - being thrown in the world without as much as a title screen - is the attitude of that game. You are an intruder in its world, and it will not hold your hand, or explain itself to you. And yet the puzzles are paced in a way that lets you decipher what is required of you without much roadblocks.Some people are criticizing this as an elaborate menu for choosing maze puzzles to solve. Those people clearly didn't play it long enough: the environment comes solidly into play as a puzzle element.Beautiful, polished, clever and makes your brain work out. Heartily recommended to any puzzle lover.			"

Posted: February 2, 2016
												There are plenty of reviews explaining positive points about this game, so I'd like to address two specific criticisms having sunk a fair amount of time into it and continually being surprised at how well put together the world is and how satisfying the puzzle solving is:1) 'The Talos Principle did it better, and there was a real story.' I love The Talos Principle, but the games aren't really comparable in design - The Talos Principle, with few exceptions (some of the harder stars) confines its puzzles to very clear boundaries and the levels don't interact with each other. The Witness throws that out the window, with puzzles building together and the player's perspective of the level changing what puzzles are available and solvable. The two games play by different sets of rules.As far as a story goes, I don't really feel like it's lacking in this game. That's not to say that there is a complex or compelling narrative presented, but it doesn't need more than it has. The real narrative is how you the player interact with your environment, and that's sufficient (and certainly better than a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥story shoehorned into the environment would have been)2) 'It's just a bunch of mobile game puzzles in a pretty island.' Anyone who says this didn't get very far in the game. It has a pretty gentle difficulty curve at first, so I can see how you would get that impression. The way the player interacts with the world is via panels with little maze puzzles on them. If you play the first 45 minutes to an hour of the game, it teaches you the first few maze mechanics in quick succession, so that's the main focus. Once you start exploring, it becomes apparent that the mazes aren't really the majority of the puzzles. They're merely how you communicate your understanding of the puzzles' solutions to the game. For example:In the desert area, the main mechanic is reflections. You communicate your understanding by seeing how to complete a maze via bright light shining directly on them. The real puzzle is figuring out how to set up the angles between you and the light sources correctly. In the greenhouse, the main mechanic is colored light changing groups of painted squares that have to be separated in the mazes. The real puzzle is figuring out how to view each maze so that it has a set of colors with a completable solution (and, a step further, using multiple colors to figure out the pigments without being able to see them with unfiltered light). As far as I can tell, the most complex mechanic is how the optional puzzles are baked into the world - the environment itself contains hidden visual puzzles that trigger black obelisks to light up with the area's patterns. I'm enjoying this game a lot. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you like being presented with interesting problems, banging your head against a problem only to realize the solution was right in front of you 20 minutes later, and then being satisfied that you figured it out, this game is really fun. It does a great job of teaching the mechanics to the player, and then pushing your thinking.Also, it's a really pretty.			"

												First and foremost: I have had to base this review on a two hour play time. Reasoning: as of the date of this review: two hours is the maximum play time you can have a game for in order to request a refund if so desired. I desired that refund. Moving on.My criticisms are for puzzles, and gameplay. They are not against style, art, sound, assets etc. If this was a flash game from 5 years ago: I'd have the same concerns as I do now. This was not a relaxing game for meI found this game stressful, and at times frustrating. When I encountered the pathing puzzles: I quickly learned that navigating the maze was simply not enough. There was a particular method that was needed in order to solve all the puzzles in a given set. This makes sense to me. Find the overall method of solving a solution, and you can solve the rest of the puzzles with a little bit of elbow grease. Kind of like a 'teach a man to fish' scenario.But then the game decided that it no longer wanted me to do that. I attempted to solve a puzzle in the manner in which the game had taught me; only to find that it's rules had now arbitrarily changed. Had I misunderstood the rules? Had I just fluked out? Where there rules I was missing?Honestly with the time constraint that I had: I simply had to locate a guide online and use it's solution... And that's when I got frustrated. The solution in the guide was simply an alternate solution than the one I had attempted. RepetitionIn my mind: the worse thing in a puzzle game is repeating the same puzzle over again. By their very nature: the vast majority of puzzle games suffer from a lack of replay value. I get that, and I accept it. We've all played the Portal series, and forced ourselves to forget it so we can enjoy playing it again in 6-8 months.There was a part in my playthrough of this game where I failed to solve a pathfinding puzzle. Instead of letting me attempt again: the game reverted the previous puzzle to a non solved state, and forced me to re-enter that one too. The worst part was that the puzzle was still visibly solved, and I jsut had to trace over what I had already done. Why?The restriction of movement felt like a time-sink mechanic rather than a gameplay mechanicThere is no jumping or crouching. The game is not about physically demanding puzzles, and that's fine. However there are invisible walls everywhere. A minor ledge of say - half a metre - is an impass. It makes me have to walk back and forth between puzzles and areas the long way every time. I get it; the game is gorgeous and you want people to experience the environment. But I couldn't help but feel like I was just a slave to the world's path, and not person taking a place within it.On top of that, your character is slow to move. I found I was constantly holding the shift button to sprint, and my pinky got cramped. He also seems to have this strange acceleration when beginning to move in a direction. Starting off slow, and speeding up. While true to life: it feels out of place and indeed seems to serve no purpose in this particular game.All in all: I do wish I had more time with it - (Thank steam). If these types of issues are not that important to you: then I can reccomend this game. For me: it was simply not what I expected.			"

												If you get through this game without using any guides whatsoever you're probably mensa material or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game gives little direction, sometimes this is annoying but it adds to the mystique of the island. However, maybe I was wrong to exepct this, but I thought it would be a more story driven puzzle game like The Talos Principle or something. I want to know who I am and why I'm solving all these crazy hard puzzles. What did I witness? I just wish the game wasn't so barren of any information, both the puzzles and the story. Don't buy this expecting a story that will keep you solving puzzles, and don't buy it if you don't like challenging puzzles because you'll just get frustrated. The puzzles are well done, but a lot of the time I feel like a good amount of the difficulty comes from ignorance of what I'm trying to accomplish. Sometimes the puzzles that are meant to teach you about new challenges are so small you can complete them by chance. Also, sometimes I just didn't understand a section and had to give up. The island is beautiful and designed very intelligently. I recommend it, if it's on sale.			"

												To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Braid, although I played through the entirety of it. The Witness, on the other hand, is another animal entirely. The game plays as well as it looks, and even the generous screenshots don't really capture how gorgeous this game is. Anyone that writes off this game as ""just line puzzles"" doesn't really get the point of this game. Sure, you interact with all of the puzzles in the same way, but the real purpose of The Witness is the process of solving the puzzles. Even in the first few hours of playing, I must say that some of the ways the game approaches puzzles are downright genius and require not just logic, but creativity, attentiveness to surroundings, and other skillsets not usually emphasized in video games. Interaction with the player is subtle but always fair, so challenges are sometimes tough but never unreasonable.The Witness is a marvel of game design which has already given me more ""A-ha!"" moments than any game in recent memory.$40 is very steep for an indie price tag, but this game really is a labor of love and is oozing deliberate, intelligent design.

												It's a puzzle game with over 600 of very similarly looking 2d puzzles, where you guide a line through a panel. The puzzles are not the same though, far from it. Unlike games like Portal or The Talos Principle, the progression is not expressed as harder puzzles, but different ones. New mechanics are introduced, old mechanics are combined or altered and it goes all the way until the ending. I've only been stuck on two puzzles, one of the two being an optional extra difficult one.Yes, it is pretty much a necessity for an average human being to take screnshots and make drawings, but I don't see a problem in that. This game is well worth the effort. I mean, I'm not even a huge fan of puzzle games, but this one has managed to keep me interested all the way.There are audiologs which carry not so much a plot as much a message this game is trying to convey. I'm far from philosophy, but it makes an interesting point I haven't considered before. Made me look up some reading material, so there's that.Other than that, the game looks and sounds amazing.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. But it really feels like I'm taking a scantron test while sitting in front of a window with a particularly nice view. Except in the scantron test I don't have to keep walking back and forth to each question. Also a test explains the rules of the game before you start.This game feels more like playing football except you weren't told you're allowed to throw the ball, so all you can do is run at all the other guys until something works. It's VERY easy to make something hard and challenging if you don't give any indication of what the player is supposed to do.Perhaps I'm just an idiot, but when the three 'warm-up' puzzles of each section are so brain deadedly simple that when I get to the real puzzles from those rules I still don't understand what the goal is, something is wrong.

												This is an outstanding puzzle game, with a huge depths of puzzles. On top of that, it must be one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.It far outclasses The Talos Principle, which has a similar feel of big world littered with puzzles - it looks better, it has a higher quantity of puzzles, the puzzles are more difficult with more variety and it does all this without explaining anything directly to the player.I personally don't understand the negativity around this game, I assume it's from people that had very high expectations. If you know nothing about The Witness and you are looking for a good puzzle game, then you've found the right place.			"

												If you enjoy programming or want to know how it metaphysically feels to be a programmer, you will love this game. If the prospect of that sounds like a red flag, you'll probably not like it much. The game subtracts all superfluous elements like music, characters, cutscenes, action, etc. to be entirely focused on the game itself and its themes of isolation and self-reflection. It abandons you, but teaches you the rules subtly and subliminally. There is an overarching narrative, but it's subdued and backseated more so in that it's loose enough to be interpretive and allow for self-insertion. An understated masterpiece in game design, everything is meticulously crafted, organized, and positioned to have a distinct purpose with clear attention to freedom. You are completely free to play as you want, going wherever you want at your pace. Though, akin to learning, discovering or creating a programming language, there are foundations that you must know first before building upon further. When you are consumed by the Witness, you learn about yourself, you learn your limits, you overcome them, you learn how to examine problems from different angles, and to reflect on not only your environment but yourself. Personally, I love this game and am proud of what Jonathan Blow has accomplished after so many arduous years. The excruciating detail shows and the experience is surely worth $40. Hell, I would've paid $120.			"

												Phenomenal puzzle game.  It really challenges you, but rewards you for delving pretty deep into how the various mechanics all really work.  The only downside is that if you get stuck on a puzzle (and there are very very many), eventually you'll need to solve it to move forward.  But the internet is there for you if you really can't figure out one of them.			"

												God, I wanted to like this game. I wanted to like it so badly it hurt. I thought Braid was completely incredible, and my god, the art in The Witness! Stunning. Truly visually stunning. But in every other way, lackluster.While there are puzzles and cool things to explore and do outside of the panels, the panels are about 80% of the game. If you like the panels that's obviously not a problem, but if are like me and find maze/line-logic puzzles boring, you're going to find about 80% of the game boring.Perhaps more disappointing, the sense of story and mystery that we got with Braid is nowhere to be found. The audio logs are mostly discussions of science and logic and I found it really lacked the sense of mystery and wonder that you get from, say, The Talos Principle as you explore this dead world and try to figure out what's going on. Maybe it really picks up and has that later, but it wasn't at all in what I played and folks I know who have played much more haven't really found it either.Overall, kind of a disappointing release given the quality of Braid and the style of the game.

												The Witness is a puzzle FPS for the hardcore natured veterans of the genre, although it opens itself to anyone that is willing to surrender to its merciless complexity that is layered with multiple levels of depth in both technical understanding and visual feedback.Unless you are absolutely against puzzles, in which case you would really wish to stay away from its grasp, then you will most certainly appreciate its novel approach in teaching you how to solve the same, relatively simple concept, in more than 430 ways imaginable.Absolutely recommended, and a must-have for diehard puzzle molders.

												The best part about The Witness is when everything for a puzzle clicks, you realize all you need to solve what's in front of you, and you feel like a genius for having thought of it.  This game is essentially an open world series of those moments, boiled down to a science.  It's not for everyone.  The Witness has surprisingly few elements to it, but it is world class at what it does, and not many games do it.  What is it?  Why, making you feel like a clever son of a ♥♥♥♥♥, that's what, but you'll definitely have to earn that feeling.  The most similar game is probably Myst, though I'd be careful to not make too close a comparison, as their approach to puzzle solving is radically different.  There's no question in this game if you have what you need to solve something.If you like puzzles, you'll love this game.  Just keep in mind that the game doesn't try to provide you with much more, other than some pretty scenery and some wanderlust.  There's no music or story to speak of, and there is almost no direction.  Just interconnected puzzles on an open world island that doesn't care if you can figure it out or not.  That needs to sound at least somewhat interesting to you, otherwise this will be a waste of money.  I can't emphasize it enough, you HAVE to enjoy puzzles on a fundamental level to really enjoy this game, and it is oh so worth it if you do.And yes, the whole game uses that line puzzle formula.  It sounds limiting, but it actually makes the game feel a lot more clever and organized than it otherwise would.  I wouldn't let that be a barrier to entry.			"

												It's a game design wet dream of how to subtly implement a whole array of mechanics through increasingly complex, but similar, puzzles. The use of background and scenery to solve puzzles put the biggest smile on my face. Extrensic motivation through exploration helps too. It's nothing but puzzles, some secrets, and a beautiful world. I adore it but I know some people will hate it or not appreciate it (which is absoultely fine!). It's made for the people who smile when finishing a puzzle, who do jigsaws in their spare time, and crosswords when they're bored.			"

												A gorgeous game with a powerful message. The Witness treats you as an intelligent player, rather than triggering a false player perception of intelligence common to many adventure games today. It upholds the idea that everyone possess the innate power to understand anything, given that it is explained well enough. The Witness is thought-provoking, difficult, and absolutely beautiful. Every moment on the island is its own reward. I recommend staying away from online walkthroughs because your relationship and struggle with the game is part of its message.			"

												This is a game of discovery, which makes it difficult to talk about without ""spoiling"" something, so I'll just tell you what it's not:1. It's not an action game (duh).2. It's not an infinite procedurally generated universe (and costs / glitches less too).3. It's not a story-based game (though the lore is real with this one).4. It's not particularly ""generous"" with its rewards. No confetti, no new tools, no cake. Plus, most prizes for solving puzzles are simply doors being opened and the satisfaction of a job well done.5. It's not a jukebox. Don't expect any music in this game.If none of these truths deter you, you just might love this game like I do.			"

												Excellent puzzles, great atmosphere, great game.To elaborate a bit: I like puzzles, but too often puzzles aren't ""fair"".  You solve them by bashing them, by trying a bunch of stuff or you happen into an answer - but you groan because you didn't actually do any interesting thinking, or the correct ""answer"" isn't better than others you've tried.  Out of hundreds of puzzles in Witness, there was only 2 or 3 that I didn't like.  Almost all were fair and many were a real solid level of difficulty. And a few were just amazing: difficult but fair, requiring a combination of lateral thinking, cleverness and deduction.  I really like puzzles where you can solve them through a series of small realizations, rather than just finding the ""whole answer"" all at once - and that was a core feature here.  There was some absolutely beautiful moments in this game.Overall: a puzzle game that belongs in a very short list with classics like Braid or Portal.			"

												The Witness is an absolutely beautifully crafted game, both from an aesthetic point of view and the novel craftsmanship of its puzzles. It’s amazing to see how such a simple idea, drawing a line from one point to another, can be given such mechanical complexity. Taking that one step further and including the very world itself as part of the mechanics is an inspired achievement, one that blew me away when I finally figured it out. However the repetitive nature of the puzzles, coupled with the lack of narrative to drive you forward through those puzzles, makes it hard to keep coming back after a while. The Witness is most certainly a testament to Jonathan Blow’s dedication to perfection in all things he sets out to create however it falls short of acquiring the “must play” status that his seminal title did. Overall I believe The Witness is certainly worth playing, just maybe not to its ultimate conclusion.Read my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2016/02/05/the-witness-the-world-is-but-a-puzzle-for-you-to-solve/ "

												This is a game full of engaging, difficult puzzles and gorgeous art direction.It is also a game that is comes across as smugly content with its philosophizing, believing that it's much more profound than it is*, in a way that I found intensely irritating. It wasn't enough to sink my enjoyment, but it came close. It hints at mysteries and some sort of narrative, but in the end it's just a set of empty symbols to project onto rather than anything coherent. It's not what I had hoped for in those regards.Basically, the actual gameplay is satisfying enough for me to recommend it even though if it had a face it'd look exactly like Martin Shkreli.*It's possible that it just went whooshing over my head, but I don't think so.

												So I thought I'd buy The Witness to kill some time before the new Tomb Raider comes out. It looked a little like Myst which I really enjoyed. Well, 3 days and who knows how many cups of tea later I'm into the 14th hour of gameplay, finished about 200 puzzles, got 2 lasers going for now, discovered a hidden theatre room, and some interesting recordings about science and a boat, I can only speculate about what's next and I don't want it to end! The graphics are stunning, the island is a very sunny place which is nice because the weather outside is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this winter. I take my time solving puzzles, walk away from more difficult ones but eventually figure out what to do which is very satisfying. Occassionally I need to make some notes or take some screenshots which is great because it actually feels like conducting some investigation. Although I haven't experienced any issues the game already got 3 updates and I can see that the developer is involved in the forum and passionate about his product. And it shows in the game. So I'm truly sorry Miss Croft, but you'll just have to wait your turn!			"

												The Witness is, in my opinion, one seriously well made game.This is a game that relies on you and your ability to solve problems where no solution is ever given to you, but instead must be achieved through inductive and deductive reasoning. From the start, the idea is simple: Draw a line from point A to point B. Every puzzle in this game follows this one mechanic, and that may turn some people off. But in a sense, Super Mario Brothers only had two whole mechanics: running and jumping, but it's what you do with those mechanics that makes for satisfying gameplay. And boy are these mechanics satisfying.The gorgeously and painstakingly detailed island is host to many distinct sections, each one dealing with new mechanics that get added on to the ""A to B"" style of the puzzles. Perhaps there are symbols on the board whose rules must be learned by the player, or perhaps the environment itself contains hints as to the solution. There is never quite as good a feeling as when you finally understand the rule of a challenging puzzle. It's a moment of ""Wow I can't believe I didn't think of that, it seems so obvious now!""In fact, as the game world is freely open to exploration, I sometimes stumbled upon puzzles that I simply didn't have the knowledge to solve. But where there is a difficult mechanic, there is an area of the island that has simpler puzzles for this mechanic that allow you to learn the rules for yourself. This type of gameplay feels alot like when you reach an area of an RPG where the enemies are much tougher than you, and then coming back when you have gotten stronger. But rather than leveling up a character, returning to tougher areas means coming back with new knoledge that you have acquired for yourself, and that is a very satisfying feeling.It wouldn't seem like much really, if the world wasn't beautifully crafted and a joy to wander through. Every area is distinct both in its' puzzle mechanics and its' visual flair. While there is no conventional story pulling you through the game, I found myself excited at the thought of finding a new perspective illusion located in the games world, from calm water reflecting rocks to form faces, to statues interacting with shadows in clever ways, to faces hidden in the outlines of the branches of trees. This world is perhaps the most preciously constructed world in gaming. Everywhere you look you see new illusions or beautiful landscapes dotting the island. Many people have complained, thinking that this game is based solely on these panels of puzzles and that this gameplay couldn't possibly hold their interest for long, and that is true, this game is certainly not for everyone in its' slow, deliberate pacing. But to say that this game has nothing else to offer besides puzzles on panels is patently false. I won't tell you what else there is to this game, as the beauty of it does come from discovering stuff on your own, but let me tell you that I was floored by the detail placed into every aspect of this island. From clever mechanics all evolving from one simple ""A to B"" style to the gorgeous game world, devoid of music and calming to journey through, The Witness is a fantastic experience, but only for those willing to figure out the path for themselves. This is a game that does not hold your hand in any way, and you as the player must be willing to think and learn for yourself. I very much appreciated this mature approach to game design, which is in stark contrast to many games with necessary tutorials due to the complexity of the controls. This game does away with complex controls, and instead decided on one main concept and creates a full experience around it.			"

												Allow me to preface my review with a commentary directed at many of the highly rated negative reviews currently on the store page. It worries me greatly that so many people put so much stock in reviews that very obviously let their expectations drive the review. I hope that potential buyers read a generous number of reviews (both negative and positive) and gauge the contents. If your tastes match those of the reviewer, a subjective review will probably resonate with you. If not, try and view it from an objective standpoint. That being said... Let me put something bluntly, and in brief.If you are not the type who could lean back and listen to instrumental music and dream up worlds of your own, this game might not be for you.If you like clear stories being told for you and to your face, this game might not be for you.If you believe that a good game has explosive action, this game might not be for you.If you dislike sitting in silence and letting your thoughts flow free, this game might not be for you.The Witness is a cerebral game, as much about curiosity and self-reflection as it is about exploration and seeking clarity. It is not a successor to Myst. It is not trying to compete with The Talos Principle. I'd even go so far as to say that, despite some very obvious similarities, it tries to break free of Blow's previous work, Braid, and does not try to emulate the cryptic secrets of Fez. The game (I'm tempted to call it interactive art) deserves to be considered on its own merits before being compared to experiences that may seem similar to it. As does any other game. Indeed, the exploration of the game and the thick atmosphere of the world evokes thoughts of the desolate and empty worlds of Myst. Its single mechanic echoes the central element of time manipulation in Braid. The ""first person puzzle solver"" moniker can also be applied to The Talos Principle. But The Witness is different. Its core mechanic, the sliding puzzles shown many times over in the gameplay trailer, is not the game's primary draw. It is only the first of many layers, a conduit through which you engage in a dialogue with the world you explore, a sun-bathed island seemingly abandoned ages ago.As you take your first steps from an ominous dark room into the glaring sunlight of a quiet garden of strong colours, you are left naked with nothing but the wind in your trees as your companion. Even before passing the first gated puzzles into the open world ahead, you a greeted by choice. While one has an obvious immediate impliciation, the other does not. What is its repercussion? You don't know. The thought lingers, and the moment you are released onto the island you are made free to follow the trail to its conclusion. Or perhaps the harbour town you see in the distance as you find an overview. Or the doorway, tucked neatly behind a few bushes, unseen as you pass by the first time. This urge to explore and see every part of the island, the effects of choices made and the many vistas and vignettes, all come together to form yet another layer of the game.Before long, you will encounter tape recorders scattered about the island, containing quotes from notable figures of our own past. This is not some pretentious attempt at being philosophical or artificially raise the class of the game. The clips, as with every feature of the island, have been particularly chosen to make you think. About the puzzles. About the island. About how you, as the player, perceive what may have transpired and how you view the world and its mysteries - yet another layer of The Witness. This is when something becomes clear. Every rock, every tree, the dancing shadows, and running streams have all been placed with meticulous, deliberate precision. You will return to previous scenery, time and time again, and notice something new. Lessons learned in your travels will open your mind to impressions that may have never occurred to you otherwise.This exploration and cycle of increasing depth is an important part of The Witness' narrative. This game is not about the puzzles, however obvious they may seem. The puzzles are a means to an end. The puzzles, and the always cryptic revelations they lead to, allow you to draw your own conclusions. This is the beauty of the game, and why it stands out in comparisons.Players who delve single-mindedly into the puzzles, enforcing their own Metroidvania view into the many and complex puzzle rules, are likely to overlook the shifting perspectives and obviously deliberate constellations in play.Players expecting a Myst-style relevation from the precious but fragmented voice and video clips will leave wanting.Players expecting the frivolities of dialogue or humour to break the tedium of puzzles have entirely missed the point.This game is for the patient. The meticulous. The explorers. The ponderers. The listeners. The dreamers.In many ways, this game defies categorisation while integrating elements of many well-known games. Above all, however, it is most definitely a Jonathan Blow creation. If nothing else, this tells you three things: everything is deliberate, you are only limited by your own mind, and the story is yours - through and through.			"

												The positive:I love the estethics, I love the puzzles, I hate that its over. These guys have created a wonderful world filled with tons and tons of puzzles. The level design is near-perfect, the way the game teaches you how to solve the puzzles, the gating is done without more than 3 symbols showing you how steer and look around. Which you do alot of in this game and the way the game rewards you for being observant and watchful is great. There were only a handful of puzzles that I would never have understood ( I got help with 3 of them ) and I got 460 puzzles and some more. This game is for anyone that enjoys the feeling of solving a problem that you never would have understood in the beginning but learned as you played the game.The negative:I didnt understand the Journal stuff, like at all. That doesnt mean its bad but more that its never explained what it could mean.			"

												Do you enjoy puzzles? Logic, mazes, even sudoku? Have you ever played/enjoyed Myst? If so, you'll probably love The Witness.The game is amazing. There are countless puzzles, and it's up to you to find them on the huge island, and to solve them.You will get stuck. You will stumble. You may need to get a pen and paper to write notes, and to try to work out puzzles.You may get to a point where you want to slam your head against the wall because you found a puzzle that is too hard for you to understand.That's ok. That's part of the game. You aren't expected to have all the answers right away.Go to a different part of the island, solve some other puzzles, and eventually you will be able to come back to the puzzle with a fresh perspective and understanding, and wonder ""Why was that so difficult before?"" This is a game for puzzle lovers. That frustration is part of the enjoyment. Because the ""Aha!!"" moment is the ultimate reward. This game is full of those aha moments. The Island itself is fascinating, and wondrous to explore, discovering new bits of knowledge to add to the puzzle language.If you are impatient, easily angered, hate puzzles, or just can't stand being stuck.. Then this game isn't for you.The Witness is a puzzle journey. It's about solving puzzles, but it feels so much more than that. It's an experience.			"

												Much, much cooler than it seems like it's going to be, but it takes a while to get there. This game is long and hard. Most people who aren't enjoying it seem to have stopped well before the end, which is understandable. But, if you stick with it, this game gets much more interesting.			"

												I put a ""yes"" on the ""Do you recommend this game?"" box, but it should come with a disclaimer. This game is not for everyone. It's not like Braid; you can't just jump into it and go. The Witness is a lot more like MYST or other older puzzle games, where it's entirely puzzle and no action. All of the puzzles are done on grids and they involve creating lines on these grids. There are rules however, and sometimes you have to get very, very creative. The environment interacts with the puzzles and you have to put the two together in a way that will not always make sense at first. A lot of people are saying that the puzzles are not rewarding due to no big ""ah ha!"" moments, but I find that this isn't entirely true. There aren't any 'big' moments where everything falls into place, but the game does provide an enjoyable slow burn that is fun to just spend an afternoon digging into. It's not a short game, by any means (I've played about 10 hours and only activated three out of seven lasers). The high price tag reflects the amount of time you will spend in The Witness. My only complaint is that, so far, the plot/narrative elements are vague, far apart, and unrewarding. There's clearly a lot going on on the island and I don't think I've missed much, but I get the feeling that lots of people will never even come across a single story element. Good thing that the puzzles themselves are plenty fun on their own.			"

												The Witness is a puzzle/exploration game with a special focus on perception and perspective. It starts out simple, easing you into the mechanics of the game, but before long you'll be juggling multiple puzzle mechanics that you've learned hours or days ago to try to unlock new areas or ""complete"" already discovered areas.During the process of playing the game, you're basically being taught a puzzle language and the game constantly tests you to see whether you've understood the rules correctly. With the exception of one specific challenge, there's always at least one logical solution, so if you feel like something's impossible to do, it's usually best to look elsewhere or revisit the area that teaches you the skills and mechanics involved in whatever you're having trouble with.Except for one challenge, which could be considered the final boss of the game (and is an absolute blast to complete), The Witness features no music, allowing you to concentrate on understanding the game world and learning the puzzle language, or just take in the breathtaking sights of the island.If you've enjoyed games like Myst or Fez, you'll be happy to hear that The Witness is their lovechild, only prettier, smarter and even more full of surprises. And if you get a kick out of moments of epiphany where you go ""A-ha! That must be how this works!"", you'll not be able to put this one down for quite a while.			"

												This game lives and dies by its puzzles. I'm sure it's a great game, but it all just feels... hollow, empty and dreary, despite the colourful presentation.Just because you liked The Talos Principle, it won't mean you will like this game. On the contrary, you might find The Witness somewhat dull in comparison.I'll give this game another spin way into the future, but for now I'll have to pass. "

												This is one of those reviews where Steam could use a ""Maybe"" button...As a long-time fan of the Myst series, I was eager to play this game.  It is absolutely gorgeous and very imaginative with a uniquely beautiful art style.  However, while the puzzles are cleverly designed with some lateral thinking required, each and every one is a line maze puzzle - and there are over 600 of them.  I don't wish to knock the ingenuity of this title and for those who enjoy maze puzzles, it's a must-buy, but if you were hoping for a better variety of puzzle types instead of the same line-through-maze concept, this isn't one you'll likely enjoy.Unsure?  I recommend that you give it a try because, on Steam, you have two hours to decide if this is a game for you.  For me it wasn't, so was given a refund.			"

												Don't let this game fool you into thinking it's only a gaggle of placemat-puzzles. It's a vibrant, dazzlingly gorgeous game with an intricately detailed world!It can be very difficult - but you are given free reign of the island and can wander as you please. Stuck? Take a stroll through the cherry blossoms, or eye the beautiful crystal ocean. Go somewhere else, and explore enigmatic gardens or stately ruins. It's much more obscure than Myst (which had journals to explain all the vagueness). Nonetheless, The Witness gives you an extra sense of achievement, not only from solving its puzzles, but from developing your own theories as to what is really going on.There's no music, so you might wanna stick something on in the background if (like me) it helps you think! The lack of the more traditional gameplay elements adds to the atmosphere very well. There's no tutorial, no HUD, no hand-holding. Just a fully-immersive experience. Definitely play on highest graphical settings if your computer can handle it. It's so damn pretty!I honestly thought I would dislike this game... I'm so glad I gave it a chance!			"

												Whilst at times a little pretentious, this is an amazingly vibrant and challenging little puzzle game that also plays with questions of perception and the very idea of puzzle solving.Luckily it's still very enjoyable at a basic puzzle level. I would encourage you to play without reading up on the game too much as the very existence of some puzzles could be considered a spoiler, and the experience of learning things and applying them is very much at the core of the game. If you get stuck though, seeing a symbol you have never seen before it might be worth exploring the island some more and coming back later - most symbols are introduced via a bank of simple puzzles that let you experiment to find out the rules of said symbol.

												I usually don't write reviews for anything, but my god, this game is amazing. The world is absolutely beautiful, and there is so much to it. Some people may stray away because it is basically the same puzzle over an over again, but the creators somehow made each puzzle fresh, new, and even more complicated then the last. This game made me hate myself, this game made me hate the game, this game made me love myself, this game made me love this game.*Puzzle Spoiler*My favorite experince in this game was a certain series of puzzles. The game taches you as you go, so I had figured that I had figured out the point of the puzzle, outlining the rocks in the water, so I came to a single rock in the water. No matter how much I outlined it, it still didn't work. As it turns out you don't have to be looking directly at the puzzle to solve it. The rocks I was suppose to outline were to my right, and I had to look at just the right angle to see them. Once that puzzle was done I move to the last puzzle of the series, and using my newfound knowledge, I looked at the rocks in all different angles, but I still couldn't solve it. Finally, I figured it out. I had to look at the puzzle backwards, and outline the trees, not rocks. This was one of many experinces I've had the pleasure of having thanks this game.This game is worth every penny I spent on it.			"

												3 hours into the game and I'm just not feeling it.  There is a sense of stagnantation to the game,  I think part of the problem may be due to the randomness of the puzzles scattered all over the island, There is no rationale or reason as to why these puzzles exist in the particular context. They just feel randomly scattered and makes no sense. Because of this, there is no real feel of progression.I am not really motivated in continuing further, which is partly due to the fact that I get nauseous after a short period of play time. The other would be the fact that I'm just not engaged by the promise of mystery and wonder of the island. At least not enough for me to brave the nausea. Some may find the appeal in solving the puzzles strewn across the island, but I'd probably have trouble keeping my lunch in much less finding solutions to the puzzles.note: it would probably help to have animation cues when certain puzzles are solved as to be able to determined what some of the puzzles achieved. I had an instance where, when after I solved a puzzle, I was wondering what had happened. A little back and forth and looking around (not good for the nausea), and I then only noticed a gate opened.			"

												I like first person puzzle games. Portal, Portal 2 and The Talos Principle were all great games, while Qube and The Ball were pretty good. The Witness, however, is a mixed bag. I'd have preferred to give it a neutral rating, but on balance my feelings are more negative than positive, hence the thumbs down.Anyway, you're a guy, or maybe a girl, I don't know, who is stuck on an island for some unknown reason, and you've got to solve some puzzles in order to do ... something. There is no story whatsoever, no explanation for who you are, or what you're trying to achieve. And without going into spoilers, the ending is a total anti-climax. Well, okay, as long as the puzzles are fun, that's the most important thing, right?The first several hours of my time in The Witness were extremely frustrating, because compared to those other games that I mentioned above, The Witness does a terrible job of explaining its mechanics and concepts to the player. I'm not complaining about difficulty. I don't mind being stuck on a puzzle for a while, as long as I've got an idea of what I'm supposed to be doing. There's a difference between understanding the rules of a puzzle, and actually finding the solution. The best puzzles are easy to understand, but challenging to solve.In Portal 2, the first time I stepped on the orange gel and ran face first into a wall, I immediately understood ""this stuff makes me run fast"". In The Talos Principle, when I see a laser beam shooting out of a wall, I immediately know ""I need to redirect the beam to activate something"". The Witness does have some puzzles like that, where you need to observe clues in the environment. The first time I saw a console partially obscured by the shadow of a tree's branches, I immediately knew ""draw a line that doesn't touch the shadow"". Some puzzles have objects blocking part of the grid, and its obvious that solving the puzzle depends on standing in the correct place to get a better view. And there are some puzzles that have multiple solutions, which unlock different paths in the world around you. That's kinda cool, and its easy to understand ""if I want to go over there instead, I need solve this puzzle a different way"".But the vast majority of The Witness' puzzles revolve around coloured dots and symbols. For example, when there are differently coloured dots, you draw a line to separate the colours. Okay, great. Now here's a triangle. And now there's a star. And here's a white thing with three lines. But what do those symbols mean? The game doesn't tell you. You just have to draw some lines on the grid in a random direction until something works, and then try to understand why it worked. Its not really a case of working it out with logic, but more a case of trying to guess ""what was the developer thinking here?"". And quite often I ""solved"" a puzzle without understanding what I actually did.Sometimes a little bit of hand holding can be a good thing. Its like if you give me two numbers and specify whether you want me to add, subtract, multiply or divide, I'll give you the correct answer because I understand the rules of maths. But if all you give me is the two numbers, there's a crucial piece of information missing, so what am I supposed to do?Some of the concepts have ""training"" puzzles, but because you can wander around the island in any direction, you will probably find the more difficult puzzles first. I must have encountered about a dozen tetris block puzzles, which confused the hell out of me, before I finally found the area with those training puzzles. Yeah, I understood the concept after that, but you're supposed to give the player the easy puzzles FIRST. Introduce a concept, then build more complex puzzles around it later.I eventually resorted to reading a community guide which explains the rules of each type of puzzle without giving specific solutions:  


Puzzle Rules Guide (No Solutions) 
A Guide for The Witness
By: vernanonix

			Be warned: This guide may ruin some of your experience of this game. Sometimes it's hard to figure out how the mechanics in this game work. So here's some help.		


 After that, I started to enjoy the game a little. Some of the late game puzzles are especially mind bending, combining multiple concepts into the same puzzle, or just laid out in a really complex way. And although every puzzle requires you to draw a line through a grid, there is plenty of variety to stop it becoming boring. But unfortunately it was too late to forget that initial frustration.Another thing that annoyed me is that some of the puzzle grids will deactivate if you fail to solve them correctly. This forces you to re-draw the line on the previous puzzle grid, to re-activate the one that you failed. Imagine being stuck on a puzzle, failing it dozens of times, and before you can attempt it again, having to re-do the previous puzzle over and over again (the previous puzzle doesn't change, so you just have to draw the exact same line again). The store page says that the game ""treats your time as precious"", but this is the exact opposite, a completely unnecessary waste of my time.The game doesn't have any major problems from a technical point of view. I didn't suffer any bugs or crashes, and I got a constant 60 FPS at max settings on my GTX 770. The art style is pretty I guess, but I've always cared more about story and mechanics. You can't rebind keys though. Okay, the only key other than movement is ""run"", which is bound to shift, but I prefer to use end to run in other first person games, so the position of my hand felt unnatural. There's no excuse for a PC game in 2016 to not allow key rebinding.My recommendation is to skip The Witness, and play something better instead.			"

												The WItness is one of the best games I've ever played. It's crushingly difficult at times, so I recommend moving on to other areas of the island if you get stuck. Don't try and rush the game: take breaks if you are tired or frustrated and come back to it when you feel refreshed. The beauty of the game for me is how it teaches you concepts non-verbally, and those concepts turn into a language that you build upon from first principles until you're solving much more complicated puzzles than you ever expected to. It felt like playing a Metrodvania game, except instead of gaining new abilities to access new areas you gained knowledge of concepts to solve puzzles.In the end I felt like the whole experience was a meditation on learning. I thought a lot about how I learn personally, and that was truly profound. Highly recommended.			"

												It's by far one of the most clever puzzle games I've ever played. The puzzles start out fairly simple, and you're left to your own devices to figure out each new rule and concept introduced with new puzzles. At times you'll need to pull out a pen and paper to solve your way through a particularly difficult set, but when you solve each series of problems with increasing difficulty, it only makes it more rewarding.The story is largely symbolic, and most of it is only hinted at through environmental cues, audio clips, and intentional placement of objects. The best way I can describe it without spoiling anything at all, is that the story is about an abstract concept. Since abstract concepts are hard to describe directly, the best way to describe them to someone is through bits and pieces of information that at first seem irrelevent. These small pieces of information may seem abstract in and of themselves, but they slowly come together, leading you closer and closer to an epiphony that was (hopefully) intended.At it's core, it's a puzzle game. Exploring the world reveals nothing more than clues into the story. The world is so detailed that every item feels deliberately placed, but sadly very little interaction with the world actually takes place.			"

												This game is great.  Unlike a lot of other puzzle games, it isn't just a linear slog through an endless line of puzzles.  It's a lot like a metroidvania in that you need to explore and discover new things to progress, but the things you are discovering aren't powerups, they are knowledge about how the puzzles work.The atmosphere is great and the setting really lends itself to very relaxing exploration and puzzling.You should also know: these puzzles are hard.  If you aren't very good at puzzles usually, you probably will be very frustrated by this game.  There's a lot of logic in the puzzles you are probably going to have to take notes or sketch things out on paper at some point.			"

												The Witness is a game where you wander around an island solving cryptic puzzles. It's really good and I love it.I bought this game completely blind and my immediate first impressions were how breathtakingly beautiful the world is. Stepping out into the open of the island for the first time was a chilling experience. It's easily understandable why Jon Blow took so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to create this game. The design behind the game works so well. *[en.wikipedia.org]The actual puzzles wouldn't find themselves out of place in a free mobile puzzle game, but the island adds entire new dimensions to the solutions. The answers are integrated into the environment in a surprisingly varying number of ways. The deceivingly simple puzzles are kept fresh throughout. Sometimes, like a Metroidvania, a simple puzzle will be impossible to solve until you explore elsewhere and learn how to use the new mechanic, helping you further uncover the secrets of the world of The Witness.The game will never explicitly explain the mechanics of the puzzles to you. You are left to decipher the island on your own. I wish I could describe some of the ways you need to solve the puzzles in this game, but of course, that’d ruin the experience of finding it out for yourself and feeling like a genius. So just trust me. It’s an incredibly creative game.This is an easy choice my 2016 game of the year.Of course, this kind of game isn't for everybody, but if you have the slightest interest in the concept of 'wandering around an island solving cryptic puzzles' sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend The Witness.

												The game fails to strike the balance between being challenging enough to give a sense of accomplishment whilst being easy enough to not be tedious or frustrating. The puzzles are fairly simplistic whilst challenging, the key is to figure out the rules behind them (typically indicated by symbols) and there are areas across the map that serve to introduce these rules to the player. This is a great mechanic to motivate a player to explore.Unfortunately, I feel that the puzzles are ultimately not fun or particularly satisfying and due to their difficulty easily get tedious. It can't be compared to the fun and interactive physics puzzling of games like Portal 2.Story, well didn't play sufficiently yet to say, but you're basically just thrown flat into the game without any explanation whatsoever. Perhaps that's part of the mystery, I don't know, but it's certainly not gonna keep most players intrigued since the story element (at least for now) is largely absent.Graphics are pretty, but optimization is rather poor. Overall, an interesting game that's worth trying but NOT FOR ITS CURRENT PRICE ($35-40). That's  why I can't recommend this game. The presentation with the visuals and all is nice but the novelty wears off and at its core it's still a shallow indie game that priced like a triple-A title.			"

												This is one of the greatest *games* I have ever played. It's a game you can truly get lost in, with a definitive meditational quality to it. Some of the puzzles are really hard, and you *will* get stuck. Luckily the game is extremely nonlinear: you can always move on to another puzzle and come back later with a fresh mind.This game teaches you how to solve puzzles without using spoken language, opting for symbols instead. Your inner grammarian will connect the dots little by little and by the end you can solve any puzzle using just logic and the new language you have acquired.The island this game takes place in is extremely beautiful and rewards exploration. The island is divided into smaller themed areas with great variety between them.Most of the negative reviews seem to stem from either misplaced expectations coming from Braid or the lack of story through dialogue. It is a solitary experience, which works very well in a puzzle game like this. The statues around the island tell their own kind of story, but if you just breeze past them you might miss it completely.Essential purchase for any puzzle game fans.			"

												Sometimes brilliant things come out of restrictions to a form. You can see them in some of the classic early video games, in art, and in film. In the Witness they decided very early on to restrict their puzzle to the basic panels you see in previews for the game, but the brilliance is in the way they've taken the idea to its absolute peak. The puzzles in this game are inventive, challenging, and somehow manage to be varied. If you're at all interested in subtle game design, The Witness is rich in undertones and manages to both effortlessly and wordlessly guide the player to solve extremely difficult puzzles.This game differs from other classic adventure puzzle games in that it is almost entirely distilled gameplay. There is little narrative carrying you along, and although there are voiced pieces in the game, most of them are about the human mind rather than any story. For the most part, the game leaves you to pull your own meaning out of it.The Witness is not for everyone. If you love puzzles for the sake of puzzles, I don't think you'll find a game with more challenging and clever puzzles than this game. The island, in its isolation, ambience, and beauty, is a solitary retreat. You could equate the experience of this game to sitting down with a sudoku puzzle at the kitchen table on a rainy Sunday morning, a cup of coffee to your right and raindrops pitter-patting against the window.

If you are even a little bit, I wish you all the luck in the world with this game. Took me around 19 hours of solid mind-bending play to finish this game, and the difficulty ramped up about every half hour of my playthrough. The end game does not mess around at all, so please be warned, but the feeling of accomplishment when you finally finish this game cannot be put into words. Hopefully John Blow will take a little less time with his next project, but I am looking very much forward to playing whatever comes next.			"

												Witness to sum up - irritatingly repetitiveI thought this would be great.. Seein the trailers, the art style and me being a puzzle game fan. The game started well, puzzles were intriguing, the world was awesome with scale and graphics. As the game goes, puzzles get challenging which is really a great part, but there is a line between challenging and infuriating. Challenging but fair is one kind, but challenging and irritating is another. Here its the second kind, because the puzzles get overly repetitive after a point, same kind of puzzle again and again, and what do you get for completing it ? Same more difficult puzzle again. Also another big problem is there is no puzzle variety, only mazes with different rules. That adds to the irritating nature of the game.There is no music, no rewards for finishing puzzles, collectibles are dumb and doesnt make sense. Instead of feeling proud, satisfying for completing puzzles, they feel like a chore just to complete and get over with it. I thought atleast story will start to unfold but thats a no over there also.

												The Witness it's not a simple videogame. It's an actual piece of art, a journey who can really teach you something about life itself and how a simple matter of perception can change everything in the world around you.Do a favor to yourself and play this fantastic trip inside your brain. Thank you Blow for this masterpiece!●────			"

Exploration and PuzzlesDo you enjoy logic puzzles involving rules, patterns, symbols, geometric shapes, process of elimination, drawing lines, sudoku etc.? If you don't you can forget about The Witness, if you do then read on.If there ever was a game designed to be best experienced completely blind it's The Witness, so if you already have a strong feeling like this might be your kind of game, I'd recommend you to stop reading and go play it.I went in knowing nothing more than that it was some kind of puzzle game and I'm glad I did, but from a consumer perspective I think it's worth knowing that every single puzzle in the game is some sort of grid or node tree, where the solution is to draw a path through it according to the logic used in the particular puzzle.This means there's not a huge variety in the base type of puzzles, and the variety instead comes from the many different logic rules found throughout the game. It also gives the game a great sense of cohesion as a lot of it builds upon your previous understanding of the logic and virtually all of the rules can be used together to make new puzzle combinations.Exploration is also a big part of The Witness. Exploring the island, exploring for puzzles, exploring and learning the puzzle rules. The game is completely open—if you manage to figure out the rules of a puzzle on your own nothing stops you from progressing—and there's very little handholding.That's not to say the game is obscure or unfair, on the contrary all of the rules have great introductions, but the progression isn't linear so just because you come across a puzzle doesn't necessarily mean you're supposed to know how to solve it. If you get stuck it's better to explore in a different direction and come back later, maybe you'll have a better understanding of the rules, or maybe you'll notice something you didn't the first time.This is where a bit of a gameplay issue comes in, in that there's no real map or navigational system present most of the time. Some kind of in-game camera/snapshot function and maybe a simple map that allowed for notes would have been nice, now you'll have to make do with a pen, notebook and some grid paper (which I'd recommend having handy anyway for a few of the more advanced puzzles.)But the island isn't really all that big. My sense of direction is absolutely terrible, and I even I had no problem navigating after crossing it a couple of times. It does mean you'll be trekking back and forth a bit however, so I would advise against playing this if you're feeling pressed for time or find yourself wanting to rush through it, as you won't have a good time.The aesthetics of the game are gorgeous, and the technical aspects are pretty good. You can stand virtually anywhere on the island and look in any direction and get a colorful, picturesque, serene, postcard-worthy scenery. The game environments are all very well-designed too, often integrating cleverly with various puzzles or providing clues on how to solve a particular puzzle, and the island has plenty of landmarks and visual cues helpful for navigation.As for the story, there is none. There's plenty of curious and mysterious imagery on the the island, but you can only look and wonder and come up with your own theories, the game will tell you nothing. Scattered throughout are audio/video logs which are mostly thoughts and musings of various historical people on the topics of philosophy, religion and science. Interesting and thought-provoking, or just pretentious, depending on how you're inclined to feel.I would have loved something more conventional, a mystery unraveled along with with the puzzles, and although it's a fine game even without it, be aware that you'll mostly be puzzling for the puzzles' sake and exploring for exploration's sake, as there's little other reward for it. Considering this I would recommend not peeking at any guides or reading too much about it if you intend to play it, or it would all be rather pointless.Either way the beautiful environments, puzzle integration and the audio logs provide a great atmosphere and contemplating tone and elevates the experience to something much greater than what could have just been a series of IQ tests.

												Before venturing into this game, I will warn you, as have many others by now, that this game has absolutely nothing to offer in terms of lore, story, characters, or any narrative elements to speak of.  This game is comprised solely of puzzles and explorations. That which it has, is done masterfully, but don't go in expecting it to be something it's not. The central core of the game is about learning. EVERYTHING in the game, every maze, every obstacle, even the environment is a constant and concerted effort to teach the player. The problem, at the start of the game, is that the player does not yet understand the language in which the game operates. So it is the task of the player to, essentially, learn how to learn. How to listen and how to read, to be open to new and challenging concepts, and how to apply them to the world around you. This is the central experience of the game, and it is done beautifully well. If you allow the game to teach you, and you put your mind to work at it, this is a game that can be, and very much should be, completed without outside help or guides, because of how important your sense of discovery and understanding is to the experience of the game. The landscapes of the island are gorgeous, and while the game does not have a soundtrack, the sounds of the natural world around you inspire a stronger atmosphere of introspection. The environments are varied and gorgeous, and the architecture is thoughtful and detailed. Every inch of the game screams with attention to detail, no space is wasted, nothing is without intent and purpose. Every aspect of the game works together to create a truly wondrous experience. Perhaps my only complaint about the game is that one or two smaller sections of puzzles felt like they progressed with a somewhat unfair / disappointing form of difficulty, that just felt cheap and unimaginative. However this was a very small and specific set of puzzles, and is not a complaint I had anywhere else. The ""main path"" of the game is about 20 hours long, for a game like this, I feel like it's a good length: enough to keep you engaged and challenged, but not so long it wears itself thin. In addition to the ""main path"" I've caught a lot of glimpses throughout my play of well-hidden additional content and hidden / optional puzzles, which, from other reviews I've read, could easily tack on another 20 hours for the particularly meticulous player. Overall, The Witness is easily one of the best puzzle games I have ever played, and certainly one of the most unique gaming experiences out there. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys puzzles and thinking games.			"

												I cannot overstate enuogh about how well-designed and creative this game is. The environment design alone is in a league of its own.Pros:- Challenging puzzles that are fair- Fantastic / Creative environment- Art style is very pleasingCons:- Not always clear what happens when you complete a puzzle. Some that should do something, don't.- 'Story' is very obtuse and a bit pretentious- Weak 'easy ending'. Way too involved to get the apparently actual ending.- Normal ending provided zero closure and wasn't satisfying at all.If you enjoyed The Talos Principle or Myst, you should enjoy this game. It's different than both of those (and better), but in the same line.			"

												I returned this game for a refund. I still recommend it, but with some reservations.'The Witness 'is beautiful and the puzzles are frustrating yet addicative and engaging. It's wonderfully crafted and the devs clearly put a lot of heart and sweat into it. I love that. For people who enjoy puzzle games, strongly consider this one. For myself, I can't say I value it at $40, but that's based on my own gaming tastes; I'm not big into puzzle games.			"

												A totally non-linear puzzle game that works almost like a Metroid game, where you'll walk past stuff that you can't gain access to. But, the only thing preventing you is knowledge of the puzzle mechanics, which you learn by seeing those mechanics implemented in smaller more simpler puzzles. If you get stumped by a puzzle, you can just walk away, and find another one. Like Jonathan Blow's other game Braid, there's a ton of philsophical undertones embedded in the story and in the world that slowly unravel as you continue to play and discover. The only reason you have to not play this game is if you are not a fan of puzzles. This game will wreck your brain! "

												This is a great game, well worth the asking price -- there was more care and attention put into this than any recent AAA title that I can recall.The world is gorgeous and well put together as a cohesive whole. It rewards exploration with little bits of explicit or implied lore, as well as heaps of hidden puzzles and locations. The puzzles are well done for the most part and the difficulty hits just the right note. There were a couple places where I either felt like a total genius for deducing a really difficult puzzle mechanic or a moron for not being able to figure something out, only to have the game ""teach"" me about the puzzle mechanic half an hour later. Basically, it can be tough if you ""sequence break"", but quite manageable otherwise. That said, I do have a couple bits of minor criticism for The Witness:  It isn't quite as mind bending as Braid was: the puzzle mechanism in that game (time manipulation) involved your entire perception, and the mechanic in this game simply isn't as immersive (although the environment is certainly more immersive). The end-game feels a bit tedious and on-rails as opposed to the rest of the game. It would have been nice to continue with the theme of exploration and discovery right up to the conclusion. "

												Firstly, this game isn't Portal. Going into this game with those expectations will leave you dissapointed.The Witness is a deeply satifying and somewhat challenging puzzle game set on a desolate island. The island looks stunning and I found myself on many occassions just waltzing around admiring the views.The puzzle range in difficulty from easy to extremly difficult, but your never left feeling like the game is cheating you as the answers are always there somewhere on the island, if you have the vision to see them.The only negative thing I will say about the game is the lack of audio. There is no music and the enviroment makes very little sound. The game could do with a subtle eerie score or nature sound such as chirping of birds or the blowing of the wind to help create more of an atmoshphere.This aside, it a great game and worth the purchase.

												This game is not for everyone.  I am five hours in, and from what I can tell (and what I've read) there is no plot.  There is no extrinsic reward when you're solving puzzles.  There's nothing pushing you along.  Don't get this game if you need those things.  You won't like it. For people like me, however, who just love puzzles for the sake of puzzles, you will like this.  There are tons of little ""oh!"" moments when something clicks and you figure out what you're supposed to do.  It's very self driven. It's amazing.			"

												An okay puzzle game. It looks beautiful and most of the puzzles are good.But I don't like how many of the puzzles have solution hidden in the environment. and so solving these environmentally puzzles depends not on actually figuring out a solution but simple walking around trying to find a place to stand so the a solution can be properly aligned and seen.This does not feel mentally stimulating but more like busy work.All in All the good outweighs the bad.

												I absolutely loved this game.Besides the devillishly difficult but enjoyable puzzles, the game is truly beautiful and there is much to look at and enjoy. There are tape and video recordings hidden around the island for you to find if you keep an eye open for them. They are filled with quotes about the ways in which different thought processes colour our view of the world, such as thoughts on Religion, the Scientific Method, Human Morality and the Art of Zen.I have now 'finished' the game, although there are still quite some puzzles out there I think I might have missed or have remained unsolved as you do not have to solve every puzzle to 'complete' the game. However, when starting out I cannot stress enough that you have to explore the whole island to be able to solve the mazes. In the first hours you are playing you might think that the puzzles you are encountering are truly impossible. This is because the rules of these puzzles only get explained in certain areas, so there are many puzzles you will encounter in the beginning that are way too advanced for you. The more you explore, the more you learn bit by bit, the more fun the game gets. At the end I was gleefully solving puzzles while backtracking to places I thought were impossible the first time around.In this day and age it is sometimes difficult to just stay in a moment and have the patience for more than a few minutes to truly look at the details of an object that is in essence an extremely simple thing (a maze), repeating this process over and over and over again, and then still coming up with new ways of solving the same object. It is very refreshing, like a deep cleaning of your brain.All in all, I came away from this game with the Zen-like experience which I believe the game was trying to impress upon its players. I think if people are willing to set aside their expectations they will find much to enjoy.			"

												A beautiful island of puzzles. That's all I would say if the puzzles were simply connecting a line from A to B, but it's not that simple and you need to figure out why. Do you know that feeling when you discover something is not working then you realise what you can do to solve the problem? The Witness delivers that feeling of intelligence in many different puzzles in many different variations like any good puzzle game. What makes The Witness one of the special puzzle games is that the puzzles meaningfully feel like they are a part of a grander scheme - because they are. The environment around the puzzles gives you clues on how  to solve each of the puzzles, and some are the puzzles are literally the environment itself. But most important, you are not collecting meaningless tokens, you are slowly unlocking the island itself. The Witness is a rare treat for puzzle gamers - we will have to wait many years before we get another game of this quality (nothing has been as good The Witness & Obduction in years). If you like puzzles then The Witness is a must buy. If you love exploring interesting new worlds, then I recommend you buy The Witness. And if you are impatient and don't like being confused then you should avoid The Witness.			"

												The witness is a masterclass in how to implement, teach, and experiment with mechanics and any puzzly game should really study it and figure out how to take its lessons and put it into their games. There's an incredible amount of depth in a very simple way of interacting with the world + just about everything ties together. Every single puzzle is taught, every single puzzle has a mechanical language easing you into exactly how to solve it- and there's just a ridiculous amount of them all to work through.i've yearned for a really good elaboration on what the myst series did to videogames for ages and this is just the sort of thing i've been waiting for, really. Games that do what the Myst series tried to do so few and far between, despite that series being so groundbreaking. Puzzle games centering around world- and exploration-based puzzles are basically nonexistent - there's barely even games that try and fail at it, let alone games like this that succeed so hard. The game feels like one that came from a world where games like the Myst series were iterated on constantly and the concepts had time to be polished and perfected, not a world where Fez and Talos Principle are the two bulletpoints on the timeline since the Myst series died.Anyway: it's a really good game and you should absolutely make time to play it if you are interested in puzzles + game design at all! do it!

												I wanted to love The Witness - if it were half the game Braid was, I'd recommend it in a heart beat.Instead it's an absolutely gorgeous game with a bunch of sometimes interesting puzzles that slowly but surely wittles your down your ability to care.I've completed some 430 puzzles now, and I've given up - it's not worth the time to complete it to find out the meaning of it all, so I googled the ending. And then I got mad. Really, really mad. The ending is a waste, just as much as the psuedo-philosophical quotes scattered around everywhere - a greater game would have encouraged these ideas to it's player through it's gameplay, not it's voice overs.I still got 18 hours out of the game though, and the puzzles themselves are alright. I'll give this a really weak recommendation, but not for the current price. If you buy the Witness, know that it's only worth it for the puzzles and the graphics, there is nothing to the power of Braid here, and it's probably better enjoyed at $15 or less.			"

												Not everyone's cup of tea, yet it is in my opinion greater than the sum of its parts.Getting the ""Endgame"" achievement is half the experience and should be a significant milestone for many. You can comfortably put this game and its myriad secrets to rest at that point. I reached this in ~20 hours with half a stack of post-it notes and my favourite image editor to draw over screenshots.Casual to moderate puzzle solvers should enjoy this first half of the game, the remainder of which is balls-to-the-wall insane.The $40 price tag will not be justifiable to many. Personally, however, it more than earned its keep.I would recommend giving this a shot anyway, and take advantage of the Steam Refunds feature if you're not getting any satisfaction after the 1 hour mark. In order to maximise the likelihood of enjoying this game, please relax. Know that if you are ever stuck, you can always set the game down and have a break, and have the solution spring to your mind the next time you sit down to tackle it, or journey to an unexplored part of the map and find another puzzle to crack.I really love this game.CONS:- Sometimes in a sequences of puzzles, when you make a mistake you are forced to solve the previous puzzle again.- Rarely, you are only given half a solution forcing you to brute force the remainder of the puzzle.

This is a game not for everyone… I repeat this game is not for everyone! It is a puzzle game, but don't expect it to be a linear story like Portal 2 or Talos Principle. What to expect is an atmospheric mind bending puzzle game on an beautifully designed island. The only story you will find is through the architecture, props and tape recorders (the tapes are quotes that are philosophical, astronomical, that sort of thing.) The story is open ended and not told in a normal manner.Hand holding is something this game does not do, it was designed in a way to respect the player for being observant. Gameplay and visuals teach the player on how to progress through certain puzzles. Puzzles will be many variants of the line and block puzzle you see in the screenshots, trailers and gameplay. Now there will be sets of puzzles in certain areas where you have to solve in a row, those are the ones that will teach the player how to use puzzles. There will be different mechanics thrown in when you have learned a puzzle. There are some very challenging puzzles in this game that are logically and thoughtfully designed with such a simple concept. If some puzzles are too hard the player can just go do other ones, you are free to walk the unbeaten path. This sort of freedom is fantastic!This is a really good game and I highly recommend this game if you really like puzzle games. As I said before it's a different game compared to Portal 2 and Talos Principle. It is a game that is not going to appeal to everyone either. Edit: Forgot to mention that the graphics options are limited to High, Medium and Low, vsync and full screen. No resolution or FOV options. You can edit these in the .ini files. http://www.wsgf.org/dr/witness/en "

												The Witness is a puzzle game like no other I have played.  It bucks the trend not only by having no narrative, but also by having no direct explanation of any of the game mechanics.  Rather than painstakingly explaining everything as most games do, The Witness simply provides the information you need and lets you figure it out.  It's quite refreshing in an era of constant hint popups, control prompts, and hour-long tutorials.Now how does this work?  The Witness provides all the information you need, and even provides a set of tutorial puzzles for each main mechanic but it does not tell you how any of it works.  Half the challenge is figuring out how the mechanics work.  The game provides a near-constant feeling of satisfaction from figuring the puzzles out, barring a very small minority of puzzles.  I found many of the puzzles rather clever in their design, and I find it quite telling how superb the design is that I only ever felt frustrated in two spots in the entire game when I am normally frustrated very easily by difficult puzzles.Another large difference I see between The Witness and other puzzle games is in the design of the puzzles themselves.  Most games use very simple mechanics and combine them in increasingly complex and lengthy ways to increase difficulty.  I find that results in the major difficulty of the puzzles being simply thinking through all the steps, rather than any mechanical complexity.  The Witness, however, uses more and more complex mechanics, constantly modifying or introducing new ones, without unnecessarily increasing the size or complexity of the puzzles themselves.  The difficulty feels more natural and logical this way, rather than just trying to overload the player's brain with too many steps.The part that makes this all work and ties it all together is the puzzle interface itself.  Puzzles are presented on panels throughout the game world with an exceedingly simple goal: Draw a line from the starting point to the ending point through a grid.  Every puzzle has the same basic goal, and this simplicity tying every puzzle together gives the player a feeling of familiarity, even when confronted by completely new mechanics.Graphically the game is very impressive, especially considering how low detail the models and textures are.  It runs quite smoothly as well, barring a particular bug with my GPU that I've been working around and will hopefully be solved in the near future.  The island is beautiful and very colorful, with each zone having a distinctive style.  Sound effects are minimal, but fit their purpose well.  There is no music, which I was confused about at first but completely understand after playing the game.  I wasn't even tempted to play my own music while playing the game.  Any music would drastically alter the mood, and the game is so tightly designed, it felt like that would lessen the experience.There are two things about the game I dislike:- The first being a small number of puzzles that felt like they could not be solved with perception and logic alone, but required the use of external software to decipher.- The second being the story, or lack thereof.  While nearly everything in the game is very tightly thematically linked around the idea of opening your mind and learning new things, I thought that there should be some sort of explanation for the island itself, why you're there, and certain things non-puzzle-related that you find.  It's possible there's a well-hidden secret that has not yet been discovered that contains this, but nothing has been located to my knowledge.  I know that some people complain about the lack of narrative, but while I don't think it would fit the game to have an Elohim or GlaDOS watching over you the whole time, I would have liked a little bit of something to explain the world.  There does seem to be an attempt by the game but I found it very lacking and it raised even more questions.I'm not sure I've ever played such a well-designed game.  Everything fits, everything supports the rest of the design.  The amount of content is certainly worth the price, containing more than either The Talos Principle or Portal 2.  It's certainly an experience unlike any I've had before in a game and I hope that other developers, not just of puzzle games, can learn from this example.  I realize this game isn't for everybody, but I hope that most will enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												I finished the game. Not 100% but completed the endgame. 518 Panels solved +53 secrets. If I understand the black Pillars correctly there are probably over 50 secrets left. Probably also a few panels left but I solved everyone I found (except one, for which I need to study a good few hours more). But I have all the lasers.This game is about exploring an island and solving the panels. The panels exhibit various mechanics/rules. And when looking at a very complex panel you have no chance figuring the panel out. But there are easy panels of each mechanic distributed over the island, which offer you to understand the mechanic step by step. So when you come across a new mechanic you don't have the knowledge to solve for yet you got to come back later when you learned more.The game has at least 10 zones where a laser can be activated by most of the panels there. Many zones exhibit one mechanic that is deepened but often combined with other mechanics to produce more difficulty. In some zones you have to complete all puzzles to activate the laser in others you can solve either half of the puzzles. When you reached a certain number of lasers you can enter the endgame. The endgame is so difficult. There are no words that do justice on how ♥♥♥♥ing difficult it is. It felt like torture. And I only worked it out by trial and error. At this point you should have fully understood every mechanic and can apply it with all its tricks. But the puzzles in the endgame sometimes seem impossible to solve. So you just try and try until out of luck something works. And the endgame is a long zone with many puzzles and combined mechanics from the whole island. I am sure that not many players will complete the game. It is just insanity and you really got to have the will and patience for it. (if you are not good in logical and methodical thinking you are screwed)There is no story whatsoever in this game. There are recordings that can be played but only contain some pseudo intellectual jabbering that goes on your nerves. And the voice actors weren't very passionate about it. The game has very beautiful graphics and very good sound effects. But there is no soundtrack. So you can play your own relaxing music while playing the game and I strongly recommend to do so because otherwise you end up frustrated way too early. Would I recommend? Yes if anyone wants to perceive the experience of exploring mechanics and is ready to handle the difficulty and frustration that comes with it. Go for it.			"

												I'm genuinely surprised and irritated at the number of reviewers who put <2 hours into the game and give it a negative review.  Personally I love the game, but I'm sure it's not for everyone.  It's a very in-depth, very long puzzle game.  If you're not someone who enjoys puzzles just for the challenge itself, please don't buy this game and take it out on the rating.  It's great for what it is.  It's not what it's not.  Great teaching pace, amazing visuals, and some exciting twists and revelations.  So far, I'm very happy I bought The Witness!			"

												+ The game is stunningly beautiful+ The small yet dense world is fun to explore+ Puzzles are mostly skillfully crafted and fair- Some puzzles are challenging only because they cause nausea or are physically hard to see- Some puzzles are not colourblind friendly- Puzzles are devoid of reason and lack any meaningful context- The game description promises a narrative that is nonexisting- The open-world nature clashes with the puzzles occasionally, as in you may stumble upon puzzles that include mechanics that have yet to be thought in the game+/- Some well read monologues/quotes that seem meaningful but ultimately amounts to nothingOverall a strong intro that transitions into frustration as it goes along until the ultimate ""slap in the face"", the ending.""As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives."" - Henry David ThoreauDid you expect this quote to have anything to do with this review?

												Not everyone's cup of tea, yet it is in my opinion greater than the sum of its parts.Getting the ""Endgame"" achievement is half the experience and should be a significant milestone for many. You can comfortably put this game and its myriad secrets to rest at that point. I reached this in ~20 hours with half a stack of post-it notes and my favourite image editor to draw over screenshots.Casual to moderate puzzle solvers should enjoy this first half of the game, the remainder of which is balls-to-the-wall insane.The $40 price tag will not be justifiable to many. Personally, however, it more than earned its keep.I would recommend giving this a shot anyway, and take advantage of the Steam Refunds feature if you're not getting any satisfaction after the 1 hour mark. In order to maximise the likelihood of enjoying this game, please relax. Know that if you are ever stuck, you can always set the game down and have a break, and have the solution spring to your mind the next time you sit down to tackle it, or journey to an unexplored part of the map and find another puzzle to crack.I really love this game.CONS:- Sometimes in a sequences of puzzles, when you make a mistake you are forced to solve the previous puzzle again.- Rarely, you are only given half a solution forcing you to brute force the remainder of the puzzle.

												I really don't want to repeat anything anyone else has said but,  this is a phenomenal game if you put the time in and really give it a chance.  I bought it here on Steam and for PS4, my wife and I are both hooked on it.  I really don't see an issue with the $40 tag either seeing as how many ""AAA"" are $60+ and pale in comparison in terms of length and quality overall.(this also goes for any good puzzle game)  Once you get some time into the game and come across some of the more challenging puzzles you can't help but admire and respect the person or people that came up with these ideas and solutions.  Just an overall great game that makes you think and work for your progress.  Between this and Braid, I will gladly    buy any game Johnathan and team put out.Not the most informative review but everyone with a positive pretty much summed it up and said it better than I could.

												Wonderful game with puzzles that keep you playing for a long time. I was excited for the witness for a long time, and was not disappointed. I think I am addicted to the feeling when I correctly solve a puzzle and something happens because of it or some sort of progress furthers. Too bad my computer wasn't able to run in HIGH mode - who knew a puzzle game would require so much power? And after couple hours I was forced to stop playing because overwhelming sense of nausea was pushing the limit of my ability to keep it down - I have no trouble playing first person games usually, but this one is really bad :(.

												I would recommend ignoring the dozens of negative reviews from users with less than 2 hours played who were angling for a Steam refund- they are universally bad takes from folks who didn't even scratch the surface of the game. The complaints that the game could be in 2D, or that the envrionment is pointless are ill-founded and kind of comical having played further. Same goes to the reviewers who complained that the walk speed is too slow or that you can't jump. Running is the *only* instruction the game actually provides to you, and complaining about jumping is completely beside the point of the game. Don't get me started on the person who said that the puzzles are ""badly placed""- the Metroidvania structure isn't that difficult to figure out. If you don't know what a symbol means, thats a hint to go elsewhere.What you'll get with The Witness is a clever spin on puzzle gaming where the game isn't necessarily about solving line mazes, but about learning the ever-expanding vocabulary that governs them. It feels very satisfying to learn these rules and apply them all by yourself, and its hard to ever truly feel stuck since you can easily take a break and change gears to try a different set of puzzles with a different set of rules.To those who complain that there isn't a big payoff at the end, or that there needs to be more story or some sort of motivation to continue playing: knowledge is its own reward.

												The Witness is beautiful, and challenging, and I think an interesting game to spend time in. The puzzle difficulty ranges from ""well, DUH"" to ""I'M GOING TO MURDER YOU FOR INFLICTING THIS ON ME"". I would recommend it if you like challenging puzzles and if you want to check out a beautifully crafted little world. At this point I've played just under 20 hours and the only reason I've stopped spending every waking moment at home doing line puzzles is because I feel guilty getting ahead of my buddy who bought it first.A friend and I played a lot of this at about the same time. I found it pretty interesting how almost every puzzle I found impossible, he had no trouble with it. Meanwhile he got stuck at one point for about an hour and asked me to get up to where he was so we could bang our heads on the puzzle together - I got it within seconds of getting there.So yes, it's almost certain there will be at least one set of puzzles that you Just Don't Get. If it's not making your blood pressure raise alarmingly, give it a while and you might crack it, otherwise I'd recommend looking up an answer and moving on to some other puzzles you actually enjoy looking at.Pros: Tons of puzzles. Lots of surprises. A gorgeous and colourful game world. Feeling like an absolute god when you figure out a problem you're having trouble with, or notice the Big Important Thing you needed to notice.Cons: Some puzzles WILL feel impossible. Some puzzles WILL just be massively annoying. Eventually wanting x10 speed to move around because seriously man I just want to get over there already jeez.			"

												The witness is a puzzle game. It is hard. It is beautiful. It is awe inspiring. It is frusterating. It is not a story telling experience. It is hundred little moments of clarity mixed between moments of confusion.If you are looking for a hard core puzzle game you will love this game. Everything in this game has a purpose and reason for being there. Every detail was painstakingly added for a reason. This is a very different game from anything else out there.If you are looking for a game with music and story and dislike solving problems you might want to stay away.			"

												I'm really torn in the recommendation of this - as I didn't enjoy it all that much (through only my limited playtime) despite being put together and thought out very well. To this point it just seems to be the solving of puzzles for the sake of it, with no discernable story and no feedback/reinforcement given from the completion of puzzles. For those up for a huge cerebral challenge for solely the sake of a challenge, then this may be for you. The puzzles are very innovative and the world is aesthetically beautiful and immersive. It's just that, as a game (and not as an academic exercise of some sort), its not very fun at all.			"

												Only played an hour of it before I decided to refund. The main reason for not recommending it is mainly the cost. This is not a game worth $40. It feels too sterile and lifeless. Games like Myst or The Talos Principle have way more variety to their puzzles as well as having a really immersive, interactive world that is exciting to explore. This game just feels like a bunch of line puzzles randomly placed throughout a pretty island. It's way too restrictive with its sluggish walk speed, inability to jump, and overabundance of invisible walls and insurmountable waist-high fences. The puzzles themselves aren't really interesting either. Some of the puzzles aren't even puzzles. They're just memorization. One group of puzzles involves looking at trees at a certain angle and seeing what branch an apple is and replicating that on a monitor. There's no real thought to that at all. On top of that, sometimes failing a puzzle will force you to go back and resolve the previous puzzle to reunlock the puzzle you were just on. That's just unnecessary busy work. I will say though that you should take this review with a grain of salt as it is only based off of an hour of playing since I didn't want to surpass the 2 hour refund limit. Regardless, I just don't think this is worth the absurd price tag. Wait until it's at least half off.			"

												This is the best puzzle game I have ever played. It's all about non-verbal teaching, building on ideas and re-evaluating what you've learnt. You can get stuck on a puzzle, go to bed, then wake up and solve it immediately. The world is compact and interesting, and allows for freedom of movement from the get-go, meaning that if you get stuck you can simply leave and return later. The only gate to your progress is knowledge, and those moments when you correctly figure out how to solve a puzzle are a delight.You will probably need a pen and paper and a lot of patience for some of the puzzles. Try to avoid spoiling yourself; the joy of discovery and the work you have to go through to get there is the entire point.10/10			"

												I haven't quite finished everything, but I have completed a very significant portion of the game without any guides. Not only does this succeed in being the most consistently mind-blowing game, I've ever played, it's also unique from any puzzle I have ever seen because it requires both inductive and deductive logic. All puzzle games, whether it's sudoku or portal, give you the rules up front and then just rely on you to make deductive steps to reach the solution. In The Witness, the rules of the puzzle are never given to you. It is up to you to inductively guess what the rules could be, abductively test your supposed rules, and then deductively solve the puzzle based on the info that you yourself have been able to gather. Because of this, I would not hesitate to say it is the most challenging puzzle game I have ever played. This in turn creates the largest temptation to use a guide or look for hints because we naturally associate ""more challenging"" with ""less doable"". This is, however; not the case. The game is just as doable as any puzzle game, and it facilitates the learning of all of the rules naturally. If you go for this game, do not bang your head against the same puzzle for more than a few minutes. The world is open, when you get stuck, explore. The answers are never all in the same place. The creator very cleverly draws parallels between the relationship of the player and the game world to the relationship between the scientist and his testable environment. Jonathan Blow's philosophy of what we need to know, what we can know, and what is useful to know is very profoundly expressed through the game, although I can't say I totally agree with his rather cynical philosophical outlook. Very enjoyable, one of a kind experience. If you are willing to allow yourself to legitimately struggle with the unknown, you will get so much out of this game.			"

												This game is hard, but it's very relaxing. The general ambiance is very peaceful, and I find that complimenting the game with some light orchestral music makes for the perfect experience. The key to enjoying this game is to view the panels not as a challenge, but as a lesson. They're not something to be conquered, they're something to be approached on their own terms and handled as one becomes ready.I don’t think that the development team is trying to show off how smart they all are, and how dumb everyone else is. The puzzles aren’t trying to beat you back and dissuade you, they’re enticing you with the opportunity to learn and to understand and to explore. Sometimes, they fail. Most of the time, they succeed.I think the decision to build the game without an engaging narrative is a bit of a double edged sword. On the one hand, I don't feel frustration from not being able to complete the puzzles fast enough to satisfy my narrative curiosity, which was a problem I sometimes had in Portal. I always wanted to hear what Glados had to say next, even more than I really cared about solving the puzzles, a conflict which often led to significant frustration. In The Witness, I don't have to worry about missing out on a captivating narrative, because as far as I can tell, there isn’t one.But, on the other hand, not having an engaging narrative means that this isn’t a game that I can sit and play for long periods of time, especially now that I’ve gotten far enough in that puzzles are taking more than 10 minutes to solve. Even with the music, I find my mind wandering and thinking of other things to do. I just try to take it one panel at a time and when I start getting bored I do something else. When I come back later, I’ve regained some energy and my curiosity and I can enjoy playing once more.Ultimately, I offer my cautious recommendation of this game. If you find that you don’t like it before your refund period expires, just go and get a refund. It won’t get any easier or significantly more engaging any time soon, and you’re better off finding something else that can hold your attention.			"

												I get nausea within a few minutes of playing this game. This is apparently a common problem. Adjusting the FOV setting doesn't help. I think it's because of weird built-in distortion in the display. Try this: If you find a nice vertical line (e.g. a wall) and sweep it from one side of your screen to the other you will see that it leans from one side to the other as it sweeps. I think that this very odd non-linear distortion is what's causing people to throw up. There's no way I can recommend this game at the moment.			"

It surely can get repetitive if you dont have the patience to stay in a puzzle for maybe 1 hour, but I can only recommend it for anyone looking something familiar to The Talos Principle. The artistic style of it and how cautious you have to be to notice things you didnt even imagine would exist is its own strong points. (Please rethink of buying it as it is not colourblind and deaf friendly, which, unfortunately, cannot help you progress in the game).			"

												Oh this one is freaking me out more and more...At first I thought it was silly of me to feel paranoid when I started the game. Why am I here? What are all those noises? Will those things move if I turn my back to them? Should I avoid attracting attention to my presence here? I was on edge more because of my own inclination to expect being watched or hunted, than because of the setting. The Myst-like atmosphere felt too solitary and pretty to look at to ever realise any of my silly fears.By the time I had settled down and took each lesson the game gave me to heart, learning to utilize the simple tool given to me from the very start, it really threw a curveball. Now it has me paranoid about my very senses instead, expecting every little beautiful vantage point to be there for a purpose, and I'm starting to see puzzles in everything I look at.It might cost me my sanity in the process, but I'm in too deep now to pull away. For better or worse, I am witnessing more than I ever expected. I just hope nothing is witnessing me while I'm at it. One kind of paranoia at a time is enough, thanks.One hell of a trip.

												The satisfaction from solving a puzzle in the game is the reward for your perseverance; however, you pay for that perseverance in hours. You will spend several hours wandering around the island looking for some inspiration to a puzzle and the game promotes this. The colours, the sounds, and the sceneries are all designed in a way that tries to help you with finding the next solution before the point of frustration, the game tries to be your puzzle muse and calming influence.So with all that said you might believe that I played the game without any help and you would be wrong, I relied heavily on guides that gave me the rules for the different puzzle types and I am happy with that. If this is a game that has you interested but you are worried about the difficulty you should grab the game and embrace your inner cheat, the puzzle rule guides are a good compromise for those of us who are not too clever or just don't have the time.

Up to that moment yesterday I was sure The Witness is just boards with mazes. They are fun, of course, solving the hardest is REALLY rewarding, but boy, the reward you get when you discover what I have discovered  - it is this feeling I love in games, something happens and your jaw just drops down.

												PROS1) This game has a lot of puzzles which will blow your mind, if you are equipped to solve the puzzle in the first place.2)The puzzles are difficult but enjoyable once you get a grip on the theme of the game3)Within each area, the tutorial ramps very well. I usually could figure out the mechanics of each area before being pushed into the real ""meat"" of that areaCONS1) It's openworld, except the areas definitly ramp in difficulty and you need to complete each area roughly in the correct order, and that order is not intuitive. If you were going to look anything up for a slight hint at the game, look up the recomended area-order.2)The puzzles become a bit excessive after a while, but that's sort of the point of the game anyways. Each puzzle is different but it starts to feel repetative after a while.Comments:1)This game took me 20 hours to complete. I used a guide lightly through out the game (maybe 4-5 times?)2)Don't bother 100% this game. Just, don't. I looked into it...don't try.3)As many others hac expressed, this is a really hard game to recomend. Although I enjoyed my time, if I had the oportunity to play for the first time again, I probably wouldn't. I almost want to recomend buying it to just experience the concept and play through a few areas, but I also would really want you to finish it. If you REALLY like puzzles, or you want to experience a new twist on puzzles buy this game. If not, don't. I'm going to ""YES recomend"" this game because I did enjoy it, but I'm not far from downvoting it. "

												This is a mixed review - I recommend The Witness with caveats. I haven't beaten it and probably won't return to it, but the time I've spent playing has been magical.Pros:Holy cow this is an amazing puzzle game! I've played it for almost 2 days solid and spent every other waking hour thinking about it. Every puzzle seems to have just the right level of challenge. Despite appearances, there is a huge amount of variety in the puzzles, there's hundreds of puzzles, and there's plenty to do in-between puzzles.I had no performance issues at all. I have a GTX970 running at 1080p. I just started the game up, it defaulted to High settings, and everything played incredibly smoothly.The island is jaw-droppingly beautiful. This is probably the most beautiful full-3D game I've ever played. The amount of effort that went into making everything so picturesque AND making all the puzzles line up is truly incredible.Cons:The price. It's probably a fair price if you're one of the people who ends up loving everything about this game, but I had to stop playing early. I would have regretted paying full price if I hadn't gotten this as part of a bundle.It's very hard to stop playing. This is not a veiled complement. You can uninstall the game, but your brain will keep trying to solve the puzzles. The Witness will find its way into your life in ways you never expected, and that can be quite horrifying. Unfortunately I had to stop playing after realizing that this was happening. I cannot risk my sanity further. Some puzzles rely on color and sound. If you're deaf or colorblind, 90% of the game will still be accessible to you, but you'll want to check the forums first to see which areas you're going to have to look up solutions for. "

The audio is simple, grounding you in whichever environment you are in. And the puzzle progression is incredible. You cannot simple ""luck"" your way through a puzzle, you have to fully understand why you were able to solve a puzzle before moving to the next one.

												This game is absolutely amazing.This is a game about learning how puzzles and mechanics work (in the context of the game world), then realising you've been blind your entire life and now everything deserves a second look.A must play, one of the greats.			"

												Beautiful game, interesting puzzles, well worth it overall. However, once you've completed all the main puzzles then the game requires you to run around randomly stumbling onto hidden puzzles. Ultimately doesn't treat the player's time with respect, reduces to a ""Where's Wally"".			"

												The Witness is an unexpected journey to forgotten lands of your brain. Since the Portal and Portal 2, I have never been so amazed by overall theme and emotion of the whole game. It feels really as a whole, and not as a decoration for some puzzles and author's ideas. Basically, the game explores one mechanic. But creating new rules, then bending them over to create new rules, combining those rules in different, unimaginable at first, ways - all of this creates an atmosphere, where you are proud of your solutions, even the simplest ones. The game is hard sometimes. I mean, it isn't scary hard, but I had a couple of dozens of puzzles, which stopped me for some significant time. The difficulty in the game increases gradually, which is a big plus for such games. You don't want to stop, because you understand that every minute you spend in the game, you solve something a bit harder, you brain works a bit better, so you are... a lot smarter?There is one thing, where the game even beats Portal games. The environment here holds your attention, which wasn't the part of the game feel in Portal. Trees and sand, rocks and ocean, windmill and autumn leaves, sometimes you just stop and watch the nature of this island. There is more in it, sometimes you can find a small puzzle or secret in an unexpected place, sometimes the environment plays a significant role in puzzle solution and... sometimes the island is the puzzle itself. And in the end, the atmosphere and puzzles don't interfere, but work together to give you the game experience of the year. If there will be another puzzle game of such level, I would call it extraordinary year. P.S. DLC please? Please?			"

												The witness is a divisive game to say the least. The people who like it, really like it. But those who go in expecting something this game is not, are almost certain to walk away disappointed. The following are just some general things about the game. I dare not call them ""facts"" since some things are still subjective, but I try.Whether you will like the Witness or nor depends largely on whether you consider any of the following to be pros or cons.1. A number of puzzles rely on color and sound, more so than you might be used to in other games. Colorblind or tone deaf players be warned.2. Similarly, there are a handful of puzzles with brightly flashing colors which may cause discomfort.3. The Witness is a puzzle game, far more than it is a puzzle-adventure game. It's not Myst. Solving puzzles doesn't give you a new piece of the story. It gives you more puzzles. Story is an afterthought at best.4. The witness has decent atmospheric sound design, but is devoid of almost any background music.5. Some sections you may do 10 or 20 puzzles in a row that are similar except for increasing complexity.6. This game has no tutorials, no hints. Everything is determined by the scientific method. You have to experiment with puzzles to understand how they work.7. When you solve a puzzle in the Witness, there is no fanfare, no sparkles, no gold star rating. For the most part, the only reward is unlocking the next puzzle.8. The Witness is open-world. You can very early in the game go nearly everywhere in the island. It is also likely to throw puzzles at you in the early game that you will need to step away from and come back to much later.9. You will always be drawing lines in this game. There are many different mechanics at work, which make for many unique puzzles, but the method of imputing the solution is always the same. Even switches and levers are line puzzles.10. This game can be really hard, obtuse, and often frustratingly mind-bending. Sometimes, very rarely, it might also be just a little cheap.- The bonus totally not objective sectionUnpopular opinion inbound, but I think I liked this more than The Talos Principle, to which it is compared quite a lot. I like the mental process of solving puzzles, but not really the act of having to show my work, which in Talos Principle might mean 5 to 10 minutes of carrying around boxes through force fields and trying to get a laser angle just right. I already know the answer. I don't want to have to do all the grunt work as well. I want to do a new puzzle.  This game allowed me to do just that. Once a puzzle clicked, it took just a few seconds to draw it out, and move on to the next challenge. This wasn't always true. At times the pace set by the puzzles is broken by the languid pace of the world around you, which I suppose is fine, if you are taking the game at a slow pace. Near the end of the game, getting around the island between the few puzzles you might have remaining was also not that much fun anymore, and one or two puzzles were maybe just a bit too obnoxious in the way it regarded my time.  Despite this, for the most part, I loved it. It this was one of the most inventive, original and gorgeous puzzle games I had played in a long time.			"

												This is a mixed review - I recommend The Witness with caveats. I haven't beaten it and probably won't return to it, but the time I've spent playing has been magical.Pros:Holy cow this is an amazing puzzle game! I've played it for almost 2 days solid and spent every other waking hour thinking about it. Every puzzle seems to have just the right level of challenge. Despite appearances, there is a huge amount of variety in the puzzles, there's hundreds of puzzles, and there's plenty to do in-between puzzles.I had no performance issues at all. I have a GTX970 running at 1080p. I just started the game up, it defaulted to High settings, and everything played incredibly smoothly.The island is jaw-droppingly beautiful. This is probably the most beautiful full-3D game I've ever played. The amount of effort that went into making everything so picturesque AND making all the puzzles line up is truly incredible.Cons:The price. It's probably a fair price if you're one of the people who ends up loving everything about this game, but I had to stop playing early. I would have regretted paying full price if I hadn't gotten this as part of a bundle.It's very hard to stop playing. This is not a veiled complement. You can uninstall the game, but your brain will keep trying to solve the puzzles. The Witness will find its way into your life in ways you never expected, and that can be quite horrifying. Unfortunately I had to stop playing after realizing that this was happening. I cannot risk my sanity further. Some puzzles rely on color and sound. If you're deaf or colorblind, 90% of the game will still be accessible to you, but you'll want to check the forums first to see which areas you're going to have to look up solutions for. "

												An excercise in frustrationThere are key elements to first person puzzle games that The Witness simply does not have. As Portal and The Talos Principle if you add a story and/or humor to a puzzle game you make it seem less hard. While the player has fun laughing at Glados or is pondering the philosophical implications of The Talos principle, the brain gets a chance to relax. To gain perspective.This helps stop the frustration chain. In The Witness there is no music, no story, no context, barelly any tutorials. . Even when there is sound, the effects are minimal and create no mood. So what is left? Graphics, which are nice, puzzles and criptic clues for said puzzles. The simple fact i found in the first two hours of play is that if you take out humor, and other distractions such as Elohim or Glados all you have to think about is your own frustration with some puzzle. Because of that even when i solved the puzzle i didn't feel smart. I felt stupid for taking so long. Also even in the first two hours of play i encounterd two very simple puzzles made hard in an artificial manner: maze puzzles, and regular puzzles translated in the enviroment.  Again i din't feel smart at all. I just felt frustration. This game could have been amazing with some relaxing music to help with player frustration and just a bit more story. The way it is, i can't recomend it.*5 hours later*It a masterpiece. After the first two hours i was sure Jonathan Blow produced a 7 year dud. After another 3 i was ready to un-install and throw my computer towards the closest living thing in the hope i would finally be committed for my genocidal tendencies while playing video games. And then something happens after 7 hours. You start seeing things. I could swear i started hearing music in the game. There is no music in the game. I am now obsessed with the games' puzzles.  I must be losing my mind. But i can't stop. I want to learn more, see more, understand more.This is the Dark Souls of puzzle games.			"

												If you enjoy maze logic puzzles (or Sudoku, Sokoban, etc) you'll love this game. The Witness is broader and deeper and more subtle and surprising and wonderful and beautiful and epiphanic than just a series of maze puzzles, but I really appreciated how well crafted those maze puzzles are, how they teach without words and bring you to unexpected solutions with such elegance. The world has a peaceful, meditative quality that needs to be embraced - these puzzles aren't work, they're like steps on the road to enlightenment.The Witness is a magnificent game.			"

												The less you know about this game going into it, the better.  The gradual journey of discovery and surprise the game takes you on is without question its biggest strength. The Witness is overwhelmingly fascinating, and it's easy to develop a sense of obsession seeking more and more answers toward it's mysteries.  You will be challenged, and extremely tempted to spoil things for yourself continually while playing the game.  Though if you do, you'll simply be executing actions through an instruction manual.  You'll remove yourself from the experience.  There will certainly be puzzles you will grow to loathe but it's then, that you should walk away to another area, clear your head and come back later.I feel writing this review is too premature, as even still at 40+ hours I know I have atleast another 40 more to go.  And I don't doubt I'll play through the game again fresh after that.  But I'll wrap this review up to say... if there's any game out there currently that you absolutely need to experience, it's this one.			"

												This game is so meticulously crafted that i have no idea why it took less than 10 years to develop. I solved a bit over 400 puzzles now. They are hard but never unfairly so - you never have to guess, and if you wander around the world, you will certainly learn how to solve that kind of puzzle. This game teaches you how to solve very complicated and abstract problems without a single word. Playing this game feels like a master class in game design.There are puzzles i have not been able to solve yet, some of them might take a few hours or days to solve. But you can just wander to a different part of the island and solve the puzzles there, you can even finish the game that way. Solving every puzzle in this game will be very hard and take a very long time. I am extremely glad i never looked up a solution on the internet, i am sure this would totally ruin the game. "

												This is a game that triggers my mind to think about everything encountered in the world, Searching for signs, for patterns, for solutions all around me. I would rate this game really high because it used just one single concept to create such vast veriaty. Another up point is the learning curve and difficulty level of the game. It is so modetate that there were only two times I needed to take out my pen and paper to record down what is in my mind. Everything is well taught before the real challenge comes by. The downside of the game is the ""too-predictatble-pattern"". Everything you encounter will fall under certain pattern. The pattern became predicateble when you know all the tricks of our great game desinger's mind. Ohhhhh, let's not forget about all the architectural decoration in the game. It seemed that this cerater of the island squeezed a lot of brain juice for this game, so he had to leave all his design intention somewhere in the map. That is interesting and fulfilling.			"

												Suffice to say that if you don't get an inherent sense of joy and accomplishment from solving complex puzzles, then this is not the game for you. The major driving force behind the game is puzzle solving and uncovering the mysteries of the world in an unconventional narrative. That said, for the puzzle-lovers among us, this is not just ANY old puzzle game, While the puzzles and the world around them seem disconnected at first, the game soon starts playing with your sense of reality and connects the two in clever ways. Puzzles become more metaphoric, and the game starts to communicate with you in its own language. This is not a android lock-screen walking simulator. This is something special.			"

												I like pretty much everything in this game. The Witness has been praised for it's environment and that praise is well deserved. Architecture and the different biomes work very well together and create this beautiful island. The environmental puzzles work geniously with the landscape. The puzzles on screens are awesome and very challenging and I like how the game teaches with only the puzzles. I also like the freedom to go try other puzzles if one gets stuck on some particular puzzle. The two endings I got were pretty and fullfilling. Overall I think this game has great atmosphere and really good gameplay.			"

So frequently in this game I was given puzzles I was certain were impossible, but through moments of insight, I solved them and was left in awe. While this game is not for everyone, I think it can be a spectacular experience for many if you let it. This game also has massive amounts of content.

												I have been waiting for this game well over 5 years and my expectations were actually quite high, but after playing it for a little under 11 hours it didn't disappoint at all. After a few hesitant moments at the beginning of the game, right after you leave the ""tutorial"" area and you begin explorning the island, the game absorbs you and never lets go.Each part of the island is brimming with puzzles that will leave you amazed at what you can actually achieve if you put your mind to it. One of those few experiences where you can walk out of it feeling fully satisfied of every second you spent playing on that island. At no moment you feel trapped or stuck on a puzzle for too long, as you are always free to leisurely move on to the next thing that awaits you on the island. The brilliant part is that taking those breaks actually helps you gain more perspective and aids you in solving those puzzles that proved too difficult at the time. With the right angle and/or spin, everything clicks into place in one of those so satisfying 'Aha!' moments that occur quite often throughout the game.If you are a puzzle fan of some sort, or you are someone who likes to give his/her brain an interesting challenge every once in a while, give this game a world. Just don't expect a lot of action, explosions or cinematic moments, as there aren't any on this game. Instead, you will get an inmersive experience in an island where you will rekindle that child-like sense of discovery that is very hard to come by in most movies and games.			"

												If you like solving logic puzzles, and I'm not talking like in an adventure game, I mean like in puzzle magazines and such, then you'll love this. I just wish they hadn't been so infuriatingly pretentious about the whole experience. The first soundbite you get is a quote from Albert Einstein, for Pete's sake! I mean, it's not one of the most worn out ones, but it just goes to show you where the creator (Jonathan Blow, I guess) thinks good philosophy comes from.This game is a lot like Talos Principle, which I would recommend you start with before going to this one. Mainly because the puzzles in Talos Principle are a lot more reliant on the medium (first person perspective) than The Witness. This game could really have been made in any format on any platform.That being said, the world built is very pretty and I personally like this kind of puzzle solving. The free roaming nature of the island sometimes mean you have to leave a particularly hard puzzle for a while until you've gathered enough information to solve it elsewhere. There is almost no hand-holding in the game, you have to figure out what to do by yourself. This is by design, however, so again, if you're the kind that is unable to leave a puzzle unsolved, you might not enjoy this. :)Some puzzle sequences are badly constructed. Two easy puzzles followed by one that is 50 times more complicated followed by one that is simple again. But I guess that's down to play-testing, something that Indie-games can't afford as much of, I guess (or is that wrong? sometimes I feel that AAA-companies seem less likely to playtest enough than Indie-game developers).Jonathan Blow may be smart, but I fear that maybe he has surrounded himself with one or two too-many yes-men. He probably should try playing ""Magic Circle"". Instead of the ""Inspirational quotes"" strewn about the island, maybe he should have written some kind of story for the game that we could take part of, or a bunch of little stories. These quotes just make me tired, listening to them drone on and on.			"

												Ok, let me start this review by saying that I ALMOST did not buy this game because of a bunch of negative reviews here on steam.  People were scaring me and they were making me feel this was a very inaccessable ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2d mobile game wrapped on in a pretty 3d world.  I ALMOST took these bad reviews word for it and then I realized that just about ALL of them have under 2 hours of playtime.   ANYONE WHO GIVES THIS GAME A BAD REVIEW AFTER PLAYING FOR ONLY A FEW HOURS WERE SIMPLY TOO DUMB TO GET ANYWHERE SIGNIFICANT AND THEY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF ONE OF THE MOST WELL THOUGHT OUT PUZZLE GAMES OF ALL TIME.This game is amazing.  Seriously, I am not going to spoil much for you here but there is a LOT to do in this game.  I have been going at this walkthrough and spoiler free so far and it is testing my brain more than braid, portal or anything ever has before.  There is so much to consider when solving these puzzles and finding them.  LOOK AROUND.  I bet you missed dozens of puzzles in plain sight but didnt realize. Progression in this game is crazy.  It must have taken a gigantic brain to map all this out.  serious organizational props to mr.Blow.  This is like the metroid of puzzlers.  You dont unlock upgrades but you do learn things in new areas.  as lame as it sounds, knowledge is the upgrade that you get as you run around this crazy gigantic island.   Something crazy happened today after I figured out all the hedgemaze puzzles in the castle and There is absolutley progress to be made and an end game on this crazy mystery island.   I have my notebook handy and I have been writing down the games laws as I figure them out.  Just when you think you understands the laws of a certain puzzle dynamic, another one gets added and it kind of ♥♥♥♥s with you because you were sure things only work one way, but they dont.  jotting all this stuff down and drawing lines in a noe book heplls a bunchy bunch.Is this game hard to access?  Yup, sure is.  biggest learning curve I have ever encountered.  It is like if someone handed you a ton of puzzles and just walked away. no hand holding at all.    If your brain cannot think outside the box or if you really do not like testing your mental patience, DO NOT GET THIS GAME.  but if you want to witness one of the most intricate, well thought out puzzle games ever and you are up for a challenge, go for it!   amazing game 10/10 "

												I have gotten both achievements and seen both endings, and only have a few puzzles left before 100%. I have throughly enjoyed this game, but I must warn that it is not for everyone. This is a puzzle game first, not a puzzle adventure game. It is not like Myst. It may feel pointless or repeitive if you do not enjoy the puzzles. I do enjoy the puzzles.For me this game is worth full price. I never felt like what I was doing was mindless or repetitive. Every puzzle always felt like it taught me something new or challenged me to use what I knew in different ways. The game's environment is as beautiful as the clever design of these puzzles. Many puzzles seemed to know how I thought and actively cut off paths that I would naturally try to take, instead forcing me to get creative and try something else - this felt very refreshing. There are also several puzzles where your initial solution solves the puzzle but nothing happens, and if you solve the puzzle in a different shape it changes the environment to match how you solved the puzzle. For me this is the most rewarding experience.Not to mention the secrets in the game that blow your mind when you first discover them and then continue to blow your mind as you solve more of them. Many of them are a puzzle to even set up in the first place, and I felt challenged in a different way than the normal puzzles. It is very enjoyable.I only had to look up a walkthrough at two points during the game, and not to solve puzzles that I was stuck on, but instead to find out where to actually find more puzzles to solve.If you enjoy puzzle games like the Portal series and Antichamber, this game is for you. There is minimal story and the focus is expressely on puzzles, and you are free to play any music you want in the background or listen to a podcast etc, or you could just stick with the ambience of the game.If you aren't interested in actually playing the game yourself, you can watch my playthrough here for more in-depth commentary and spoilers:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCsoffCh90oOXDIoHd1PLOd6DkVRMBSV "

												Initial Thoughts on The Witness: This game is amazing. I've only played for 6 hours so far and it has, quite literally, surpassed every expectation I had going in and, interestingly enough, scratched an itch for immersive puzzles that I didn't know I had. The game is beautiful, one of the most beautiful games I've played, but not in the sense of graphical prowsess but in the sense that it really feels as though someone laboured both time and love into sculpting this island (though, in having said that, graphically this game runs like a dream and looks the part (for specs and FPS, check bottom of preliminary review). This is one of those games where I, in good concious, can't spoil or talk about any of the puzzles or what occurs in the game for that would do a great disservice to the experience. All I can say is that if you like puzzles (and, yes, they are varried -- even if they all essentially are the same breed) and if you like immersive experiences, please play this game and please do not spoil it for yourself. This is an experience that needs to be your own. I can't wait to jump back in and see what else I learn.Thoughts on Performance: The game consistently runs well at 60fps (on the high setting) with a GTX970m, i7-4720HQ (2.6ghz) with 8gb RAM loaded from SSD at 1920x1080. Runs fluidly and smoothly and beautifully. A great PC game. Recommended for:Anyone who likes puzzlers. This is, at the very core, and exploratory puzzle game. I'm not sure if there is a legitimate narrative but that isn't what is gripping about this game. You create the narrative with your exploration and puzzle-solving. Do not buy this game if you wanted a game like MYST or a game that isn't fundamentally a puzzle game. The price tag is a bit steep for a puzzle game, yes, but it has been worth it for me so far. Wait for a sale if you are on the fence about the title but this has been one of my personal favourites for the past year.			"

												Do  you enjoy puzzles, open environments. Do you like games that are easy to learn but difficult to master? You should try this game. From the creator of Braid, this is a great example of what an indie company can put out when they follow their imagination and don't have a conglomerate pushing their own agenda. It is remenicant of Myst, but without the complete aimlessness when you encounter new areas. The reliance on a core mechanic always leaves you with a starting place when you hit new puzzles, and makes it easily enjoyable by gamers and non gamers alike.It does not appear to have touch screen support (which is a shame as the interface for the core mechanic would really thrive with this addition), so you will need either a game pad ot a mouse/keyboard combo to play.

												honestly I just wanted to examine the art, their art style is so inspirational and gorgeous. It turns out it's actually just an amazing game. To be fair, yes, I like puzzle games, if you don't then maybe you won't dig it. The mechanics are extremely simple, but also extremely deep. There are puzzles almost everywhere, and basically everything on the island is intentionally placed here or there for a reason. Take your time, explore, see what you can find, there's a lot to see. Some of it is just, uhh, painfully artistic, which should be expected from Mr Blow I guess, but pick up your eyes after you've rolled them out of their sockets and get back to exploring and feeling awesome when you crack a puzzle.

												Think of The Witness as less of a traditional game you might find on steam, as an artistic gameplay showcase. It may seem simple on the surface of just click and drag puzzles to solve, but the way they are presented and taught are absolute genius. The game's art is phenomenal and an absolute necessity for the puzzle solving involved. Playing through this with intentionally no help really made me appreciate all the design decisions around the various puzzles and themes they have scattered throughout. The Witness is slow, repetitive, and you don't get much (if any) of a story out of it, but it's probably one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Some might scoff at the price tag, but I think it's worth every penny.Story time. I had been banging my head against some puzzle with almost no way to solve it that was immediately apparent. Yet, when the envionrment interacted with me just right (shadow, or direct sunlight, or obscuring my line of sight) the solution was right in front of me the whole time. Cracking the puzzles and getting to that ""ah ha!"" step of learning is what The Witness is all about. It's not action-oriented, it's not hipster indie artsy-for-its-own-sake, but it's raw and simple genius.			"

												Some look at this game and see a collection of nearly identical puzzles.  I won't lie to you, you interact with puzzles in mainly one way in this game.  But the logic of the puzzles is so varied and challenging, and the environmental impact on the puzzles is very distinct and keeps a somewhat simple idea really fresh for hours on end.   Most games have a primary way of interacting with the game (in shooters, you shoot, etc.), and The Witness is no different.  But the way in which the game distorts these puzzles, uses them to challenge what you already understand, and incorporates a beautiful environment makes The Witness a memorable and very enjoyable experience.  The world is vast, with lots of places to explore and secrets/easter eggs to find when you want to take a break from the basic puzzle.  The Witness does follow the recent trend of not giving the player much (if any) story directly, instead relying upon the environment and some hidden pieces to build the story of the world.  This approach may not resonate with everyone, but I feel that it fits the story being told.  I'd highly reccomend this game to anyone who like puzzles or wants to think a bit when playing their next video game.  9.5/10			"

												The Witness is a hard game to review: I love it, and I hate it. It is cold and devoid of soul, relying purely on you to learn its vocabulary and internalize its logic. Despite that, it is one of the most meticulously designed and visually stunning games there is. Every texture, reflection, shadow, polygon seems to have a purpose - at a macro level it's almost impossibly interconnected, but you may never find that out. The only hints of a plot are hidden away at the end of tens of hours of puzzles, but you may never even see them. Even still, you will see puzzles in your dreams and in everyday objects for weeks to come. 10/10			"

												A beautiful, immersive game! To be fair there isn't much along the lines of a story, but there is something: some mystery, some history, plenty of discovery and wonder. Where the game shines are the puzzles. It's all about the puzzles, puzzles, puzzles. The reward is often the simple satisfaction of completing the puzzle, of learning something new that can be applied to yet another puzzle. For some this might not be enough, but I felt it was more than enough. This game gave me that ""A ha!"" sensation in a marvelous and all to rare fashion.Those who might say ""well how interesting can it be, isn't it all simple line mazes?"" as I did when I first watched the trailer need not fear. The game is so much more deep than that, one might as well look at a book and say ""well how interesting can it be, isn't it all simple squiggles?"". The depth of the game does not come in a varied interface, as true all the puzzles are interacted with as ""simple line mazes"", but in how many different ways the game presents to think about these seemingly simple interfaces. The progression of the games puzzles is truly masterful. There are no unlocks, really no keys or doors or ""new zones"". The only thing pacing you, or putting the game in any sort of linear flow is generally your ability to understand and solve the puzzles. Symbolic languages and mechanisms that build upon each other that you need to learn and combine to succeed.The game teaches you these languages and mechanisms without words, just through observation and repetition. It's truly genius, and I think could and should be a case study in how to write successful training systems.Highly recommended.			"

This game does have theming as well that I haven't had a chance to see much of yet, but there is more than just puzzles if you look for it. The puzzles are fun and varied and I enjoyed the way you have to figure out the rules for the puzzles yourself. The scenery looks amazing as well, especially the water.			"

												I rarely review or rate games on Steam however I feel compelled to for this game, which is the best game I've played in a very long time.I enjoy puzzle games and remember playing Myst on my first PC as well as the Monkey Island games, The 7th Guest and the like. Games that required a notebook for keeping up with clues and trying to solve large puzzles. This is that kind of game. I unlocked the end game after 439+42 puzzles, and there are still more I'm discovering and working to complete. Those who are saying that it is the same puzzle over and over have not delved far enough to see what is amazing about the game. The puzzles are layered and layered, the starting ones are simple, the end ones are a nightmare, and I was learning and adjusting my thinking all the way to the end.If you are expecting an easy game or something to hold your hand you'd be out of luck here. If you are looking for a serious challenge that gives you a sense of accomplishment, you'll find this is the best game out there for that.			"

												You have to stick around... keep playing. There's more here than what's apparent at first. The puzzles are fun and challenging, the environment is gorgeous and full of mystery, and the way everything unfolds is truly unique and very effective. I love games where you genuinely feel like you've figured something out or unlocked something that was hidden. I'll say the same thing that's been said before...  don't use a guide. Just don't. Everything will become apparent after you've played for a little bit. It's hard to say ""if you've played ____, you'll like this game"" because there's really nothing like it. The closest thing I can say is it's a little bit Myst and a little bit Portal and a little bit Rubick's Cube. Everything mixes together nicely with some incredible graphics to boot. I'm playing on a mid-high end PC and it looks incredible. The high frame rate on PC really makes the world come alive in a way that it doesn't on the PS4. I'm having a great time with the game and I've become addicted to it. Supposedly there's around 80 hours of gameplay... I'm only 17 in, I can't imagine what else I have ahead of me. Highly recommended.			"

												If you don't enjoy puzzles please stay well clear of this game. Off you trot. Bye bye.You're still here? You LIKE puzzles?! Well get on in.The Witness is one man's vision perfectly realized. Having finished the game, I look back to the start of the experience realize just how much I have been taught about how the structure and flow of the puzzles in this game work despite never being offered a single line of instruction to as what the rules are.All puzzles in the Witness are solved by drawing an unbroken line from a circular node, through a maze and into a rounded end point. Interacting with the world in such a consistent manner avoids being repetitive by constantly switching up and adding to the design of the puzzles with masterful execution by the creator Jonathan Blow. In doing so, it also solves a big problem of many puzzle games - pixel hunting. You now know without the need of pressing a button or requiring a cluttered GUI overlay if what you are looking at can be interacted with.Puzzles aside, the game itself looks and sounds beautiful. The visuals are wildly varied between sections of the game, while at the same time still feeling like they belong together on the same island. While (almost) completely devoid of music, a solid ambient soundscape ties the experience together.At first I wondered why the island itself was even necessary. Could the game simply not be a collection of puzzles held accessible by a central menu? Having completed the game, I know understand the opposite to be true. The island is crucial.The Witness is a lovingly crafted puzzle game. I cannot wait to return to the island.			"

												The game is boring. The puzzles are great. The visuals are great. The gameplay is fairly smooth.No music. No real ambient noise. The world feels bright only in appearance. Idk if the melancholy silence is a part of the intended atmosphere, but it sucks. Also there is also no story. At least, no story appears to you within the first hour. Not even a little hint at the possibility of you putting time into the puzzles netting some reward.Basically, the puzzles are challenging. If you're the type of person who has time and energy to solve puzzles with no promise of reward, neither long term nor immediate, then this is a game worth considering. This game boils down to an iOS puzzle game implanted into a pretty 3D landscape.It was boring enough that I opted to go read instead after about an hour.Also, I got it from the Humble Monthly Bundle and thank god because I really considered paying full price for it.

Gamedesign and level design are so close to another, it suits perfectly.2 - You will be surprised by its mysteries. Once you think you've understood how it works, you can always discovers new things, and that's a huge point. Just look up the sky, through the forest, under trees, on the water, and be surprised !It makes you think about how you play a game.3 - Puzzles are well well thought ! The difficulty is well managed. Some zones serve tutorial purposes, whereas others are real challenge.Everything put together, it's a masterpiece, every single detail has a signification.I just love it !To those who say that the game is too expensive, read about how this game was made, and read my comment. It's quite unusual to have indies that expensive on steam. This one simply deserve it. It's a game of a lifetime, made by a small team.			"

												If you like puzzle games, and beautiful stylish high budget ones like Portal or The Talos Principle, this is the game for you. Just like the time mechanics in Braid were layered with more and more aspects and a-ha moments, the seemingly simple ""draw a line puzzle"" keeps being built upon, requiring noticing hints in the world, lateral thinking, and remembering puzzles done earlier. There is no music, just beautiful ambient sounds, which I think is a good choice. While the music in Talos Principle is great, eventually I got tired of it. Graphics are similarly sparse, going for bright, pastel colors and smooth plain surfaces instead of high resolution textures. Think functional archtecture or zen gardens.If I could think of anything to criticise, it would be nice with more achievments for boasting rights and to get a greater sense of progress, it currently only has two achievements, which I suspect are ""completed the game"" and ""found every secret and did every damn puzzle in the game"". But maybe that is another aspect of the minimal, zen like design, teaching you to shed youself of the trappings of modern gaming and appreciate the beautify of the essence.			"

												This is pure genius!I did have utmost respect for Jonathan Blow before. Now that has grown to the level of hero worship, and I do not use the word lightly. What goes on throughout is a testament to both his brilliance and his ability to communicate, even through the most limited of channels. It does take intelligence to admire the game, admittedly. You only get to appreciate the layers of puzzles unraveling if you are able to unravel them. As you progress deeper into the game, you glimpse part of that genius, and in time begin to think alike. You grow and get to expect what comes next, and then you get amazed that the designer did foresee your growth, what path it would take and did prepare for that. You bubble with joy when you see the next surprise, that you deep inside knew was coming, but only realized it after the fact.You get to see the simplest of puzzle ideas, an application of graph theory, grow into an infinite playground in a fractal pattern, always promising to be more in the next step.It is amazing that this level of intricacy can be achieved, in any stretch of time. The development time, long as it may be considering 'industry norms', is nothing, considering this was the end result. It is exciting that yet more artifacts like this may come from Johnathan blow.There are all these complaints, from people who are offended when their intelligence is challenged. People don't play games to feel inadequate, many do when playing this. And many people tend to lash out so as to convince (primarily) themselves that the inadequecy isn't intrinsic. Those who can introspect, can grow, and that denomination is the target audience for this work.I have seen comparisons with Portal and Talos Principle. Games that fall far behind their promise (especially in the case of Portal). The puzzles were kept simple, as a design decision -to appeal to a wider audience, when they could be so much more. No punches are pulled here. The premise is extended far, far beyond what could initially be imagined.There are complaints that you have to use pen and paper. False: You also need a pencil and an eraser. The puzzles are so intricate that some of them would give you a headache if you tried to keep all aspects of it in your head, even if you were named von Neumann, and that is by design. If you think that is bad, this game is definitely not for you.I have seen comments that this is a disappointment after Braid. Ridiculous, I think: This game contains the seed that made Braid great: the ever-evolving puzzles, the extension of a simple mechanic to both technical and symbolic extremes, and the philosophical sense of wonder behind. Likewise it contains what made Myst great: The sense of exporation and loneliness in an alien environment, and the devious, ingenious, and original puzzles. Myst was never about the patchwork mythology pasted on it afterwards. This work captures the 'abstract' in them both, where most people merely grasp and look for the veneer, the packaging. I tried to avoid and spoilers throughout, but here I will give the whiff of one: The game _explicitly tells_ this fact within, showing that 'the dev team thinks of everything', even what most people will fail to grasp, and the few will.I have seen someone complaining when they learned to do something, and looked forward to 'apply elbow grease' to solve others like it was frustrated when 'the rules arbitrarily changed' in the next step. That is the point here, really. That was Blow's promise all along: There won't be any repetition, any 'application of elbow grease'. You won't ever get to turn off your brain and proceed through muscle memory -or its cognitive equivalent. Aside from some tutorial bits (where the whiners haven't even got past) the game always keeps you on your toes, always offers something fresh. This gripe, of course, contradicts with another that has been raised: That the game is repetitive. Well, only if you cannot see the puzzles for what they are and all you can comprehend is lines and boxes.There are those who whine about not getting rewarded. That's pitiful, for it shows that the people have become so dependent on the Skinner boxes that dominate the industry, not only need but also explicitly want the base gratification offered by them, for accomplishing trivial tasks. Here the gratification is in the puzzle itself: Admiring the beauty of one's own work in the solution, getting a nontrivial thing done, and getting to see the next puzzle. That is not to say there are no climaxes and revelations, they are just scarce enough to be really significant and deeply satisfying. And supposed dead ends are, more likely than not, part of some greater puzzle that you might get to see hours later.And in all that freshness, there is an amazing amount of content. It was immensely satisfying to get the endgame after 13 hours of play, and I believe I did very good time there. There wasn't the disappointment of it being over either: There is so much more to explore yet. And the game did make the promise with puzzles that -at the time- I could not fathom, teasing to come back after I did grow.Now all I hope for is for Blow to begin working on his next project immediately, and with utmost pace. I do believe he is a font that contains more to give than a lifetime of giving would suffice.---Slight spoiler, so beware:Seen the ending, then dove back in to complete the obvious extra objective. Done that, and when admiring the island in satisfaction, saw a curious little detail. Clicked around just for fun and got my mind blown. Chased the lead, and am feeling overwhelmed for the first time since the beginning. There are so many layers, and the sheer amount of detail makes one think that the developers _lived_ on the island all this time, to get it all 'just right'.			"

Granted, new patterns and various twists are introduced to continually increase the puzzle's difficulty and ambiguity; and of course you get to walk around the island looking for all the instances of the puzzle; and the island's environment occasionally provides necessary clues -- but however pleasant and intriguing the island is, it doesn't come close to compensating for the frustration nor, ultimately, for the sheer boredom of working on those difficult, but uninteresting, trace-the-path puzzles.

												It's not perfect, but what it does right, it does VERY right. Certainly the Witness is the best puzzle exploration game since Myst. The environment and art style, for example, are beautiful, colorful, and uplifing. In fact I even think this game has singlehandedly cured my Seasonal Affective Disorder and am curious how video games like The Witness could help people as therapy to deal with depression and other mental disorders. In any case I wholeheartedly appreciate the many ways the landscape bleeds and meshes into the very puzzles themselves. I've played this game for hours and hours and have certainly gotten my moneys worth and I haven't even scrateched the surface of beating the game yet. Looking forward to more great games from this developer			"

												What a beautiful game! Puzzle interface design is top notch. No music. It is a clever game that makes you think you are clever too, and maybe you indeed are :)  Very difficult, expect to take notes on real paper, make screenshots, think for dozens of minutes about some puzzles (and there is hundreds of them), but it is also very rewarding experience, when your mind clicks :)Environment at times is so beautiful that it beats many AAA titles by a mile, despite rather minimalistic yet colorful graphics.Whitness is the Dark Souls of puzzle games, let’s hope next game will be Bloodborne of puzzles genre.

												At about 2.5 hours in and a couple frustrating (in the best possible way) moments later I had to stop to write a review. Somehow this game is only ""Mostly Positive"" and it seems the people who are not pleased have some sort of surround sound bug (legitimate complaint) or simply played for an hour, maybe two and never reached a complex puzzle, never asked a single question, ""What is that?"" ""Why am I here?"" ""How do I get there to do that?"" There's no spoon feeding here. You must work your way through and you must want to do so. The game is absolutely beautiful, and there are many subtle sounds and visual ques along the way which add to the whole vibe the game seems to be working toward. I have already taken several screen shots and I expect to take many many more by the end of the game. It's simply stunning.So unless you're not a puzzle gamer, or you've got legit concerns about your surround sound headphones... this game is fully worth the full price. 10/10 Best single player game I've played in a while!

												This puzzle game has some entertaining puzzles to solve. However, you will very quickly realize that it only has one type of puzzle. It has nothing but walking around and solving a different take on the same puzzle several dozen times. Along with its lack of different puzzles, it lacks music for most of the game, and it doesn't have any real payoff for solving the puzzles except to continue.If you like puzzles, I recommend only buying it on sale and listing to a book or podcast while you play.

												It's a beautiful puzzle game with fantastic art and some excellent puzzles, but I can't say it's worth forty dollars. The lack of any kind of narrative whatsoever means it's basically a set of puzzles with a pretty skin (admittedly, very pretty).The puzzles are solid, and although your interaction is limited to walking around and drawing lines, the puzzles do involve the environment, more than you expect at first glance.It's not an adventure, it's not a story, but it's a solid collection of puzzles to get your brain going. I'd recommend buying it on sale.			"

												I wish steam had a little more then yes or no to recomindations cuse my recomendations is sort of and I'm haveing trouble if I want it be yes or no. Also fyi I have compleated everything in the game with no walthrough. The only thing I didn't do was get all the collectables cuse I really have no interest in doing that.Basicly the magic of this game is that it is a puzzle game with an exstreamly smooth difficulty curve. Towords the end your are solving puzzles that are exstreamly challenging and you probly didn't notice when this game suddenly got hard. This is supper impressive and requires remarkable game designe wich this game has in spades. And it's dubbly impressive that the game teaches all of it's many complex ruls through gameplay making the tutoriouls the most intertaing sections cuse you truely feel like you are getting better and smarter. To get an idea of how the puzzle sections work think portal if glados wasn't telling you what to do (I don's say myst cuse the story/puzzle mix those games have is non-exestent here like portal those two things are keept in seprate boxes in the witness). what was trully amazing is that even though the island small in size and by the end of it I knew where everything was and what was the quickest path to get there every time I passed through and area I had been before I would notice something new. So if you haven't decided yes I'm going to buy this game based on what I said above I don't think this game's for you cuse plot and world is where this game compleatly falls apart in my opionon and to call it pretentous is being too kind. Basicly the world feels lifeless beacuse there is no music and verry little animation. For the vast majority of the game the only real hints as to what this island is are audio files with quoats from famous pepole about religon/ science and when you get basicly to the end and it's a little (I stress a little) clearer as to the actual plot.But even after that the story feels chep and hollow. The writter of the game seems to be trying to make a profound statment about how games can be more then entertainment and can be enlightening/meaningful (I agree) but when there dosn't appear any original thoughts of the developers own in the story it just made me feel like the hollow story was extra hollow.I've come to expect from a game that wants me to spend 30+ hours in it's world I want that world to ether be a world I want to be in or a world that is teaching me something. I feel like the developer despritly wanted to teach me something but lacked the currage or cofidence to tell me something that wasn't directly taken from well respected philosiphers or the like and if I was interested in that I'd just go to the source. If the argument was that I wouldn't hear these quoats or thoughts otherwise I find that insulting and would rather my games not insult me.As to the complaints that the game is $40 those complaints are pritty stupid. The game is masterfuly crafted with lots of original content. Sure it's no the same level of content as say skirym or something like that but something this original takes extra effort and there was probbly a lot correctly on the cutting room floor as the delopers were feeling outside the normal gernra norms. I feel like if the game story and or overaching levels came together better in the end like a myst or something like that I'd say $40 is a steal but as it is I think it may be a little over priced but if you see this for $30 you'll get your $'s worth so $40 day one is fine by me.Final not the 2nd achevent without spoiling anything was the most stressful/fun thing I've had to do in a video game in years so for me my time with the game was enjoyable but objectivly the game is overly lopsided.

												The Witness is a puzzle game, yes, but it is also about learning, discovery, philosophy, religion, understanding yourself and the world. This is both a game, and art, and if you are a person who enjoys repeated ""Ah Ha!"" moments, this is the game for you. Rich in depth and beauty, any ""ending"" of the game merely unlocks new areas that remain to be discovered. Completing the ""main area"" took about half the time as every other thing I subsequently discovered, and I still am awed by the beauty and intricate details that I continue to find scattered purposefully around this island.You will not like this game if your idea of fun is blowing stuff up, shooting zombies or nazis, racing quickly, trash talking, achievement hoarding, a talky-story (although there is excellent spoken dialog), or instant rewards for solving the tiniest challenge. This is a thinking game, a game about enlightnment and what it means to understand, fully, pretty much anything. Some complained that $40 was too expensive. I feel it is too cheap, because the takeaways are probably equivalent to college courses on mathematics, logic, science, philosophy, and comparative religion, rolled into a highly entertaining experience.

												In many ways I don't feel qualified to write about this game. First of all I cheated. Out of the 300 puzzles I cleared to finish this game (out of about 700, I believe) I had to look up solutions for maybe 5-10% of that. Therein lies the shame, and the act of playing into the developer's hand of being an illogical being, driven by comfort rather than intellectual curiosity. Games have long conditioned us to look for help if we are stuck and to fully resort to the helping hand in such a predicament; this instead of our own ability or logic. Realizing this you are swiftly thrown into discomfort, playing The Witness. Because the game has a logic to it, but you can only rely on yourself to figure out the system in play. The mechanics are obscured by non-knowledge, but that's what makes this game so unique, and what constitutes its elegance and beauty as a game. I can't say that I have played a game that has required as much of me as The Witness. It requires trust and dedication, trusting that the game is working properly, that when you do not know something, that is what the game intends. And the only way a game can pull something like that off is with having absolutely impeccable game-design. There can't be any tricking of the player, in any sense. Blow mentions in an interview that he does not want to trick the player into feeling smart, which he never does with this game, but more so I think it's important to not trick the player into feeling dumb. Once a player start to doubt his or her own ability to solve something due to a lack of information, it's over. But even in this regard I think that The Witness succeeds in making the player feel like the answer of any puzzle lies within the game itself. My problems mainly arose when I knew that I didn't know, because I knew I disregarded certain places of the game where I felt like I couldn't grasp the logical rule-sets, or where I couldn't get over the leaps of logic even after I looked up solutions for certain puzzles. I conceded, there was no real trust in my own ability. That and my impatience lead to a certain mistrust of the game. But with this view back on myself, I see that the problem is not with the game-design, it is with me.Because I can't stress this enough, this game is elegant in a way I have never seen before. It is a self-sufficient game. It's cyclical, it is an exercise in the Nietzschean return. Repetition of fleeting activities, grasping at shadows of pleasure, the attempt to make something out of nothing, personal progression, are all parts of this game. Narratively, visually and according to the mechanics we are witnessing the eternal return of our activities as human beings, our purpose as lifeforms. The Witness adumbrates a great deal of humanity, an intimacy that becomes so much closer despite the distance required when viewing ourselves existentially. The Witness is this incredible holistic experience that encapsulates the art of game-design without profusion. It is clinical, precise and executed perfectly, which you will notice with enough trust in the game-design and with enough appreciation for game-creation. At the heart of this game – what is really the core of this experience, to me – is what goes on in your head, and what this game requires of you as a person; as a mind among minds, as a human being with intelligence. What I noticed fairly early on was my desperate need to vocalize the principles that each puzzle was run by. I had to vocalize this intuitively logical puzzle, just to wrap my head around what was required. This is not something I've ever really experienced before in games, and I was surprised to see it come out in a medium that is not often lauded for its intellectuality. Because this process of vocalizing or making conscious and intuitive form of intelligence puts it in the view of self-conscious scrutiny. This is a quality that can be very valuable for people in general, and in its own way The Witness has the possibility of teaching it. What I referred to earlier in terms of elegance, was in regards to the game-design, puzzle-design and the comportment of this game. This elegant restraint and non-compromise with the idiocy of the gamer's conditioned need for help, bleeds into its over all presentation. There is almost no music or extravagant sound-design, but runs the gamut of beautifully suiting each situation with an aural atmosphere that never feels empty nor mawkishly musical. It's this portrayal of life as “doing”, as functionality and concreteness. Every sound has its place, it springs out of the movement of the player and has a natural flow to it that in accordance with the visuals manage to structure a believable holistic world. Every facet goes with the theme of an encapsulation of being within something very fleeting, finding familiarity in a world that you're thrown into and out of, at least for the moment being. While this is the attempt, at least seemingly, it is hindered by self-hatred spawned out of inability. That is, however, limited to the dynamics of the individual, to what is deemed subjective. The Witness succeeds in creating a stimulating world in all senses of that word, to all senses. In terms of visuals, I struggle to think of a game I think is more beautiful than this. In terms of composition, level design, environment, colors and lighting, it's out of this world, but more worldly than most games. There is this marriage between naturalism and human influence, between nature and machine, between natural colors and vibrant neon, between vocalized LOGIC AND VISUAL CUES. When I get some time I am going to revisit this game with a fresh mind. I am not going to look up solutions and I am going to wholly dedicate myself to this experience. The Witness is incredible, and unless this game spawns a trend of games following in its footsteps, we will most likely not see anything quite like this in a very long time. I'm the type of person to be subjugated under things I consider to be more intelligent than me, and this game falls under that category. That means I am naturally inclined to praise it, solely due to the fact of it being “above me”. I have yet to master this game, even though I have beaten it, I don't feel like I have beaten it, and I that alone makes me impressed. I do not feel finished with the game, I couldn't happily move on from this game. Because I know there is more to it. I know there is more to learn and that curiosity will drive me back to this experience. And I think that is special. Especially special enough to warrant a recommendation.I believe this is a game where the more time you dedicate to it the better it gets and the more fulfilling it becomes. It simulates and portrays the essence of human – even personal – progression in so many ways and so perfectly, and it has so many moments of beauty and immense respect before the creator. If If I were to inhabit this world as my only existence I'd bow down in eternal love for its creator. I respect this creation and most of all I appreciated the experience. It was okay.  "

												It's difficult talking about this game without spoiling something important.This game is made of puzzles, linear puzzles. It's always the same mechanic (almost) yes but after an hour that you'll play this and start to resolve some puzzle you will start to notice something, and every step you'll do from this moment will be a new discover and the magic/mistery about this island will start to embrace you.Really one of the most beautiful experience in the history of gaming, really you'll see what means 8 years of love and developement.The game is difficult, has a TON of secrets, puzzles and easter eggs furthermore everything is related and the learning/teaching curve is excellent so you'll become better at the game during the experience.This game is the Dark souls of puzzle games.

												This games puzzles are generally harder than the talos principle and that can get you somewhat frustrated if you don't like that kind of increasing difficulty.Each area has a variation of the same 2D puzzle and they will present you that variation over and over increasing the difficulty. That also makes you feel like the game is repeating the same puzzle.I've played 5h so far and enjoyed the game. I was expecting something more in the adventure puzzle line, but this one has been quite fun, but I would recommend you to watch a gameplay video first before buying. It's not because you like puzzle games that you are going to like this one.I'd say that if you enjoyed playing ""hook"" and ""lyne"" games, then you will probably like this one.			"

It is a metaphor to life: puzzles are not just found in the game. They are found all over the island, and all around us in real life. If we put our minds to something, there is no puzzle tha we can't solve. From finding the entire underground cave system to leisurely solving puzzles, this game is a complete and udder masterpiece.

												I got The Witness after reading mixed reviews and I can now see why. I'm a huge fan of puzzles and open world exploration, and the ideas in this game are masterfully clever - but I don't think it's a good game.I never got tired of the core gameplay - the variety of puzzles available surprised me, actually, and it requires a lot of lateral thinking to get through them. However, I found myself on several occasions unable to progress because I hadn't noticed a very slight detail, even though nothing I was doing was wrong. You don't need to complete every puzzle to win, but it's still frustrating.My main complaint is with the ending. After a final round of puzzles that test everything you know up to that point, the game ends with two timed puzzles that are randomly created. Everything else in the game you can look up a solution if you just want to experience the next part of the game, so gating the ending to only those able to figure out a solution - and it's timed - feels petty to me. It didn't make the puzzles harder, it didn't challenge me differently, it just keeps the ending away from anyone who can't solve it. That, to me, is hugely arrogant game design.Then, after you watch the end cutscene, it puts you back at the beginning of the game. I now have the choice of playing from the beginning of the game with all progress cleared, or going back to one hour before I won. Not saving right before the end, in a game I assume partially made to comment on the player's obsession with completion, was just a little insulting.I enjoyed playing but I won't play again. It's maybe a $7-$10 game. Not worth it unless there's a really good sale.			"

												I was really excited for this game when I first heard about it since I love puzzle games like Myst, The Room series, etc. But 40 dollars is too much for this game, way too much. This game tricks you with all of its pretty colors and mysterious imagery, you think you are going to be interacting with cool things in the environment like you do in The Room and Myst, but no... It is ♥♥♥♥ing mazes. All ♥♥♥♥ing mazes. This whole game is mazes. Sure they do a few creative things with the mazes but after a while they get so ♥♥♥♥ing boring. It ends up being really hard maze puzzle after really hard maze puzzle after really hard maze puzzle... rinse and ♥♥♥♥ing repeat. It really kills the game, the bordom and repetition. It was so disappointing. When you find yourself looking up solutions to the puzzles, not because they are too hard, but because they are ♥♥♥♥ing boring and time consuming, then your puzzles have ♥♥♥♥ing failed. The best thing about this game is the (Spoiler) environmental puzzles. The first time you find one, it just blows your mind! That is where the game really starts to shine, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing about it is that once you get all the environmental puzzles it does absolutely nothing. It is so disappointing.This game borders on the pretentious. It is more a work of art than a game, and I think that is what kills it. There is no satisfying ending or closure of any kind. Sure there is a eureka moment when you realize what The Witness is about, but the problem is that that happens halfway through the game. The rest of the game after that point is just pointless. The game treats it's puzzles like they themselves are the reward for solving them. Which would be fine, if the ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles were interesting instead of just ♥♥♥♥ing mazes! I am an artist, and I went to art school, I understand what this game saying. The problem is is that it is just boring.This game ended up making me depressed, and not like a good kind of depressed like games like The Last of Us pull off. The Witness just makes you feel depressed, that this mysterious, colorful, and breathtaking world didn't live up to your expectations, that the second half of the game is pointless, the endings offer no closure whatsoever. And there is something else that I just can't quite put my finger on as to why this game made me feel bad. I just can't explain it. I guess it was just the disapointment. I was hyped for this game, and I thought it was going to be something it wasn't. In the end this game feels more like you are in a contemporary art gallery than a world with a story that wants to be told. It is very subjective in it's interpretations. It is a mystery without an answer and it shows you that what matters is not finding out the answers, what matters is searching for those answers. I personally love these kinds of concepts. They are not normally explored in media like video games, and now I understand why that is. Boredom. The Witness isn't about what happens at the end, it is about how you get there, but like I said prior, that would be fine if how you get there wasn't through hundreds of boring maze puzzles.			"

												Played on PS4, so playtime is inaccurate.After around 70 hours, I finally completed all of it. I absolutely love The Witness. Some people may be turned off by the ""line puzzles,"" wondering the need for the world itself around them. But for many, there are reasons. Big reasons. Here the environment is the puzzle, the panel is where you put your answer. And then there are even more secrets within the surroundings to find. Explaining any further would spoil these discoveries.There are also puzzles that don't use the environment, teaching you many of the rules of this game that will be used and built upon in the future. It won't tell you how to do them though, this game is as much about learning the puzzle as it is about solving the puzzle. But the answers are there. It can be a very hard game when it wants to, but it's never unfair. If you're stuck, the open world is great to look around and solve other puzzles.And the art direction is just incredible, sometimes I'll just stare at how pretty everything is. You'll quickly notice the amount of detail put into it and how much thought was put into where and how everything was placed. I mean, look at this small blog post:http://the-witness.net/news/2015/06/polishing-the-architecture/Don't expect much story, though you can piece some together. This game is pure puzzle. No hand holding and no ""Good jobs."" A game about observation, epiphany and logic that wants you to learn instead of being told. If you like puzzles, especially difficult ones, play it.			"

												Worst kind of puzzle is such that you can solve but you have to jump through hoops to execute your solution. This game is full of it. I liked some types of puzzles but the game started to feel like a chore after few hours.Some of the environmental puzzles are interesting but that does not make them fun. There is a lot of   clever mechanics that is used well but once you cracked it, demonstrably prove it by doing a few puzzles of the same kind, and want to move on, the game throws a ton of more of the same thing.The lack of sound is terrible and gets annoying but if you listen to something during the jungle section you will miss the cues.Definitely not interested in finishing it. Not because the puzzles are too hard but because it feels tedious. There does not seem to be much to the background of the game either. The whole thing just comes off as pretentious and self serving.What absolutely put me off was the sandy pyramid section, where the puzzle is positioning yourself relative to lightsources while the game makes absolutely sure you waste a lot of time on it. That's not a puzzle and along with other 'position yourself to find the solution' is just busytime. I then started to notice it all over the place until it got on my nerves.I think that what it breaks down to is the fact that there is no reward. You do 10 puzzles, your reward is 10 more of the same puzzle.			"

												Are you curious? Can you be patient? If both are yes, go buy this game. If not, you could skip this game, but I promise this game is worth the effort. Just know what you're getting yourself into.I can already tell that The Witness is easily one of the best games I've ever played in my lifetime. I'm roughly 5 hours in and I can't get enough. I'll fully flesh out this review at some point, but I thought it important to put my initial impressions up as soon as possible. Without meaning to offend, it seems clear that most of the negative reviews I've skimmed through, simply don't get it. StoryThe Witness is not about being told a 'story', at least not in a traditional sense. It is a contemplative, meandering conversation between designer and player. It's about uncovering a story yourself, through hours of patience and curiosity. There are so many mysteries to uncover: what is this island, who were its inhabitants, what the heck is with all of these puzzles? I've only barely scratched the surface, and I am more than intrigued. I'm excited for more, and without being spoon fed the answers. PuzzlesSaying that the maze puzzle mechanics are repetitive is like complaining that an FPS is repetitive because it makes you fire guns, or driving games are repetitive because you drive cars. The maze puzzles work BECAUSE they are the backbone of all of the puzzle solving. They give your brain a filter through which to receive all of the information that you collect by completing other puzzles or simply exploring the environment. It would be impossible for the puzzles to have the depth that they do if it weren't for the maze structure. The puzzles are beyond fantastic, a masterclass in puzzle design. They are always varied, always making you question assumptions, and always building upon the accumulated lessons that you've acquired. It's your brain that levels up, not your character. Truly brilliant stuff! Yes, they are crazy fun; yes, at times they are pretty frustrating; and yes, you probably should get out the old pen and paper once in awhile. They are more than worth it.This game challenges not only you as a player, but the entire medium of gaming itself. Come at it from a place of patience, curiosity, and a dash of discipline, and you will experience on of the most rewarding experiences gaming has to offer. "

												If you want to suss out the meaning on your own, be warned that there are potential spoilers ahead.A lot of people are getting frustrated with the game, and it seems to be because they are overlooking what it is actually trying to convey.That's right, The Witness isn't just goading you to solve puzzles, it's goading you to think about what solving those puzzles means.While I haven't finished it yet, I can tell you that the puzzles are integral to understanding the core ideas behind The Witness. It is through the interplay of your actions, the scenery, and the audio that you can begin to understand the deep meaning that Blow was trying to convey. It shows a startling and absolutely genius understanding of how the human mind works, and how different types of thought give rise to different types of meaning--while also tying those different types of meaning together. It is not an action game by any means, because it is meant to be played at your leisure. People are used to plowing through games like a cheap buffet, but this is a feast and must be taken slowly. If you allow your mind to relax, the puzzles and meaning will fall into place--and that is an exciting and rewarding moment.Really, what Blow has done is create a game that helps you realize and understand just how much thought went into figuring out the world around us. At times I can even imagine what some of the great thinkers from the audio clips might have felt when a deep meaning or new understanding has finally clicked into place (probably a bit like it feels to finally solve a game puzzle that has eluded you).And it is exactly this that makes the game what it is. It is not just for your entertainment, it is meant to teach you something that the convenience of modern life has caused many to forget about humanity: that it took a lot of careful thought, daydreaming, and work--from many people throughout history--to get us to where we are. Sometimes it feels like you're playing inside a book (or someone's head), and I've never played a game that is so fully immersive.If you are looking for action, look elsewhere. If you want to play a game that rises to the level of great art: play The Witness.			"

												The Witness is a great puzzle game. It's the first game in a long time that I've actually wanted to take notes for while I play (screenshots + annotations maybe?).  The puzzles start out simple and just keep gaining more layers.  Playing the game feels like being on your own personal ""Lost"" Island.  It has a bit of a myst feel to it as well.  Overall, I'd highly recommend this game if you enjoy puzzle games!			"

Then puzzles start to combine several of them, making it harder and harder.Think of the puzzles as a way to interact with the environment. Where other games might have a simple switch or a button, this one has a panel featuring a puzzle.			"

												I have loved puzzle games since Myst. I loved Braid.  The first few areas of this game were intriguing and the puzzles were fun. But quickly the puzzles become tedious & boring, drawing line after line after line with zero reward for yoru accomplishment. I've completed plenty of puzzlers with little to no cheating.  I will say these puzzles become head scracthers with no clues or hints on how to solve them unless you get lucky, Google, or mayb eyou can read the creators mind. Glad I bought this on sale for $24 and even that was over priced.			"

												The Witness has pretty scenery but is strictly for hardcore puzzle loving Myst addicts. Playing it feels way too much like work.There is crap you can unlock which presents you with various half-baked philosophy ideas but they won't challenge you much. You'll either simply agree or simply disagree. But the Talos Principle is much better in this area: it actually tries to get you to really engage with the ideas it presents rather than having them float past you as a passive observer.I think this comment I made on Reddit pretty much sums up my thoughts on this game:""The Witness IS NOT made for instant gratification. Neither were 19th century novels. The difference is that when you get to the end of a 19th century novel, you've got something intellectually substantive and thought provoking you've completed, while when you get to the end of The Witness, you've done several hundred trivial puzzles involving lines and dots.""

												I thought I was the dumbest person in the world when I finally solved the puzzle - the solution was so simple, all along! Then, later on, there was another puzzle, the rules of which were different. I solved it immediately and felt like a genius. Combining the rules of those puzzles I constructed a solution to a third puzzle. My doing so opened a locked door. The door led me to an underground cavern lit by torches and full of mysteries waiting to be examined.It's beautiful. It's complicated. It's difficult, but sometimes - inexplicably - not.It's The Witness.			"

WARNING: If you are colorblind or slightly deaf and cannot either differentiate certain colors or differentiate sounds, STAY AWAY. There are MANY puzzles that REQUIRE that you differentiate colors and the difference in pitch of sound and if you are any sort of color blind or deaf, this game will not be your thing. I would LOVE if there were color blind options but unfortunately that would RUIN the game.Mazes? What fun!Bored of weird stories in puzzle games like Talos Principle and Portal? Want a Myst-esque experience but felt the ""story"" was non-essential? Do you just want difficult puzzles with various mechanics that will tax your brain? DO YOU LIKE DRAWING LINES?The Witness is an open-world puzzle game where you, the Player, enter an island that is littered with grid panels that are individual puzzles (most of the time). These puzzles begin at the disc shape and end at a curved point and the objective is to draw a line from the disc to the end. As simple as this sounds, the game makes this challenging by adding rules to the grids which you must follow carefully otherwise you will fail. Some of these rules are you must separate the black and white squares, you must draw the line over all the hexagons etc. Meanwhile there is also something strange about the island which you may or may not notice (you mostly will, it's in your face half the time).Story(?)There is a story... kind of. If you're expecting a linear narrative that goes from A to B then it's not here. In fact the only narrative you get is from narrations of quotes from various famous intellectuals that are strewn about the world in the fashion of audio logs. These really don't mean anything and most of what's happening will have to be pieced together. I'll say right now, there's no logic in what's happening so don't look for it. You're not there for a reason (not really) and what's told to you (or shown) doesn't matter to what you do. For all intents and purposes, you are on an island and there are puzzles so go solve them.Sound?There's barely any music in the entire game. The ambient sounds are very well recorded and play well into the game and are sometimes integrated into the puzzles. But my one criticism in this department (barebones as it is) is there's no volume adjustment AT ALL in the game. At times, especially in confined spaces the ambient sounds are way too loud and it gets close to becoming a horror game despite there being NOTHING to be afraid of.GraphicsThis game is EXCEEDINGLY beautiful. This is a pretty big open island with various themed areas that tie in to the type of puzzles in that area. Areas have been carefully crafted with many weird and interesting details that make you wonder what more is littered around. The textures are stylized and I feel the visual will most certainly hold up in a few years' time.GameplayAs I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is almost entirely the player tracing lines across grids placed at various locations, each with some rule that bends the nature of the puzzle. The puzzles are mostly fair with certain tutorial-esque sequential panels laid out at various locations that teach you a single mechanic which you will then use in other grids. Some grids will activate certain elements in the world such as gates or other grid panels which you will then use to move forward. I would say a good 95% of the puzzles are fair with few of them requiring you go out of the way to look for a clue around you as some of them use the environment extensively. There are definitely the occasional completely ridiculous and unfair puzzles but in the hundreds panels I've solved, there are maybe 10 that are just unfair. Towards the end there are some panels that made me motion-sick and some that gave me a headache which I'd rather just weren't in the game. One frustrated me so much physically that I didn't bother figuring it out and just looked it up because I felt weird and if I were an epileptic, I'd have a seizure. In most matters regarding the puzzles, the game is highly polished almost to a straight sheen. You cannot move where the game doesn't want you to and there is ONE method to solve each of the puzzles though there may be multiple actual solutions.My biggest gripe with the game is there is some sense of the game not respecting your time. There is no fast travel and the game requires you move across this island numerous times especially since you may come across a puzzle whose solution is not obvious because you haven't learned to solve it yet. There are also MANY moving platforms that move SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SLOWLY. Sometimes they move slowly for a reason but it's still hard to justify especially when the movement of the platform is  tied to a puzzle in itself meaning you have to ""re-solve"" the puzzle to move it.ConclusionThis is a fantastic puzzle game that requires you use your wits to solve. One issue is that there's no real sense of satisfaction of solving many of these puzzles aside from the satisfaction of solving it itself. If you're the kind of guy that solves Sudoku puzzles for fun, you may LOVE this game. If you like puzzle games in general, I recommend you check it out. At $40, this is quite steep (the asking price is because the devs spent almost 6 years crafting it and feel that's fair) so I'd recommend it at 25-50% off. At $30, it's fair and at $20 it's worth every penny.			"

Not sure who thought it was a good idea to make a puzzle game that will eventually require a notebook and pen. That is so annoying.There is no reward for completing puzzles and it's not intuitive at all.Pros: I like the art styleCons:Puzzles are almost always the same with very minor differencesBasically no storyline apart from some people talking about basic philosophyNo reason to keep playing, as this game doesn't reward youThe game is that boring, I am uninstalling after barely 2hours of play.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

												Pros:  Starts simple, adds complexity quickly.  Very clever. And I mean very. Epiphanies everywhere.  Not hand-holdy at all.  Kicks you down and expects you to get back up.Cons:  No obvious storyline and no really gratifying ending.  Some truly terrible puzzles near the end.  Kicks you down and expects you to get back up.Play this game if you love solving puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles and challenging the mind, and not for some clear end goal or storyline gratification. The core puzzle concept couldn't be simpler, and yet the complexities that are introduced are truly wow-inducing. A huge part of this game is knowing when to walk away from a seemingly impossible puzzle and come back after picking up the necessary knowledge. I found this refreshing, but others will find it infuriating. There was a sequence of disappointingly uncreative puzzles near the end that literally gave me a headache, and I would've really liked a tangible plot. All in all, I loved the journey and had a blast solving the huge variety of clever puzzle mechanics. Pick up this game when it's on sale for $20.			"

												This is the best puzzle game I've played in years. There's so many things to do and the whole game is a work of art. The difficulty ramps up nicely as it forces you to explore different parts of the beautiful landscape, pieces of which can also be puzzles. The puzzles consist of drawing patterns onto all sorts of different objects to perform several different kinds of tasks. If you see something that absolutely baffles you, just keep walking because there's simpler puzzles that will explain it to you later.I highly recommend this if you're in the mood for a bright colored diversion that will make you think.

												Genius. There, I said it.For everyone who said Jonathan Blow's writing in Braid was ""pretentious"" I would submit that this problem is addressed in The Witness by the fact that they're all quotes from actual historical figures of some merit (mostly.)The audio logs and videos do tell a story, but it's the story of the perpetual, fundamental tug-of-war between knowledge and experience. I'm a hardcore empiricist and skeptic. I Loved the Burke and Feynman videos. But even though the Gangaji and Spira speeches are total crazy-making garbage, there's a tiny grain of truth behind them. There is nothing of empirical value there; in fact, the content is demonstrably false. But they do present a way of approaching experience that is meditative and slow. Along with all of the audio logs from religious figures, they point at a way humans experience existence that is not empirical, and which has some value, in that it tells us something about experience itself.I say this because attempting to solve all the puzzles in a sitting is almost impossible. You have to walk away, possibly even for an extended period, and come back. Let your brain rest and reset. I got stuck and unstuck many times, having to walk away, sometimes for a day. And certainly, the environmental easter eggs do require you to walk around with your eyes open and your finger off the run button. The Tarkovsky video clip is a perfect metaphor, as well as a demonstration. I'm a big fan. I've seen several of his films and they are not for the impatient. In a footrace between Tarkovsky and Bela Tarr, I wonder if they would compete to see who could finish last.The game mechanics are a perfect reflection of the knowledge/experience dichotomy. While direct experience has no empirical value, it does directly affect our human ability to process information. And the game is also perfectly consistent: Empirical knowledge (the puzzles) leads to more empirical knowledge (more puzzles.) Turning all of the columns white does...nothing of any measurable value, other than the experience itself. Noteworthy is that it is necessary to solve all of the puzzles in order to have all of the environmental experiences. So I ask you, what has more value to human existence?That's what The Witness is asking, and demonstrating.Also, it's super fun. But then, I also enjoy Tarkovsky.Also, The Challenge under the mountain is awesome. If you haven't completed that, you're missing out. The final video it unlocks is a sly wink at the whole project (664 puzzles? Really? Cute.) Again, Blow didn't write it. "

												I was one of the people making a racket both over the price of the game, and its content, perceived oversimplification of gameplay and lack of Myst-like features. Why is this a thumbs up, then?I simply believe the game keeps its secrets too well hidden from its potential audience, to the point where it becomes a fault. The thing is, it's not just that the line drawing puzzles escalate to amazing depth over time, it's also that there is an entire extra layer of depth and interaction and revelation inside The Witness that the dev never even hints at and all professional reviews do a really poor job underlining.Outside of the (admittedly excellent) panel puzzle sequence that progresses the game, there is an extra intricate layer of gameplay that exists outside of the physical panels that you solve. I feel this is something you might have a hard time spotting in your 2-hour jittery Steam refund window. But I feel that it's important that people know that this layer IS THERE and it's much more mind-boggling than the actual panel puzzles.There is a ton of other secrets within secrets and little surprises and feelings and meanings that I have not yet discovered despite watching some mild-to-medium spoilers before I purchased. It was those spoilers that won me over.Even though I've seen and read fascinating things, I can see there is a wealth of extra content, layers and meanings that I have yet to uncover, in addition to all those mind-bending puzzle grids. The whole point of The Witness is not to solve a sufficient number of panels and trigger an ending. To me it's all about peeling back as many layers of mystery and meaning and feeling as you can and enjoying the process as best you can.			"

												You definitely need to approach this game with an open mind. It's essentially puzzles for the sake of puzzles. A bare-bones plot, minimalist art style, and a nearly absent soundtrack make for an unusual video game experience.It might not sound like it, but I had an amazing time playing The Witness. I had only the most basic idea of what I was buying (I watched someone play through the 'tutorial') and I loved every minute of it. Exploring an (almost) completely open world filled with puzzles that had little direction to them other than what could be inferred was refreshing. The puzzles themselves are rarely Challenging*. It's more about understanding the theme of each area and how it applies. The reward for completing a puzzle isn't some cosmetic item or plot device, it's more puzzles. To that end, the real pleasure of the game comes from making the aformentioned connections, the ""Ah-ha!"" moments. However, it is very likely that this game will test your patience. There is no hint system. If you don't get something, too bad. Mull it over, sketch out a diagram, try a different puzzle, sleep on it, come back to it later - whatever works for you. When it says it respects you as an intelligent player in the description, it's a pledge of faith in your ability.

Now consider that it's a computer game that's designed to leave you asking answerless questions.  (At least I think it is, durrr)The problem for potential buyers of The Witness is that you won't know if you like it for at least five hours into the game, so the refund issue comes up there.  The puzzles are excellent, they're also very hard.  Also the game is slightly designed to troll your brain.  At times recently, when I've been strolling through the trees and taking in nature, I've thought, ""hmmm yep this reminds me of that Witness game.""On the whole, The Witness.YES.Buy it if you can afford it.If you can't afford it, don't.Otherwise buy it.Unless your ethics preclude its purchase.The Witness.Yep.

												I never write reviews but this game was really special to me.I won't be talking about the message of the game as it didn't talk to me that much. It is an interesting allegory but also a very simple one.What I want to talk about is how perfectly crafted this game is. The game design and graphics are simply amazing. I loved roaming around on the island, looking for the next series of puzzle and wished the game would never end. The difficulty was perfect for me and I really enjoyed the roller coaster aspect of it. Traditional puzzle games tend to get harder as you progress. This one goes back and forth which is key to make sure the player doesn't get frustrated. I was sometime stuck on a puzzle for 30 minutes and the last thing I wanted was to be stuck on the following one for another 30 minutes. In the witness, you have plenty of opportunity to take your breath and this aspect is what sucked me back in the game every time. A must have!			"

												THis is a difficult game to review. It is a puzzle game, but it is not only a puzzle game. There is more to it than endless rows of line tracing panels. The moment I realised that...well all I can say is that was a great moment and it made me reinvest in it on a whole new level. Also, did I mention that the game is gorgeous? It is. So the question is, do I recomend this game? My short answer is 'Yes!'. However, to answer the question if you should buy this game I have three follow up questions:-Do you like puzzle games and brain teasers?-Are you the kind of gamer that look behind every rock, every tree for that last collectable? -Do you enjoy a well made walking similator?If the answer is yes to one or more of these questions, you owe it to yourself to try this game. It  is great!Once you feel that you are done with the game and ready to stop playing, have a look at the spoiler filled game session Giant Bomb had with Jonathan Blow. It is fantastic and actually made me go back to the game with renewed interest! However play the game first, it is more fun that way.   "

												This game requires a bit of compartmentalization. As a TL;DR for anyone reading, if you're into the kind of challenging logic puzzles the game offers, this game is well worth the money. But that's really the only reason to buy it.GameplayLet's start with the good. The puzzles in this game are all based on an extremely simple idea: get a line from point A to point B. However, the game sprinkles in so many different rules and requirements the player has to meet along the way that some of the puzzles can be extremely difficult. It starts with simple maze puzzles, but expands with icons that reflect shapes that need to fit into sections the player makes, to color-coded icons that need to be grouped or divided in various ways, all the way to affecting the color of the icons using glass partitions and colored lighting. The number of iterations on the same concept is actually very impressive. I particularly like the puzzles that require the player to physically position themselves to gain the proper perspective on the board to see the solution.The open-world nature of the island can lead to some frustration, though. The player can come across puzzles that require some fore-knowledge that they haven't gained yet. My advice to anyone looking to pick this up is to never be afraid of walking away from a puzzle you don't understand. Go exploring, and you'll eventually come across the tutorial panels for the information you're missing.The puzzle portion of the game is the reason you should buy this game. Check out some youtube videos that show what the puzzles are, and if they interest you, the game is worth buying. If there's any problem with them, it's that there is an overwhelming number of them.Graphics/AestheticsThis game is gorgeous. There are likely some that aren't into the aesthetic of the game and want photorealistic graphics, but this game doesn't have that. If you're not that type of person, the extraordinarily colorful and varied landscape is actually very refreshing. I didn't run into any situations where the game ran slowly for me, but that no doubt depends on the machine you're on. Some of the environments also play into the puzzles, as mentioned above, and that's really the most creative part about the game. Going around exploring the island and discovering all that's hidden away is a nice way to give the player a chance to breathe in between puzzles. If there's one complaint, it's that the environment suggests a bigger story with the island. The game has a Myst vibe to it that makes you feel like you're seeing a lot of real history and that people have been there before, but the game never really delivers on that. This actually makes the whole island feel much more artificial.Art/Message/Story (Spoilers) The Witness is pretentious. There's really no way to justify the ""artistic"" element in the game. On this strange island that has so much detail in it, the player starts to think there might be a greater message, a bigger story that happened in the past, and they're doing all the puzzles to figure that out. There seem to be experiments, archaeological digs, and statues of people that...might have been alive at some point? It seems like such a mystery, and it's fun to explore the environment and wonder what the answer could be.Instead what the developers decided to do was record people reading famous quotes by famous people and scatter them as collectibles throughout the island. Yeah, the first one you find is kind of interesting, but after a couple more, you realize what the ""artistic"" message is supposed to be and that the developer couldn't convey that message themselves. They had to cobble together a selection of supposedly profound sayings from other people and create this Frankenstein's monster and call it ""art"". It doesn't take many of these tape recorders for the player to say, ""Yes, science is the only true religion, I get it. Couldn't you have come up with an actually creative way of conveying this sentiment via gameplay or visual story telling?""And around that time you'll likely find the theater room. This is a small area off the beaten path that includes a projector tied into a puzzle panel. The player can find secret codes behind locked doors to enter into this machine for secret surprises. These turn out to be complete videos of some of the people the tape recorders have been quoting saying more of the same stuff you've probably been listening to this entire game, along with some cinematic clips that seem profound. Look, that guy is carrying that candle, and it's all one continuous take, how artistic!And this is a major problem with the game. I find it less enjoyable to solve difficult problems to unlock new areas if all I'm going to get is more puzzles and preachy quotes the developers substitute for artistic merit. I like the puzzles and the visuals, but this grates on my nerves.And worse still, there is one thing that the game does that I would have loved to see developed more. While playing the game, you'll eventually see a puzzle in the environment. I first saw it as a reflection on the water, the distict circle with the line that has a beveled end. I thought it was weird, and was amazed when I found I could actually trace a line down it just like all the puzzles I'd been doing up to that point. I was even rewarded with a big booming noise when I completed it. Suddenly, I began to see those puzzles scattered all throughout the island, usually requiring I find the right perspective. Walking into a forest, I saw another puzzle start to form in the tree's canopy. I could even find some in the clouds when I was standing on the right hill-top. This element of the game was facinating and clever, and I find this to be where the greatest potential for artistic merit in the game lies. The player spends so much time solving these puzzles that they start to see the patterns in the world at large. First on a building, then in the trees and the water and the sky. Isn't this a good way to make an artistic message about recognizing the same patterns from the smallest elements in reality to the great expanses of the universe and finding some form of spirituality in the surprising order of chaos? This isn't a new idea, but the way the game never forces you to spot these large environmental puzzles, yet almost guarantees the player finds at least one could have been such an interesting way to convey that message.But these puzzles don't really do anything. To my knowledge, finding the dozens of them that exist maybe gives you an achievement. Unfortunately there are so many of them that hunting them all down is way more than I'm willing to do. Such a waste of a good idea.SummarySo the game is fatally flawed, but if you approach it with the right expectations, you can still have a lot of fun with it. The puzzles are good and challenging, and the game does a decent job of giving you the tools you need to solve them, albeit in a way that sometimes requires you to walk away from puzzles until you get the information you need. This aspect of the game is the only reason to buy it, however. The game really wants to be artistic, but it's terribly misguided in its execution. Do not buy this game for a story, as you won't get any here.			"

												I played The Witness at launch and since then I've read a lot of dissenting opinions on how well the game's puzzles validate being part of an interactive world and how the sparse story and thematic elements help or hinder the game and even John Blows own pretentions of being the ""Thomas Pynchon of video games."" I've bounced back and forth between thinking the game is pure genius and thinking the if it had a head it would be up its own♥♥♥♥♥ When I step back from post game analysis and remember what it was like to play the game with no expectations I can't help but think of it fondly. Stepping onto the island and feeling overwhelmed by what could be waiting around every corner. Solving a series of seemingly pointless puzzles only to realize that I'd just learned how to solve a previous puzzle that seemed impossible. Stumbling over little details in the envoronment that I'd walked past a dozen times without seeing. There were so many moments of wonder and discovery that I can't help but step back from the debate over how well executed John Blows idea were and fondly remember the experience of playing The Witness.In the end these things will add up to something different for different people and there's something a little off-putting about the endings which are simultaneously (and intentionally) obtuse and blunt in a way that's makes them not what you wanted, but exactly what you should have expected. There's the cynicism of someone who's spent too much time thinking about the industry and the art of game design embedded in The Witness, but the wide-eyed view of someone who's fascinated by the possibilities of games is there too and for me that voice was the stronger one and the one I'll remember when I look back on The Witness.

												The Witness is a very immersive game that would best be described as a puzzle adventure.  In this game, you're walking around exploring a colorful island while solving lots of puzzles.  The basic premise of these puzzles is to draw a line from one end of a maze to the other, and there are usually many paths to take in these mazes.  However, as you progress through the game, you'll discover more and more rules that you'll need to understand in order to help you figure out the correct path to take when solving these puzzles.  Sometimes these ""rules"" come in the form of clues in the surrounding environment that you need to pick up on, or they could come in the form of certain symbols displayed on the mazes themselves.  Throughout the game, you'll often come across mazes with symbols on them that you don't recognize.  You know how games like Metroid and The Legend of Zelda have power-ups that help you reach certain areas that you couldn't before?  In The Witness, you have no actual inventory, but your knowledge of how to solve puzzles with a certain type of symbol on them fills the same role as these power-ups.  Even though you may not know what to do with one of these symbols at a point in the game, there will undoubtedly be an area somewhere else on the island that will teach you how to solve puzzles with that type of symbol.  With your newfound knowledge, you will then be able to solve more puzzles and access more areas on the island.One of the most impressive things about the game is how it manages to present all of this without any textual or auditory explanations.  This only makes it all the more immersive; you are left to your own devices to figure everything out for yourself through trial and error.  This system works perfectly, and it's nowhere near as tedious as it sounds because the areas that are meant to teach you how to solve certain puzzles start with the simplest versions of those puzzles and gradually become more complex, helping you grasp the intended concept.  I found the learning curve in this game to be perfect; many of the puzzles were challenging and had me thinking hard, but I would always figure it out eventually, and I would feel a great sense of accomplishment upon doing so.  No puzzle ever had me thinking so hard that I would become frustrated and quit.  Even though there are many different sections around the island, you don't need to finish all of them to complete the main game - though it's very much encouraged that you do finish every section, for reasons I probably shouldn't spoil.Also, if you ever grow tired of solving the puzzles, the island is breathtakingly goregous and it can often be entertaining just to wander around and explore.  The game's various environments are full of color, and although the graphics may at times seem rather polygonal and forced into certain shapes, I guarantee you that this is for a reason.  You may figure this reason out early on in the game, or it may take you a while, but regardless I probably shouldn't give it away.  While searching around the island, you might also stumble across miniscule audio players from which you'll hear philosophical quotes.  At first, these quotes seem like they have nothing to do with the game, but upon careful interpretation you'll find they're at least vaguely related to the puzzles you're solving, which adds all the more to the game's creative value.I hear a lot of people have been pirating this game, most likely because it's something unique and they don't know what to expect from it.  While I'm normally not one to complain about piracy, I believe The Witness is truly a masterpiece of a game, so if you want to see more games like this, then please - throw down some cash and support the developer.  They deserve it.			"

												I bought this game because of Braid, and how beautiful it is in the trailer videos. Now that I've played it myself it totally exceeded my expectations, and now that I've beaten it, and with the rising amount of negative reviews on top about this game I feel like I have a responsibility to speak up positively.First of all this is totally not a game for everyone, this is for those who loves to just chill and explore, this is for those who want a game that respects their intelligence. This game does a different take on many things. One of it is obviously not spoon-feeding the player about many things. I hate those games where they just bombard you with texts, or dialogues and all just to teach you every bits of what you can do in the game. Those kind of games are an example of bad game design. I mean looking way back we got Mario, did it teach you the mechanics through texts? No, instead it taught you by experience.Moving on some other side, The Witness really focused on the gameplay side with a little glimpse to its narrative, that glimpse giving the player hints so it can interpret things on its own. Regarding the gameplay side it totally rocks! The puzzles are brilliant that you'll even think about how Jonathan Blow came up with it. I can't comment much on the narrative side because I was so into the world, and the puzzles instead. I'll probably focus on them on my next run.Commenting on those people who did not recommend this game because ""there are no rewards but puzzles"", dude I just want to say that this is a ""puzzle"" game for a reason. The real reward behind this game are those ""aha!"" moments when you solve a puzzle that you've had a hard time with. There were also saying that the narrative is ""un-insteresting"", the game is dull. Yeah maybe it's ""un-interesting"" because the game doesn't present it to you by explosions, slow-mo epic moments and stuff, but it gets interesting when you dig deeper beyond the audio logs, the island, and what you do in it. Well at least for me it's interesting because it's a really clever ending.Anyhow I just also want to point out the game content-wise. Is the $40 price tag worth it? YES! I've beat the game, I got 38.9 hrs as of the moment, and there are alot of areas that I haven't gone into yet! (I've solved around 450+ puzzles I think with around 30 secrets). For me I would even buy this game at $60. It's just that worth it for a puzzle maniac like me.TL;DR version: The game is totally not for everyone, but if you're that kind of person who loves games that pushes their brain to its limits then this is totally for you. Content-wise, it has a lot in it. You just gotta dig deeper.			"

												The Witness is an open world puzzle game. Weird combination, huh?That concept actually works rather well. You work on a puzzle for a while, can't figure it out, and instead just move on to another part of the island. This solves the everlasting puzzle game problem of not even wanting to start it up if you're stuck.The (many!) puzzles are singular screens which have you drawing a line across a grid. A very basic concept. And with that very basic concept The Witness does absolutely everything it possibly could. It will introduce lots of new rules, need you to take the surroundings of the puzzle into account and even have you taking notes in real life.""Then why are people complaining that the puzzles are too similar?"" you ask. Well, that kind of line puzzle is all there is. The Witness really needs to be praised for how much it does with the limitations it set itself but it never answers the question why it limited itself so much in the first place.The island is huge and even 5 or 6 hours into the game you will still find yourself running into new places you haven't seen before. And not because you just unlocked them, it just actually has that much content.Content made out of puzzles that is, this game really is for the absolute puzzle game buff who wants nothing else out of it.It also likes having some big fps drops and on some graphics cards it gets occasional random crashes but it's biggest downside remains its price! I don't feel like paying 37€ for a collection of puzzles and a pretty island (did i mention this is one of the prettiest games i've seen in a long time?) to walk around on is worth it.I do however recommend buying it if you're really into puzzle games AND you can get it while it's on sale.

												This is a really good game.First off. The setting is beautiful. There isn't anything about this game that isn't artsy or pretty to look at. When you enter darker rooms, it feels like you're there. When you go out into the sun and gaze out upon the mountains and trees, everything is just stunning. This game is beautiful.There is absolutely no ambient music. Only the noises of the enviorment you're in. And I have to say that the developers did an excellent job at making sounds effects, every step sounded like what I was stepping on/in. If I was walking on concrete, it sounded like I was stepping on concrete. And the same for all of the other materials in the game. It was really well made as far as little details go.As for gameplay I would have to give The Wittness a 8/10. The game is a puzzle game that is open world and relies on you exploring the beautiful landscapes to find out where to go. Now, that being said there are several areas you should go to before others otherwise a lot of the puzzles the game puts you through won't make sense at first. I had this issue multiple times and I had no clue where or what I was supossed to be doing. This was frustrating at best as I had to go look up what I was supossed to do for a specific puzzle because I didn't know what the hell I was supossed to do. But I like that about this game. There is absolutely no tutorial and the game does not hold your hand at all. It is extremely challenging and forces the player to think about the puzzle they are trying to complete. There were clues hidden throughout the enviornment which made me look about to try and find something to try and help me complete the puzzle. It is a very clever idea and the concepts for a lot of these puzzles are some that I have never seen in a game before. The ""you have to look for clues"" aspect of the game also led to several different secrets in the game which IMO is really cool.All that being said this game isn't easy at all. The game starts out relatively easy, however that's about it as far as easy goes. The game is extremely difficult and challenging. I wasn't able to play the game for more than about an hour per session because my brain would melt and be in a puddle on the floor. But when I was in a good mood and ready for a challenge the enviornments were very relaxing, and being that the only sounds in the game are the ones you and your surroundings make just exemplified that even more.I would definitely recommend this game to those who are ready for a challenge and don't want their hand to be held or be stuck in a super linear puzzle solving experience. Excellent work.			"

												A brilliantly intriguing puzzle game. It's not short so the price isn't steep. I will review further, but the more you read about the game, the less you'll enjoy it as even the smallest spoiler can affect the experience - there is a lot of joy in figuring the puzzles out for yourself. Don't expect a strong story though - not finished yet but it definitely seems to be one of those ""hinting at something but not actually telling you anything and whoops the game is over"" kind of stories. Play this for the puzzles only.All puzzles are variations on the same type of puzzle - start at one point, and draw a line to the end point, but following certain rules. However, when I say ""variations"", I mean a lot of variation - there are several different areas which each have entirely different mechanics, so there's a lot of variety. The first type of puzzle generally involves a panel with symbols on it - you have to follow the rules for the symbols to be able to make the correct path. As you get further through, different rules get mixed together and you have to keep your mind on several things at once, which can be very interesting. Stop reading now if this has intrigued you, as what I'm going into now is way more fun to find out about for yourself.Some puzzles, still involving the panels, instead require you to make observations of the surroundings, which are then used to draw the correct path. These are, to me, the more interesting panel-based puzzles, as they require thought of the surroundings and looking around the (frankly gorgeous) environment.Here be spoilers. There is another type of puzzle which is for finding secrets rather than completing the game, and this is the type which I would heartily recommend you find out for yourself so stop reading if you are interested.As you look around the world, you may notice that, in some locations, the environment itself may form some pattern where there is a large dot, a line and an ending, much like in the puzzles - you can use these to draw paths much like in the main puzzles. These are incredibly interesting as they require a lot of thought as to how to place yourself, especially as you begin to spot what might be one but can't quite figure out how to join it. This is what really sells the game to me - the island is so cohesive through this and everything is important. So much detail and work went into this mechanic alone, and I love it. "

												This is the BEST puzzle game I've ever played, handsdown. The puzzles are expertly crafted such that they're feasible, but not overly frustrating. If you feel like you can't beat a level, walk away take a tour through the BEAUTIFUL world and find another.One of the most interesting things I found about this game is that they treat knowledge as a form of progression. There are no items (as of yet, I haven't beaten it) to solve puzzles, and it's not like you cannot progress because of something lke that. Rather, it is your own brain, your own experience, knowing the ""syntax"" and rules behind each symbol and format that allows you to solve the puzzle. I orginally had no idea what the ""star"" symbol meant, and each time I encountered one, I would have to walk away. But then I found a series of puzzles that taught you how to do it, in an intuitive yet challenging way. As soon as I knew what to do, I immediately went to solve the others that I had stopped up on.This game will give you countless ""ah-ha!"" moments, as well as bend your mind in dimensions not thought possible. Absolutely worth the price. 10/10.			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys solving extraordinarily challenging puzzles in worlds that are equally mysterious. Playing this game is a meditative experience, and you need to have patience and enjoy intellectual challenge to really get the most out of it. To those who say this game ""doesn't have a plot""... I say the story is what you make of it. Blow left plenty of ""clues"" that let the imagination run wild with theories. I can't help but wonder about the nature of the island and its previous inhabitants, or this strange contraption that the puzzles are connected to.To me, the experience of playing this game is a lot like Fez or Antichamber. If you loved those games, I'm certain that you'll enjoy this one.			"

												Beautiful in its visuals, interactive design, and thematic underpinnings, I've never played a more interesting game, even if I have played plenty that are more fun. The subtle, wordless tutorializing combined with meditative quotations and audio recordings  seem to me like an attempt to communicate a (somewhat lofty and pretentious, but probably not incorrect) argument from that designer that people can do so much more than they are to better themselves through study and meditation, and with the right approach, all things, even philosophy, products of creativity, and our very consciousness, can and will be eventually be *fully* understood with sufficient study and intelligence. I did indeed find myself tackling puzzles that I would have never even attempted in a game made with less craftsmanship and sense of wonder; it’s really neat to see the core interactive game bits so directly play into (what I assume) are the novelistic thematic underpinnings of the whole thing. The game's beauty and amazing capacity to just keep on delivering those wonderful ""A-ha!"" moments keeps you going and pushing yourself just a little bit more. *Fantastic* game.…I totally cheated on the sound puzzles though; I couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket. Screw those.  "

												To talk about the Witness is risking to spoil it for the unlucky ones who have yet to experience it.You're on a (beautiful) island, and you're solving puzzles. If you're hoping for a great story or some sort of reward at the end, this is not the game for you. This is a game about figuring out the rules of the puzzles and the world, making steady progress and feeling smart about yourself when you've figured out a particularly tough puzzle.With that in mind, the first few hours of the Witness might seem a bit dull. It will just ask you to solve some basic stuff, drawing lines that respect the rules of the puzzles.. But these are only the building blocks for a much larger ensemble. After theses first few hours, you will start to understand better how things work in the game and its world, and it will start to make sense, and you will start to unraveal the layers of the game. Suddenly, you will understand why this game took years to make.True, all game long, you will still be solving puzzles about drawing lines according to the hidden rules of the puzzles. But the game does it in such a way that it makes things way more interesting than just a 2D puzzle game offering panel after panel after panel. The game has its own way of teaching itself to you. It also avoid frustration by allowing you to explore everything at your pace, in the order you feel most confortable about. All theses details of the game will progresssively appear to you and make more sense to you. The more you play the Witness, the more you will like it and also appreciate the craft in the game design. The island isn't superficially beautiful, it is beautiful in its design and its goals.Just try it, enjoy it,and then you will want to talk about it with others that had the pleasures to play it.PS: As the Witness is a slow FPS, it may trigger nausea for some people. To avoid it, I recommend you play with Keyboard + Mouse rather than a controller, and most importantly, set the FOV to its max value (120). I had nausea on my first few hours, but once i took theses steps it solved the problem for me.			"

												Based on only an hour played, so take what I say with a grain of salt.I was hoping this would grab me like Braid, or the Talos Principle. Solving puzzles in those games rewards you with insight into the world, the story, the themes. Along with being fun puzzles in and of themselves, there was a reason for solving them beyond 'because they're there.""I got no sense from the Witness that there was anything beyond the puzzlees. I never felt like solving a puzzle resulted in a tantalizing, fleeting glimpse into what lies beneath. It just felt like... puzzles. A bunch of puzzles.If that's what you want, then this may be the game for you. But if you want puzzles in service of something else - ANYTHING else - then move along. There's nothing to see here.(I'm sure someone (possibly many someones) will say I didn't give it enough time. To them I'd say that if Braid and the Talos Principle (and many others) managed to hook me in an hour, then the Witness should be able to do the same. From what I experienced, it seems utterly indifferent to my enjoyment. It offered no hooks. It simply exists, and much like the island on which it's set, it seems completely unconcerned with me or my actions. I'll give Blow credit for thematic consistency, but that doesn't change the fact that it was not enjoyable to actually experience.)EDIT: Originally I refunded The Witness after the review above, but I bought the Humble Freedom Bundle that came with a copy, and I decided to give it another chance. I've gotten much farther in this time, but sadly it hasn't really done much more to win me over. On the second attempt I'm much more willing to meet it without my old expectations, but the end result is a sometimes clever, sometimes frustrating, but still ultimately un-engaging experience. The Witness is basically like being stuck in a room with someone who doesn't speak your language, so you go through the painstaking process of total immersion learning. When you finally learn something, there's a great Eureka moment. When it feels like the game is doing nothing to teach what you need to learn, you want to bang your head into a wall. But there's also the added bonus of not knowing who you're locked in this room with, or what you hope to achieve by learning the language, as The Witness offers no context or reason to care about anything that you're doing. I'd be more eager to jump back in and try harder to solve these puzzles if I thought there was any sort of payoff at the end, or even if I thought there was value in the skills I was learning, but there's just not, so... why?

												I have a hard time rating this one, so I'll try to list the pros and cons.Pros: Lots of puzzles - two basic types - the obvious ones found on tablets, and then the ones found in the sky, on the ground, etc. Interesting terrain - you'll slowly gain access to all of the island as you unlock certain doors. You learn some simple rules for figuring out different puzzle types, and build on them to figure out more complex puzzles. Some of the puzzles are really complex - thankfully there is always Google.Cons; Lots of puzzles - repetitive even and even with the obsidian pillars scattered around, you'll waste a lot of time finding some of the ""environment"" puzzles - and they aren't even needed to ""win"".  That interesting terrain gets boring when you have to trace and retrace your path over and over. (The SHIFT key to run fast is your friend) Also, I hated certain puzzle types that when you fail cause you to go back a puzzle and resolve it before you can attempt it again. (Most of the types allow you to attempt over and over without any penalty)  I didn't notice it anywhere, but without special setup/knowledge some of the puzzles are hard for people with visual or hearing problems. Oh - and those complex puzzles? I don't know how we are supposed to keep all these rules straight in our head - there isn't any in-game notebook or guide or notebook to reference. Some of the puzzles are just so baffling that I spent much of my time looking in Google to understand the puzzle, and then some more of the time just looking for the outright answer because solutions that seem good didn't work.The storyline - I didn't get it at all while playing it - it wasn't until I got to ""The End"" that I went online and learned there is even more puzzle aggravation before you can learn the ""true"" story of why you are on this island. After my game play experience, I came away from The Witness confused and discouraged from trying again - I'm sure there are a few ""failed"" lessons in there that will make it to the Games Developer Conference one day.The authors wanted a regular price of $40, which I can understand for all the work they put into this; I'm glad I read the reviews first though, and waited for the price to drop on sale before buying it. The long wait for a lower price I paid for it was quite frankly worth it, considering the sheer aggravation of this game. Comparing this game to other, simpler games (in terms of graphics and quantity of puzzles), I thought the other games were far better buys. If you want enjoyable puzzles, look elsewhere - The Witness will probably seem like a Walking Game with puzzles to you. If you enjoy beating your head against rocks and spending weeks, months even figuring out stuff on your own then by all means go for it - you'll get your money's worth.Ultimately I have to give this a thumbs down - I didn't feel like the hours I spent on this were worth the few minutes of satisfaction earned solving puzzles. To give you my frame of reference, I have about 450+ games of all types on floppy/CD/DVD and Steam - so that's where I'm coming from; while the graphics are good, the design psychology is not so good - players need to get sufficient rewards in the right places; I've played games that made me attempt something over and over again and really the only thing I wish I could do is gift this ""used"" game to someone for free.

												Are you an avid puzzle solver? If so, this game will likely interest you; however, keep in mind, this game will not hold your hand at all. Think of this game as what dark souls is in the hack and slash genre... except replace hack and slash with puzzles. This is an open world puzzle game, probably the only one of its kind. You will get stuck on puzzles in this game, and that's okay. You'll come across puzzles that you have no clue how to solve, at this point, it's time to turn around and explore the world further. Each type of puzzle in this game is like a language. Each area in the game will teach you one of these uninque languange through very easy to solve puzzles... however, quite often you will come across ""languages"" which you have not learned yet, back away and go to another area. From an outsiders perspective, the base medium of the puzzles is very simple, and would make one wonder why such a beautiful game would be made for such a simple concept. This is indeed one of the most ingenious things about the game. The medium of the puzzles is very simple, just as shooting holes in walls in portal, or swinging swords in dark souls with the press of just one button. The mechanics that are developed on top of this very simple medium is what makes the experience so unique. You will need to use the environment in your surroundings in order to solve these line puzzles, very often the line puzzles are solving by the interaction with the world; I will say no further as I refuse to spoil any of the puzzles.With that said, as you are eased into the many languages of puzzles, you will come across very, very tough puzzles. I play many puzzle games, and I would say I am very good at solving puzzles, there were countless times where I was stuck on puzzles that took me in the upwards of 15-20 minutes. Solving these puzzles is just as rewarding as defeating a very challenging boss in the souls series.On the graphics side, this game is absolutely beautiful, one of the most artistic games I've ever played, as you explore the many types of land you will come acorss the many languages of puzzles that I mentioned. Solving the puzzles is very rewarding and clearly the main point of the game, however seeing the beautiful world as you explore from one area to another will have you in awe of the scenary and vibrant colours of the world. The story of this game is told in a very subtle way, similar to how Braid told its story. To many, this game won't have a story, unless you look for it. The environments tell a tail, as do the few audio diaries that spew quotes of history throughout the world. This game respects the players enough to not shove a story down their throat. There is a story, if you want it, look for it (again, very much like dark souls... or Braid if you prefer).10/10 would recommend.			"

												Beautiful in its visuals, interactive design, and thematic underpinnings, I've never played a more interesting game, even if I have played plenty that are more fun. The subtle, wordless tutorializing combined with meditative quotations and audio recordings  seem to me like an attempt to communicate a (somewhat lofty and pretentious, but probably not incorrect) argument from that designer that people can do so much more than they are to better themselves through study and meditation, and with the right approach, all things, even philosophy, products of creativity, and our very consciousness, can and will be eventually be *fully* understood with sufficient study and intelligence. I did indeed find myself tackling puzzles that I would have never even attempted in a game made with less craftsmanship and sense of wonder; it’s really neat to see the core interactive game bits so directly play into (what I assume) are the novelistic thematic underpinnings of the whole thing. The game's beauty and amazing capacity to just keep on delivering those wonderful ""A-ha!"" moments keeps you going and pushing yourself just a little bit more. *Fantastic* game.…I totally cheated on the sound puzzles though; I couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket. Screw those.  "

												After a couple hours the apparently simple and repetitive ""panel"" game mechanic becomes your language, your natural way of effectively communicating with your surroundings.The solutions to most puzzles do not come from logic, though it sure can help, but from acute awarness of your environment. The different puzzles types are quite original and often unexpected, and the game doesn´t seem to exhaust the interesting combinations they can yield.Even after reaching the game´s ending, you can´t help but feel you have only scratched the surface of this puzzle-ridden island... you know there is still much left to discover.The design of the island, the somehow consistent aesthetic and the lack of music really sink in, creating an extremely immersive atmosphere of solitude -the good kind- and exploration.

												A facinating game. I haven't completed it yet and I don't have any idea what the meta-narrative might be, but this game is extremely clever. The payoff for completing the puzzles is an increase in your own knowledge of the rules and the opportunity to explore more of the extrodinarily crafted world. If finding out that, by looking at a tree from the right perspective, it transforms into a sculputure of a person engaged in changing the environment doesn't appeal to you, this might not be the game for you. For me, finding these places where the things you have been seeing for hours transform themselves just because your perspective has changed, provides a rush of euphoria and ""Wow!"" moments. The island in The Witness is the most meticulously designed game world I have ever seen. Everything is important. The trees, grass, clouds, flowers, shadows, ruined buildings; all have been specificly built and placed. My fingers are crossed that someone will add Oculus support to The Witness because there is no game world I would be more excited to experience from the inside.			"

No game has ever captured my mind and ideas like The Witness.I've had a weird relationship with this game. I first saw it by watching a yotube playthrough of it. I watched through the entire game, spoilers and all. I pretty much remembered all the concepts and ideas of it. About 10 months to a year later, I came back and bought it on sale. I remember really enjoying the game when I saw it. I played through it, and I remembered all the concepts. I never had that ""Ah ha"" or ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moment that everyone else has had. That being said, I absolutely love this game. I loved ""reliving"" the experience but doing it on my terms. I absolutely LOVED the Challenge. That was probably the best part of the game for me. Now, after all this praise I do have some complaints.- You can't jump. This is just a minor nitpick that I think is weird.- You can't look down all the way. This was really annoying at first. I wanted 360 visability and hated that I couldn't fully look down.- Lack of a story. This is probably my biggest complaint. The island gives you enough where your brain craves answers to everything. ""Why is this like this?"" ""Who made this?"" ""How did this get here?"". Suprisingly, the game gives you answers on ""The Good Ending"". And let me tell you, after you piece it together, this story is absolute horse♥♥♥♥♥♥- Hard Puzzles - I don't mind difficulty, but if you put something crazy hard in the game, I will look it up. I will not try. This absolutely sucks. I wanted to experience and try, but making me look something up because of difficulty is terrible.All that being said, this game is one of my personally favorites and I hold it up to the game ranking as Portal 2.

												This game is a masterpiece.If you don't like puzzles, you probably shouldn't play this game.If you like (or love!) puzzles, I recommend it.If you get a little bit high when your brain forms a solution, you will want to play this.Puzzles are the meat of this game. Please understand this. This is one of those games where watching a stream or using a walkthrough defeats the purpose of playing it at all. Feel free to do so, but don't be surprised when you don't find any satisfaction in it and fail to understand the hype. If you want to skip all the puzzles and just focus on the story, this is really not the game for you. It's difficult to describe the truly amazing parts without spoiling anything, so the rest of this review might sound very vague. Learning how to solve the puzzles is a puzzle in itself. There are no big walls of text throwing exposition at you. Aside from the game's menu, there is no text at all. There is no hand-holdy tutorial voice-over that spells out what you need to do when you encounter something new. When you encounter a new symbol or a new type of puzzle, it's up to you to figure out how it works and learn to apply it to more complex puzzles.If you explore beyond the puzzles, you may find references to philosophy (Eastern & Western). Some of these references are more overt than others and involve an audio or video component. Appropriately enough, these can be found if you go looking for them, but they're not required, and you're not expected to absorb any of it if you don't want to.For the deaf or colorblind: there are a few puzzles that involve sound and some that involve color. They're not required in order to reach the ending, but they are required in order to reach a large chunk of optional late-game puzzles as well as one of the achievements. For people who experience motion sickness in first-person perspectives, they've added an FOV adjustment in the options. I experienced some lag (mostly in outdoor areas) affecting camera motion and puzzle control, but it's because my computer can't handle the highest video quality, switching to Medium fixed it for me.My advice, based on my own experience with the game:Give yourself big blocks of time so you can binge, especially in the early game.Bring some paper and a pencil. Graph paper is ideal if you happen to have some.Because the world is largely open for exploration, it's possible to reach some complex stuff before you've learned how it works.Be patient with the game and with yourself. If you get temporarily stumped, go visit a different area. Solve some other puzzles or just take in some scenery until you forget the puzzle that's been frustrating you. When you return to it, you may have a different approach that will let you succeed.Some of the puzzles are quite hard. You may find yourself questioning whether your game is bugged, or whether you inadvertantly ""broke"" a puzzle. It's not, and you didn't. It's okay. If you're on one of these puzzles, you're already doing great and you'll get it.When you reach the late game, you'll be aware of the existence of some puzzles but you won't be able to find them. Don't stress too hard or beat yourself up or ragequit. Even in the late game, there will be surprises for you. Head in another direction for now, and the answers will come to you.Resist the urge to look up the answers. This is a really big one.Keep your eyes open. Allow yourself to observe things that don't seem relevant. Clues are everywhere.Grab a snack and a pee jar and settle in.I give this game: a bunch of amino acids / 10			"

												This is what the puzzle genre is about, not the endless list of bejewled clones. The puzzles are brutal and I was pretty frustated for the first hour while I was learning the basics but, it's satisfying as hell when you do solve them. Puzzles are SO clever in their design, and just when you think you have the hang of it all, it beats you down. This is no casual game, but if you want a good challenge with no hand-holding gameplay, get it now.I enjoyed the hell out of this; amazing puzzles, great visuals and well optimised.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. It's deeply complex, but not on the surface. There are layers and layers of abstraction to explore and appreciate here. The world itself is beautiful and immersive. There is a peaceful, almost meditative ambience to the place, but also an eerie undertone of loneliness and mystery. The level design is impeccable; what may seem random at first will eventually become an important and well-thought through detail. The puzzles evolve in difficulty over time, testing not only your logic but also your perception. The story is not linear and there is nothing to guide you through it. You must explore, discover and make sense of things yourself. Very few games have impacted me quite like this one (certainly Riven comes to mind, but perhaps nothing else). This game certainly isn't for everyone, but for us lucky few it doesn't get much better.			"

												Bought this game day one, and it is one of the greatest games I've ever played, bar none. It's one of those experiences where the more you know going in, the less special it is, so please go in with as much of a blank slate as possible. In a nutshell, you solve LOTS of puzzles, many of which appear very simple at first, but the mechanics throw tons of interesting curveballs. If you dig stuff like Sudoku, then this is your jam. On top of that, the architecture is insanely meticulous. Again, I don't want to spoil anything, but you could spend hours upon hours just observing reflections and how objects in the environment interact with each other. Flawless 10/10.			"

The only things that have annoyed me are the fact that the menu cannot be controled with your mouse, and that the puzzles can be somewhat fiddly when using a mouse (I haven't tried with a controller, but it seems to be a choise, at least for the puzzle part).

												Puzzles are just the same concept over and over with new rules sprinkled in once in a while. No map system makes it so you feel lost all the time and it's difficult to get back to a puzzle you couldn't figure out the first time you happen across it. No music or sounds to really speak of, so it becomes too silent while you get frustrated over some of the puzzles. Theres no real indicator that tells you that a puzzle you've solved opened up a particular area or did something interesting... you'll just randomly go into an area that happens to be open not realizing that it was locked until you solved that one puzzle a half hour ago. For what I've seen of it, which is all I will probably bother ever seeing it is obvious that in the end, it's just a disjointed and ultimately pointless tracing game with okay visuals and redundant puzzles.

The puzzles aren't easy, they are deceptively simple but surprisingly complex at times.The only real problem with this game could be that there isn't much in the way of replayability. If you can forget the solutions to every puzzle, then you can enjoy the game multiple times.

												A deeply engaging puzzle game about perception, exploration, and experimentation. The Witness is not the kind of puzzle game you'd play if you like puzzle games; rather, it's the kind of puzzle you might give to someone who likes puzzles. It has the definitive style and tactility of one of those die-cast metal things you'd get at the learning store at the mall, and the same rich symbolism and intellectual charm of an ARG or illustrated puzzle book with a cash prize that nobody ever claimed. On top of that, The Witness is also one of the most beautiful and painstakingly designed locations I've ever inhabited, full of painterly trees and buildings designed by a real-life architect.Well worth the asking price, and well worth not spoiling even if it means never completing it.

												This game is a work of art. Some people misunderstand a piece of art and quickly dismiss it. Many people who bought this game came with certain expectations. What they expected didn't end up happening. Instead of over-the-top action sequences or a transparent narrative, this game is quiet, contemplative, and tough. Some people prefer books that have a simple conclusion that tells you exactly how the characters felt and what happened to them. These people get angry at authors who don't spell out exactly what things are supposed to mean. Other readers enjoy interpreting things for themselves. I believe the word for that trait is imagination. This game is deeply meditative, and I give my interpretation of the meaning below. Warning: it contains some vague spoilers about the game.You start in a sheltered area, learning the basics of how things, how to get ahead, how to progress. It isn't too long before you gain independence and can go anywhere and do anything you want. But you quickly learn that all these new areas are locked until you apply yourself to more learning. Your final goal is not immediately obvious, but major moments of solving puzzles unlocks more and light directs your path upward. You can take the time to hear scientists, philosophers, psychologists, and religious icons if you choose. Their words can shape your experience and make it more meaningful than simplying moving from point A to point B. Instead of endlessly working and never feeling fulfilled, you can realize that there's no rush. No timer to hurry you. No other inhabitants on the island to force their expectations on you or pressure you to complete anything. You can stop to look at the clouds, hear the birds, enjoy the beautiful island you are on. And even in these natural formations, you see patterns that can be meaningful. You have the realization that solving puzzles just seemed like the thing you had to do, but really there was no person telling you to complete them. You start to find your own reasons for completing them. A sense of accomplishment. A sense of adventure. Curiosity to see what it all means and how it ends. And in the end, progressing to the edges of what is possible to learn and accomplish, you finish your journey and look back on all that you've done. Did it matter at all? Was it meaningful, or just a waste?....And that is the beauty of this game. It makes you realize that life works the same way. Humanity has always sought how to interpret our surroundings and progress toward lofty goals. For some, religion gave perspective. For others, the pursuit of scientific discovery was enough of a goal. Others still didn't see any point to it at all, and felt cheated when they looked back on what they did. This game, if you are willing to listen, is asking you, ""What is your perspective on life? What is your reason for going through life, solving the daily puzzles in your way?""10/10 Made me rethink my perspective on life			"

												The Witness is a PURE puzzle game. It has no story, and it has no puzzles that don't involve drawing a contiguous line from the start to the end of a grid in order to divide the space according to logical rules.  Those puzzles are deliciously challenging, and the lack of distraction from them forces you to start to see everything in lines. This is important as you progress, as you are constantly asked to apply the visual language you have been learning in new ways and in new contexts. In the same way that people used to play Tetris for hours and then dream of pieces falling, spending some time getting familiar with the Island and learning the aesthetics, you will be dreaming in connected lines.It's a 9/10 for me.If you like puzzling, and you go in expecting a collection of puzzles that fit within a larger context that is also a puzzle, and don't expect a story, you will find one of the best designed and put together challenge to come along in a long time.The downsides for me are mostly technical: * I have the audio crackling problem, which hurts the already somewhat sparse ambient sound experience * There is some z-fighting on some of the grass, flowers etc that detracts from the beautiful island design * My method for note taking is to use the steam screenshot feature. While this works OK, an in-game note system would have been really helpful. No, I'm not going to use my phone or write notes in a notebook * A few of the puzzles are bad for colorblind or deaf. It doesn't affect me personally, but I think more care should have been done to either mark those puzzles optional or work around people's limitations.			"

												I was worried following the development of this as to how a full game was going to be genuinely enjoyable whilst consisting of solely line drawing puzzles. I was even more concerned how it was going stack up against the brilliant Braid. I shouldn't have doubted Mr Blow for a second who has once again proven himself incredibly capable both of creating fiendishly difficult puzzles but also of excellent game design by having really well crafted ""tutorial"" sections that ease you in with the fundamentals without ever having to outright tell you anything but also by having an open-world approach so that should you find yourself completely stuck you can wander off to another puzzle and try again later. The ways the same basic puzzle has been expanded upon and altered for different sections are so imaginative and really rewarding to crack. Also, the whole thing is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is also excellent.You absolutely need to be prepared to use your brain (and quite possibly a pen and paper to help in some cases) but if you do enjoy a mental challenge then this is an excellent game to pick up.

												This game is awesome. I haven't even beaten it yet (assuming there is an ending), and I don't even need to finish the game to tell you how awesome it is. I would say that this game is best played going in completely blind. Don't watch video reviews or anything, don't hunt around looking for info on the game, you just kinda have to play it yourself for the experience. They best part about the game is figuring out how to play it.As of writing this, I've racked up nearly 20 hours this week, and oh man I feel like there is still so much more for me to do. To be fair, though, I'm personally really REALLY slow when it comes to figuring stuff out.The graphics are so pretty, I've taken so many screenshots and I plan on using them for wallpapers ;)  You might also need a decently good computer to run this, but I've been getting a solid 60+ FPS with no real problems. (my PC is pretty mediocre) The main question you're probably wondering about is: is the 40 dollar price tag worth it? Maybe. I didn't get it for the normal price (thank you for having this on humblebundle, otherwise I probably wouldn't have picked it up cause I'm scum) but I really do think that this game is worth 40 dollars. If you're not having fun 30 minutes to 1 hour in I can pretty much guarantee that you won't like the rest of this game.			"

												This game has has blown my mind. I started this game trying to force my way into understanding the puzzles and knowing that each puzzle has a solution and eventually I would figure it out. But as I progressed the puzzles became harder and had more solutions to each one until finally frustrated I made myself take a step back and then realized I was approaching them wrong the whole time. This game makes you learn a new perspective in figuring out how to solve things. The environment and other things may influence how you solve the puzzles. I think this is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. The Talos Principle, Portal and Myst are great games but this game is a new type of puzzle. I encourage you to try it before judging it. You may get frustrated at first but you will hopefully learn to take a step back and open your eyes to beautiful world and puzzles before you.			"

												Fair to say I did not have any expectations for this game, therefore no way for me to be disappointed. This game is similar to Myst in that it is a puzzle-solver title, but that is where the similarities stop. Don't buy this expecting to have the same experience, as some people have stated that they had going in, and you will find satisfaction if you enjoy this genre.That being said, this is a title that that does not hold your hand at all, has no hint buttons, and no bloody quick time events! If you find enjoyment in being challenged, this is a title you will want to add to your collection.			"

												The best puzzle game ever created. It holds its cards close to its chest, but dig deep enough and you will find awesome things. It's also a longer game than it lets on, particularly if you go for 100%; nearly 30 hours in and there's still plenty to do. The only thing it lacks are caffeine pills for when you come in to work after staying up until 4AM playing it.			"

												(10/10) - MasterpieceThis game completly blew my mind. It satisfied me in every aspect that it ever could:The world is well designed, intreaging and available right from the start. Every moment the explorer in me wanted to wander off and see what´s around the next corner while memorizing every puzzle or location i wanted to come back to.Speaking of puzzles, they are perfect. The start of the game is simple enough to get you used to the simple premise of drawing a line from one point to another. But soon enough, more elements come into play with which you will spend more time thinking than actually drawing.What really fascinated me was the tutorial/learning curve tho. No element of the puzzles gets explained to you, instead you have to figure out what they do by yourself. Finding a puzzle early on with something you don´t yet understand really pushes you into exploring the world further. You immediatly understand that you aren´t yet able to solve that puzzle and shold move on to find an easier one with the same elements so you could learn about it. That is partially because the game does a really good job of seperating real puzzles from teaching experiences. On the latter, elements will light up red after finishing the puzzle wrong so you can see why it didn´t work, understand the rules of it, and later tackle more difficult puzzles with it, that won´t be so kind and give you any hint on what you did wrong.This simple but brilliant mechanic also shuts off a lot of the world at the start. More difficult areas usually have a little puzzle at the start, that contains at least some of the elements to make sure you understood the basic mechanics before moving into the area.That said, the design of the puzzles like this would already be amazing, but where the game completly blew my mind, was on the clever design of EVERYTHING. Some puzzles can´t be solved without clever thinking, observing the environment and/or thinking outside the box. No puzzle game has ever done it this brilliantly. When a puzzle has no element at all yet requires you to somehow draw the correct line, you really start thinking, and once it clicks, that feeling will keep you going for a long time.At the end i think i should also mention the amount of secrets inside the world. The perfect amount of detail really shows you what hidden objects are supposed to look like. A valuable lesson for other games i think.In the end i can only reccomend you to play this game. It easily jumped into the top charts of my most favourite games of all time, which recent games usually struggle to do. I had fun playing it and will probably never forget the amazing experience of a game so well made like thisone...			"

												Judging from the other reviews, this game is like Vegemite. Either you get it and you love it, or you don't and you hate it. The reward for completing a puzzle is almost always access to another puzzle, so, to be perfectly clear, if you tend to get angry at inanimate objects or have a short attention span, or just don't see the appeal of 2d maze puzzles no matter their depth, you should avoid this game.If you like puzzles, though, you've come to the right game. Blow & co. are puzzle-making maniacs and have created a game that teaches you how to solve every puzzle on the island with a carefully balanced, well-paced difficulty curve. The game oozes with polish, has a well-put-together world, looks fantastic, feels sublime, and has plenty of depth and gameplay to offer.The game has crackling sound in a few places on my machine (earliest in the game in the building with the pots that have Voronoi patterns painted on them.) I didn't feel that it took away from my experience much, but if you have a non-standard sound card you might also have extremely occasional problems with the sound. I have a Xonar DX PCI-E sound card that's never given me trouble with any other game, and it's disappointing that it doesn't work perfectly for this game when the rest of the game is so polished.Another disappointment, for me at least, is the game's use of lightmaps. I feel that lightmapped games tend to limit the number of moving parts of the world at the expense of gameplay, whether it's Mass Effect, Remember Me, or The Order: 1886, and I think The Witness could have had some really excellent mechanical puzzles beyond what it has if the lighting were more dynamic. I remember between 2004-2008 or so starting with Doom 3 there was a lot of hubbub about making everything dynamically lit and destructible, and there's a lot of gameplay potential that the developers give up the moment they decide to use lightmaps for a game.Overall, this is my Game of the Year So Far for 2016, and it was a real pleasure to play it. I hope someone at Thekla, Inc. will see fit to give this game a Linux port at some point. Even though there aren't as many gamers on Linux and OS X as there are on Windows, this seems like the type of game that most Linux users would really enjoy, and that many Windows users would not, as the other Steam reviews clearly show. I look forward to seeing what this studio comes up with next.			"

												I recommend The Witness if you like strictly puzzle games.So a lot of reviews compare this to Myst: it's not. There's an island, and that's where the similarities end. That's fine, because if I wanted to play Myst I would play Myst. Unfortunately those reviews set me up with the impression that I would be playing a puzzle-driven narrative -like- Myst; again, it's not. The narrative in The Witness is extremely vague, if there even is any. I'm several hours in and I can say with confidence the story isn't why I'm continuing to play. The puzzles are. There are a lot of puzzles; hundreds, maybe thousands? The premise of these puzzles are interactive maze-displays that grow progressively harder as you adventure through a visually compelling island. Sometimes you'll ""get"" the maze solution in a couple of moments, but more often than not you'll walk around, think, walk around some more, and wonder aloud before you have your ""eureka!"" moment. If you want to spend ~$40 USD on an adventure game then don't buy this. This isn't an adventure game, although I will admit it -might- turn into a more solid adventure after one progresses far enough; however, that point comes well beyond the first few hours. If you want to spend ~$40 USD on a puzzle game then this is going to be worth your money because there's a lot here  - a lot of puzzles. If you buy The Witness I promise you will have myriad hours of puzzles in your future.Closing thoughts: I wish this game had a soundtrack. I like the clever environmental cues for some puzzle segments. I like the overly-saturated world. I wish the collectable, uh, tape recordings were more common.			"

												This is an incredible game!If you are still hesitating on whether to buy this game or not based on the mixed comments, I totally encourage you to have a try on this game! (steam has a decent refund mechanism, right?) And I shall explain my experience below what my expereices are -- I hesitated a long while before try this game due to the negative reviews but now I enjoy this game a lot.Frankly speaking, I don't expect too much from this game when I first bought it due to those negative comments, and my first 1~2 hours game playing is also not satisfying. But I'm totally wrong! Because all I was expecting a 3D Machinarium which I collect items in the scenario or a 3D platformmer Braid where I need smart movement to solve the puzzles.The game is nothing like I was expected above, its a totally brand new deep interactive *puzzle* game (instead of an advanture game), where you need to solve the puzzle based on your careful inspections about the environment and based on your inference about how the surroundings may lead to a solutions to the puzzle. As the game is a deep-puzzle game, it is hard, but never frustrating -- as long as you want to challenge yourself on these puzzles and you enjoy infering possible relationships between your surroundings and the puzzle on the board. If you enjoy this kind of challenge, you can gain incredible pleasure out of it!Yes, this time, IGN is not wrong. The witness is a masterpiece and I strongly recommended it.masterpiece 10/10 "

												Brilliant puzzle game. You just have to know that it is indeed little logic puzzles on screens dotted around an island. If that's what you're expecting, it's wonderful. If you're expecting something else you might be disappointed, but it's very clearly about doing logic puzzles on an island, so I'm not sure why people were expecting something else?It's entirely about figuring things out yourself, which isn't to say it's frustrating or obtuse. Only ONE puzzle has annoyed me so far, and I'm 10 hours in. I'll probably solve it later and feel really silly. You'll come back to previous areas and solve puzzles you hadn't even noticed were there before. It's a series of 'Aha!' moments. And it's very pretty.			"

												I found the Witness to be one of the most intriguing puzzle games I've ever played.I'm the type of player that enjoys the journey as much as the destination so the process of learning how each new puzzle mechanic worked was immensely satisfying for me. Some reviews I've watched have said the game should have been a straightforward puzzle game on a tablet or phone because the exploration doesn't offer anything, and I completely disagree. One of my favorite segments in the game involved walking through a series of mazes and trying to pay attention to any sort of clue I could find in order to discover how each maze related to the panel at its end. Exploration is key to the enjoyment of this game, and offers a welcome break from a tough puzzle you just can't solve.Overall, I think this is an exceptional game for the small audience it was designed for. If you're like me, where the process of discovery is something you enjoy, then you should check this game out. However, if you're looking for action or a compelling, clear storyline, look elsewhere.Also, if the $40 price tag scares you off, check out a game called English Country Tune. It has similar elements of figuring out abstract puzzles on your own and is much cheaper. If you like that one, chances are you'll enjoy The Witness as well.			"

												Finished the game review. This is one of the most challanging games I've played and I am no stranger to puzzle games, It's steep pricetag does not help either as frustation kicks more than too oftern,the whole game revolves around a single puzzle mechnic, moving a ""snake"" around a maze with rules such as; no double back on yourself and you must reach the end, later as the game progress the game adds more and more complexity. The idea is great and pulled off fantasticly, but the same puzzle none the less does add too feeling too repeatitve and fatigue kicks in.			"

												This is one of the most impressive games I have ever played, maybe my experience was a little bit different from others who played it because I *kind of* played it in co-op. My friend and I both started the game together and talked over voice chat. We helped each other out when one of us was stuck, we tried figuring out the puzzles each on our own and when one of us had a new idea we would share it. That made the game extremely fun and never once got frustrating. I am sure without my friend's help neither of us would have been able to complete the game without using google at least once. But together we managed to solve every single environmental puzzle without any further help. The feeling of satisfaction when we solved the final one was indescribable. The incredibly clever graphic design was absolutely overwhelming, nothing that I have ever seen in a video game before.The game is challenging but also very relaxing, yet sometimes insanely hectic. This game is nothing you will ever want to play a second time, or at least I doubt it would be very exciting but this one playthrough was an experience everyone with a passion for puzzle games should have made.Conclusion:Play it with a friend for a Portal 2 like co-op feeling, game seems to get frustrating when playing alone.solid 10/10 from me			"

												I've been waiting for this game for a few years now. And it was great! Pretty much everything I expected.The Witness is an enjoyable challenge. People seem to think this game is short. It's not. It's one very simple mechanic used to great effect in a abundence of different ways, and then combined togeather. I'm a programmer, hence I'm very good at logic puzzles (a majority, but not all, the puzzles are logic puzzles), that said is still took me 12 hours to finish (but not complete, which will probably take a few more hours) the game, and I got stuck quite a few times (if you're stuck then explore elsewhere; the game is quite non-linear). I found the mental gymnastics the puzzles force you to do quite enjoyable, while I didn't need it a pen and paper will probably be useful for some people.The other great aspect of this game is it's environment. Graphics and sound are excellent, absolutely beautiful. There are also tons of interesting details scattered around. But the environment really shines with how perfectly tied into the puzzles it is: the thematic organization and grouping of environment with puzzles is really amazing. The movement system is good, you won't get stuck in the environment. The great graphics do cause some framerate drops for me here and there, but it usuaully fixes it self after a few seconds (likely due to loading assets from disk when traversing areas). There are some downsides. First I didn't comprehend the story (if there is one), if it's there, it's abstract. I enjoy that to an extent (e.g. the Talos Principle) but this moves from abstract to incomprehensible, interesting, but I didn't figure it out (if I was even meant to). Second, some UI issues namely that the capability is there: changing graphics features or checking progress, but the interface is obtuse (text file, look in load game menu, respectively). Niether of these disappointed my expectations from an indie game focusing on gameplay and graphics.I absolutely recommend this game if you like beautiful puzzle games.			"

												First thing is first.  The Witness is easily worth $40, even $60.  People who dismiss this game after just the first 30 minutes are missing out on what I think is one of the best games of all time.  The game is a slow burn.  It will take some time to really fall in love with it.The Witness is a game from Mr. Blow, the genius behind Braid.  He spent around 7 years working on this game and it clearly shows.  The game is incredibly polished, with beautiful watercolor graphics and literally no glitches.  The sound design is eerie and very minimalist but contains very immersive sound effects, like water and walking through different terrains.  Overall, it's really, really well made.The gameplay consists of solving line puzzles on a grid.  The game starts easy and gets more and more complicated.  The design is absolutely brilliant.  Basically, this game does NOT hold your hand AT ALL.  You are forced to figure everything out on your own.  This makes it very challenging, but also extremely rewarding and satisfying.  I want to again stress that this game does not ever...ever help you or hold your hand.  You must observe and think critically to understand the puzzles.  This is a breath of fresh air in the current gaming market.  To put it bluntly, The Witness respects your intelligence as a gamer, unlike so many games.The ""story"" is not really a story, but rather a reflection of human endeavor.  The puzzles in The Witness are analogous to human progress and discovery.  Humans have come a long way since cave man days.  Slowly, through observation and patience, we came to better understand our environment and eventually understand the physical laws of nature that govern everything around us.  There are many highly interesting scientific/artistic audio logs and even a surprising video I found from James Burke in the game.  Each audiolog, when pieced together, tells a subtle, but brilliant ""story.""  In conclusion, I love this game.  I honestly can't think of any flaws.  10/10			"

Because now the previous logic doesn't work anymore and using the same algorithm ain't going to cut it.The fun part is that the solution is right there, but your brain is in denial right now and can't see it, until you actually try to think ""outside the box"" and when you do - Ahaaaaa!

												I rarely buy games at launch, but since I loved Braid I had to buy this one. The puzzles are challenging but, when everything finally clicks, so satisfying. I love that the game doesn't have any tutorials or direction, but is made in a way that you never feel like you're lost.Even though the game is open world, it's organized much like how Braid was. Each ""area"" of the world has a puzzle theme that gets more and more complex as you progress through that area. The difference here is you don't really have to do the areas in a specific order. I hear a lot of people saying there's impossible puzzles, or it's impossibly difficult. I'd say they're probably playing ""wrong."" If you can't figure something out, don't be afraid to leave the puzzle and come back to it later.Interestingly, this makes for a great group game I've found. Even though it's technically singleplayer, my friends have had a blast adventuring and working out the puzzles together. It's a lot more fun thinking everything through as a team I'd say!If you liked Braid, you'll love this game. If you aren't a fan of solving puzzles, hated Braid, or get frustrated easily, then you'll probably hate The Witness. This is easily one of my favorite recent games!			"

From what I can tell so far, it is visually pleasing, and runs well, but the flow of the game and the puzzles are making me bored.  I talked to a few friends who have played it and they basically told me it is simply more of the same throughout the game.I will continue to play it and if I grow to enjoy it, I will come back to update my review.  So please understand, this is an ""Early Impressions"" Review.  One thought I know I won't change, is my thought on the price.  Luckily I got this game as part of Humble Monthly, because the $39.99 USD price honestly seems insane to me.At this time I am going to ""Not Recommend"" this game.

												It's a shame this game is called 'The Witness', rather than more simply 'The Maze'. The Witness is a puzzle game interrupted by a 3D environment. The puzzles themselves are about as stimulating and satisfying as completing a sudoku, but instead of you completing said puzzles in a newspaper you found during your lunch break, or in a puzzle book you bought to pass the time while you're on the train, you're sitting at your computer struggling to be completely engrossed in the game. Unlike the lunch break or the train scenario, both of which eventually end and you get on with your life, The Witness rewards you for completing each puzzle by giving you even more puzzles.I've invested a small amount of time in this game, but after playing for 3 hours, I don't feel any more as clued in to the narrative as when I started. Many have compared the open world part of this game to Myst, but after playing Myst for 3 hours, that world made more sense to me than The Witness's world does now. I really want to learn more about the open world, but the game isn't giving me any clarity. Evidently, this clarity is not a reward for completing any of the puzzles and I don't have any reason to believe any amount of additional playing will add any depth to the world. I had found 2 different audio logs, but neither gave any explanation of where I was or what was happening.I think this game will go down in history as gaming’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. The cultured public will love it, but for me, it’s just a monumental waste of time.			"

												As someone who loves puzzle games, I find this difficult to recommend.  Not because the puzzles aren't good: they're very challenging and I like how they evolve.  It's that I feel the game is misleading.  It comes with all the trappings of a traditional 3D game with a world for exploration and a story-arc: but there's nothing there.  You wander around an empty artificial world full of puzzles with people frozen in place like statues: why are you here?  are you being tested?  Are those statues or once-living people?  None of these questions are even addressed, much less answered.Now, I'm probably being unfair, as it seems to me the lack of explanation is the intended theme: the game appears to be about the scientific process and coming to understand a world that doesn't come with a manual or tutorial, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm not sure that works as a game.  The puzzles feel separated from the environment, leaving your jaunts through forests feeling pointless.  Without narrative reward for solving puzzles, you don't feel a real drive to move forward, because all you have to look forward to after the puzzle is another puzzle, and another, and another, until the game abruptly ends.If you're a puzzle fan, you may not care about all that though.  Don't get me wrong: the puzzles themselves are interesting, expect to approach learning them like a scientist: you create hypothesis, experiment, and repeat until you start to understand it's rules.  They're very well designed and challenging logic puzzles.  My only complaint with them is that towards the end they seem to run out of ideas on how to make more challenging puzzles, so they just make them flash, scroll, spin, and rotate in order to make it harder to see what you're doing.  That isn't really more challenging, it's just more tedious.  However, if they took out the game-environment and made an mobile game app about solving the line puzzles, I'd probably love it.tl;dr: Don't expect any sort of narrative or exploration or really anything outside of line-puzzles.  Only buy if you're a big fan of logic puzzles and probably wait until it's on sale, since the price is rather steep.			"

												Best puzzle game ever! Story seems like it may exist but is entirely environmental. World is pretty and fun to explore which also helps solve puzzles so it is a great loop to do.			"

												Excellent puzzles wrapped in a pretty but disappointingly pretentious veneerThe puzzles are great, although variations on the same theme. As a 2D puzzler it would be cracking (although it would have to exclude the puzzles that rely on positioning).The island is lovely to look at, and with the statues and odd audio diaries lying around it feels like there ought be some sort of story to uncover. But there isn't. There's some attempt at philosophy going on but it veers off and ends up just disappearing up it's own behind.It could have been up there with Talos Principal but ends up falling way short.			"

												I almost never write reviews for games, but decided to make an exception in this case. I think this is a great puzzle game, maybe one of my favorite. I'm currently ~25 hours into it, and find myself getting sucked into it for hours at a time still, determined to beat it (getting closer!).I won't lie though, my first impressions of this game were not great. I picked it up mainly because I loved the art style, but went into it unsure of what kind of puzzles would be involved. During the early game, it can be easy to write it off as a great environment, built around 2-D mobile-app type puzzles. However, if you play a bit longer, you start discovering more and more depth to things... Without giving away too much, I think the longer you play, the more this game pays off, and it has kept me wanting to advance to the next group of puzzles each time.The game isn't without flaws though. I will say sometimes it seems like the difficulty is all over the place, but I think that is more a product of how different people think different ways. A puzzle that could take me 15 minutes might take someone else 15 seconds, and vice versa. However, there are also some puzzles which I think are just straight up too difficult, and had me end up brute forcing/guessing to get past them. Luckily those seem to at least be few and far between (at least at this point in the game).Overall I'd say it isn't a game for everyone, especially if you are looking for something to sit down and relax for a couple minutes. It doesn't have the broad appeal something like Portal has, and there is no comedic relief or real storyline. However, if you are looking for a truly tough puzzles game with some amazing scenery, that will have you breaking out the pen and paper, and don't mind getting frustrated now and then, this is for you!

												The game looks amazing and is one of the hardest puzzle games I think I'll ever live to see.  It may not be a game for everyone, as it certainly gets tedious and frustrating on multiple occasions.  When I get stuck, I have the most success when I take a ten minute break and look at the puzzle again with fresh eyes.  This so happened to be the game I've been craving; a game that has tangible solutions that require a variety of thinking strategies to solve.  If you want this difficult yet rewarding experience, DO NOT look at gameplay or spoilers.  Every step gradually prepares you mentally for the next task, and by utilizing previously ""viewed"" knowledge, you're only cheating yourself.Likes: Visual Quality:  Like I said, the game looks amazing.  Saturated colors galore. The power of the colors makes every section of the island feel vastly different, even when they're two steps from each other.  The small trinkets and the ""evidence of human activity"" scattered around tell small stories themselves.Gameplay:  Traveling is a bit slow, but the island is the right size for your movement speed.  The core of the game, AKA the puzzles, have a good learning curve that steepens in the later portion.  You may get overwhelmed when you first see a puzzle you haven't come across before.  There's no time limit, so do not feel the need to solve everything right away.  I guarantee you will not be successful if that is the mindset you hold.  This is a game where your success depends on your own willpower and thinking strategies.   Dislikes:-Overwhelming color: Certain areas in the game have puzzles specifically using the area's color scheme.  Be weary when playing with screen brightness at maximum, you're eyes are not prepared for that intensity and brightness of color.  It only occurs in two or three areas, but I had to leave after about 30 minutes because I was having trouble seeing the puzzles. -Not an Adventure Game: I have this under dislike even though I like the concept of the game temendously.  This is more of a warning or FYI.  If you're hoping for a plot and character development and purpose, good luck.  This is a solitary game.  You make discoveries yourself, but it's all for your own pride.  -Replayability:  Unless a patch or something is released for another island or whatnot, I doubt many people will play this twice for pleasure.  I would totally let my friends play this so I can feel superior to them while they struggle, but that's about it.			"

												This is definitely a puzzle game - moreso than Portal or other first-person puzzle games like that. It feels a lot more like Myst. You are dropped in a world and have to figure out puzzles without any context whatsoever. It makes the puzzles a lot more challenging - but when you  understand how the puzzles work, it is a lot more rewarding.The puzzles increase in difficulty - one puzzle is ""teaching"" you how to solve the next. Getting the right answer to a puzzle isn't the point - it's figuring out how the puzzles ""work"" so you can apply that to the next one. You aren't going to be able to solve the puzzles by guess-and-check. You will spend time thinking about a puzzle, figuring out how/why the solution is the way it is, and -  once you ""get"" it - you will blow through a whole series of puzzles at a time (and feel really smart for doing so.)I haven't gotten to the point of frustration yet - so far I've ""got"" all of the puzzles that I've come across so far, or realized that they were based on a mechanic that I wasn't ""taught"" yet.Colorblind players might have issues with this game - some of the puzzles appear to use colors to hint how to solve them.

												This game a treat. From the start you can tell it gets inspiration from Myst, and yet is a truely unique experience. Simple yet deep, this game is well crafted. Initially seeing all the puzzles from videos, I was worried that it might get boring but this ended up being far from the truth. It's quite clever what this game does with the puzzles and I find myself always getting excited to reach the next one. But don't let that deceive you, the level of difficulty seems to be scaling quite a bit already and i'm only 6 hours in.On a side note: I could care less if it doesn't have music, i feel like it just adds to the experience. Its funny how people are like.. this game sucks, no music. Thumbs down! You gotta be open minded and patient with this game.Well worth the price.			"

												You might first look at The Witness and say, ""Is there only line puzzles?"", I did the same thing and was skeptical that the game would be boring. Let me be the one to tell you that line puzzles were all this game needed to become one of the best puzzle games ever made. The Witness easily gets a 10/10 in my book, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a puzzle game. Positives Beautiful open world environment to explore Hundreds of puzzles, basic difficulty to very challenging Probably one of the most unique gaming experiences of 2015-2016 Creative puzzle design that keeps you from getting bored of line puzzles Will make you look at life in a different light Easily 30+ hours of content (that's if your good at puzzles) Negatives I beat it already, I want more Could have used a little bit of backround music Controls can feel sluggish, but it is a puzzle game remember People with sensory issues (Hearing, Color Blind) would not be able to fully enjoy the game Difficult puzzles can eat up a lot of time if you get stuck Non-puzzle lovers will probably dislike this game completely (there's nothing to the game besides puzzles) "

												Fantastic. The puzzles are genuinely difficult. Difficult by nature.

												TLDR - Outstanding puzzle game, little graphics options and only stereo sound.I don't think the other reviews understand the point of the game. This is by far one of the best puzzle games I have ever played! The puzzles can be extremely difficult at times with no instructions or guidance which is fantastic and exactly how a puzzle game should be. Not sure how long the games lasts but I can't see myself finishing anytime soon, a lot of puzzles I had to give up on because they were just too hard :P. There is little story however there are audio tapes scattered around the island for you to discover but I'm finding it hard to understand their meaning, maybe I'm too dumb or it will piece itself together at the end, I'm yet to find out.I assume this is a console port since the only graphics options are low, medium, high and vsync which isn't really that bad since the games runs brilliantly, I'm hitting 400+fps on high with a high end rig.The sound only works in stereo mode for headsets which is a shame but should hopefully get fixed soon.

I was not expecting to buy this until I heard a review that explained how deep and elaborate the puzzle system is. Each puzzle seems daunting immediately, and then the brilliant and minimalist design pops out at you right away. After 3 hours, I have around 100 puzzles down, and you can see the rabbit hole they are leading you done.Very impressive. Superbly delivered product and a stunningly beautiful environment. Rare to get both in the same game. Buy it, the world needs more video games like this.			"

												The ratings made me expect something fabulous, fun, and rewarding, but I found this game to be tedious, pretentious and - my biggest complaint - very difficult. I'm just not hipster enough to like it, or smart enough, or have the patience, or...something. Permanently deleting, after 8 hours and many, many online cheats, will give me more pleasure than solving any of the puzzles (I managed some on my own). I wish I had it on a CD just so I could snap it in half.It feels like there may be an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" situation, with everyone claiming it's such a great experience, a masterpiece, while fearing to seem dullards if admitting finding it incredibly tough and providing no compelling reason to continue. But it does not bother me to say that I am too stupid to enjoy this game. (I also admit I feel inferior when I solve an Infinifactory puzzle and then see a much faster and complex or better solution online.) I reckon I'm an Untermensch. So be it. I'll steer clear of puzzle games like this one, now that I know I cannot enjoy something that takes this much thought without a paycheck. Life is hard enough already and I don't need a game to push me to despair.It looks pretty, though.			"

												I strongly recommend this *if* you love puzzles and exploration.I was on the fence at first. I love puzzle games but everything I had seen suggested this was just a bunch of panel puzzles which could have been a phone game, with the island being just a five-million-dollar 3D menu system which took seven years to make and made the game cost £30 at launch. I was going to wait until it was on sale, but I kept hearing there was more (but never specifics) and a friend said it was good so I took a gamble and I treated myself. I'm really glad I did. I got my money's worth, as you can see from the playtime, and did & found almost everything myself, which was very rewarding.The island is not just a menu system. It is part of the game. It is part of the puzzles. It is needed to solve the puzzle panels. It *is* the puzzles in some cases, and I am not just talking about large walk-on puzzle panels (although those do exist as well). I personally love exploring large 3D environments, and it is full of incredible detail, which makes everything feel real. It is not just the amount of polygons on screen but the way everything feels made out of solid stuff. Scaffolding and supports are in the places they would be in a real decaying building that needed them, and things like that. Things like the shoreline of a beach are really well observed, with so many tiny details. And every detail may matter, because it may be part of a puzzle or a clue, so you have a reason to look at them, too.The island feels large and varied, but it usually only takes a short time to get from one place to another when you need to, so it is never a trek. It would be more accurate to call it dense than large, but the density makes it feel large. You'll often run the same route several times and discover something new on the way in a place  you thought had nothing left to give.The puzzle panels are everywhere, but they are not the only things you can interact with, and the panels themselves are actually a UI for doing varied things, with a consistent theme and visual language. Some of them act like switches. Some are just puzzles. Some are both. The puzzles themselves are varied, and not just simple mazes (although there are a few), nor just logic mazes (although there are many). Nobody minded that Doom 3 had lots of interactive computer terminals which looked and worked in a consistent way, and the panels in The Witness are not entirely dissimilar, but obviously also more the focus of the game than in Doom 3 (and you won't be shooting any demons from hell).The puzzles themselves are very, very well designed. Puzzle design is hard to do in games, getting the training, progression and learning curve right without it feeling too hard, too easy, or too repetitive. The game nails this overall, although there was one type of puzzle some people may find a little hard (but you can always use a walkthrough for that one type if it comes to it, and my advice is to repeat the patterns yourself as that seemed to help me visualise them). A sign of a good puzzle game is that, once you've learned the basics, you'll face puzzles where you try the obvious solution but find the designer has thought of that and added a complication to make you have to think laterally to solve it. This game is full of things like that.The engine ran very well on my PC staying at a solid 60 FPS at 1080p on my GTX 960. I could up the res to 4k and get about 45 FPS but 1080p + good antialiasing and 60 FPS felt better. My hardware isn't really up to 4k gaming, so the fact it could have done >30 FPS in this game at 4k is a positive. A week after launch the things it was missing like FOV sliders and joypad sensitivity were added (mouse sensitivity was already in the game, and I played using keyboard & mouse).Any negatives? Well, the story is minimal, but that honestly didn't bother me. In fact, I'd have preferred if there was even less story as I felt the small attempts to give some background to the island in some of the more hidden audiologs did not really work. I disliked the audiologs in general, but they are more of a collectible and, I guess, an attempt to make the player think about philosophy and spirituality while playing the game. You can completely ignore them (whether you click on them or not) and it will make no difference to the rest of the game.I found the (lack of) editing of the quotes and the voice actors' delivery made even the seriously profound quotations have me wishing they would just shut up and stop repeating the same idea again and again because I understood it the first time and I keep thinking the quote will end now but they keep adding more words to say the same thing I already understood, just like this sentence itself has become; it can get annoying, can't it, when someone won't just stop talking even though they have run out of ideas to say, however good the ideas were at the start? :)I also felt that the game's audiologs & meta-story were pushing the concept of spirituality as a given, as how the world must be viewed to experience the wonder of life to its full, and then they literally complain that few prominent atheists/scientists provide answers to spiritual questions rather than criticisms of other answers. I can see how the conversation arose. The game aimed to present various philosophies' takes on the world, some of them conflicting, and without saying 'this is right, and that is wrong', and it achieved that in general, but ended up criticising atheism and only atheism. It's trendy to bash atheism lately, and some of that backlash *is* deserved, but the author-inserts' complaint in the game was that it doesn't fit the framing the game designers wanted, which is neither its duty nor its fault. It's like complaining that statistics won't tell you which lottery numbers will come up, when a clairvoyant will. It also occurred that the author-inserts making this complaint were guilty of the exact same thing themselves, but not self-aware enough to see it. None of this really affects the rest of the game, though. It's just audio you can ignore if you don't like it.While I liked Braid a hell of a lot, I wasn't a particular fan of Blow personally. He has exceptional design & dev skills, but I disagree with a bunch of things he's said (although certainly not everything) and find his attempts at narrative a bit pretentious, to be blunt. But that does not matter. This isn't ""Be Jonathan Blow's Friend: The Game"" and restricting ourselves to art only made by people we'd be friends with would rob ourselves of many great experiences, including this. As with Braid, the game mechanics and designs speak for themselves.Before the game came out, many assumed it would be like Myst, and then wrote they were disappointed it was not. Having played it, I don't understand this. It felt *a lot* like Myst to me, and that game is fresh in my mind from recently playing Myst, RealMyst and Riven for the first time. You have an island full of puzzles and zones, things you have to work out for yourself using observation, symbols, logic and experimentation, and things you learn in one area that were gating your progress in another (i.e. ability to solve puzzles & open new areas). You have the isolation and the beauty. The feeling that someone made this place, for some purpose, and that it is both real and surreal, and will probably never be completely understood, but definitely has some meaning. Some of the areas are direct homages to Myst, too (e.g. the treetops).If you like solving puzzles, if you like exploring, and having your observation rewarded at almost every turn, if you want to be inside a dense puzzle-candy store, if you like getting lost in a beautiful island that is tightly packed with detail, with things to find and do at literally every turn, then you will love this game and get many hours out of it. It is worth every penny and, more importantly, worth your time.			"

												The Witness is a stunning and stunningly fatiguing puzzle game that captures both the moments of madness and bliss its creator must’ve felt over its seven years of development. And all that madness and bliss? Well, you’ll experience a fair amount too if you play it.Jonathan Blow, creator of The Witness, in an interview with The Guardian, said he wants to make games for people who read Gravity’s Rainbow. Not everyone who games reads books, and I imagine even fewer read Pynchon. Much like The Witness, Blow’s statement is obtuse and vague but still understandable: He wants to make a game that not everyone will understand, enjoy, or fully comprehend the first time through. In this sense, he achieved what he intended: a frustrating, beautiful and alienating puzzle game. In love with this idea, it seems he never stopped to consider how the player on the other end of the experience will feel about it all.On a surface level, The Witness resembles the open-world of Myst, puzzle mechanics that gradually build on each other like in Braid (his previous game) and rudimentary grid-based puzzles you’d find in the newspaper. One assumes there must be more to the game than this. In many ways there is, but not always in the ways you want or expect. The ways in which you discover and solve puzzles continues to surprise even after ten hours of play. With over 700 puzzles, it’s entirely possible that Blow is displaying every conceivable puzzle type possible with the rules at play. Discovering and playing with those rules is what makes The Witness so enjoyable and often so painfully tedious.Unlike Portal and other recent successful puzzle games, The Witness puts a focus on making the player define the rules of the world. Even a tutorial isn’t defined in this game. Instead, you solve a series of simple puzzles, discover nothing changed, and decide “Well, I guess that’s a tutorial!” The Witness is a game about thinking outside the box without ever knowing how big that box might be. Not only is this process deep and ingeniously clever, but it holistically feeds into what the game is trying to convey to the player about life and nature.If this is all The Witness contained, it’s be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, discovering the rules of the world is only half the experience. You also have to apply them. A puzzle game is only as good as its rule sets. A good rule set can make a puzzle game endlessly fun; I’ve played Picross for years and will continue to do so. But spending even a couple hours with some of the rule sets in The Witness makes me never want to play the game again.A good puzzle should be about figuring out what rules are needed and how they are applied, but so much of The Witness’ frustration comes from the game obscuring readability for challenge. Imagine playing Tetris with the screen half-black or Uncharted with the screen spinning. It would be unacceptable. The Witness is so far removed from other games that it can almost get away with these tricks at times but they are still cheap tricks: lazy ways of adding challenge to a puzzle that would be easy to solve otherwise.Additionally, half the puzzles are trial-and-error and not in the sense of “Does this rule apply here or that one?” but rather “I know what rules apply, I just don’t know the exact path through so I need to try again and again until I find it.” Where The Witness’ best moments made me feel satisfied by being observant and thoughtful, these puzzles made me feel like my time was wasted. I never felt clever or happy solving them, as they require an amount of brute force and patience that makes for a miserable puzzle-solving experience.There are awful things about The Witness. The game becomes so awful at the end that I decided to stop playing it and watch videos of the ending instead. I think Blow is a very intelligent designer but I also think he is a very stubborn one. He insists on making a complicated world that is not meant to be easily understood (or understandable at all, in some aspects); rather than a game world that is designed to accommodate the player. I don’t mean to imply the game needs tutorials or guiding the player -- it’s in these aspects that Blow’s stubbornness pays off -- but the puzzles should have been designed with player experience in mind. If they were tested on players, then Blow must be fully aware that his puzzles force nausea, discomfort, eye strain and just aren’t fun at all at times, especially in the game’s final section.The Witness is a puzzle game that tests the player’s resolve more often than their intellect. Even though Dark Souls is one of my favorite games, what The Witness asks of me in terms of visual discomfort, fatigue, and repetition is not worth the experience of playing it all. But it is worth playing. It’s a contradiction I’m aware, but the beauty of The Witness’ world, exploration, and message to the player is inspiring. It’s world is one of the greatest things ever achieved in games and when it’s good, it’s incredible. But more often than not, I found myself bored and tired by many of the game’s poor rule sets and combinations of them. There is a madness and obsession that permeates across The Witness. It manifests itself in the unfathomably beautiful and complex visual design and layout of the game. But, unfortunately, it also manifests itself in the puzzles that have a blatant disregard toward player experience. So in love with this vision, it seems Blow never considered how others may view it. The Witness is a game about the joy of discovery and observation, but so often its puzzles go directly against this theme. The Witness might aspire to be Gravity’s Rainbow, but it’s not. It can’t be. It’s not a book. It’s a game. And if it were more aware of this aspect, it would be a better one for it.			"

												The Witness is a wonderful game! The panels you see in the trailer are the only mechanic of the game, but the way you interact with it changes dramaticaly from zone to zone. Sometimes, the enviroment gives you the answer to a puzzle that at first looked simple, but only has one corret answer. There are others where 2 solutions trigger 2 actions, one at a time. It can be difficult at times, but I can't stress how good this game is!			"

												This game is eeeexcellent.So. Gameplay. Let's get the first thing out of the way, which is the reservation a lot of people seem to have when seeing this game for the first time. That one being, ""Is this just a game where you draw lines inside of mazes? Isn't there anything more to it than that? That seems dumb.""That is exactly what this game will look like if you are just watching Let's Plays. And honestly? The first couple hours of the game will feel a bit like that. But this is mostly just because the mazes are foundational for solving other, more advanced kinds of puzzles, so you need to learn a lot of things about them right away. Also the maze puzzles are extremely easy to see. Just square terminals sticking out of the ground, right out in the open, right? Seems like you'd just walk up to terminals and solve mazes and that's it, right? WRONG. It only looks like that's the only kind of puzzle at first because that kind of puzzle is THE EASIEST TO SEE. So naturally when you (or whatever Let's Player you're watching) first starts out, you'll just run immediately to all the maze terminals you see, because they are right there and you can just check them off, bam bam bam. But unbeknownst to you, you'll be walking right past dozens of more complex puzzles that you just don't know how to see yet. But the maze terminals are important! They teach you foundational knowledge you'll need for more complex and multi-phased puzzles later.So after you learn a lot of rules and special techniques for the maze puzzles, you will eventually start to run into situations where it's not good enough to just know how to solve a maze puzzle. You start to realize that there are kinds of ""hidden knowledge"" that you need to solve particular puzzles, which you have to get from elsewhere. The knowledge is often something external to the puzzle itself. Whereas in most games this would just amount to finding a door combination written on a wall or piece of paper somewhere, in The Witness nothing is that simple. You have to pay VERY CLOSE ATTENTION, because the insight you need to solve the puzzle might be found in something as subtle as the way a tree looks when reflected off the water of a pond that you are looking at from the second floor of a nearby house. (Note: That is not an actual puzzle solution in the game, but it is the exact KIND of solution you can expect.)That being said, the grid mazes in The Witness, while highly puzzling, are often not the ""actual"" puzzle. They are just a logical puzzle interface on which you communicate a lateral thinking type solution. (Yeah, it gets complicated.) The ""actual"" puzzle is often an insight you have outside of these mazes, and then you use or apply that knowledge in the maze somehow, or else the maze is a sort of gate you pass through on your way to executing the ""actual"", broader solution.It's hard to completely explain without spoiling too much of the fun of discovery, but suffice to say that The Witness is primarily a game about PERSPECTIVE and PERCEPTION. Things may look different depending on the angle and manner of view. A particular object/thing that seems inconsequential may at some point leap out at you as having a meaning that never dawned on you before. A thing that you walked past one hundred times turns out to have an obvious puzzle that you somehow never noticed until the 101st time you walked by. Oh yes. In order to solve the puzzles, you must first be able to PERCEIVE the puzzle, and many puzzles will go quite unperceived by you at first, even though they are right there, staring you in the face. You just weren't looking correctly.Don't ruin it for yourself by watching Let's Plays. That won't give you an accurate idea of the experience of playing The Witness. Watching a Let's Play of The Witness is like watching someone else view one of those Magic Eye books. It's just not the same thing. You have to do it yourself to really get the idea of how good it feels the moment that shift in your perception occurs and YOU FINALLY SEE IT. You will not get that feeling or experience from watching Let's Plays.Puzzle difficulty? There is a wide range of difficulty and type. The maze puzzles being the most obvious type. These will challenge your logical thinking. Some of them are simple as putting two and two together, but you will eventually hit one that seems impossible. And I don't just mean it seems hard. I mean you may literally encounter a puzzle that you are 100% convinced is impossible. It makes no sense! It doesn't follow the rules! But don't worry. Go do some other puzzles elsewhere. You'll come back to it later and find that what before seemed illogical now makes total sense.Then there are the other puzzles, which I will just call the ""non-maze"" puzzles. These will often challenge your spatial and lateral thinking. Logic will only get you so far in The Witness. You'll also need to read and interpret various kinds of unique ""signs"" in the environment and sometimes you'll just have to try a crazy idea. An idea that seems so stupid it couldn't possibly be the answer. But it IS the answer.Don't go into it expecting it to be like Portal or The Talos Principle. There are certain similarities, but The Witness is its very own kind of experience.Finally let's talk visuals. It's not exactly photorealistc. The game does not strive to have amazingly realistic looking textures, and frankly I think that works in its favor. The island still feels very much like a ""real"" place, but visually it is like some kind of living watercolor painting or the most vibrant graphic novel. It is a really cool style that manages to feel both real and stylized. And it's not just the graphics/colors/etc that are worth noting. JBlo actually contracted some professional landscapers to help make sure that every inch of the environments on the island looked fantastic. Just the way that everything is spaced and harmonizes with everything else around it is excellent to behold.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.			"

												First and foremost: This is a puzzle game.I don't mean that in the obvious sense. I mean in the sense where it is the closest game possible (besides possibly the brilliant but flawed game ""Pandora's Box"" made by Microsoft) to a jigsaw puzzle. As such, each fragment of the game you complete - each panel, which you can see in the trailer - is meant to take a small portion of your time to complete, and be challenging in and of itself. If you know the solution, you can solve it within a couple seconds maximum and then immediately start on the next ""piece."" If you cannot solve it, place it down and pick up another. I see a lot of people complaining about lack of reward for completing each panel; your reward is the information you've gained mentally and your greater grasp as to how the puzzles work. If you do not get a sense of euphoria from understanding puzzles and completing them (or if you are failing to gain understanding of the puzzles as you play), this is not your game to begin with.This game also heavily rewards observant people. There is a particular puzzle in the game that I solved within minutes, because I quickly realized more information was needed, and sought out such information, finding it almost instantly. I watched someone else who took hours on the puzzle because they failed to recognize where they were missing information. No puzzle in the game has a solution that is obtuse or arbitrary; all the information you need to solve every puzzle in the game is given to you in creative ways; you just need to recognize it. 98% of the time, it is immediately around you, staring you point-blank in the face.Comparisons are hard to draw. I see plenty of reviewers likening this game to Myst or The Talos Principle. Neither of these are good comparisons at all. Myst had obtuse puzzles that were not explained fully with little depth. In The Witness, each puzzle is obvious and doesn't require vague clues from elsewhere. You are required, however, to fully understand the puzzle itself. Knowing how to solve it is not enough; there are many puzzles within the game with several possible solutions, and you are required to figure out them all. As such, each puzzle has incredible depth and complexity, which cannot be said of adventure games like Myst.Each puzzle also does more than form a small part of a whole; you are required to understand and learn what works within the puzzles and what doesn't. Once you understand the puzzle itself (which in my case, sometimes required graph paper, Legos, or both), solving it was trivial and took seconds. The same cannot be said of The Talos Principle, where each puzzle had a few variables which, with trial and error, could be used to create a solution, and even with the solution in mind could take several minutes.The Witness is not a game for everyone, and both positive and negative reviewers need to understand this (In fact, a negative reviewer explained in such depth what he disliked about the game that I realized this was 100% my kind of game and bought it immediately). If you are a curious player who pays attention to detail in every game you play, and who enjoys brilliantly-crafted mental challenges just for the sake of the challenge, this may well be the puzzle game you've been waiting for. If you suffer from impatience while attempting jigsaw puzzles, or often charge through games without peeking around every nook and cranny first, watch someone else play the first few minutes of The Witness to get a better feel. This may just not be for you.			"

												To begin, I think I have to explain what the Witness is. The Witness is a puzzle game, you draw lines through puzzle boxes and it slowly gets more complex as you get through the game.The puzzles are actually executed fairly well in my opinion, the island is reasonably sized and there is  a boat that brings you from dock to dock but you can run across the island pretty quickly regardless . I've got some gripes with the way a couple of them were executed, for instance (serious spoiler potential),  there are some puzzles based on sound. This is a serious problem for me because I didn't realize this until half-way through brute-forcing them as I listen to podcasts while playing singleplayer games like this. Even when I did realize, I'm completely tone-deaf and while I could get through a couple it started throwing in garbage noise to make it harder. This is the only time I had to use a guide (and the one other time there was a sound puzzle)  . To summarize without spoilers, there are some puzzles that used mechanics I'm not a fan of, and I think weren't thought through very well, though they weren't so terrible as to ruin the game.Beyond that, I think that the game is really cool with the way it uses its theme (which seems to be  perspective  ) and some of the way the puzzles are implemented. The basic gameplay of just solving puzzles is pretty satisfying as was a certain moment in the game. Again, huge spoilers, but  there are line puzzles implemented in the actual environment whereas normally it's done on relatively small panels. You can probably find one of these environmental ""puzzles"" at any point in the game, it clearly tutorializes it about after you've completed your first puzzle segment though, when you are lead to a mountain has a panel with a very simple line and immediately behind that is a river that is identical to the line. I found an environmental puzzle shortly before this moment which was very satisfying though. However, the thing that  really  sold me on this mechanic is when I was riding on a boat past a cliff-face that had a wavy yellow line that was never really complete at any point. But I turned the boat around, and realized that I could complete the puzzle while the boat was moving me past. This started making me look for circles and lines in  everything   .All that said, as the game came to a close I was left a bit unsatisfied. Not for a lack of puzzles, I honestly never want to do another one in my life. But because the ending itself honestly just felt  extremely pretentious  . Like I said, the mechanics and everything are actually really cool if you like interesting puzzle games, as I do. But the game honestly  lacks any real story and attempts to supplement that with theme, and just feels hamfisted  .In the end, if you read all the spoiler text, the text that I noted as a serious spoiler in particular, you don't need this game. It's got nothing for you and you should just watch it being played or something like that if you're curious, but it seriously holds no value for you if you've been spoiled. If not though, I think this is a must-play for fans of puzzle games. It's seriously just cool.			"

												I knew roughly, what I was getting into, before I bought the game.I thought ""this could be fun"". Solving puzzles. Taking in the beautiful environment.....Well, I guess not.It's really exactly as tedious as it seemed at first glance.Which wouldn't be that bad, except the game doesn't communicate AT ALL what you're supposed to do.....Sometimes you see an entirely new and strange puzzle and the game just expects you to guess that surely you'll be taught how to solve it in another location via little tutorial puzzles - so that you can just continue onwards for now. While on other instances the game expects you to, though you have NO CLUE AT ALL that the puzzle is even possible for you to solve at that moment, somehow just FEEL that there are clues hidden around you....I really tried hard to like this game, but I just kept feeling completely confused of what was expected of me,of what I should solve and of what I should be able to solve in the first place.Where should I go? What knowledge was I expected to already possess?...One good example pretty early on for this utter lack of direction was the windmill. I cracked the code. I got in.Now what ? Oh there's a switch... if I press it in direction 1 some cable lights up and the windmill starts turning...if i press the switch in direction 2 some other cable lights up, but the windmill isn't turning any more.Okay, so now what? Do I need the windmill to turn ? I don't know, how about the freaking game tells me ?If I don't need it for anything, which is how it seems to be, then what do the two cables do? They disappear upwards out of view, how am I supposed to know where they lead or if they activate things I just can't see ?...Another example, which frustrated me immensely, was the final switch below the desert.So I solved all the tedious reflection-based puzzles, and some door opens, and there is a simple switch again.I press it, rumbling starts and I instinctively go back a few steps to see, if my surroundings change in some way.At which point it turns out the area around the switch was an elevator, which now lifts itself out of view, -WITHOU ME ON BOARD. I couldn't believe it.This should have been a moment of relief und pride, some sense of accomplishment at least -I beat the whole damn level ! - But no, I just stood there below the earth, trying desperatelyto get that freaking elevator back down, which of cause didn't work.Instead I realized in amazement that I could send sparks down a now visible cableshaft - who knows what I could do with this newly found mystical Power ??? - Aha, nothing, eh? -.-So in the end I walked all the way up again through all the puzzle rooms I just solved an felt IMMENSELY frustrated. This game lacks any kind of reward, or feeling of accomplishment even. You literally solve hundreds of boring puzzles like a little monkey, without gaining anything. The beautiful nature is there from the beginning, nothing to gain here. New abilities, or quicker movement or leveling up or WHATEVER ELSE - nope, nothing to gaing here.Just quotations of long dead people, which often feel more like the game is lecturing you, then anything else.Thanks for telling me that I should think about stuff, yeah.Oh, a quotation about people not seeing and heering and acknowledging god - how nice.A guy who killed people should really be held accountable, wow, who'd have thought.I really hoped, this game wouldn't make playing it SO DAMN HARD.Maybe I even try playing a little on, later.But for now I really REALLY need anything with even the slightest bit of fun.

												I refuse to play this game anymore than I've already put in as it's obvious nothing changes. The hour I spent playing the game is going to be the same throughout the rest, and that's not a good thing. You solve puzzles to solve more puzzles so that you can solve some more puzzles. The game wants you to think there's some underlying story, it wants you to give the game meaning and other than solving maze puzzles over and over there's none. I seriously can't understand how this game has so many positive reviews, and apparently I'm not the only one. If I had to describe this game in a few words: pretentious, bland and repetitive.			"

												The game looks great, but has both a technical and a community defect.I use an uncommon keyboard layout and the game only allows you to choose a few different pre-set key configurations. On my keyboard layout all of them have the movement keys all over the keyboard, so it's not even playable.Worse though, is what I saw when I googled ""the witness change keybinds"". A player complained (harshly) about the lack of key configuration options. The forum admin responded in a passive agressive way and moved the thread to ""dumb internet comments"". This is not an acceptable way to treat your customers, even if you think their critique of your game is unfair. After seeing this, I can't in good conscience recommend the game to anyone.			"

												No Borderless Windowed mode. No audio options. Options menu doesn't respond to mouse input. No key rebinding.The game is pretty and some of the puzzles are enjoyable, but there's a lot that isn't intuitive. Puzzles are often not laid out in ways that ""teach"" you how to solve some puzzle types. Failing some puzzles resets the previous puzzle, forcing you to backtrack and solve the previous puzzle again. I assume this is meant to prevent ""brute force"" solutions, but it really ends up being tedious. Simply, the game doesn't value the player's time. Note: If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there will be times when you need to look up the puzzle. Several puzzles rely on audio to find a solution. It is also likely that people with color blindness will be unable to solve a number of puzzles.			"

												Much like movies took us inside the mind of John Malkovich, or great works of film took us inside the dark world of Brad Pitt's sensually charged world of vampires, or books that built the world of the charming businessman Christian Gray, ""The Witness"" takes us by the hand and guides us roughly, painfully at first, but then with growing anticipation, into the depths of Jonathan Blow's sex fueled addiction to methamphetamines.Great puzzle games pose significant but mortally overcomable logical challenges, as we reverse engineer solutions from a procedural sequence of rules. The Witness takes this one step further. The rules are not always known, and an equal part of the puzzle is even understanding what the rules of the puzzle even are -- and much like David Fincher's ""The Game"", the fact that you only get to experience it once ""for the first time"" is a deep regret. That it takes place in on a graphically gorgeous island is merely a bonus. Though the story transcends even the most meta of meta at times, you might be forgiven for being skeptical. Jonathan Blow is not merely channeling the spectral ghost of Stephen King's The Dark Tower and protagonist Roland Delacroix, but has instead become his spiritual sucessor, weaving his personal challenges at constructing a decade long 7th wonder of puzzle into a public offering for the mass market. His talents will speak for themselves.I am highly critical when it comes to puzzle games, but as a puzzle enthusiast, The Witness has become a core component of my psyche along with a short list of other greats. Zachtronics. Deadly rooms of death. Saira. Is it worth $40 to a general audience? Maybe not. But I feel it was time very well spent. And if you are a cool person who likes great mental games, this is a game for you. If you do not like it, please, don't tell me. Because I won't like you any more.  Good day.			"

												I purchased this game because I LOVED Braid, so I was expecting something as fun and simple yet subtle and atmospheric as Braid was. After 8 hours of play the verdict is: it seems I am not going to get it. No charming music, no story, no fun, just beatiful lifeless island and puzzles, puzzles, puzzles. I generally like intellectual effort, but in The Withess puzzle solving feels too much like boring meaningless work that I have plenty in my real life))) Too often I can't figure out what's required of me or how it works so I am just guessing and do trial-and-error, and I guess this difficulty would still be ok, if there were an in-game reward for solving, e.g. some plotline that develops along the chain of puzzles, but there is nothing at all like that so far. Maybe I don't love abstract puzzles enough to love this product....PS. BTW I read or heard somewhere that the environment hints you the solution- nope, have not  witnessed  that in the whole 8 hrs)))			"

However, the game lacks any kind of story, narrative, action or meaning and all you get for your efforts is the satisfaction of having figured out the puzzle and some insufferably smug philosphical readings which are completely unrelated to the game.The island is pretty, but following a path for what feels like ages to find that it only goes to a nice view or a spot where the scenery lines up into a picture wears very thin, very fast.Pros: good puzzlesCons: needed more game, less ""art""If you want puzzles you'll like it, if you want a game, you won't			"

The interface is intuitive.  The puzzles start easy and get hard, guaranteeing you both the flow experience of quick, intuitive solutions and the head-wrenching frustration of seemingly insoluble challenges.  The feeling you get when you finish a zone is that of really heady accomplishment.Four hours in, I've hit a point where I'm convinced I'll never solve another puzzle.  But that's happened before, and if I leave the game alone for a week or two I'm sure I'll have a flash of inspiration when I come back.CONS: It's a 3D world, and you can't jump.

												The Witness purely a puzzle game, and I've never been fan of purely puzzle games. I don't mean I never should have bought this, I mean I like when games have purpose and puzzles, and The Witness only has one of those things.Some puzzles are tricky, yes, and the trickiest require you to finish a puzzle elsewhere on the map for the solution to a previous one, but most of the puzzles are solved by you staring at them for an extended period of time before the solution clicks. It's also extremely annoying when a puzzle could very very easily be solved by trial and error, but the game makes you return to the previous puzzle if you get it wrong. This seems like a cheap way of forcing you to solve it correctly especially when my favorite puzzles have so many combinations that it's more worth your time to figure out the answer the way the game intends rather than through trial and error.As expected from his previous game, the Braid developer has shown a complete incapability of adding any meaningful story. I don't know why I expected a better for this game, maybe it was because of Portal and to a much much much lesser extent The Talos Principle (which I believe is filled with too much philosophical mumbo jumbo) but I would have liked some form of purpose to this game, any reason to exist whatsoever, besides only solving puzzles, but there's none. There's voice tapes scattered throughout and some extremely out of place videos but these almost always ramble on for minutes at a time and have you screaming ""stop stop stop I don't care"" until you avoid the voice tapes entirely.If none of that bothers you, then The Witness is a good puzzle game. It seems all negative reviews can at least agree a little bit on that, so if you want something to try to chip away at every night then this is pretty good filler.final edit, for something that I forgot to add apparently: What is with the lack of colorblind options? There's puzzles in a greenhouse I am physically incapable of finishing because I am colorblind. I had to get my brother to do them for me, and that's not any fun. Not only that, there's puzzles that require hearing, and my first thought was ""RIP deaf people."" Almost every knowledgeable developer adds ways of getting around these disabilities given to us lowly people by a warping of the universe at birth, but I guess The Witness is above such catering. I don't belive I'm entitled to specific or better treatment, and I hate to be a special snowflake, but come on, even Battlefield, a game that arguably doesn't need it, has colorblind options. It involves something as basic as switching color based puzzles to symbols - that's all that needs to be done!			"

												I am generally not a fan of games that require a lot of patience. 15 hours of playtime ago I may have not recommended The Witness, if only out of spite. I was really enjoying the puzzles that taught, and then asked you to apply, knowledge of the puzzle-language the game employs. But then I ran into a set of frustratingly silly puzzles that relied on --and I appoogize, because I must be vague about this to avoid spoilers-- something I don't feel belongs as part of solving puzzles in a puzzle game. There are also these random bits of audio log, and some even more out of place video, that reminded me a lot of the textural parts of Braid that I ignored. Not so much for the content, which at the time seemed pretentious, but because of how disconnected they were from the rest of the experience.But I found the puzzles themselves so engaging that I pushed through. And then I ran into a second set of similar puzzles, and again I pushed through. And after some more great puzzles I became incredibly frustrated by the increasing occurances of a puzzle concept that I hadn't yet found the ""tutorial"" set of puzzles for. I ended up looking up the explanation, and I regret it. I was driven by a feeling that the game was wasting my time, or expecting too much of me, but in retrospect I can see that wasn't the case, it was merely asking me to be patient.As I neared the end game, the puzzles I thought were great began to show true brilliance in how they interacted with me, how they changed the way I thought, the way I interacted with the world. And those seemingly disconnected and pretentious bits of dialog and video were suddenly relevant and sound musings on philosophical concepts that were actually exposed through gameplay. There were moments, furstrating moments, where I knew I was missing something about a puzzle, and then as I realized what it was I would be overcome with that special awe of sudden understanding, of now seeing things that were always there, but were filtered out by that part of my mind that, in its ignorance, believes it knows what's going on.I haven't yet finished the game. And it's pretty obvious now that there is a difference between finishing it and having completed it, though I'm not sure I'm willing to devote the time I believe will be required for the latter task. This is a flaw with myself, not the game, mind you. The game does demand patience, which I lack for the most part, but not without reason.Play this game. Take your time. Trust that it knows what it is doing and let it guide you. You will not regret it.			"

												The Witness is a gorgeous, exquisitely-detailed game. If you like exploring a peaceful and colorful island, if you like being challenged with geometric puzzles that test your logic and observational skills, if you like the satisfaction of spending time on some of the puzzles and eventually having the satisfaction of figuring them out, then this is right up your alley. Most of the game is non-linear, in that if a puzzle is blocking your progress in one area then there are plenty of other areas to work on until you have an epiphany.The game has a first-person perspective; all you ever see of yourself is your shadow. There are no other people around (aside from many beautifully-posed clay statues). You're free to explore the island at your own pace. There are some doors beside computer monitors that display mazes and symbols. Figure out the patterns and solve the mazes to open the doors and get access to more of the island. Sometimes, scenery nearby will help show you the correct path to choose through the maze. It's a lot like a modern-day Myst. No weapons, no jumping, no dying, no health bar, no inventory, no automap, no music, no words; just puzzles to solve and an island to explore.Everything about the game feels handcrafted; it even uses its own custom-built graphics engine. There are many locations where, if you stand in just the right place, the scenery will line up just right so that you know it was intended.The endgame is The Witness's only drawback. Suddenly it becomes very much like Portal (without the homocidal AI), and the puzzles become much more difficult not because they're more challenging but because the game makes them harder to see. And I found the game's actual end disappointing because it left so many questions unanswered (like, what's the point of all the obelisks?).Still, it's a journey I recommend, though you may want to have a hint guide nearby to avoid getting stuck for days trying to figure out what a puzzle is looking for.

												Best puzzle game i've ever played.Pros:[+] Nice visuals[+] No music, just nature sounds. Makes the whole experience so very relaxing[+] No pressure whatsoever.[+] Open area with many puzzles that introduce different rules but still use the same mechanic that is introduced in the beginning. if you stumble upon something you don't know how to solve you can just go the other way and solve something else until you figure out that specific rules you didn't understand before.[+] No plot. I'd say is a pro, even though many people consider it to be a huge con. There are some collectibles and other stuff that makes you think there is something happening, but in reality it's just a puzzle game. Don't expect interesting ending or deep messages. You can on the other hand expect some cool secret stuff.[+] Incredible depth of the puzzles. The gameplay consists of you ""finding a route on special tablets"". It may sound boring, but each different zone introduces new rules that define the puzzle. There are sound puzzles, color puzzles, tetris-block based puzzles and many many more. Not only that but rules get combined and harder. [+] Vast ammount of secrets. As you gradually proceed through the game you begin to understand that there's something else besides simple puzzles. Not to spoil everything but there's a huge amount of secret puzzles, secret places and such and such. You just have to know where to look. And where to look from. [+] Everytime you boot up the game you continue from the point you left the game at. Cons: [-] No plot. If you're into puzzle games for plot then you should probably skip it.[-] It's not rewarding. You don't get a candy for solving all the puzzles in the area, you don't get rewarded for different actions. There are some specific things that will trigger secret scenes but that's pretty much it. The puzzles are their own reward.[-] Some puzzles include sound and color which might be challenging for tone-deaf and color-blind people. [-] Other puzzles you might find to be extremely difficult. I never felt frustrated with the game because if i found myself lost i usually checked a guide or something, just to keep the experience flowing and relaxed. Some other people might have problems with that and stay stuck at some particular puzzle, which might result in some frustration. I can't recommend this game enough for all the puzzle-genre fans but i've read lots of reviews where people felt lost due to the ending and misleading nature of the game, that occasionally makes you think there is a story, a point behind all that. Citing words of infamous Sean Murray ""Don't go in looking for that kind of experience. It's not that kind of a game"".			"

												This game is fantastic, and I would highly recommend it.  The puzzle design is amazing.  It's the same ""kind"" of puzzle in that you're always drawing lines from one point to another, but the different ways this game makes you think, the puzzle design, and how often this gets switched up made this an incredibly enjoyable experience from start to finish.The only thing two things I would say detracts from the game are that you can come across puzzles you don't know how to solve yet, and the difficulty can spike randomly.  This is definitely in my top 5 for puzzle games though.  Check this game out!			"

												If you enjoy puzzles for the sake of puzzles, you will absolutely love this game.  Though the premise of all of the puzzles are the same (go from point A to point B on a grid), the variations on this theme are quite extensive- though there are hundreds of the puzzles throughout the island, you won't tire of repetition.This being said, if you need a story, or any goal to motivate you, I would recommend staying away from the game.  There is no story to be found; just disconnected, pretensious, 'philosophical' ramblings.  The game would have been better if these had been left out completely, but since it can all be skipped, it's not really detrimental to the game.The main puzzles of this game are all possible through logic alone- I would highly recommend avoiding any walkthroughs, as being given the answers greatly cheapens the experiance of figuring it out for yourself.  That being said, the black monolith puzzles vary from ""obvious"" to ""there is absolutely no way you will figure this out on your own.""  Once you complete the main game, don't feel too bad about breaking out a walkthrough to find all of those really obscure patterns in the world...  or just skip that section entirely.In summary, I highly recommend this game to puzzle enthusiasts, but not anybody else.  Know your own tastes, and don't try to force this game on yourself if this isn't your thing.			"

												This game reminded me a lot of Myst, one of the very first PC games I ever played. In both games you're the only living creature on a mysterious island full of puzzles. And both games are the only ones I've ever needed to use actual pen and paper to get through. The island is colorful and beautifilly crafted, with lots of secrets to find, including an entirely optional unique game mechanic that will change the way you look at everything in the game.The puzzles in this are all similar: you have a grid with 1 or more starting points and 1 or more end points, and you have to draw a line between them. But that isn't much of a puzzle so the game complicates things with extra rules, like the line has to pass through certain points, or draw a certain shape. Sometimes there are multiple solutions that cause different things to happen. It all sounds very simple when decribed like this but the puzzles become brutal when different sets of rules are layered together.There isn't really a story; the game is about solving puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles. Which is good since Jonathan Blow's version of storytelling in Braid was giant screens of text in between levels. In The Witness there is no text whatsoever, other than the main menu. All the important communication is told through puzzles, which is done pretty well for the most part. The only words in the game at all come in the form of audio logs of spiritual and philosophical quotes, and a few secret videos, none of which have anything to do with the game and are all easily-ignored pretentiousness typical of Blow.

												I have never been so confused in a game in my life, nothing made sense thoughout the game yet I kept playing, some levels  took hours, some took minutes but no matter which puzzles I was doing I still did not know what I was doing them more. This lack of knowledge was my motivation to trudge though insanely difficult puzzles and them get super frustrated and check a walkthrough for solutions. As I got to the last puzzles I felt anticipation for what was prepared for me. What was the end goal? Was this worth my hours of effort? Should I have just watched a playthrough? I finished the game and I saw the ending and I still have no clue what happened or what my goal was. Even though the ending made me contemplate my life I still learned a key  thing about myself......

												After playing several hours of this game, I have felt that my money was well spent purchasing this game. This is simply an exploration puzzle game. There is no adventure to this game. You are literally stranded in an island solving puzzles. But why I like this game, because it is a really good puzzle game. This puzzle game requires you to try various puzzles so you can gain knowledge of various mechanics so you can complete other puzzles. There is no levels in this game, you can go anywhere in the island, but some areas have puzzles that you may not know how to complete. The game encourages you to leave that puzzle and try out different puzzles in different areas so you can gain the knowledge and come back to the puzzle you struggle. Some puzzles in the game requires you to use the environment from the game (lighting, reflection, sound, etc.) which I really like. Some puzzles requires you to think out of the box, or find hints around the map to help solve the puzzle. The only thing I did not like from the game is the ending, I did not really understand it, it was just like ""that's it."" Also, the game does have a backstory about the island, but I did not go much into that.Overall, if you like puzzle games, I would definitely recommend this game. I thought I would spend only a couple hours playing this game, but ended up playing several hours. Do not expect some compelling story like The Talos Principle, just expect this game to be a puzzle game with lots of puzzles and secrets!			"

												This game isn’t for everyone. I would NOT recommend this game if you expect a great story, a lot of action, some fancy physics puzzles or you have little patience. Also be aware that nearly every puzzle includes a display and some of the puzzles require you to stand in a specific area. However this game is stunningly beautiful and it treats the player as an intellectual individual. The puzzles are actually challenging unlike most “puzzle games” which are made so the younger audience can complete them. I’m tired of that.The Witness is challenging but starts very simple. The major goal is NOT to solve the puzzles but rather to understand them and gaining knowledge. You will need this knowledge when new rules gets introduced and later combined with other types of puzzles or combined with the environment.If you don’t have a problem with the first part I would without a doubt recommend The Witness.

Definitely an experience I want to keep encountering.			"

												One of the most frustrating and rewarding games I've played. So yup, completely enjoyed it. Logic, abstract thinking, different visual perspectives are all required to solve this gorgeous yet tough puzzler. At face value I'm not too sure if people will think its worth the $40USD - I got it on sale. However it seems to me that a lot of effort went into the design of this. If you're into turning some frustrating ""how did this impossible thing even pass testing!?!"" moments into ""I'M THE SMARTEST HUMAN ALIVE!"" then, for the right price, I'd say go for it.			"

												When I was a kid I used to imagine lines extending from all of the corners of things sitting on the floor. They'd criss-cross, making shapes, and I would make a game of stepping inside the shapes without touching the lines.At the same time I was going to school, learning new things about the world. I still remember learning addition.The world was a mystery and I was exploring it, and this game gives me that same sort of feeling. I haven't finished it yet, and to be honest the feeling is starting to wear off the more I understand the game mechanics, but it's been a pretty neat experience so far and I think it's worth the price tag. :)			"

												The Witness is a great puzzle game, very layered, the graphics are like an impressionist painting. The puzzles can be tough but all the clues are in the environment and sound. I don't want to ruin the puzzle solving process but it was very rewarding to crack a puzzle you are stumped on for some time. Definitely a masterclass in game design.			"

												Overall: Very goodDifficulty: Medium-high to HighComments:- The gameplay consists of solving ""line puzzles"" and exploring the island.- There is no story.  There is no big mystery.  There is no profound revelation.  There are ""only"" puzzles.  If you expect something more than that, you will probably be disappointed.  - There are philosophical audio and video clips scattered throughout the game.  A few of the clips hint at a story, but they are just fragments.  There are also cryptic statues scattered around the island that suggest a story.  However, these things, either individually or as a whole, do not form a coherent narrative or thesis.  Their meaning is open to interpretation and speculation.- There are three types of puzzles:   1. self-contained puzzles, which can be solved all on their own once you have figured out the rules  2. external-based puzzles, which require additional information external to the puzzle itself  3. monolith puzzles, which are hidden in the environment. They are like the 3D version of those hidden picture search games you might find in children's activity books) Likes:- The fun is in figuring out how the puzzles work -- understanding the rules behind them.- Overall, the puzzles are good (some comments raved about how amazing the puzzles are -- they are good, but they are not more extraordinary than puzzles in other good puzzle games).- I enjoyed the self-contained puzzles.  A small number of them are very well-designed and creative (e.g., the blue and orange bridges puzzle, the simultaneous solutions puzzles, the puzzle that contains four other puzzles within it).- As you learn how the game works, you start to discover more and more puzzles that are hidden in the world (the monolith puzzles).  At first, it is fun and satisfying to discover these, but see also the related Dislike below.Dislikes:- Often, the interesting part is figuring out how a puzzle works, but the physical act of actually solving the puzzle is tedious because of the mechanics involved. For example, some puzzles require you to wait for something to move slooowly.  As another example, the desert ruins puzzles require you to fiddle with motors and lights and water levels.  See also the comments about monolith puzzles below.- The monolith puzzles become tedious after the novelty wears off.  Also, they often feel arbitrary. First, they can be anywhere, so you have to search everywhere for them.  Second, they can be easy to miss if you don't look at them from the right perspective (e.g., the ones in the Tropical Forest).  Third, they often require a trial-and-error approach, which does not feel puzzle-y (e.g., the one in the cloud).  A lot of the time, you are just wandering around the island looking at everything.  It is tiresome to keep searching the same areas for puzzles that you missed just because you were not standing in the right place looking in the right direction.- A few of the puzzles are just obnoxious (e.g., the puzzles with the color changing background, the hour-long video puzzle)- Timed puzzles are the worst.  Fortunately there are only a few.- There are no resolution settings.  There are no volume settings!			"

												Before you purchase this game, make sure you absolutely enjoy puzzles, because that's the entire world of The Witness.The Witness will guide you through a world where every action you take requires you to complete increasingly difficult puzzles. Each zone has some overlapping rules, but unique ones as well which all need to be learned in order to complete the final area.If you are looking for a good story and flawless game, The Witness is not for you. There is no access to a map and some puzzles won't feel difficult, but rather unfair.If you simply enjoy doing puzzles and patiently thawing out every possible option, then you will love The Witness.

												It's difficult to describe how satisfying this game is to play. The game spoon-feeds you problem solving techniques at a fantastic pace, you just have to be open to accepting how it teaches you. The first areas are obvious meant to guide you, but you will soon wander off chasing gorgeous vistas and will encounter puzzles that are completely alien to you. You have to learn to leave puzzle you don't understand. The game will teach you everything you need to know, you just have to be patient and return when you've had all of the required lessons.In the end, when everything fits together, it is incredibly rewarding. The game has the proper sense of spectacle to deliver the type of moments you want out of a grand mystery.			"

												The witness is a gorgeous puzzle game with some questionable elements, and this was another game I felt compelled to review. When I say that this game is gorgeous, I really mean it. This is quite possibly the best looking game I have ever played, even when compared to high budget AAA titles. The fantastic graphics are heightened when playing this game, as the fairly large open world you play in is set in a slew of environments including deserts, bamboo forests, treehouses, swamps, caves, cities, and a few others. While the game has a rudimentary fast travel system, I barely used it throughout the game as most areas can be quickly reached through shortcuts. Now, the meat of the game is in the puzzles, which are interesting grid ""mazes"" that gradually become more and more complicated with new rules constantly being added. Sadly, this brings me to my first negative about this game. While the world is open, many areas have puzzles that, without prior knowledge, are literally impossible to solve. I seriously wonder if this game needed to be open world, because many things would be much more straightforward if the game was more linear. There are probably many people out there who like the idea of an open world with these difficulty locks because a dedicated player could eventually figure out these difficult puzzles, but trying to solve the puzzle of if I know how to solve the puzzle isn't exactly for me. Through natural progression and tutorial puzzles scattered around the world, I eventually learned all of the rules of the witness. But, that wasn't always enough. While the game did have many cool ways to solve puzzles (reflection island being my favorite BY FAR), many of them seemed unfair. For example, one puzzle area tests your hearing in an almost ridiculous way, and I needed a guide to solve it.  The only other time I needed a guide was for the swamp area, which, again, was unneccessarily confusing. In the end, the witness is still a really strong game, and if you have the time to sit down and slowly take in the world while solving some mostly great puzzles, then this game is certainly worth a buy.

												If you enjoy puzzle solving, then you probably enjoy this game. Most of the puzzle are limited to square puzzles with line dragging, that reminds me of 90s puzzle book selling inside most bookstore. This game is not for everyone.- No tutorial. No menu. Just straight into puzzle- Visual are very nicely represent as a puzzle cue. But some maybe a bit overused and feels very competitive.- Too many frustrationd moment that I can't get any idea from the puzzle. Which is usally normal for most puzzle game.... But many puzzle in this game aren't making anysense. I do have to use discussion forum/google search time to time because some type of puzzle aren't that enjoyable to solve.Does it worth $40? I don't know, you can get many more indie game at this price tag. But this one is one of the best puzzle I ever play and every $$$ did worth it.7/10			"

												This game isn’t for everyone. I would NOT recommend this game if you expect a great story, a lot of action, some fancy physics puzzles or you have little patience. Also be aware that nearly every puzzle includes a display and some of the puzzles require you to stand in a specific area. However this game is stunningly beautiful and it treats the player as an intellectual individual. The puzzles are actually challenging unlike most “puzzle games” which are made so the younger audience can complete them. I’m tired of that.The Witness is challenging but starts very simple. The major goal is NOT to solve the puzzles but rather to understand them and gaining knowledge. You will need this knowledge when new rules gets introduced and later combined with other types of puzzles or combined with the environment.If you don’t have a problem with the first part I would without a doubt recommend The Witness.

												The Witness has a lot of substance worthy of attention. It manages to do this even though 90% of your gameplay time is spent solving line puzzles. The Witness definitely doesn't follow many traditional game design processes, so it's hard to write a traditional review that marks gameplay, story, graphics etc. One traditional process that most games go through is rigorous testing that aims to maximise 'fun' and minimise struggle or frustration. The Witness never went through this, but it means that the final product is exactly what was intended, making it authentic.I'd recommend this game to people who enjoy exploring, and exploring a world that has something to say about our own world. It's for people who love mystery, whether they know the answers or not. Jonathan Blow has also said that it's for people with perhaps above-average attention spans (this will be obvious when you get stuck!) and people who recognise their feelings and how best to negotiate with them. It's also for people who get excited at the thought of pulling out a notepad and pen. It's only a guaranteed hit for people who love mind-bending puzzles, and difficult puzzles. It's definitely a puzzle-person's puzzle game.When you're stuck - take a step back; explore elsewhere. The answers are all around you.			"

Posted: December 27, 2016
												I breezed through portal, portal 2, and the Talos Principal with no problem and thought I was pretty good at solving puzzles.The Witness cured me of that delusion.The graphics are beuatiful- highly stylized and lots of bold contrasting color help the environment pop without having to try for photo-realism. Visually It reminds me in a way of Mirrors Edge, but less city and more natural.For the puzzles, the designers went with a single mechanic that they expanded on using variations by logical constraints impossed in each puzzle. At it's core, the mechanic is simple- draw a single unbroken line from a small maze's start point to it's end point without crossing your path. To spice things up, some maps have multiple start points and multiple possible end points, but the real challanges are created by the inclusion of various icons in the maze that alter how you must solve the puzzle. Some will requier you to pair certain color tiles together, some will require to you separate groups of tiles, some require you to draw shapes with your line, etc. Often times these different elements are combined in to a single puzzle.This is where things become needlessly obtuse- the rules for the icons are not explained, you have to figure them out for yourself through trial and error. Depending on where you are on the island you will sometimes find puzzle sequences that help step through the logic for a given icon and it's variations, but because many puzzles combine many elements and the layout is fairly open you will often run in to these icons long before you find the puzzle sequence to help you figure out the logical rules for that icon. I understand this was a design choice byt the developers to keep the game from just being linear (like portal), but it causes a lot of frustration and honestly at times looks like it was done to pad out the game play time since you may get stuck on a puzzle because it's using logic you don't understand yet and will have to wander around somewhere else for a bit and come back to it later.Further complicating that is there is no map or way to mark puzzles you want to come back to later, so it's a lot of wandering around hoping you find something again you wanted to take another crack at.The puzzle difficulty curve is often non-linear. There are times I would run in to a sequence of 5 or 6 related puzzles and could breeze through the first 4 or 5 in a couple of minutes and then get stuck on the last one for half an hour.There are hundres of puzzles in the game, so if you like that kind of thing it will definitely keep you occupied for a bit, but it lacks the humor of portal or the philosophy of the Talos Principal so the only draw to solving puzzles is to explore more of the island. Maybe there is more later on, I'm still playing through the game and will eventually finish it but there are simply times I need to put the game down because of frustration and it making me feel like a moron.I also miss being able to jump. Even just a short hop would be nice, but apparently this island exists in a strict no jumping zone; If you can't safely get there by putting one virtual foot in front of the other then you aren't going that way. It's like Pokemon- a 2 foot high ledge constitutes and impassible barrier, as does a 1 foot gap. If you want to get some place on the map and can't, you will need to find another way. A way that is probably impeded by puzzles.There are also only 2 steam achievements in the game, so don't expect to be given any sort of feedback or arbitrary rewards for continuing to solve the puzzles in the game other than what the game itself presents for doing so.All of that being said, I assume you are looking at this review because you are thinking of buying the witness and therefore either like puzzle games in general or because you just liked the pretty screen shots and though it might be fun. If you are one of the former puzzle game loving people then I do recommend the game.  If you are one of the later that are just considering this because of the pretty screen shots, it really is very pretty in the game, but some of these puzzles are very hard and if that's not your kind of thung, if you just want to shoot first and never worry about asking questions later, or really just want to be able to press a button to jump then you will probably not be as happy with it.

												The Witness is a shining example of how an incredibly simple premise can still hold up a game through clever, thoughtful  design. It's a game about finding perspective and taking views from different angles, literally and metaphorically, and said views are quite a beautiful sight to behold. It relies on the curiosity of the player and the intrinsic reward of solving the puzzles and exploring the environments to keep the player going, but if that's enough for you, it's a unique and challenging experience that is not to be missed.

												This game is a puzzle game in the aesthetic of Myst. It's beautiful and tests your mind like nothing else. The game is loaded with philosophy and questions religion, what ideas are and logic itself. Highly recommend this game as it will expand your mind in a number of ways!			"

												I breezed through portal, portal 2, and the Talos Principal with no problem and thought I was pretty good at solving puzzles.The Witness cured me of that delusion.The graphics are beuatiful- highly stylized and lots of bold contrasting color help the environment pop without having to try for photo-realism. Visually It reminds me in a way of Mirrors Edge, but less city and more natural.For the puzzles, the designers went with a single mechanic that they expanded on using variations by logical constraints impossed in each puzzle. At it's core, the mechanic is simple- draw a single unbroken line from a small maze's start point to it's end point without crossing your path. To spice things up, some maps have multiple start points and multiple possible end points, but the real challanges are created by the inclusion of various icons in the maze that alter how you must solve the puzzle. Some will requier you to pair certain color tiles together, some will require to you separate groups of tiles, some require you to draw shapes with your line, etc. Often times these different elements are combined in to a single puzzle.This is where things become needlessly obtuse- the rules for the icons are not explained, you have to figure them out for yourself through trial and error. Depending on where you are on the island you will sometimes find puzzle sequences that help step through the logic for a given icon and it's variations, but because many puzzles combine many elements and the layout is fairly open you will often run in to these icons long before you find the puzzle sequence to help you figure out the logical rules for that icon. I understand this was a design choice byt the developers to keep the game from just being linear (like portal), but it causes a lot of frustration and honestly at times looks like it was done to pad out the game play time since you may get stuck on a puzzle because it's using logic you don't understand yet and will have to wander around somewhere else for a bit and come back to it later.Further complicating that is there is no map or way to mark puzzles you want to come back to later, so it's a lot of wandering around hoping you find something again you wanted to take another crack at.The puzzle difficulty curve is often non-linear. There are times I would run in to a sequence of 5 or 6 related puzzles and could breeze through the first 4 or 5 in a couple of minutes and then get stuck on the last one for half an hour.There are hundres of puzzles in the game, so if you like that kind of thing it will definitely keep you occupied for a bit, but it lacks the humor of portal or the philosophy of the Talos Principal so the only draw to solving puzzles is to explore more of the island. Maybe there is more later on, I'm still playing through the game and will eventually finish it but there are simply times I need to put the game down because of frustration and it making me feel like a moron.I also miss being able to jump. Even just a short hop would be nice, but apparently this island exists in a strict no jumping zone; If you can't safely get there by putting one virtual foot in front of the other then you aren't going that way. It's like Pokemon- a 2 foot high ledge constitutes and impassible barrier, as does a 1 foot gap. If you want to get some place on the map and can't, you will need to find another way. A way that is probably impeded by puzzles.There are also only 2 steam achievements in the game, so don't expect to be given any sort of feedback or arbitrary rewards for continuing to solve the puzzles in the game other than what the game itself presents for doing so.All of that being said, I assume you are looking at this review because you are thinking of buying the witness and therefore either like puzzle games in general or because you just liked the pretty screen shots and though it might be fun. If you are one of the former puzzle game loving people then I do recommend the game.  If you are one of the later that are just considering this because of the pretty screen shots, it really is very pretty in the game, but some of these puzzles are very hard and if that's not your kind of thung, if you just want to shoot first and never worry about asking questions later, or really just want to be able to press a button to jump then you will probably not be as happy with it.

												I did not expect to like this game.My brother bought it for me, and insisted I play it.  While I like puzzle games and exploration this looked like a lot of the same puzzle.  I was wrong.  While the puzzles use mostly the same mechanic (draw line through box) the princples behind each of the ""sets"" is very different.  The game does an excellent job teaching you the rules for each puzzle type without explaining anything at all.  The puzzles increase moderately in difficulty, but as there is nothing to stop you from exploring anywhere, you can always go away and come back.  Once I was stuck for several hours on one, went to bed and had the answer come to me while I was falling asleep.  There are so many ""ah ha"" moments which make you feel like the stupidest genius ever.  In a puzzle game with no text, overlay, score or pointers, everything felt like I was discovering something no one else had.The graphics are lovely, the world is intriguing, the audio (especially the famous quote voice clips) is very well done.  The game length feels satisfying, at just over 16 hours I have completed roughly 75% of the puzzles, but no one area feels especially tedious.I really, really liked this game.  I wish I could play it for the first time again.(Side note: If you play this game while someone is watching you, you will probably wind up hating that person by the third time they get a smug look and ask you if you really haven't figured it out yet.)

												A solid game from Jonathan Blow. If you like puzzles, then the game is definitely worth the price. It's like a 3D Myst that tries to teach you a new language via line puzzles. This game tends to lean toward the artistic side, but if you've played a Jonathan Blow game before, then you know how it goes with him.			"

												Overall: Very goodDifficulty: Medium-high to HighComments:- The gameplay consists of solving ""line puzzles"" and exploring the island.- There is no story.  There is no big mystery.  There is no profound revelation.  There are ""only"" puzzles.  If you expect something more than that, you will probably be disappointed.  - There are philosophical audio and video clips scattered throughout the game.  A few of the clips hint at a story, but they are just fragments.  There are also cryptic statues scattered around the island that suggest a story.  However, these things, either individually or as a whole, do not form a coherent narrative or thesis.  Their meaning is open to interpretation and speculation.- There are three types of puzzles:   1. self-contained puzzles, which can be solved all on their own once you have figured out the rules  2. external-based puzzles, which require additional information external to the puzzle itself  3. monolith puzzles, which are hidden in the environment. They are like the 3D version of those hidden picture search games you might find in children's activity books) Likes:- The fun is in figuring out how the puzzles work -- understanding the rules behind them.- Overall, the puzzles are good (some comments raved about how amazing the puzzles are -- they are good, but they are not more extraordinary than puzzles in other good puzzle games).- I enjoyed the self-contained puzzles.  A small number of them are very well-designed and creative (e.g., the blue and orange bridges puzzle, the simultaneous solutions puzzles, the puzzle that contains four other puzzles within it).- As you learn how the game works, you start to discover more and more puzzles that are hidden in the world (the monolith puzzles).  At first, it is fun and satisfying to discover these, but see also the related Dislike below.Dislikes:- Often, the interesting part is figuring out how a puzzle works, but the physical act of actually solving the puzzle is tedious because of the mechanics involved. For example, some puzzles require you to wait for something to move slooowly.  As another example, the desert ruins puzzles require you to fiddle with motors and lights and water levels.  See also the comments about monolith puzzles below.- The monolith puzzles become tedious after the novelty wears off.  Also, they often feel arbitrary. First, they can be anywhere, so you have to search everywhere for them.  Second, they can be easy to miss if you don't look at them from the right perspective (e.g., the ones in the Tropical Forest).  Third, they often require a trial-and-error approach, which does not feel puzzle-y (e.g., the one in the cloud).  A lot of the time, you are just wandering around the island looking at everything.  It is tiresome to keep searching the same areas for puzzles that you missed just because you were not standing in the right place looking in the right direction.- A few of the puzzles are just obnoxious (e.g., the puzzles with the color changing background, the hour-long video puzzle)- Timed puzzles are the worst.  Fortunately there are only a few.- There are no resolution settings.  There are no volume settings!			"

												When I was a kid I used to imagine lines extending from all of the corners of things sitting on the floor. They'd criss-cross, making shapes, and I would make a game of stepping inside the shapes without touching the lines.At the same time I was going to school, learning new things about the world. I still remember learning addition.The world was a mystery and I was exploring it, and this game gives me that same sort of feeling. I haven't finished it yet, and to be honest the feeling is starting to wear off the more I understand the game mechanics, but it's been a pretty neat experience so far and I think it's worth the price tag. :)			"

												Two moments really stood out for me in The Witness. The first was in the areas where you need to use reflection of light to reveal the puzzle. On this puzzle, you could raise or lower the water to change the position of the platform for the light to strike. I kept raising and lowering the water then trying to run around the area to find the position to see the solution in the reflection. After doing this for a while, I ended up going to a video walkthrough to see how to solve it. The second was solving the puzzle at the top of the mountain around three statues. As I walked around it, I could only see one angle to solve it. After I did that, it needed to be solved in two other ways. Each time after a surveying the puzzle from what must have been the starting position, the solution became apparent. Those two puzzles sum up The Witness experience for me. When the puzzles work, they were quite satisfying to solve. But when they failed, they were immensely frustrating. Then as the environment starts playing a part, working out how to solve the puzzles became the bigger issues. Which environmental clues, if any, are meant to be how you solve it? And even when certain rules were established, the rules were then changed without rhyme or reason. One of the biggest difficulties in the game is the sheer size of it. And since the game is split into areas, the kinds of puzzles found in each area are variations on a theme. This is good for internalising the rules, but solving multiple puzzles of the same kind in a row gets tedious. One area - the treehouse - was particularly egregious as each plank was made up of multiple near-identical puzzles. The feeling of grinding out solutions came a few too many times in game.More than anything, The Witness is more clever in puzzle design than it is in puzzle execution. Some of the puzzles were incredibly impressive in their construction - the creativity and aptitude of the developers was definitely on show. This doesn't always mean a better gaming experience though. And like the beautifully-rendered world, the subtlety  can too often lead to exasperation. So I would recommend The Witness, but do so with a caveat. It's a game that often requires patience on the part of the player, and that patience isn't justly rewarded by completion. At times it feels like a slog to get through, and the puzzles are repetitive to the point of tedium at times. But the sheer audacity of the game and some very good puzzle design make it worth playing.			"

												The Witness slowly evolves from being a game about mazes to one about observation and discovery. To think like The Witness is to think outside the box, then inside again, to think creatively yet constantly reminding yourself that the best answer is often straightforward. It is a game full of paradoxes and juxtapositions, illogical puzzles with logical answers, and it entrances you so, driving you to find meaning in the seemingly meaningless. Perhaps that is what makes The Witness so special.			"

												This game has become one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. But, of course, this by itself does not really tell you if YOU will enjoy the game. So, I'll go through some common complaints to help you figure out if you will like this game. First, this game does not hold your hand. It gives you the information you need, and allows you to figure out how to progress on your own. If you only want to be led by the hand without putting thought into anything, this game is not for you.Also, there is not really any ""reward"" for completing puzzles. The reward is actually completing the puzzles themselves which unlocks more puzzles for you to solve. If you love solving puzzles, this is great. If you think solving puzzles is work and only for unlocking some silly animation or story then this game is not for you.Some people say it's just the same puzzle (lines with dots) with slight variations. Well, yes, I can somewhat agree. But I actually don't find this a bad thing. Isn't that what a lot of puzzles are anyway? I mean, look at Sudoku puzzles. You are given rules on how to solve them, and then they are all the same puzzles with different variations. But people still love to solve them, even though they are similar and have no reward (except the experience of solving puzzles).If you can live with those things, you will probably love this game. The environment is great and the puzzles are fun and challenging. And puzzles are definitely the heart of this game. And like any puzzle game, some puzzles were really easy, and some were insanely difficult. But the great thing is, you can skip some if you find it too difficult. The really difficult ones aren't required to ""beat"" the game. You don't need to 100% the game if you don't want to (remember: there is no ""reward"", just some number that goes +1). I, personally, would continue to think about puzzles that stumped me even outside of the game (and at work!) until I would solve it because that's just the way I am. Or, you can cheat and look up the solution, but I don't recommend doing that at all. I lost myself quite a bit in this world.Speaking of losing myself: I have nominated this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award. So many nights were spent playing The Witness. My wife would come in and say it's time for bed and I would literally tell her ""just 5 more minutes!"" Of course it was never 5 more minutes, and she would come in a half hour later wondering what I'm doing and I say ""just 5 more minutes"" again! Yes, for me, this award fits perfectly for The Witness. "

												Probably the best puzzle game there can be. The best part about the game is that there is no guidance. From the first puzzle to the last, there is no hand holding, no tutorial, no guide, no nothing. You have to use you brain to figure out how to solve everything. And then you find something else, and you get a ""Whoa!"" moment. After playing this you will start to see patterns in the real world as well.Best tip: Do not use any guide or walkthrough, nor any tips. That is spoiling the fun of finding something out for yourself.			"

												What's in a game's title?  I'm not sure.  After finding the ending, I don't know why this game was called ""The Witness,"" and I don't think I ever even knew to begin with.  Perhaps this game is better called ""The Island"" or ""Pathfinder"" instead.So... what is this game anyway?  In one word: mazes.  You will be solving maze puzzles, having to figure out the rules of the game as you go.  Not to worry, there are training areas on the island, so you aren't completely lost.  However, even when you know or have figured out how everything works, expect to be stumped.  Once you've solved the 523 puzzles in this game, you can look for secrets and easter eggs, including a special challenge area.You are a being who can freely roam around this diverse island of lands and unlock its secrets.  The art style seems to be focused more on color than anything, making this game a gorgeous one to look at.  Even some of the puzzles revolve around color.  The sound design is equally gorgeous, and some of the puzzles even rely on sound.  There's not much music, but this game does well without it.The ending: it's nothing original.  The game quits on you, just like Antichamber (then again, it has no proper UI (and that's not a problem!), so that's fine).  It also resets on you, just like one of the endings in The Talos Principle. The #1 downside to this game: the price.  Sorry, but $40 is a bit too much unless you put in an actual story instead of some vaguery in the game's description and words from famous people.  I'd gladly pay $20 or $25 for this game.  That said, get it while it's on the biggest sale you can find (at least 35% off is my recommendation).A more subtle issue with this game: The ""secret"" ending is where they shoved all the credits into, which is not where they should be, despite being formatted interestingly! The normal ending should have the credits too!  All we get are some random words from an uncited source (and on top of that there are a few quotes in the game that are not cited).I've heard some people say they've spend 40+ hours on it (don't ask me why, but the 135 ""secrets"" seems like a poor excuse for this game — hell, one of them takes up to a full hour!), but if you're smart enough, you should be able to conquer the game in 20 hours or less.I've officially decided that this game is overrated.

												I put off buying this game because I misjudged it completely from the trailers and screenshots. It looked low-res and and the puzzles seemed blatant and repetitive. I was SO WRONG. It is a lush, beautiful world and the super-saturated palette make it so dreamy and helps you figure out where you are. The puzzles are not stand-alone games, you have to use the environment to find the solutions. The world around you is part of each puzzle. You are free to roam and circle back later to the ones that stump you. The answers are usually very simple, and sometimes extremely clever, but you have to look around you! Sometimes a different perspective will be all that it takes. Don't cheat and look at walkthroughs, you will be so satisfied when you figure things out! I played for almost 20 hours and was still discovering new little hidden places. I love that I can stand in a certain spot and see a figure in the rocks that was hidden in plain sight the whole time. The world is full of these optical illusions and you don't even notice that they're there until you've shifted your viewpoint. Gorgeous, gorgeous game. Will go down as one of my all-time favorite puzzlers.			"

												The Witness is perhaps as much a philosophical experience as it is a game, even though at its heart it almost exclusively involves drawing lines and solving maze puzzles. The graphics are gorgeous, the game world is fascinating to explore and while the game can seem daunting at first, working your way through the hundreds of puzzles on offer can be tremendously satisfying. That said, this is a game that does require a large amount of patience and you will get stuck... a lot. The Witness does not hold your hand and offers only the bare minimum of explanations (by way of puzzles) to help you learn what to do.Fans of puzzle/exploration games like Myst will almost certainly get a lot out of this game. For those with only a passing interest in the genre however, The Witness may turn out to be more frustrating than enjoyable in the long run.			"

												I bought this game after seeing it on everyone's ""game of the year"" lists and I really enjoyed this game. The basic puzzle mechanic of this game evolves throughout it, keeping it fresh. If you get stuck there are plenty other areas to discover and work on. The island is beautifully rendered and has a lot of detail. I was really surprised at how big the game is, it keeps going and feels like a lot of love has been put into it. The mystery of the island is intriguing and was fun to try and figure out. If you liked Myst and enjoy IQ type puzzles then this is an amazing and very chill game to spend your time in.			"

												The game is by far the best puzzle game you can find there in terms of puzzles, though it has virtually no plot at all. So, for everybody seeking for another Portal, you guys better go play something else. For everybody else who is kin to solving it's indeed a must have.			"

												Honestly, I really, REALLY liked this game, but at the same time it's really hard to recommend to others.  It's pretty damn expensive, and there's kind of a high barrier to entry.  If the thought of solving hundreds of logic puzzles turns you off, OR you just hate first-person exploration games, then skip this one.  BUT, if you dig the idea of exploring an island completely packed with mystery, hidden secrets and tons of line puzzles, then you can't go wrong.  Absolutely worth it.			"

												This game is great.You're dropped on an island with no context or any dialogue, and it stays that way throughout. I fell in love with this game because they left the story telling up to you, with you having to not only figure out all the puzzles on the island, but what's happened there in the past. I've played through a fair chunk of it (I'm guessing around 80%) and I still want to go back in and keep finding all the mysteries. This is a particularly big thing for me, since I rarely finish games these days because I get bored of them too quickly.The puzzles vary in difficulty ranging from relatively easy, to down-right hard, and often I found myself trying to actually figure out what the rules to the puzzles were; which was a great feeling when you finally figured it out. It's a genius idea for gameplay, because you do get those moments of frustration, but they're always outweighed by the satisfaction of figuring out the fundamental rules of a puzzle set, and then being able to apply it to all the subsequent puzzles.The design of this game is also breathtakingly beautiful. The time and effort of all the modelling, texturing, ambience really shows, and it helps to just absorb you into the game, where hours just disappear. I love how a large portion of the game is based around context, and in playing it, you gain understanding of why it's named ""The Witness"". Even the decision to only use WASD and the mouse for controls, and not have any other way to interact with things was a great choice.It's a beautiful, emotive experience, which I'll be recommending to all my friends. So glad I got this game, it'll go down as one of my all-time favourites.			"

												There is no story, it is simply you on an island left to explore and to learn to understand. If you have a penchant for beautifully crafted puzzles then I can't recommend this game enough. It challenges you every step of the way, teaching you its own symbolic language and building on it throughout. I discovered this after Talos Principle, so if you liked that and are looking for a different but equally as delightful and rewarding experience then this is probably for you.If you struggle with any of the puzzles try exploring different areas of the island instead and everything will start to fall into place!

												Excellent game reminded me of Myst and Riven but it was clearly better and more focused than the two oldies (although much easier than Riven).Excellent puzzles with amazing perspective mindf*****s. I completed the game COMPLETELY blind (as I did with Riven back in the day. Those that are old enough know what this means:P) at about 25 hours and got the second ending at 35. I'm now solving the environmental puzzles so I expect at least 50-55 hours of content which is actually amazing for a puzzle game. 9/10 for meps: Don't believe people that have 15 hours on this and claim they've finished everything without guides. They are simply lying and were sneak picking puzzle mechanics and solutions 24/7.			"

												One of the best games I played in a long time. It's hard to talk about how awesome the game is without spoilers, and spoilers are the one thing you want to avoid playing the witness.So I'll just mention a few general things: - If you are into logical puzzles and out of the box thinking and are willing to invest some hours pondering over problems, and especially if you like heureka! moments, then this is your game. If you expect on the other hand a great story to dive into and a linear plot, and are in general a rather impatient person who doesn't like riddles - not so much.- Almost nothing in this game is arbitrary. Many puzzles can be bruteforced, but it is never necessary. If you think it is, you have most likely overseen a rule. - I had a few moments of ""Aw, I really expected more ... "" just to discover that there is more. A lot more.- For this reason my guess is that people with less than 20 h or less, that are new to the game and didn't look up anysolutions, have missed big parts of the game.- I love the graphics, the details and the depth of the game. Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did!			"

												That moment in the desert, when the sun stikes the circle disk just right and it reflects so brightly. Such a beautiful circle. Then without knowing why I try to click on it and it sparks at me. (What?) Move little to the right and click again, bigger sparks. Move closer and click, It ignites with a powerful hum! I trace it out and then it explodes into particles and flows to one of the black pillars. What is going on? Hours and hours later. Watched first video under the windmill. What is going on? Many more hours later. The beginning is the entrance to the end! I no longer need to know what is going on.Would have mind blown again.			"

												I'm probably not even halfway through, and I already want to recommend this game. The puzzles are intriguing and sometimes require outside-the-box thinking. In that sometimes, hints as to how a puzzle needs to be solved are hidden in the landscape, or even invisibly on the puzzles themselves! The landscape looks gorgeous, even despite my lower-than-low graphics settings, while the puzzles themselves feature a minimalistic design.Although, you might want to make sure you have a decent graphics card. All I have is a potato that only THINKS is a graphics card, and while the game runs relatively smoothely, it also has a few puzzles that require you to quite literally see things clearly.			"

												This game is brilliant.  It's not perfect, mind you.  But it's certainly brilliant.  The first thing you'll probably notice about The Witness is that its environment is strikingly beautiful.  And if you take the time to notice throughout the experience, you'll be struck just the same again and again.I'm far from an expert, but looking back at all the design choices in this game that I was able to recognize, I have negative opinions of just a couple, and very positive opinions of almost all others.  Especially the puzzles.  Considering just how many puzzles there are in this game, I'm very impressed by how varied they are, and how rare it is to find a bad one.Overall, I strongly recommend The Witness if you're looking for a quiet, wandering, challenging, and very pretty adventure.  If you're anything like me, you'll want to take long breaks away from the game once in a while.  But getting to the endgame content eventually is a must.  Not for the story, but for the puzzles.  The expect The Witness' endgame puzzles to be fond memories for me for quite some time.  What a joy.			"

												Easily one of the greatest puzzle games ever made. If you are a person that is driven by the need to understand or solve something no matter how long it takes, this is definitely the game for you. If you are a person that will give up after being stuck for a certain length of time or someone that will search online for answers if you can not immediately solve a problem yourself, this is definitely not the game for you.  Please note that having no instructions on what to do in the game or giving the locations of the puzzles is what helps make this game amazing, it is not a flaw. The purpose is for you to explore and have those descovery moments when you finally understand something about a puzzle or the world that you previously did not.			"

												A very clever puzzle game that is especially great at guiding you gently into new puzzle concepts without holding your hand.  I found all of the new concepts that it slowly introduced to be surprisingly nuanced, and there were a couple of times where I was genuinely stumped and had to try again the next day.The end game (parallel to actually ""beating the game"") is a bit annoying, though, because it's a bit too open-world, ""collect all the things God-knows-where"" type nonsense that's far too popular these days.  Which is a shame, because it's actually very cool how it plays on a concept that any puzzle game player will recognize.  My recommendation is to look up a guide once you get to it, because I don't find it worth my precious time wandering around and wondering what you're even looking for.			"

												At first playing this game, I was bitterly disappointed with it. For me it was just a classic mobile puzzle game with levels 1-1, 1-2, 2-1.. but the excuse of the environnement was just to walk in 3D between the boards that replace the button-levels from a hub. After lots of really good recommandations and titles like ""PUZZLE GAME OF THE YEAR 2016"", I couldn't fit in the hype even tho I do love this kind of game. And then I got stuck stupidly in the Apple section because I was searching something that doesn't exist. And then I understood why this game was really incredible.Please do not get your review and your appreciation of this game by just the first boards and puzzles you will face on. Walk just a bit more, and it will become mindblowing. Explore! Some discovers get pretty exciting the map!!! and completing the game will make you miss its unique atmosphere.It is ok not understanding or succeeding in the firsts hours of a puzzle game. That doesn't involve it's a bad one and that it has only one thing to say to you.			"

												For starters: Puzzles. If you don't like them, then you're going to struggle through The Witness without a companion guide (and honestly, there really isn't much point in playing that way unless you're totally stumped, so move along in your Recommendations Queue). Love puzzles as much as I do? Liked Portal? Chances are, you'll enjoy The Witness; maybe more or less than I did--but about that, later.The Witness has an elegantly simple premise: Solve a puzzle = Move Along Home. Solve a puzzle = Move Along Home. That's the first layer of the game; and the game teaches you how to play as you Move Along Home, steadily increasing the difficulty of puzzles, the rules of certain subsets of puzzles, all the while, tantalisingly, and teasingly, edging you on with beacons you feel, eventually, will culminate in answers. That's all there is to it. If that's enough for you, if you think you'll get your money's worth from this paragraph alone, what are you waiting for?The second layer, without giving anything away, is all about presence, space, time, and perspective. What the first layer does is rewire how you see the world of The Witness; and, in turn, how you experience your own sense of presence, space, time, and perspective, external to the game. There are a handful of Easter eggs to this effect, reminding you... well... about yourself. Your relationships with things, within other things, without them, be they objects, people. That difficult-to-quantify substance about human nature, all of it harking back to my undergrad philosophy days and them some.I'd say the third layer, that's a combination of the first and second, challenging how you experience your self; and your self experiencing the game; how you move about space; how you regard the time you spend (in game, out of); how you see, what you consider you see, how that changes, how your perspective has changed throughout the course of the game and your life; how a moment ago, a puzzle seemed impossible, and the next, is solved. Always the now.All of this culminates in a unique gaming experience, philosophical, at times almost spiritual, as you delve into your own psyche (sometimes at wit's end), and the delicate strata of the developer/s, ""clues; scattered all over the table like crumbs"".Will it be easy? No.Will it be hard? No.Will there be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? Such is life.Get out there and find out!10/10			"

												The Witness is a triumph of games as art, though I think it could have been a more cohesive and compelling piece if it had truly had no language whatsoever; the message of the game is conveyed so thoroughly by the gameplay that, to me, the supplemental quotes felt superfluous and too on the nose, artifacts of older, more comfortable art forms.  Even so, for me, The Witness succeeded in its apparent mission of inspiring awe.Gameplay-wise, if you enjoy drawing lines on grids that fulfill certain rules, and figuring out what those rules are without explanation, The Witness is delicious.  The environmental puzzles are only okay, but the spatial reasoning rules produce some really lovely epiphanies.  And there are deeper mysteries to the game that reminded me of that scene in Westworld where Ed Harris finds a map on the inside of some poor guy's scalp--just an utterly bizarre and unexpected layer of puzzles underlying the apparent game.There are some ways in which The Witness could be less remote and inscrutable.  After I activated all the lasers, I spent hours wandering around the island looking for another one, because I thought there'd be some dramatic indication that I'd activated the final one; if there was, I didn't see it.  Accessing the post-game content requires some very careful observation, though in its defense it follows rules the game laid out earlier.  But these are minor blemishes in an otherwise fantastic (and at times profound) experience.			"

The WitnessORA Poke Around In Jonathan Blow's MindA ReviewI'm gonna get it out of the way and say I loved this game. For me, personally, it hit all the right notes. Plus, even the idea of the thing appeals to me (Bespoke in-house engine? I'm not the only one that finds that neat hopefully.) As a strong advocate of ""Games can be art."", this is a fantastic example of the stuff you could argue for. My mum would probably play and enjoy this, stick it in a museum and just let folks walk around.I went in knowing:It's a first-person exploration gameIt's got some sort of line puzzlesIt's by Jonathan Blow, and I thought Braid was pretty goodIt did pretty well review-wiseThis is pretty much how I'd recommend playing it. The trailer presents the game well, but it also gives away many of my favourite moments of discovery on the island, and isn't discovery half the fun? I spent my first hour just wandering around in a daze, looking at all the cool stuff on the island. And what an island it is! Everything, from the smallest rock to the buildings to the vistas and more, is placed just so. You'll start to notice it early, but the sheer extent and scale of the design that went into this thing is impressive. It's not crowded, but there's plenty to do and see. If seeing is your thing, there's literal art installations scattered around the whole place, sometimes obvious, some less so.That's the thing about The Witness. Like an Ogre, it's got layers. You have to get used to thinking in them if you really wanna get into it. There's the superficial beauty of the island, sure. But there's also that statue that's neat, and the way the rocks look like something from this angle, and the way those shadows intertwine, and also the clouds make a cool shape from here. Every once in a while you should stop whatever puzzle you're doing, and just look around. Really look around, see what hidden stuff you can pick out. It's there, I can assure you.Puzzle-wise, there's a nice difficulty ramp, with the caveat that it's not all in the same place. If you come to a puzzle you can't solve, maybe explore until you find an earlier section of that series. Of course, some puzzles combine mechanics and others still are pretty unique, but there's always something else to do if you get frustrated. For me the solutions fell mostly on the right side of the wall, but one person's ""That's so smart!"" is another's ""That's dumb."", so your mileage may vary. The odd few I did get sick of, but there's complete guides you can peep at to get an idea of how to start, or if you want just copy. I wouldn't blame you for some of them, but do try them first at least.Qua atmosphere, this is another point of contention among reviews. My view is you either ""get it"" or you don't. Not in any superior sense, but in a more ""I identify and am interested with the concepts presented here."" There's very little music, which is another thing by design. It makes the Island a little spoopy, especially when you suddenly see a statue looking at you. Then again, they soon become old friends as you trek around, landmarks if you will. Each area has it's own visual and puzzle theme, so of course you'll have a favourite, and some will be less good to you. Me, I'm partial to the Monastery, but maybe that's my weaboo showing through.With all the philosophical guff, that's what the subtitle is about. This game is -i'm sure there's an art word for this- a piece that's Jon Blow now. Or presents the ideas that make up his worldview. Or just ideas he likes. It's not terribly clear in specific, but rest assured the game is Jon to an extent. The videos and audio diaries don't all present a common theme, but they all go in vaguely the same direction, if you get me. These are also sometimes echoed in the themes of the Game itself: exploration, experimentation, the joy of discovery... This feels like a pet project of Jon's, which it ostensibly is. But also it feels very personal, like he made it for himself a little and decided to share it. He's left a lot of things lying around, and it doesn't feel as if you're intruding, but definitely that this is not ""yours"". It's really easy to imagine Jon hanging up whatever he's doing now for the day and boot this up to unwind.In closing: If you ignore one or more of the aspects of this game (Gameplay, visuals, design, themes, guff...), you may not get your money's worth. You can't put all the weight on one pillar and expect it to hold up. But as a complete package, taken as a game and an art piece? Definitely an important title in that regard, and a great one too. If you read all this and thought to yourself: ""He's talking out of his♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""What a load of tripe."" more than twice, then maybe the puzzles won't hold this game up for you.But: if the descriptions of the visual layers and the arty-fartyness made you think ""Hmmm?"" or ""Interesting..."", then rest assured I haven't been forthcoming, there's a lot more types of everything to see, and my favourite part of the game I haven't mentioned cause, as always, it's better to find for yourself.TL;DR:Comfy walking sim with mostly good puzzles, fantastic visual/game design and some philosophy thrown in for good measure. Jon Blow's almost literal baby. I loved it, would recommend on a case-by-case basis dependant on taste.			"

												The Witness is one of my favourite games.  It is a puzzle game set in a pretty, open world.  As other reviewers have posted, it's all one type of puzzle, but there are many variations introduced then scaled up in difficulty.  There were many moments of me thinking the game very clever, several where I was totally stuck, and a few that were jaw-drop worthy.  It's a very pure game, so if you aren't into its central conceit it won't be so much for you, but this is one of the few games I set aside time to play and treasured my time with.  It's exciting to know there is more in the game that I did not find.  My only complaint was not being able to keep my progress and go back to 100% the game after beating it.  Highly recommended.			"

												The Witness is a puzzle game. It's a beautiful, meticulous, ingenious pain in the neck of a puzzle game. And for all my complaining and struggling and frustration I was completely hooked.The very start of the game sets you up to question - where am I? You're thrown straight in, you play around in a nice little learning area, and then you set out free to roam and explore a stunning and mysterious island. The next day of your life is spent running around solving puzzles, speculating about the nature of the island, and activating things for a reason you don't understand. It's great.The puzzles are exasperating. The design is spectacular. The ideas are original and humorous. The atmosphere is spot on. The gameplay is perfect.If you like puzzle games and you fancy testing yourself then this is a masterpiece.You can hear my brain explode right here. "

												At times, The Witness may seem as though it is reserved for geniuses. It does have parts that are ""brick wall"" difficult, where you stand, cursing at a puzzle for a long while. More importantly, it is a fun, challenging puzzle game that has a lot of content. The Witness has an incredible way of teaching you principles and lessons without any dialogue. The Witness at its surface is a puzzle game, but symbolically it represents how mankind interpits the world around him. I'll go out on a limb and say playing the Witness makes you a better person. You'll feel a sense of accomplishment upon completion of areas, and for good reason. Instead of pressuring kids to go college, we should just give them a copy of the Witness.			"

												I was very skeptical about The Witness after reading the reviews, particularly the ones that said this game is pure puzzles, and that the only reward for completing them was more puzzles. Turns out those reviews were totally accurate, but it didn't stop me from logging 35 hours - doing puzzles. The mechanics of the puzzles themselves are well-introduced, but that didn't stop me from pulling my hair out trying to figure out some of the solutions. Seriously, they get TOUGH at some points, and that makes it all the more rewarding.The setting is an island that is intriguing, and the game's use of angles, sound, reflection - basically everything in the environment - is frankly brilliant. The ""game within the game"" is expertly put together. There isn't really any story per se, but I still felt mystery and delight at discovering new places and things within the island. That was reward enough for me to keep going.That said, there were weird audio/video clips that I thought were super pretentious, bordering on nonsense. Maybe some people will find deeper meaning, but I didn't quite get there. I do wish there were something more rewarding throughout the game , I felt a little empty at the conclusion.Overall, great puzzle game but you REALLY need to like puzzles. No story, no great reward, but brilliant settings and challenges. Recommend for those who enjoy clever, well-orchestrated puzzlers.EDIT: If I'd been a little more patient and thoughtful, I would have gotten that satisfying reward I was looking for. Went back and found it, so I wanted to update my review with a slightly stronger endorsement. Great game.			"

												wow. just wow, man.the witness throws you into a mysterious island full of gorgeous scenery and incredible challenges. the puzzles all follow the same ""maze"" theme, and become increasingly more difficult as you progress and learn new rules.I am not a photography guy, and I rarely take screenshots. but as I was playing I was really compelled to capture more and more beautiful landscapes, and before I knew it I had a whole photo album's worth. visually, the game is stunning.in fact, the whole environment, down to the subtle ambient sounds, is excellently built. there's not really any music, but the environmental noises are still complementary to not only the game, but also certain puzzles (chirp CHIRP chirp).you know how in a metroidvania style game, you'll come up against a wall that you can't seem to break down, so you go another way and explore until you find a rocket launcher, then come back and continue your original trail?the witness does the same thing. but instead of rocket launchers and double jumps, you learn new rules that allow you to progress through more advanced puzzles. what I find so incredible is that, though the first time you encounter a new puzzle rule, you probably won't be able to solve it, but once you find the ""tutorial"" area for that rule, the game does such an amazing job teaching it to you without any vocal guidance whatever.that's not to say that as soon as you know the rules you'll be able to complete a given puzzle! I recommend busting out the graph paper and a couple of colored pens/pencils. you will absolutely need to make notes and/or redraw some puzzles to figure them out. one of my favorite things about having played through the game is now I have some really cool looking sketches and notes showing my progress.I do have two negative points: firstly, that the game /does/ sometimes become a little ""too much,"" and after hammering at a puzzle for 25 minutes, I got a bit frustrated. my advice is to not be afraid to step back and do something else for a little while. the solution might come to you when you don't expect it :)secondly, this game is definitely about the journey, not the destination. I didn't have any expectations for the ending, but was hoping for a bit more. this has not stopped me from doing a second playthrough, however :)overall, this is an excellent game. if you enjoy games like myst, or logic games like sudoku, you will be in heaven. if you enjoy just the idea of those games, but never really took the leap to actually play them, this is a great game for you.of course, if you don't like puzzle games, if you're looking for a platformer, or if you are expecting a great arcing plot, then do look elsewhere; this is not your bag :)			"

												The Witness is such an eye-candy with its vibrant colors and rich contrast.There are no words or inventory windows or anything of that sort in this game. 10/10 immersion.Drawing lines -  that's pretty much the only thing you can do. But with the many different mechanics and environmental puzzles, it never gets boring; though occasionally some puzzles might be hair-pullingly frustrating.What I love the most about The Witness is that despite how difficult some puzzles may seem, after a few tries and maybe a couple restarts with a fresh mind, there's always that moment when you go ""oh ♥♥♥♥ how did I miss / not think of that"". It is definitely possible to go through the entire game in a reasonable amount of time without looking up any walkthroughs .Also, you won't need pen and paper for most of the pieces, though I'm not sure about the secret area. Throughout the main story, there were only about three puzzles that require you to take note of portions of them (maybe even less, I do have awful short term memory).All in all, amazing game, would recommend it to be played over a nice sunny afternoon in a dark room with a trash can handy for lost hair.

												I've completed 514 puzzles and found 50+ bonus items, the videos, the ending and secret ending, but there's still lots I can do (mainly obelisk puzzles at this point).  It's hard to tear myself away - the environment that is The Witness is filled with puzzles, all with the same basic rule but with dozens of variations. I got help on about a dozen, with 3-4 concepts and 'what next' guides also used to open up further venues. There's so much here, and it's amazing to just wander the beautiful environments, even as you're constantly looking for new puzzles and secrets. I can't put into words how enthralling this game has been, although some of the rewards earned (the videos, specifically) didn't seem worth the effort.  But honestly, the journey is its own reward. And the Witness is definitely a highlight of my year in gaming.			"

												The Witness is set in an intriguing and attractive world based on a simple but pleasing rendering style.  The game begins by introducing the simplest of puzzle mechanics and then seamlessly building on that singular mechanic through layers upon layers and combinations upon combinations, with many additional twists thrown in throughout the game.The Witness teaches new puzzle elements and skills through hands-on experimentation and problem solving, with no direct instruction.  It does this in a wonderfully immersive and successful way.I paid $20 for the game and found the novelity and length of experience to be good value at that price.			"

												""The Witness"" is an amazing puzzle game like no other I'd played.  This is a game where you have to solve a maze without crossing any lines you've highlighted, with symbols in the maze providing extra rules that must be followed.  In a twist, the game gives you no outright instructions - only training puzzles that allow you to intuit how each symbol works.Note:  I strongly suggest you write down how each symbol works, because you run into symbols late in the game that you learn early in the game.I like that ""The Witness"" needs brainpower and not speed or reflexes for success.  There are only two puzzles that are timed in any way, and one of the puzzle is easily solved in the time alloted.  In fact, you know you have solved one of those puzzles correctly when time becomes a non-issue.Overall, I highly recommend this game to everyone.			"

												The Witness is a gaming experience like no other. It has no narrative, no other characters to interact with, no health or HUD, and very few game mechanics (you can't even jump), yet it's ability to teach, evoke emotion, and captivate you into finding every secret and solving every puzzle simply through the design of it's environment and the puzzles within it, is what defines this as one of the most intelligent and absorbing games ever made.You cannot begin to understand the layers of intelligence and cleverness that the game's island possesses and challenges you with, and I can't describe them to you without giving away any spoilers. I can't recall any other game I've played (and I've been playing games for over 20 years) that has provided so many ""oh my word that's absolute genius"" moments when I've noticed yet another thing the game does that is easily overlooked and brilliantly interwoven into the island's design.The puzzles themselves follow a simple common rule - draw an uninterrupted line from the circular start point to the half-circular end point - but the additional rules and challenges that each area of the island throws at you are enough to keep you constantly thinking, observing, and obsessing over their solutions, even when you're not playing the game itself. What's more, most of the puzzles have enough variables that you're extremely unlikely to get the solution just by guessing - although sometimes an element of trial and error is necessary to figure out if your theories are correct.If you play this game, I strongly recommend you don't get any outside assistance. The solutions to all the puzzles and secrets are, of course, available on the net, but the feeling of satisfaction when you've finally cracked that difficult puzzle, or of wonder when you discover a secret about a seemingly innocuous area that you've walked through oblivious many times before, these are the emotions that define the game, that reward you for your perseverance, and that make it the masterpiece that it is.Even when you think you're finished, there is more to do, more to find, more to see, and a special area of the island that provides you with it's toughest, most frustrating, most heartbeat-increasing puzzles of them all - you'll never be able to hear Grieg in the same way again.To summarise, if you're looking for mindless entertainment with lots of explosions and the ability to swear at 13-year old kids, this is not for you. The Witness is a game that took several years to make, and it shows in every detail packed into it's game world. It's ability to combine clever puzzles, many layers of intelligence and intrigue, and a beautiful, colourful world is unmatched by anything that has come before, and probably by anything you'll ever play again.

It makes you feel smart in the best ways possible, and it also makes you feel really stupid when you deserve to. 20 hours to endgame went by like nothing, and it still feels like I've only cracked the surface of the secrets hiding within the game.

												I could feel myself processing the patterns in this tangled web. You know a game is well made when it tells you almost nothing about how to play it, makes you feel like a genius, and also doesn't have too many parts where you feel like the concepts are insurmountable. I did have a bit of a hard time with the water portion of the ""light"" puzzles in the temple, which might have been due to my graphics settings (or I just didn't figure that one out, take your pick).

It starts out super simple but within 10 minutes you're dumped into a world full of puzzles that you have to try and find out how to solve.

												In summary: My brain was finally able to have a conversation with my heart. I wasn't afraid of looking or thinking the wrong way, this game naturally helps you take yourself where you need to be. With no music or text at all. Everything just makes sense. This is a testament to intuitiveness in games.  You can be at ease cause nothing is closed off to you, and you can return to anywhere at any time. When I solved the puzzles it didn't feel like there was any force pushing me on or the game would halt, it's just me and my will. Whenever I feel like it, I can look away from the puzzle & breathe in the landscape before continuing or deciding to come back later and just walk off. It feels so right & I'm sure if I keep playing more pieces will naturally fall into place. Highly recommend if you like to be at ease & follow environmental cues.			"

												Had the game on my wishlist for a long time. Love puzzle games but couldn't justify $40AUD on it. Got it in the Humble Bundle.A good comparison is Talos Principle. Both have pretty environments and dozens of puzzles. Talos; however, has a much more immediate and interesting story (I have yet to find the story in Witness an hour in). Talo's puzzles are also more tactile and varied; in The Witness 90% of the gameplay appears to be staring at line graphs (completing which only leads to more very similar line graphs).I can appreciate world-building, but TW seems to love itself too much. I found an 8 minute audio log at the top of a mountain that only needed to be 2 minutes long. Instead I had to listen to this woman say 'identity' and 'integration' and 'part of something' about 50 times.If you want a low intensity but still interesting puzzle game, go buy The Talos Principle. I would not have paid full price for this game.			"

												Does this game deserves a 10? Hell yes!Is this game for everyone? It should be! It's a game for people who love to play and test and observe and try...This game got two things against it the developer didn't knew would exist when he created this game: Twitch and Steam refund.A lot of people use Twitch to form their opinion on a game now... And this game is not meant to be watch. You are missing ""the game"", it is not meant to be seen but to be played. Even more so than a lot of games. And steam refund prevents that also... You don't play this kind of game for 1 hour 1/2 and ""get it"". At best, you've found some tutorials and puzzles you could not understand, and you can't understand the world neither...Braid comparaison: Watching 2 hours of this game is like watching the first chapter of Braid... You would think it is a platformer!Yet, what is important in a Platformer : timing. Then Blow made a game ABOUT time, how our understanding of it changed through history (up to the atomic bomb) or how it changes depending of the status of your relationship (up to the break up) and implemented all those idea through gameplay mechanisms.What is important in a Puzzle : discoveries. Then Blow made a game ABOUT discoveries, and again, through the gameplay.If you consider Talos puzzles as ""room"" where you move lasers, block distrubtions, rewind time and Portal as Puzzles where you change speed, jump or teleport to go to places.And if you consider The Witness puzzles as ""lines"" you can draw.The diversity of puzzles in this game is so much more !I guess that because the presentation of this puzzle is simpler people think the game is simpler, yet it's the opposite. The simplicity of the interface allowed the creators far more room to explore.Again, it's by playing the game (and not watching it on Twitch) more than some tutorials and reaching puzzles you don't understand (in a world you don't understand) in 2 hours (due to Valve refunds) that you can see this.The creators didn't knew Twitch and Valve refunds would exist when they made the game and it might be one of the first game that is affected by those.

												Even if I'm never able to beat this game, I'll always remember it as one of the neatest game concepts out there. When my father showed me it I thought ""maze puzzles... that'll have to get boring."" I was wrong though.The sense of exploration the game induces and the number of eureka moments I've gotten with each puzzle solved has really made it one of my favorite games. Everything from the simple gameplay to the gorgeous island you get to explore is just pure fun.The only con I can think of is certain puzzles, if failed, make you go back and reenter the solution to the previous puzzle. The solution is displayed but it can still be a bit obnoxious. That said, it only happens with certain sets of puzzles and it wastes only mere moments.If you like puzzle games, pick this up.			"

												If you take it at face value and don't think about it much, it's a nice and pretty puzzle game with an immersive and relaxing atmosphere. People looking for a Myst/Riven successor will be disappointed by this game. Wait for a sale. It's essentially a series of logic puzzles with a lot of fancy window dressing. There's no real narrative here to be engrossed by - you can find obscure and famous quotes dictated by voice actors that generally amount to musings on intellegience and discovery, accompanied by these colorful puzzles. It's both slightly charming and terribly pretentious, given the rather grandiose nature of the quotes submitted.   It's also a game that really burns you out if you play for extended periods of time. This isn't something to be marathoned since solving the same types of puzzles with general increases in complexity gets rather monotonous despite the backdrop - the novelty wears off.  Some puzzles aren't very well designed, requiring the player to wait for long amounts of time which is rather frustrating but they are few in number. It's a good game to play casually. Wait for a sale and get it cheap.			"

												I think this game is fantastic. If you like logic and don't mind using a notebook this is a solid bet. I'd say this surpasses Braid and is in league with Portal as far as the coolness of the puzzles. Exploring the world makes you feel like a scientist. This might ot appeal to everyone, but just like science in real life, basically anything could be hiding secrets. Anything could give you that new bit of information you need to progress. The world feels like a big knot that you pick at little by little until you can finally unravel the whole thing.It isn't perfect--especially if you are sense impaired. I could see how warnings of this front could be considered spoilers though. Some mechanics get a little silly near the end, but the end has some really cool aspects too.If you like art/science, you should probably give this a try.			"

As it is, you can go from simple puzzles to very complex ones (the Town) and you're not sure if they really are that complex or if you just haven't figured out the rule for them.  Regardless, it is a good game and worth playing.			"

												You know how in most puzzle games 90% of the puzzles are instantly easy to solve and the 'good' puzzles are few spread thin? Not here. The puzzles are probably the best in any video game to date. They are unrelenting and punishing and have high demands of the player. The Witness is the Dark Souls of puzzle games.The art style is also a fairly original mix of impressionism and retro game asthetics. There are many, many small touches that artists have added that make the world enjoyable to explore.There are a few minor missteps in the rest of the game: Elevators and moving platforms are hilariously slow. Audio has weirdly tight falloffs. The voice clips are too long and the voice acting is patronizing and emphasizes the wrong words in the quotes. You will be holding down shift to run for the entire game. To 100% the game you will be doing a lot of needles-in-an-open-world-haystack wandering. But overall nothing so egregious that can take away from the quality of the puzzle design.The Witness is also a long game. I think it is maybe either a bit too long or just right, as I was ready for it to end when it did. It really ""explores the space"" with every expression of their mechanics which is kind of exhausting.Note: There are many puzzles that involve audio and color, so if you are deaf or have some rare color blindess (I think the game is safe for common kinds of color blindess) you may need to consult a guide to solve some of the puzzles for you. Color blindness may actually make some of them easier.It's very similar to another game, The Talos Principle, right down to the obscure philisophical rants. I loved The Talos Principle too.			"

												I have been playing this game for a few nights now with my wife. She absolutely loves the game. We saw a youtube video (NerdCubed) playing it and she feel for the game. It is not very challenging but can have its moments where we will both look at a puzzle and wonder about it for a while. Then the stroke of genius happens and we solve it.We thought that we were nearing the ""end game"" but seem to be no where close to it now that we have found rooms and hallways lined with more puzzles that seem to have no point but might. We have used online guides for a few (less than 10) hints on solving puzzles but mostly for where things are located to learn about HOW to solve the puzzle series.Overall, the game is gorgeous. The graphics, while not intense or crazy, just look natural and comfortable. The colors are vibrant. The audio is also very well done. If you walk around or out of a room that has sound in it, the sound changes and keeps with the walking out of the room.Now I will recommend this game to just about anyone, but would still limit that same recommendation. If you don't enjoy solving puzzles, some simple and some not so simple; then look to another puzzle game. We have done so many puzzles in this game, that we thought we are almost done, but we aren't. From reading the other reviews, we may be about half way done. So if you don't like solving many puzzles, and doing it many repeated times, this is not the game for you.			"

												The envoirnment is incredibly interesting. Every little thing feels like its there for a reason. The puzzles feel challenging and clever and I was blown away by how the island itself comes to play its part in the puzzles. Exploring the island and progressing felt really cool. But it lacks a sense of reward. Don't expect a story or any kind of reason why you are there or why you are doing puzzles, there is no reason for anything. its just a game where you do puzzles. Just because there is no story doesnt mean its a bad game in my eyes because the game is still good for what it is: an interesting puzzle game.Also you need to be able to see colors and hear properly for certain puzzles, fair warning.

												Buy if:- Problem solving doesn't result in feelings of anger and frustration.- Discovery is about you and the mysteries of the environment.- Any ideologies you have about philosophy and science need challenging (a soft touch).- You're tired of having your hand held through a game.- You're from the 19XXs and somehow feel the quality of gaming nowadays is lacking something (probably creativity and purpose).Don't Buy if:- Thinking is a chore.- Short attention span.- Idealistic and opinionated.- Hate repetition or minor variances in repetition (But doesn’t that just explain all games?)- If you blame your anger and frustration on things other than your inability to cope with your limited emotional intelligence / drug addiction.

												I'm going to be very plain and clear when I say this.If you do not like exploration or thinking about stuff, don't even bother with this. A lot of negative reviews that I've seen point to the fact that it 'lacks direction'. That is the very reason I love it. There is absolutely NO hand holding in this game. I also refuse to say much about the puzzles themselves as the sense of discovery you experience through your playthrough is part of what makes this game amazing. This game has a very unique art style and there is more to the world that initially meets the eye. Would highly recommend if you enjoy puzzle/exploration games.			"

												This is the best puzzle game I've played since Portal.  For me, it's better than Portal was.I don't want to spoil anything about the Witness, because the true enjoyment comes from discovering the essence of the game as you go.  So I'll speak in terms of Portal.  This game is tremendously longer (it took me ~40 hours to complete both achievements), and in my opinion is incredibly harder.  There are some puzzles I spent way too long on, and others where I literally laughed with excitement when I finally figured them out.  Whereas Portal had fantastic narration and at least some story-centricity, the Witness relies on mystery, discovery, and exploration to capture players.  The Witness is non-linear and each player's experience and discovery of the game is assuredly different.  I was able to solve enough puzzles to complete both achievements without any external assistance, although I know there are more facets of the game I haven't fully explored yet or just can't figure out.  This game does a good job with that adventure game trope: you discover interesting features in the world, which very likely have some function, but you just don't know how to interact with them yet.  I have a piece of paper here on my desk with reminders of such mysteries, as well as a bunch of puzzles I drew out to help me solve them.Worth knowing, I fit squarely into this game's target demographic.  It will likely appeal to players who are stubborn, inquisitive, and have taken at least one philosophy class in their life.  I refuse to look up any how-to guides or walkthroughs for games, knowing that the enjoyment comes from frustration followed by the joy of discovery.One critique of the game is that the puzzles themselves can be a bit repetitive.  By that I mean, they overall follow the exact same format the entire game, although with myriad variations on that core theme.  I do believe this was a conscious design choice for the sake of unity, however, I posit that the game would not have suffered, and perhaps would have felt more constantly fresh, if there were other types of puzzles. Braid was great, Portal was amazing, and this game is a step yet above.			"

												I ""finished"" the game in 25 hours.  Since then I have put almost twice that amount of time into it, and am still discovering new things every time I fire up the game.  That should give you a sense of the unfathomable depth available to you here.If it was just the panel puzzles, where you dutifully draw lines from the start to the finish in a baffling number of ways, it would still be a great game.If there were no panels at all, it would still be a remarkable achievement.If there were no ""hidden"" things to find, it would still be a top-notch addition to your library.If it was ONLY the ""hidden"" things, it would still rank as one of the great game designs in history.The fact that it is all of these at the same time, set in an entire world built with such pixel-perfect vision that a casual glance in any direction at any time can often bring a surprising epiphany, or unexpected beauty, is beyond any accolade I could write here.And none of these things are even the point of it.  It is, above all things, a meditation training device.  It is a game with a ""sprint"" button that screams at you wordlessly to stop using it.  The message it attempts to convey has the power to transform your life.  A timeless message, expressed yet again, this time wrapped in a wonderfully maddening toy.Plus, it's just a ♥♥♥♥in' blast.I am 45 years old, and have been playing computer games since I was five years old.The Witness is my favorite game of all time.

												Really enjoyable game: some puzzles that seem impossible when you put them down and then entirely tractable when you pick them back up, which makes for a satisfying experience. Scenery beautiful. Now, what about story? In storytelling, the most fundamental story is ""I don't know what will happen next"". And that's the only level of story that The Witness has, so if you're looking for a less primordial level of story than that, then The Witness will disappoint. The only thing that ""happens next"" is more puzzles, and then finally an almost entirely pointless video. If Blow had taken a little more time to develop this game (although the mind boggles at whether that's even possible) then he could have worked in an actual story (maybe about ecological preservation, or clues being left to some valuable McGuffin) that would have boosted the value of this game by an order of magnitude. But he didn't.			"

												Play it for the puzzles, not the 'story'. I found the puzzles in this game to be excellent and intriguing. The solutions aren't arbitrary or ambiguous like the puzzles in Myst or Riven, and the rules are introduced gradually and organically as you explore the island. The difficulty scales satisfyingly, and I found them challenging but enjoyable throughout. If you enjoy sudoku or crosswords, you'll probably like the puzzles in this game. The 'story' however... well, it's basically not worth a damn. It's literary nonsense that pursues pointless ambiguity, sacrificing meaning on the altar of 'complexity for it's own sake'. Good stories are ambiguous because they address complex issues, not the other way around. This story doesn't adress much of anything - even if you drill down far enough to grasp what's really going on, with the second ending and hidden audiologs. There's just nothing of weight to it, and it's wrapped up in so many layers of secrecy that even if you do manage to wade through the pseudo-intellectual ♥♥♥♥♥♥y, the dissapointment at the end is doubly disgusting. Blow's made a wonderful game here. It's too bad he can't tell a story worth a damn. I'd give this game an 8/10, just for the graphics and exploration and puzzles. Play it for that, and ignore his literary pretensions.			"

												The Witness is the definitive puzzle game. Get your pencil and notebook ready, because you will need them. At first puzzles will seem easy, but soon the complexity will ramp up, until you're ready to tear your hair out. Or I was, at least. At the same time, the game does a fantastic job at suggesting how the different puzzle types work. And if the main ""story line"" of puzzles isn't enough, there is a rabbit hole of ""environmental"" puzzles to dig into if you don't want the game to end too fast.A whole hearted recommendation, especially if you've been waiting 20 years for a sequel to Myst or Riven.

												Great big puzzle game and I'm going to call it right now, one of the best games of 2016. If you liked Fract OSC then you'll love The Witness.You only interact with the world through line puzzles but they introduce new rulesets and mechanics at a pretty rapid pace to keep you on your toes. There are tutorial areas spread over the island and hidden things to find everywhere, and something I really like is that everything that happens to/on the island is directly caused by you. In a way, it can be described as a ""Metroidvania"" where instead of requiring items to get through an area, it requires knowledge of a certain mechanic. The progression is nice and open-ended, the difficulty curve is 95% perfect and every bit of dialogue in the game is optional (thankfully). In fact, there's no music either, just ambient sound and the sounds your puzzle-solving create, making it very relaxing to play.You can get to the ""ending"" roughly halfway through finishing the main areas but beating all of them without doing any exploring will take at the minimum 10 hours, and that's if you're a puzzle whiz. There's more than enough content to justify the price here.On the other (much smaller) hand, the (optional) audio logs you'll come across are often the exact kind of pseudo-philosophy that plagues many other modern puzzle games (several of them from a religious perspective, which is funny considering how intelligent they want these audio logs to sound). It's great that they're optional though, because maybe - just maybe - someone looking for a nice brain teaser isn't going to conflate line puzzles with the meaning of life and the universe.Overall, if anything about this game sounds interesting to you then get it. They have a DRM-Free version on the Humble Store too!			"

												If you like puzzle games, then you should definitely play this one. The fun parts of the game are exploring the island and appreciating the detailed environment that has been created for this game. Figuring out how the puzzles work is fun. There are many hidden puzzles, and you might feel a sense of accomplishment as you find them, but that's probably the weakest part of the game for me. There are lots of clues for where to look for the remaining puzzles, and figuring out how those clues work is a fun part of the game. But I feel that the least enjoyable part of the game is when you've finished the main ending of the game, and you're wandering around unsuccessfully trying to find hidden puzzles. I suppose I could say that you'd have the most fun if you went through to the ""ending"" of the game and stopped. The problem is that there are so many hidden secrets left in the game after that, and my curiousity compels me to keep looking for them, but the pace is slowing down and the game is becoming less exciting.

												In the moments I could dissect and solve the puzzles on my own, it was a fantastic game.And in the moments I had to completely rethink my formula for solving these puzzles and face soul crushing frustration, it was still a fantastic game. It was just less forgiving; I had to look up the answers to two whole sections and a few singular puzzles because I couldn't wrap my mind around them. It's a game best enjoyed by the adaptive of mind (which I am not), but that doesn't mean a stray puzzle enthusiast can't jump in and come out feeling fulfilled. Just don't be afraid to look up the solutions. There's a lot to find and a whole island to explore, so as long as you've got the time and the patience (and the willingness to fail so you can later succeed), it'll be a fun ride.Beautiful visuals. Nice ambiance (and a car horn, and a cell ringing? if you can believe it). Quotes that really made me think. Secrets that still have me wondering. If you do decide to play, have a pencil and paper on hand and pay attention to your surroundings. Sometimes the right answer comes with a little bit of sketching and a slight change in perspective.

												A review of The Witness really needs to start with one basic question:Did you enjoy Myst or Riven?If yes, buy this game.If no, do not buy this game.If you've never heard of Myst/Riven (or never played them), keep reading.Honestly, this game is pretty much what Myst/Riven would have been if they were better designed and made nowadays. And that's coming from someone who thinks extremely highly of Riven, specifically. Basically this is a very quiet, contemplative puzzle game. The story is extremely light unless you go looking for it. The puzzles range from ""this is super obvious"" to ""I'm going to kill myself"". The graphics are gorgeous.If you read the other Steam reviews for this game, they really vary wildly. And that doesn't surprise me, honestly, as this type of game isn't really made any more. Slow, pondering, beautiful puzzle games that lead you along but never provide answers are games of the early 90s. Personally I miss them. Not everyone will.			"

												The Witness is a game about mazes. Your sole interaction with the world is to pick a point and draw a line.The Witness is also a game built to intricate detail, subtly teaching your rules of the world without ever saying a word. It's a game about perspective and observance, letting you discover solutions on your own through small iterations and practice.If I could, I would wipe the 30+ hours I spent on the island from my mind and burn the pages of my notebook devoted to chronicling my discovery of every puzzle's system and process, just so I could do it all over again.

There was a long time ago I came to the end of a game and feelt like that actually was a real accomplishment and where you really had to push yourself as a player, even to points where it sometimes becomes uncomfortable. I would not be suprised if you could increase your IQ be a couple of points by going through the Witness as this game provide ample excercice for the brain. It is really refreshing and I found strangely ""addicting"" compared to most other games.

Sometimes you want more reward from completeing a particularly challenging puzzle but at the same time its good to know that you are smarter than the game.

												How far can you carry a single puzzle mechanic? I believe Jonathan Blow has demonstrated that the answer is ""further than you'd think"".This is not a game for people who like to feel smart. It *is* a game for people who like to feel momentarily smart about some clever insight or realisation, until they share with someone else who says ""That's great. Now, if you carry that a little further you'll get this even cooler result"". It's like a gentle and gracious reminder than someone, somewhere, is always just ahead of you, and that they want you to catch up.I spent my first 12 hour session (stopped mainly because motion sickness started to set in) happily following down the main quest, picking up the occasional hidden item and generally feeling quite proud of myself.Second session, a few hours in I'm polishing a couple of ""optional"" main quest sections, about to go checkout out the end-game area, followed by clearing out the last couple of hidden items to call it a day, when I look at something near the oversaturated forest, and think ""Huh, that looks odd"".Now I'm 20 hours in, and again preparing to go checkout the end-game area, followed by hunting the remaining secrets, which will be an enormous undertaking, even though the game has helpfully provided me a list to work from.The only advice I'll give here is: There's no red herrings here, and no meaningless choices. The only action I've taken which does not seem to have had any effect turned out to be a huge clue. And I didn't understand it until later, when I returned after my ""odd"" moment. "

If puzzles arent your thing, this game wont be. Its a puzzle game where the puzzle is as much of the problem as the solution itself. Its very creative and rewarding.But there is something that doesnt sit well. The open world aspect, the lack of any narritive is cool, but also feels reduntant. The progression, the world, the exploration didnt really serve any real purpose. While the environment was beautiful, and did play a role in lots of the puzzles, it did feel like it was just a sudoku book of puzzles with the puzzles having been scattered around a world arbitrarily. The 'island' didnt really serve any purpose other than a backdrop, it could have easily have been a game done like Portal, where you move from room to room solving puzzles. The mysterious tone doesnt really reveal itself(unless it went over my head which it very well could have). A very minor minor thing I didnt like about the game, but I just wanted to point that out.			"

There are no instructions or words of any kind. There is only one type of puzzle in this game; the mechanics of the puzzle changes based on the area you are in.The Witness does a pretty good job of setting up a row of puzzles to learn their rules. And it seems the game saves constantly, so there is no detriment for quitting a puzzle and coming back to it later.If you like figuring out puzzles with little direction and walking around a beautiful setting with very little sound, this game is perfect for you.10/10 would walk again			"

This terminal connected to another 2d logic puzzle or gate accesss to a very similar logic puzzle which either unlocks another 2d logic puzzle or an area with mutiple logic puzzles, which you sometimes have to follow a wire that connects from the last Logic puzzle you comleteted in order to find the next 2d logic puzzle.  The logic puzzles  themselves are a bit trial and error guestimation.It's well made, I can see that, but I found it boring and repetative!			"

												An incredibly immersive and intriguing puzzler that is much more than just line mazes.Problem solving your way around the island and getting your head around the plethora of puzzles is a great challenge but the real highlight of this game is the beauty and meticulous attention to detail found in the game's design. The fluctuation of frustration and satisfaction felt when completing maze after maze is made a thoughrably enjoyable experience when surrounded by stunning and elegant landscapes all with their own secrets to behold.

												This game is so refreshing, you really need to try it. Yes its a ""puzzle"" game, but its actually quite complex. The puzzles actually have to be solved by interpreting rules that are learned/solved over time, and then they  begin to overlap over the top of each other.Please buy and play this today. I dont think you will regret it.Bring your notepad with you when you play this game!			"

												This is going to be short and sweet, since there is already a plethora of fantastic examples of why this game is amazing. First and foremost, if you do not like it when your brain does what it has evolved to do, you aren't going to enjoy this.  Some of us like to learn to understand and solve cleverly designed environments.  When this occurs in a gorgeous landscape, all the better.  Once I squeeze every drop of mystery out of this game, it will be a sad day. There probably won't be a sufficient remedy for the gaping void that will then plague me... at least not for another 7 years or so.  Till then, I will continue taking my fill of accomplishment on a daily basis, no matter what everyone with under 10 hrs logged are saying. Next, in my opinion, the developer should be evaluated based solely on his/her creation.  We should discontinue whinning when our threads make the ""dumb internet comments."" Jon set out to create the game of his dreams, not to babysit the internet. Does he sometimes come off as... what's the word everyone's throwing around... ""pretentious""? Yes, but probably mostly to people that don't understand what that word actually means. Everything Blow has claimed about the game has come true for me, and more. In any case, our discussion of a game developer shouldn't stray too far from the games they develop. Finally, take these reviews with a grain of salt. Understanding the game for yourself is the only way to measure its true value to you. Personally, it has already far surpassed the $40 mark, and am fairly confident I am nowhere near proficiency. Combine that with the fact that Jon blew through $6 Million and 7 years of his life, and our complaints about an ""overpriced indie title"" start to seem less rational. Now, descend upon me, trolls.

												If you've played Braid or Talos Principle, you know that agonzing frustration of not being able to figure out a puzzle, sometimes for days? Then you know that euphoria you get when you finally figure it out (without cheating)? Multiple both of those feelings by 100 and you have Witness.			"

												I have to say, half of my time in this game was very frustrating, getting stuck on puzzles, but the feeling you get when you finally solve it is the best feeling there is. Totally worth the frustration :) I managed to do the final puzzle too, the challenge at the end, and it was very hard but again, the feeling when you make it is so awesome. Love the art style too, and the exploration. I very much enjoyed this game!Edit: So, I have been watching some people play the game after I ""finished"" it and theres a ton of puzzles that I missed. Mostly ""terrain puzzles"" or w/e you want to call them, puzzles that isnt on monitors and isnt needed to ""finish"" the game, and I would probably have had a lot more played time If I were to go back and get all of those, I also believe that my play time on steam for this game is a lot less than it actually is, at least I feel that I played a lot more than 19 hours.

												Pros:- Challenging puzzles that gradually climb in difficulty- Colorful environments with fitting puzzle themes- Nonlinear island that allows you to jump between areas in case you gets stuck- A unique puzzle type found on the island (I won't spoil it for you!)Cons:- Disappointing ending (but a hidden ending that makes up for it)- A few unfair puzzles that you have to solve unconventionallyComments:I suggest that you do not look up any guides for this game (at least until you've completed the game).I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't play puzzle games.  The game doesn't tell you the rules of the puzzles; you learn the rules as you solve the maze panels.			"

												(Context - 11 hrs in)The reward in many games is the thrill of beating an enemy in combat, the visceral and primal satisfaction of violence, the steady increase of a score, the satisfaction of solving a puzzle or a designer-throws-hands-in-the-air-and-gives-up unlockable hat or achievement.The reward in The Witness is epiphany.Solving the puzzles is satisfying, of course. Completing a tricky mind-bender using the rules you've found so far is good - but what's better is the dawning realization of *what the rules are*. The Witness won't tell you, and that's the game. Staring at a puzzle wondering how on Earth you're going to solve it, and then recognizing a clue - maybe obvious, maybe tiny! - that unlocks it. This is where the moments of pure joy come from in The Witness.This is the most personally fulfilling game I've ever played. Buy it.			"

												Most mentally tiring game i have ever played.. this game is not exactly ""fun"" yet i would not quit until i finished it! Some pretty inovative puzzles and requiring heavy mental activity. Its disapointing though that most of its puzzles could literaly be written down on a piece of papper and solved in some sort of puzzle magazine.. Although the good ones used some very out of the box thinking that i enjoy.. (for refference my favorite puzzle game is antichamber). Overall i would recccomend this game, it has great esthetics and visuals, plays well and is challenging. Cant wait for the next work of the developers!			"

												TLDR; A very netflixable maze game that takes an incredible amount of evironmental awareness, fortitude and brains. Zombies need not apply. At first glance the game gives you a really beautiful skin on a maze puzzle book you could probably buy at a gas station. What's even the point? Everything looks really nice, but why am I sitting here solving maze after maze? There really isn't anything you can do except for solve mazes, and some of them have these weird symbols that make no sense.Then as you solve more of the mazes, and explore more of the island things start setting into place. These symbols on the mazes are a sort of syntax which tells you what you need to do to solve them. It's really quite impressive the way the game teaches you how to play it's self.  Quickly you realize that you know what you need to do on lots of puzzles, and the real challenge is a brain bending spacial math of line drawing. The feeling you get from finally figuring out more and more mazes becomes oddly enganging. You want to learn more about the syntax so you keep solving mazes. Until you finally find one you absolutely cannot solve. All of the syntax you've learned, all of the hours you've spent, the hundreds of mazes you've solved seems like a waste. Everything in your brain is telling you to just give up. Then just after a snack break and a nap, you come back to the same puzzle and look at it under a different light.BOOMYou solve it. You must be some kind of maze master. You have reached a zen like awareness of your space, of the island, of purpose. The endorphins of figuring out what to do next keeps you going, but it's not for the feint of heart. Although, you could always just cheat and look up the solutions if you get really stuck.Other than gameplay, there are excellently inspiring voice acted famous quotes from really smart people scattered around the island like easter eggs. Little nuggets of litterary knowledge to fill in your gaps of sheer brain exhaustion. While there is no real 'story' the journey is something I won't forget.			"

												I'll start off by saying that, overall, I personally enjoyed this game. The puzzles are all the same idea, draw a line incorporating various elements that the game teaches you naturally over time. The game doesn't need to stop and explain, but shows you how each new element works gradually, as most areas tend to revolve around a new concept. A lot of puzzles incorporate the scenery as well, which itself has puzzles hidden within it. Just bear in mind that that's the game. Line puzzles. If you aren't absolutely crazy about the idea of constant line puzzles, then don't even bother reading further. This is not the game for you.Now I have 2 main problems with this game.First, I'll be blunt, the game is pretentious. There are audio logs of prolific quotes scattered about, they mean nothing. There are perspective tricks hidden in the scenery, these are neat, but mean nothing. The game tries to be deep, but it isn't. There's a wiki cataloguing all the unexplained things in this game. The thing is, they're unexplained because it's pure nonsense. Admitadly, this isn't a huge problem, it's all quite the spectacle to behold really. I just don't think the game should get away with so much... malarky.Now for the real issue at hand, one of the most egregious offenses of any game, it's designed to waste your time! You spend a lot of time wandering aimlessly trying to find the next set of puzzles so you can learn how to interact with their elements, and this only gets worse the further along you are. Worst of all there are puzzles that force you to go out of your way. For example, during a sequence of puzzles the floor opens up and becomes a wall. The puzzles you have to solve are now on the other side of this new wall which is now blocking the path permanently. You have to leave and go around the entire area to continue solving these puzzles! Furthermore there are puzzles that make things articially difficult, especially later on. Obscuring your vision, forcing you to go back and forth, basically not things that make the puzzles themselves harder, just waste more of your time.Ultimately, I wouldn't even recommend it to puzzle enthusiasts at the rediculous asking price of $40. If you are into puzzles, and like to admire the scenery, you might find value in this at half off. I barely did.			"

												This game is so much more than what it looks like on the surface, or what any review can describe.  Yes, it's puzzles. Yes, they're similar at the beginning when the game holds your hand with friendly tutorial screens.I wouldn't describe the puzzles as mazes when it's more about drawing a path.  You learn how a path starts, and how a path ends, and the rest is up to you. This game quickly breaks the rules it teaches you and adds new ones on the fly.  It's vaguely nonlinear, and there are tutorial puzzles, but you have to find them and figure out what they mean on your own.You will be lost; you will be frustrated.You will need to step back.Very far back.You will need to take screenshots and have graph paper handy.You will come to hate basic colors and shapes and four-by-four grids in a way you never knew possible.It is truly not for the impatient or feint of heart. (Or the colorblind, unfortunately.)But this game will also surprise you and delight you and challenge your skills at perception in ways that flex the grey matter to its limits.  There are some truly mind-bending perspective shifts required here. And when you're ready to give up, there are still more hidden secrets to find and ""when you see it"" moments that keep the game exciting even after 20+ hours.			"

												I almost didn't buy this because the price seemed kinda high. But I'm so glad I did - this is the most fun I've had with a game in a very long time. The puzzles are really satisfying to solve, and the game world is a lot of fun to wander around. It's been a very long time since I've had to get a pen and some paper to play a videogame, and if you're also the kind of person who enjoys having to take notes and really figure things out, this is the game for you.I've seen people comparing this to Talos Principle a lot, and they do have some similarities. Both games have really atmospheric settings, and vague but interesting stories. I've enjoyed The Witness a lot more, though, because the puzzle design is more about creative thinking and learning to understand the game's visual grammar. In Talos, I often felt like I understood what was going on, but ended up getting frustrated by the puzzles requiring finicky movements and precise timing. With The Witness, the puzzles never required twitch reflexes, and you can't ever die or get impossibly stuck in the puzzles. The Witness is definitely a slower game, but I personally think it's better for it.  "

												The Witness is a peculiar game. While I love puzzles and logic-oriented games, I have never felt such a compulsion to consistently play a game to completion as this one.What I love is that the game is constantly building on mechanics and rule sets within the game's foundation. While puzzles can be labeled by ""themes"", those themes cross paths in many, many ways. No puzzle ever feels rehashed, and when you feel taxed in an area, you can just go somewhere else.The game, the island, and the puzzles themselves all offer their own secrets, begging for a quiet mind to sift through, examine, and experience.I finished the standard playthought at 50 hours.  I also played at a leisurely pace, often explaining the game, concepts and puzzles to my girlfriend.Highest recommendation. Play this game, and understand that the less you seek outward for the answers, the more fulfilling the experience is.			"

												The Witness is a work of true genius, and there's really nothing else like it. At first it appears to be nothing but a series of maze puzzles, although they are ingeniously constructed. As you progress through the game you discover that the entire island and virtually every part of the environment is part of a grand, interconnected meta-puzzle. Not a single rock, tree or building is placed without purpose. It's a mind-blowing piece of game design. If you enjoy difficult (but always fair) puzzles, I cannot recommend this highly enough.			"

												Just finished this game and I find it hard to decide whether to recommend this game or not. The idea is 10/10 but the actual game is quite terrible. The summary that they provided was untruthful. The summary states that you lost your memory and you slowly recover it as you solve puzzles and at the end you escape the island. There is 0 plot and there is no mention of memory at all. There is no reason you are on this island and you never escape the island at all. The audio logs and videos scattered throughout the island are completely irrelevant to the game and provide no plot. The vast majority of the puzzles were very well done. There is plenty of puzzles on the island to keep you busy. But not all the puzzles were created well. There are no hints or instructions, which means you have to figure everything out yourself. While some of these can be figured out through logic, there are a lot which require trial and error. This can become quite a big waste of time. There is little to break the tedium. There is very little to look forward to after solving a batch of puzzles. There is no music. Moving around is slow. You never get faster transport such as a bike or something. The game ending ""cutscene"" was so dissapointing and anti-climatic. There are no achievements to hunt for.   All in all, the game is still worth its price and thus I am recommending it. But I feel like unless you are the type of person that loves puzzle games, you will not enjoy it.			"

												Great Game - with qualificationsBackground: I loved Braid, I loved the idea of an Indie dev making a ""full priced"" game with a singular vision, I followed dev with interest for years, didn't flinch at the price and pre-ordered it.First Impressions: OMG what's up with the fixed resolutionFirst.one.Impression: Oh, I can adjust the res on the command line and can now hear my SLI groaning in pain - but it does look so so f'in pretty. Thank god somebody else out there has realized a Sega-blue sky makes gamers of a certain age happy and I have a negative gut reaction to ""brown games"" (Yes, I  Bloodbourne I mean you - I don't care how many awards you've won).So into the game. What I was expecting, I'd come in with no thoughts this was a story driven adventure - not what I expected, wanted or got (if you did, move on - might I suggest Life is Strange).I love the puzzle panels. No ""Oh, the monkey can be a wrench"" - you solve the game with the panels... no, that's not true, you solve the game in a myriad of ways, but always punch the answer into the panels.Intro is pretty easy as the (t)ropes are explained to you, you're trapped in an enclosed space and clearly need to get out of it. You do easily and pick up some ""rules"" as you do so.Once you've escaped the start-area, you can follow the path or wander off-piste, and be rewarded with another perspective around the start area and pick up your first tape. Bravo. Somebody anticipated my completionist urges.Go back to the path and you're lead to a nice easy zone to solve.Go onto the next one, and get stumped and stomp off to bed in the wee-hours in an ""it's impossible to solve, I hate it"" huff.Load it up the next morning, instantly see where you went wrong, happily romp through the next bit.On your way, spot some stuff you can't solve. Doesn't block you, but get pissy that you can't complete *everything* before moving on. FFS?!?!Quit with some stuff unsolved, move on, learn new stuff, realize you can solve old stuff and run back and release endorphines.This is the point I realized the game was great.Previously my mind-set was do level one (all of it), then level 2 (all of it) etc - this game more than any I've ever played forces you to give up and move on (and then go back when you realize how to solve something you'd given up on).Other free-world games might give you an unbeatable boss, until you've unlocked a BFG weapon. The Witness, doesn't have weapons, it has rules. You learn, you understand, you can go back and defeat the previously unasailable.Moreover you never feel 'stuck'. Or rather you initially do, until you learn just to go off and do something else (there's always a something else) - and you'll accidentally learn something.It's not perfect though. A few hours in, I thought this might be the best game ever, and then I got to ""The Swamp""All of the praise above was predecated on ""Not knowing the rules"", then passively learning them, and then having the scales lifted from your eyes. Maybe you then solve the first puzzle easily and have a few more of increasing difficulty, you can scratch your head over for 10 minutes or so, but felt fun.The swamp just has a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of puzzles where you know exactly what you need to do, but just have to slog through them. Literally. They're in a row of puzzles. You solve them, and then walk around a corner and there's another row of them. No new concepts. No fun. Just more of the same f'in puzzles. I resorted to a walkthrough at this point - and that killed a bit of my love.  Not wanting to end on a negative, I love the strange incidental stuff (very Braid-like). That strangely shaped crack in the wall, that if I line it up with the random pattern outside, seems to form an image. That massive statue way over there, thar if I stand just here and juxtapose with this thing in my line of sight, seems to form a tableau giving a very different meaning.You end up with the impression that the seemingly zonal-world, has actually been hyper-designed and there's potentially ideas to unlock all over the place, that you're continually going to discover or (mainly) miss. Wander, explore, absorb.Still - no idea wtf is up with the swamp.Afer playing continuously for the first few days, killed my fun dead.Intention is to clear it using youtube, pretend it never existed, hope to god that was a one-off, or I will cry.

												The Witness provides the joy of discovery, exploration, and solving puzzles in a way that abstains from the trends of modern game design. It is less like a filed-down meticulously crafted experience and more like a beautiful expanse in which many truly beautiful experiences are possible, and in that way it is less like a ""game"" and more like a world. It conveys very profound messages, never explicitly, but it leads you to moments of introspection and thought, extremely open to interpretation and personalization, and yields many individual variations of self discovery, just as experiences in real life would. It toys with many strong concepts, and often the messages are typically supplied internally as a reaction to those concepts (the most effective way of truly resonating and teaching). I think this game will most appeal to those who find themselves living their lives in the pursuit of truth of any kind. If you want a familiar comparison, it is like Myst, but done properly, and a million times more captivating and powerful.The main rewards in the Witness are knowledge and understanding. In the tradition of Jonathon Blow's games, you have the ability to choose which puzzles you want to solve first, and you may often find yourself leaving a string of puzzles to try a new set, and finding that new set providing you with a key understanding that will help you complete the old set. Sometimes you will turn to life and introspection to solve these puzzles, and draw on your own talents and personal backgrounds, many times I found myself taking pictures of the puzzles and scrawling out symbols in my sketchbook, as if I was some kind of archaeologist. A lot of the puzzles are as ruthless and uncatering as a real life puzzle or problem would be, which makes them incredibly more satisfying when they are solved, because there was no assurance that you would complete them. This helped to make the game feel like a grand mystery, or an ancient artifact that I was dusting away and piecing together. This strongpoint would not have worked if it were not for the non-linear, open, choice-driven atmosphere that is presented, as many of the puzzles, will no doubt, drive you mad. But I sincerely discourage anyone from looking up the solutions or seeking help, even if you feel they seem impossible, there isn't nearly a speck as much joy of reaping the rewards of the puzzle, than discovering within yourself the ability to solve them. In fact, until completion, I refrained from looking up anything about the game until I completed it, because I didn't even want to know that anyone else had solved the puzzles before me.The only major complaint was the weak ending, as all the mystery the game built up, led me to so many imaginative ideas of what it was all leading up to, what was possible, and what grand truth could be revealed, and unfortunately, the game didn't live up to what those mysteries led my imagination to produce. Nevertheless the experience was unforgettable, and this was a true work of art, visually as well.			"

If you don't, I would still recommend you try it, as the environment and the puzzles have been merged seamlessly into a fantastic experience. If you do go in, go in as blind as you can, as seeing the solutions will only take away from the discovery.Only real downside is that now I can never play Mini Metro because circles with lines coming out of them have driven me completely insane.100/10.

Puzzles in this game are designed masterfully and even person like me who isn't generally much into puzzle games manage to get tons of fun from just solving the puzzles and looking for clues. I would recommend you to try it, and if you won't like it your first two hours in, don't be afraid to return it, it won't get any different.			"

YouTube™ Video: Scatterbrained Review: The Witness 

			Views: 170		

			Jonathan Blow has BLOW-n me away. Follow my twitter for updates and ramblings: https://twitter.com/ScatterbrainYT Background music by Brian George (Syliss): https://syliss.bandcamp.com		

For those of you not interested in watching the video, here's the basic rundown of my thoughts on The Witness.In short, The Witness is the most engaging and addicting puzzle game I have ever played. I've never seen a game more completely built around the experience of puzzle solving than this. And I do mean the whole experience: learning the rules, the sudden flashes of understanding, the satisfaction of solving a difficult problem and, eventually, the way the puzzles begin to rewire your brain.The Witness marks the first time I have experienced full-blown Tetris syndrome since...well...Tetris. Even when I wasn't playing the game, I'd start to see grids and lines all over in the world around me, and my brain would constantly be imagining and solving puzzles in the background. This one time (and I absolutely swear this is true) the solution to a particular puzzle I was stuck on came to me in a dream. It was such a strange but amazing feeling. I thought that sort of thing only happened in movies, but The Witness made it happen.It's really unfortunate that the game is so strongly centered around letting the player figure things out for themselves, which means that even the slightest details about the way puzzles work and the way the puzzles interact with the environment (and they do interact with the environment quite a lot. This game isn't just logic puzzles with a nice backdrop) can ruin the experience for someone. So buying into The Witness takes a bit of a leap of faith, since it really is better the less you know about it. I made the leap and couldn't be happier. So I strongly recommend that if you have even a passing interest in puzzles, that you make the leap as well.			"

												The game starts out weird, but the sort of weird that makes you interested.  Things start out simply and get a little more complex over time, which is great!   The puzzles are fun and the whole while you're wondering ""What does this do?""  Then it changes the rules of the puzzle and doesn't tell you what those rules are.You don't just go from beginning to end, you have to do something different, something which you can't just figure out, you have to look around, try to figure things out yourself, the problem is that you also have no indicator on where to look, or how far into the game you learn the rules of the new puzzles you're seeing.It's fun to change things up, however it isn't fun when you're hit with things you have no idea how to tackle.  Hints aren't even made.  The game is entirely, from the very beginning, without text, without help, the only help it gives you is that arrow keys make you move, shift makes you run, and left mouse button lets you interact.All in all, because the rules aren't even remotely hinted at I fully do not recommend this game unless you're the sort of person to want to bash your head against a wall for any amount of time, figuratively or literally - the same type of personality that'd enjoy doing that would likely enjoy this.

												I liked this game for the puzzles. Gradually they get more and more difficult, and some of them are extremely clever!In addition, the visuals are stunning, and there's a lot of secrets for you to discover.However, ultimately it is merely a puzzle game, the current price (€37) is way too high imo.

												This game combines two of my favorite things, puzzles and exploration.You find yourself alone on an island full of puzzles and can pretty much walk where ever you want solving what puzzles you wish. There are no instructions or words of any kind. There is only one type of puzzle in this game; the mechanics of the puzzle changes based on the area you are in.The Witness does a pretty good job of setting up a row of puzzles to learn their rules. And it seems the game saves constantly, so there is no detriment for quitting a puzzle and coming back to it later.If you like figuring out puzzles with little direction and walking around a beautiful setting with very little sound, this game is perfect for you.10/10 would walk again			"

												An incredibly immersive and intriguing puzzler that is much more than just line mazes.Problem solving your way around the island and getting your head around the plethora of puzzles is a great challenge but the real highlight of this game is the beauty and meticulous attention to detail found in the game's design. The fluctuation of frustration and satisfaction felt when completing maze after maze is made a thoughrably enjoyable experience when surrounded by stunning and elegant landscapes all with their own secrets to behold.

												My brother was incredibly excited to play this game when it released and I watched him get practically consumed by the game.  I saw a lot of the game and really wanted to play it but I resolved to wait until I perhaps had forgotten some of the things I'd seen him do.  Now, almost a year later I've finally started playing the game and I love it.  The subtle hints, the simplest looking puzzles that become so complex, the moment when you finally look at the puzzle just right and discover the answer.  It's all fantastic and it's wrapped up in a beautiful world.  Every single detail seems to have thought to it.  Sure the game can be a little bit puzzling at times but isn't that the point?			"

												Intending no hyperbole, I can comfortably assert that, as a fan of adventure/puzzle games, this is the greatest game that I have ever played.  If you have ever thought back to your time with Riven and wondered why, in the many years since, there has never been another attempt at matching the scope and detail of such a fully realized place full of mysteries that respect your intellect and attentiveness, this game is for you.  If you have never played a videogame in your life, but you endeavour to search search for great truth and understanding, within and without, then this game is for you.Some will undoutably accuse it of being boring or pretentious.  This is not a game for the young at mind.  This game is art not because it is pretty (which it is), but rather because it isamnitious, meaningful and honest. Do not spoil any of it  for yourself if you can at all avoid it.  Go into it knowing nothing, and leave knowing that you know nothing but that you are Knowing.Thank you, Mr. Blow and the fine folks at Thekla Inc.  Just please don't keep us waiting seven years for whatever comes next :) "

												For more than seven years already, I've ranked Jonathan Blow's Braid not just as one of the best puzzle games ever, but as one of the best games in general. The way Braid used gameplay itself as a storytelling method has only been approached in some rare other games such as Brothers: The Tale of Two Sons, but never rivalled. And don't even get me started on the secrets.Naturally, I've been honkerin' for The Witness since it was announced, hoping that the end result would be worth the long, long wait. And, after having done pretty much everything there is in The Witness, I can conclude that for the most part the hopes were not unfounded.The thing that will undoubtedly disappoint some people is the almost total lack of a story, or the wish that the game is building up towards some kind of a Shyamalan-flavored mind-blowing twist at the end. That isn't the case here. Blow seems like a bit of perfectionist and a man who's not afraid to express his worldview through his games, and I see it only as a positive that he didn't set out to do another Braid, but a whole new experience instead.The Witness is all about discovery, and lots of puzzles. In the most reductionist manner the game could be described as just drawing lines from point A to B. And to be honest, that is what all the puzzles in the game are. However, during my playthrough I grew into considering this simple gesture as a metaphor for pretty much everything in the end. There is a strange power and meaning in this simple form; The beginnings you choose, the paths you travel and the endings you reach.There are layers in The Witness that are nothing short of revelatory. There are puzzles inside puzzles; Secrets piled on other secrets, some of which I'm convinced have yet to be even found. The vibrantly colorful island you explore is a masterclass of environment design: Absolutely everything has been meticulously crafted down to the smallest detail, with not a single twig in the wrong place.It's easy to get philosophical while playing, since the environment is sprinkled with media snippets of several famous thinkers. Not all of these might be for everyone's liking and the game can easily seem overtly preachy if you disagree with some of the thoughts, but they managed to get at least me to ponder not just the puzzles. Even though I didn't enjoy everything (teachings about nonduality were a bit tough to swallow), I can appreciate Blow's courage to put his very personal stamp on the game.I must still mention the gameplay design, which is another aspect of The Witness that totally shines. The way the game teaches you about its rules feels so natural. You're always learning new things, doing new things, and eventually extrapolating on your existing knowledge to reach complex discoveries. Yet, looking back, the path you took to get there seems as simple and clear as a line from A to B.In my mind, The Witness cements Jonathan Blow as one of the great video game designers of our time. I'd probably go as far as placing the game in the Top Ten puzzle games ever, along with Tetris, Picross, Lemmings 2, World of Goo and others. It's not a game for everyone. Some might find it excessively sterile and dull. But if you like puzzles, The Witness is not to be missed.			"

												Interesting puzzles based on deceptively clever concepts. Fun exploration at your own pace. Lovely visual design. Pretentious philosophical quotes and lectures - good or bad depending on your taste.Conceptual theme; no story or characters. Probably don't play this game if you absolutely must have a narrative.I strongly recommend to people who find joy in puzzles and discovery.As others have mentioned, certain puzzles can't be solved by deaf or colour-blind players. Since these types of puzzles are uncommon and usually easy to identify, I still recommend The Witness even if you are deaf and/or colour-blind, as long as you don't mind skipping or looking up solutions for small parts of the game.

												While the basic mechanics of the game are the same for all the puzzles, they get serious milleage out of the maze concept.  The puzzles are very well designed, and while it's a bit confusing wandering around at first, once you locate the tutorial areas the game does a great job of teaching you each puzzle element without any text whatsoever.  The rush of finally figuring out a difficult puzzle is like a nerd high.If you like puzzles and especially exploration based games such as Myst or Riven (which this is heavily influenced by), definitely give this a try.  It should go without saying that if you hate puzzles and/or wandering around feeling like an idiot as part of the gameplay experience, this game isn't for you.			"

												As relaxing as it can be frustrating, The Witness is an entirely original experience that is much greater than the sum of its parts. A wonder that a game with absolutely minimal interactivity and hand-holding can be such a tightly designed experience that is so effective at introducing and teaching new rules at every turn. Essentially a metroidvania where your knowledge (or lack-of) is the tool holding you back. A mysterious and gorgeous world that is a true joy to explore, discover, get frustrated at, walk away, return, try again, realise, learn, and curse self in.			"

												I love this game. Truely. There's so many adaptations on a very basic concept and the amount of planning that had to go into the layouts of everything seems to be enormous. Theres always a few cons, and I caution people (as others have) about the color blind issues. Certainly there are ways to get past this (namely looking up the solutions as that sention is relatively short). Also, for those who are hard of hearing there's a similar problem in some sections. There is also a few puzzles toward the end that I personally had trouble with; I get migranes from from flashing lights and I very nearly had to walk away more than once; but again, it was a short section. All in all, yes there should be a warning about these things, but there are guids and help all over the place that can help past the puzzles. Not to mention there's such a variety of other puzzles that it should should not pose too much of an issue. Those who are color blind would have the most problem, but it's not in every puzzle.			"

												Firstly, you cannot trust reviews from all these people that have only played a handful of hours. I don't really write reviews, but I feel compelled to in this case: I consider The Witness a masterpiece. I've just finished the main game and look forward to 100%'ing it.I've been constantly exclaiming out loud ""how the hell did he [Jonathan Blow] come up with this?"" The puzzle design blows me away: the interaction of the puzzle pieces with other pieces, the interaction with the environment, the sheer depth and variety built on top of the same simple concept... and just the way you progress in learning the rules of the panels. You are forced to question everything you see in order to understand how to move forward. Quite a few times I was stuck for a while before taking a step back and asking myself ""what is the nature of the puzzle, how has it been progressing thus far, and what can I see around me?"" A breakthrough would then come.Playing The Witness is incredibly fun and satisfying: I have a notepad full of sketches and tetris pieces, and even with the main game completed there are a huge amount of puzzles left to discover and solve.Yes, it can be challenging, and some people will give up in frustration. But if you believe in yourself, ask the right questions, and trust that the game isn't out to screw you over, you will have an amazing experience.			"

												Quite possibly the most challenging game I have ever played, but in a good way. Nothing seems to be cheap or unfair, it is all based on your intellect. I have finished the game in around 20 hours, and there is still a lot I feel I need to do. There are lingering mysteries that I need to find, but I will give my review of just the parts I have played. I did my best to go into this game completely blind, and I did a pretty good job of avoiding any sort of spoilers/ solutions. As I said earlier, this game is very challenging, so it may be tempting to look up solutions, but I would encourage you not to, as the struggle of completing a very challenging puzzle along with the feeling of completing it is priceless. In my playthrough, very few of the puzzles seemed ""unfair"", or seemed like something I couldn't complete. They are challenging, but not impossible.The atmosphere of this game is incredible, everything very carefully crafted, and lots of secrets to be found, even in the enviroment itself! The graphics are very beautiful, and all around the presentation is great. One thing though, this game is very mentally exhausting. It gave me a few big headaches, and I had to take a break. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes any sort of puzzle game. Although 40$ is a high pricetag, it is worth every penny. It may seem like a very simple game where you just run around solving snake puzzles, but these puzzles are more a translation of your enviroment than anything like sodoku or kenken. For anyone who likes riddles, puzzles, or an intellectual challenge, give this game a go.			"

												You wake up on a deserted island trying to find out what's going on, and you do that by solving puzzles that are somehow mysteriously scattered around said island. What's interesting is the fact that there's one 'type' of puzzle really (solving the maze), but there are tons of variants of this thing, using enviroment patterns as a clue in most cases. Gorgeous graphics (I would describe it as 'mad max fury road-ish crazy colorful stylized'), pace depending only on you (there's no 'timer' or anything like that and you're free to explore the entirety of the island right of the bat), mostly visual way of immersing you in the world (only spoken narration that I found were those tapes that you can listen to, found in random places) - all of that creates an unique videogame experience that I felt only few times in my life. And I'm not even close to solving the mystery, I have barely scraped the surface of this game, but I'm definetely going to press onward!That said, I have few problems with The Witness:1) after a certain amount of solved puzzles you hit a brick wall and you don't have a damn clue how to solve a single puzzle that's left. So you just walk around like an idiot desperately trying to activate one of those damn panels, getting pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the situation at hand :)2) invisible walls. They were placed so that you can't 'cheese' the puzzles just by doing some 'platforming'. But it's both blessing and a curse. Sometimes there are situations where you would like to just drop down. Instead, what you're forced to do is to walk around few meaningless enviroment obstacles, following the walkway serpentining around the hill. And while we're at it, I would LOVE to see something like teleports from Enter the Gungeon scattered through the island. They would make the 'walking sections' so much more bearable...3) on the default, recommended graphical settings (so everything on high, vsync on, etc) the framerate varied from meh (about 30 fps) to absolutely inacceptable (1-2 fps in a certain spots on the map!!) And it's not that I have a totally crappy PC. It can easily handle games like CSGO, Dark Souls, GTAs, Bioshock, etc and yet, The Witness makes it hiccup... Setting everything on medium and turning vsync off worked totally fine though.The last question is (putting the 'problems' aside) - is it worth to buy it for 40$? Yes and no. If you are puzzle games fan - absolutely! But if you struggled in games like Portal or Talos Principle (which are much easier, while still being quite challenging), you will get stuck immediately and you will become frustrated, because the game doesn't give you a damn clue about what to do next.So yea, The Witness, unique experience, not for everybody.

												dont bother with this claptrap. there are 2 halves to this game, the nice pretty part, and then the entirely separate puzzle half, which is almost always a lame line drawing challenge on a boring square grid. Also, these types of puzzles arent the ones that reward thoughtfulness, but rather, how quickly you can try random permutations until you get the one correct one - that is if you can figure out what it is you're supposed to be doing in the first place. Occasionally you come across clever perspective puzzles, but those are in the minority.as far as the story, there literally is none. spoiler alert. the most you get is psuedo-science mumbo-jumbo philosophical bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is frankly insulting.I gave this game the benefit of the doubt. I thought there MUST be something here somewhere as a payoff for wading through the endless bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ I actiavated all the laser towers, i played through to the credits, and what did i get for it?

												One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Even 400+ puzzles in the game is still challenging me with new ideas. This isn't a game that just repeats three mechanics and scales to become more complex. It's a game that continuously throws new mechanics in the mix. It's half solving puzzles and half understanding them.If you enjoyed the myst franchise or the talos principle give this game a shot. There's more than enough content to justify the $40 price tag and I think it's already a strong GotY 2016 candidate.The only things I'd caution:- While the witness brings a bounty of fresh ideas and new focus to the puzzle game genre... It is still a puzzle game. If you hate puzzle games you likely won't enjoy this.- There isn't much of a direct story to be found here. There are audio logs to be found with philosophical quotes that tie in deeply with the theme of the puzzles and gameplay but don't expect a full on adventure title. Any story that is here is extrmely subtle.			"

												I cannot say enough good things about this game. The graphics are gorgeous, the island is big enough, but has very distinct sections so that even I don't get lost.The game teaches you everything. You don't need the internets. I've looked for some hints online and have always regretted doing so. Don't do it! The game teaches you everything. If you don't know the solution, it's because you haven't learned that mechanic yet. Some puzzles require multiple mechanics combined and are best left for the very end.Take notes, take pictures, write down all the puzzle rules, cut out some tetris shapes. It's all part of the fun. At this point in time I don't need exciting, fast paced games with jump scares and hit points. I like walking around at my own pace solving puzzles in games like in FEZ, Braid, Portal, The Talos Principle, Out There Somewhere and now The Witness.I don't want this game to end. I've solved every level but one and still have to find all hidden puzzles. I've logged nearly 40 hours now, so that's less than €1 an hour. Probably the best value for money for a long time!Get it if you like brainbusters. Don't get it if you like harpooning nazis in the face.			"

												Braid was one of my favourite puzzlers ever, I wasn't expecting much from the Witness but I've really enjoyed this gameGood things: The learning curve. The game doesn't make you sit through endless, tedious tutorials. It throws you straight in at the deep end, lets you work things out for yourself. It's one of the hardest I've played, but it's far from impossible.  Aesthetically and atmospherically the game is beautiful, as well as eerie and dark at times. As a result, exploring the open world map is part of the fun. Being stuck in one area is more an opportunity to venture elsewhere than a roadblock. Secrets. Braid had 8 hidden stars, The Witness has far more secret areas and easter eggs you can feast on, giving it huge replay value. The hours of gaming you will get from this game are worth the price. Lots of variety. I was worried the maze mechanic would be boring and that the game would just be 600 top-down hedge mazes, but that's not the case at all.Bad: Of the 400 or so puzzles I've beaten so far, I'd say one or two had solutions that I'd deem unfair or inscrutable. Sometimes luck plays a part in solving them. But that's not a particularly damning figure considering you don't need to solve everything to reach the end of the game. No real discernable story, both endings are a tad anticlimactic. That being said, there's so much to discover, and I don't know what happens when you finally solve every single puzzle, or if anyone's even done it yet.The backlash against this game on Steam, Youtube etc from the vocal minority has been considerable and I'm not sure why. If you avoid walkthroughs and spoilers you've got yourself a gripping and ingeniously desgined game that will have you hooked for hours. 8.5/10			"

												If you don't like puzzles, you'll hate The Witness.I love puzzles, and I love The Witness.I love those perfect ""a-ha!"" moments a great puzzle gives you, and that's exactly what The Witness is. That's all it is, in fact. It is those moments of clarity and accomplishment and excitement, over and over and over again.I won't be explicit, but this bliss of discovery and understanding is absolutely not limited to the puzzle panels themselves. That is what makes The Witness so beautifully compelling. The game is so much more than the sum of its parts. It's endlessly surprising.The Witness presents a universe and trusts you to understand it. It offers all the tools you need to test your hypotheses and never changes the rules on you. And once your theories are proven true, it breaks down the walls you never realized were surrounding you and trusts you to understand this new, larger universe, use what you learned to find where the walls are, and break them down yourself.The Witness trusts you and you have to trust it back. If you get stuck or frustrated or feel like something is impossible, you need to be able to step back and trust that the game is being fair to you. Because it is. The new understanding you seek is around you on the island, and the game simply trusts you to seek it out. It's never arrogant, malicious, or esoteric in its design.Again, The Witness is so much more than what it looks like. It isn't just puzzle panel after puzzle panel. But if you don't enjoy the puzzles, you will never enjoy The Witness.If you enjoy learning for learning's sake, if you see being proven wrong as an opportunity, if you love searching, discovering, and understanding, then The Witness is for you.

												Despite the Myst-like premise and deceptively simple looking line puzzles, this game is simply in a league of its own. Endlessly engaging, brain-shreddingly hard, and absolutely beautiful at every turn. This is a complete game worth the standard price of $60. The fact that it starts out on sale for $40 is just icing on the cake. Don't read any reviews longer than this. Don't read any descriptions of the puzzles or the island. Just buy and play.			"

												The Witness is praised for its puzzle design, and it has every right to be in the GOTY list for that alone. However, what is often missing in reviews is that the world you are thrown into is made by very real-world architects. I've played my share of games, but very few of them could deliver goosebumps merely through the composition of space. Quite a visual feast to walk through.			"

And as you play more, you'll look at things differently. It is amazing how much is hidden on this fantasticly crafted island. True art.

Not for those looking for a braindead-gratification-on-rails; you have to put a lot in but you get a lot out. At first the concept of solving the panel puzzles may seem a bit too simple, but as you go on they integrate more and more into the environment. Definately recommend for any who like a challenge.

												After two sleepless nights of playing The Witness, I feel confident that it deserves a place alongside the greats - Portal, FEZ, and Talos Principle all come to mind, as well as pure logic puzzles like SpaceChem and TIS-100.As in those games, the puzzles all follow one basic pattern: Here, that pattern is tracing a line across a panel. This, and only this, is your way of interacting with the world, even outside the puzzles.Which is a good thing! The panels employ a number of mechanics, each with a relatively simple set of rules. Combining those mechanics just means applying the rules for each one.Easy, right? It is, at least when your mental model of the rules is correct. These moments are hugely satisfying: Progression happens not because you've collected the correct item, but because you have learned something.And when your model is wrong, it's time to experiment. People mention the scientific method in conjunction with The Witness, and I can see why. The deterministic behavior of each element means you can form a hypothesis and test it as often as necessary.Or, admittedly, until you give up in frustration. Which will happen, unless you've got Vulcan-like patience and focus. But even then, there's dozens of other puzzles you can tackle at any time, and when you come back you'll have learned new rules, or new ways hints are hidden in the world, and be able to apply that knowledge to panels that stumped you earlier.And then there's the scenery. Stunning, colorful vistas at every turn, rendered beautifully, with no background music and few sound effects to distract from the puzzle solving. I think that's a wise decision, given how much concentration can be needed to solve the panels. Say what you will, the best music in the world quickly becomes annoying if it keeps interrupting your thoughts.Also, contrary to what you might think, the environment is very much relevant to the puzzles. Lighting, perspective and audio cues all play an important part in solving certain kinds of them.As for story... I just don't know yet. You're stranded on this deserted island and clearly, something went down there. Did that event happen ages ago? Last tuesday? What was it? All questions that may or may not be answered down the line, and I'm fine with that.I realize not everyone will agree, but solving puzzles for the sake of it is reason enough for me to play The Witness, and resolving the mystery of the island is a nice cherry on top.If you pick this up - and I think if you enjoy analytical puzzle solving, you should! - do yourself a favor: Don't look up any guides, and do stop and smell the roses. There's much to be seen (and, in the case of the audio logs, heard) around the island, and enjoying the scenery will take your mind off those fiendish puzzles.			"

												Oh... here we go. I wanted to talk in a calculated and measured way but I don't think that's really the way you're going to figure if you'll enjoy the game. Either this will resonate with you or it won't and you'll think I'm full of abject puffery or that I'm deluded in some manner.I have to say, it's weird seeing the utter contrast between people who enjoy the game and people who don't. Either the motif of enlightenment and zen strikes you or it doesn't. Either you enjoy the myriad ways that the game makes path-puzzle solving difficult by using the environment and adding more rules or you find it stupid. Either you love the way the game tries to make you feel connected to something, some secret just beyond your grasp (there goes the motif again)... or you find the whole experience unbearably pretentious.I can't promise you'll like the game (if a deeply puristic exploration 'game' can even be called such). And as a personal plea from an absolute nobody, maybe I can't convince you of it but there IS something here: a surprisingly strongly structured attempt to invoke a longing for a connection to something (knowledge or spirituality or whatever metaphysical concept you hold closest to you). Either you'll find the call to this 'something' deeply self-resonant or you won't and if it's the latter I can see easily how you might not enjoy the game. The whole experience is built around trying to invoke your feeling that 'something' and if it fails then your mileage will vary.For the sake of trying to give SOME sort of guidance, it's close to the Myst series and The Talos Principle thematically (and graphically it's downright GORGEOUS). And like those games either you are good at puzzle solving or you'll need to look up the solutions. Try not to spoil it for yourself though since some of the seemingly toughest puzzles sometimes just require knowledge acquired at a vastly different area of the island. None of the problems are unfair really though pounding away at a puzzle like its a veil you're desperate to see behind is discouraging at times. As an important aside though, sadly, the game WILL give you issues at points if you are colorblind to certain colors or are deaf.Thanks, Thekla in general and Jonathan Blow. I lack the words to properly express. This wasn't a game I was looking forward to heavily and it's completely consuming me. (Hell, Braid only resonated with me minimally.) I'm really going to miss this feeling when the experience is over.In the end, whether something resonated with you in this review or it didn't. And either way I can't promise any correlation with how you'll feel about the game. So what was the point of this? I suppose I just needed to express how this experience has made me feel was all.

There is no hand hold story/narrative as with Portal. Much more ""just figure it out"" like Talos principle (with even less story than that, from what I can tell).Yes it is only puzzles but I can tell you I have had some of the most rewarding feelings I have ever had playing a game (or maybe anything for that matter).

												HOUR ONE:I must admit the negative reviews on Steam are almost overwhelming. I was really looking forward to this, mostly based on the fact that Jonathan Blow was the mastermind of the project, and it looked really pretty. I'm not really the biggest fan of puzzle games. Portal 1 and 2 are wonderful, I think they're great. Talos Principle? I liked some aspects of it (the atmosphere and the lore) but the gameplay didn't really do it for me. I got some amount of enjoyment from it, but had little motivation to go deep into it. To hear from many that Talos is a better game quickly grew my skepticism of The Witness. Is it really worth $40? Kind of a risky investment considering I put exactly 2 hours into Talos... and I don't really intend to go back.While the similarities to Talos are definitely there, this game also hearkens to what is one of my favorite games of the last few years, Proteus. The lack of music brings my full attention to the environment -- no dramatic emotional cues are provoked, and I like that. I'm kind of left to my own exploratory devices, at my own pace. And what a place to explore. This game is VISUALLY ARRESTING. I don't know how they made colors behave the way they have here. Everything I look at is a dopamine rush. It's just the definition of aesthetically pleasing. I can't quite put my finger on it. It's painterly, and layered: yes, your character is confined to sometimes-limited paths (unlike most FPS situations, if it looks like it would break your ankle, you can't drop down, etc) but the trade-off is gorgeous views, interesting visual terminals, and controlled color palletes. I wish parks were designed this nicely. I wish landscapes for designed so elegantly. It really feels like someone has considered how the game looks from every possible angle. The whole thing is super screenshottable; picturesque. And it is a dream to explore.So then, about those puzzles. They are more ""two dimensional"" and ""contained"" than I expected, I guess, but I think that's okay. Instead of making yourself and your movement an element of the puzzle, like in Talos principle, you literally use a cursor to guide lines through a 2D ""maze."" It's, at first, exactly like the pen and paper maze puzzles that lined children's magazines. And that is actually kind of refreshing to me, to have each puzzle be a clear, self-contained unit. Because it's easy to walk away from them. It's easy because there is so much worth exploring. Since I haven't allowed myself to get to the brink of frustration yet, in the first hour, I've been pleasantly surprised and happy with them. I'd say there's probably much, much building on the basic formula to be had, and I don't doubt I WILL be frustrated.At the end of hour 1, I am pretty easily expecting to blow past hour 2. I can't wait to hop back in. But how long will it hold me? We shall see...DAY TWO:Well... as much as I love the world of this game, I'm not really sure I'm made of the kind of stuff that can make much progress with these puzzles. The exploration is great. The puzzles feel like a lot of trial-and-error to my math-strained brain. Unfortunately, I think I'm going to test out Steam's refund system, because I'm just not sure if it's worth $40 for me right now. I expect to go back in the future, but... not right now.			"

												First off I'd say I didn't finish the entire game, and my PC can only run the game on low so some commentary may be variance upon the awful PC that I use and my lack of time to get everything done.First off The Witness is one of those games that just throws you on an abandoned island and you solve your way through it.  Because I failed to beat the game in a weekend (thats not a bad thing, I just have other things to play too) I'm not sure if theres a point... but from what I've seen its pretty decent to Myst like Talos Principle did to when the original Portal came out. The game uplifts and challenges the player in a different way, while keeping the experience enjoyable (minus the fact all the puzzles are line/dot puzzles (more on that later)Gameplay: All the puzzles are variances of a ""draw a line from point to end while doing things on a board."" Every puzzle, every environment action besides Moving requires you to manipulate these plates in ways to get things done, doors open, rooms lit, panels flipped, etc etc etc. So the challenge is finding the solution because as you play... what is on the board, what appears on the board, why your manipulating the board becomes less and less clear. Everything around you looks pretty and may have an overarching purpose to your progress. Thats my flaw, every puzzle looks the same, but isn't. Myst (which I compare this game strongly too) varies it up but has the same flow because you interact with objects directly while this one requires panels to do the same interation... like TURNING THINGS. Not to mention this game sometimes prohibits guessing by the inconvience of repeating the previous panel to attempt the current panel again.Graphics: Looks amazing, theres alot to look at and is a photographers dream. The artstyle might not be for everyone, but it suits this game well, and once in awhile stops your tracks to gasp at a perfect vision.Audio: Music is missing, but puzzles can have audio so I can see why. Your going to be hearing things happening that you need to see to comprehend and you can tell whats going on with headphones or speakers. Score: I'd like to give this a higher score, but 8.5 or 9 out of 10 seems to be the best I can give it. The price point might be kind of high for some, but theres enough to sink your teeth into if the puzzles can keep you engaged. While its not the best puzzle game of the past 5 years, I would say if you picked this up and don't mind drawing lines to solve things you'll survive to get a great experience, but if your looking for a more interactive, more engaging experience you can get this or Talos Principle. This might become the myst of the next generation, but it needs to tweak the average interactive experience instead of tying everything to panel drawings.PS: This game crashed twice over some of the ways the game lights rooms, it uses some kind of light filtering (I'd go more but since its a theme for a hub I'm stopping here.) so some Video cards might become unstable. I use ATI Radeon HD 5670 with the game in DX11. The auto save was never corrupted (thankfully) but I feared it could so a manual save might be a good way to go if the dev is looking for improvements.			"

												Dear Jon,I am writing to you about your magnum opus, The Witness, not out of love, but as an expression of my boredom with completing what may be the critical apex of your brain's functionality.  I understand that engineering a puzzle takes a great mind, but I feel as though you're efforts are simply too mundane.  Every day, the New York Times challenges me with a crossword puzzle that draws on my education and life experiences to craft a truly memorable and endearing experience.  The Witness reminded me of a stained glass paint kit I received as a Christmas gift.  It's an imitation of true, masterful art and only enables lesser minds to experience the physical climb towards impacting the world we share.  I can say, with no doubt in my mind, you are a smart man.  However, I beat all 700 puzzles in 10 hours and have an incredibly high IQ.  I implore you, with respect, to refund me the $40 I spent on your product as I do not make much in the world of academia.Sincerely yours,Hitler			"

												Not for me. Plenty of friends claim it was their GOTY, so I gave it a shot. Two nights and three hours in, I fell asleep twice trying to play it. It starts off interestingly enough, shows you the basics of some puzzles and progresses you through areas. Then you will find a secret area with a harder puzzle, unlock it, find another puzzle on the ground, finally solve it! Aaaand nothing happens. No visual or audio cues, nothing. Silence. Hooray.The reward for solving line-based puzzles? More line-based puzzles! With different shapes and annoying rules for solving them that are never explained. I get that 'no hand holding' is part of the 'charm' of this game, but I never once felt rewarded for solving a puzzle or motivated to continue on to the next puzzle. I guess if your reward is to feel like you are smart for solving the puzzle, then this game is for you. Such a shame really, the game has a great art style and environment, I wish there were more puzzles that didn't involve staring at a tiny grid. And if after 3 hours of gameplay I can't find any motivation to play a game, I have to give it up.			"

												This game trains you to look, and I mean really *look*, at the world around you. Few things are random in this game, and as it goes on I'm feeling increasingly like a conspiracy nut as I'm constantly looking for patterns in the world around me.The feeling of coming across a panel with no clear solution, investigating the world around you, and then trying out some far-fetched theory only to unexpectedly find that it works, is truly amazing.Enjoying it immensely so far, but it requires an hour or so to start to understand why it is so good. If you don't look past the beginning, it just seems like a pretty lame puzzle game. Might be a hard sell for some people.			"

It's just realizing that you do not know all of the rules as well as you think you do that is the key.  Hence, this game is not for everyone.  But that doesn't make it a bad game, unlike some people say.  This game is extremely well put together and the more you invest yourself into it, the more rewarding it becomes.			"

												As someone who LOVES puzzles, I love this game. I've only put in a few hours so far but have greatly enjoyed them. I WILL be putting in the hours over time to solve every single puzzle. This is not a game for those who do not enjoy puzzles for the sake of puzzles.This is not an exploration game with puzzles along with X,Y, or Z mechanic. It is entirely exploration and puzzles. Varied, intelligent, challenging, and clever puzzles. If you like to figure things out on your own, I recommend this game. If you have patience, I recommend this game. If one of your favorite things about learning is the ""Ahah!"" moment, I recommend this game. If you are looking for anything more than puzzles, the game seems to have some sort of narrative or message or meaning. But you have to really love solving puzzles to figure whatever that is. I haven't figured anything out yet but I've only played a few hours. I feel as if it's more of a medatative game. It has a beautiful open world. The scenery is amazing. The colors are vibrant. The contrast of areas is astounding. But this game isn't for everyone. It is definitely for me though. I thrive in an environment of challenge that this game presents. It does have tutorials of sorts, but you really figure everything out on your own. This is definitely a game I would recommend to puzzle fans.			"

												Dear Gamer Friends,I come to you today with a recommendation. Though that term is a bit weak.Do you like puzzles? Do you like adventure? Do you like mystery? Do you like dreaming in technicolour?You'll probably enjoy The Witness.I am seriously flipping out over this game. I have not felt this great about solving puzzles since Spacechem, and before that Riven and Myst.""How many different ways can you present a line puzzle?"" you ask?ALL THE WAYS, AND THEN SOMEThere are SO MANY things to notice. And EVERYTHING is relevant. Even the stuff that isn't there.The Witness is satisfying SO MUCH of my gaming/puzzling/exploration/non-violent FUN needs. I had been contemplating reinstalling Myst, but I'd been hesitant because I figured that time would not have been kind and my nostalgia would have been ruined.I'm having to pay attention and track ALL THE THINGS, and then I have to create theories about how all the things go together, and then i'm having to apply those theories, and then I muck something up and I realize that my prior successes were just luck, so I need to go back and experimentally refine my theories. ""Okay, I know I can solve this by doing X, which serves my theory. Y would also fit, let's try it!""It is like puzzle science and it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorgeous.As a caveat, I had initial problems with motion sickness, but was able to correct this by increasing the FOV and sticking a masking tape crosshair in the center of my monitor. This allowed for less distortion on my widescreen display and also gave my brain an optical point of reference. I also suffer from motion sickness in Antichamber and The Stanley Parable, and am eager to apply these techniques to those games to see if it has a similar effect.And, spoiler alert, once you unlock the jetpack, things REALLY get wild.

												The Witness is really quite unique. The main draw of this game in the beginning is its beautifully crafted environment, which is pretty much completely explorable and packed with detail. The only gameplay element aside from simple movement is in mouse-based interaction with line puzzles (controller works too, but I found I wanted more precision). Basically these are those puzzles that require you to trace a shape without crossing the same spot more than once. The rules are never spelled out, but the game is great at encouraging the player to learn through experimentation and exploration. I hesitate to say any more about it, because some of the most awesome moments in this game are in figuring out what's going on.The secrets are the fun part of the game, which is why it's so frustrating that a few of the secrets are so damn obscure. After a certain point, I was aware that there was more to do, based on a few glimpses of locked-off areas, but I had exhausted almost everything else of interest. I really wanted to find everything worthwhile in this game without spoilers, but the game turned into hours of me squinting at the screen for some hint about what to do next. I even tried solving a nearly accessible puzzle through the cracks in a plank ceiling to make progress (which, let's be honest, would've been an epic solution if it worked). Honestly, trying to solve that mystery on my own turned into a pretty low point in the game. For any but the most determined, if you are to that point, I actually recommend getting a hint or two. But first, try to explore and experiment for as long as you find it enjoyable!			"

												Fantastic game that kept me up at night thinking about puzzles. I will admit the first night I played I had a blast, but was very frustrated the second night as I wandered the island looking for the next available puzzle that I could solve. Something clicked the third night though and the rest of the game was as great as my first hour with it. I went into the game pretty much blind and never looked up a solution, so it took me about 24 hours to finish it the first time. I'm still wandering the island looking for puzzles and I know of at least one area I haven't even attempted yet. It's a brilliant game and experience.			"

												Have I missed something???I love puzzle games, portal, talos, turing effect and many more but this game just drags, I was apprehensive of the price tag first of all so I did wait for a sale and I am glad I did because however this games spins it with it's elegant discriptions and the lovely graphics and mysterious island the majority of the game is just sloving line puzzles of varying difficulty and you can play better versions of these on your phone. This game just drags the enthusiasm from me after sloving 10 line puzzles on it's mini screens I walk 5 meters and there are another 10 tedious puzzles and I know what is coming after I slog though them...more of the same. I was excited when I saw the island but after 10 hours I have fully lost interest in exploring any of it.If you love line puzzles then have at it, but honestly they are not hard once to figure out what the symbols mean and what needs seperating so to me it is just more grinding but as far as I can see little reward for it, I hope I am wrong but I won't be playing more to find out what's at the end it is just not worth it.

												""A Dark Souls of puzzle games""--------------------------------* Is this game similar to Myst?--------------------------------If you like Myst, or Myst-like games with emphasis on exploration, you should stop right now and buy it immediately.This is distilled spiritual successor of Myst and I waited for a game like this for years.--------------------------------* Would I like it if i like Talos Principle (Portal, etc)?--------------------------------I found people who like Talos giving a lot of negative reviews for reasons not completely clear to me. Those games are on the same level in terms of difficulty and complexity, but the core philosophy behind the games is completely different.Talos is more of a Portal-like puzzle game where the mechanic of the puzzle is simple, but the solution can be incredibly complex.Witness has more of the Myst like approach. The puzzle machanic is usually hidden and your goal is to discover it. Essentially it depends on if you like this kind of games.--------------------------------* I am afraid this is another indie crap with bad puzzles--------------------------------* This is easily an AAA tile.This is not an indie game, well, not your regular indie game. It was not made by a single person, and even if it was, this is not what automatically should make it a low budget indie.The production quality of this game is insane. Speaking in a Myst terms, I would say I found it easily on a pair with Raven or Exile.* This is not an 'only maze puzzles' game.There is a lot of misunderstanding about this part and trailer not really explainging it well. What I was expected initially from the Witness is a collection of small mini-games where you just need to go through the maze. This did not sound really exciting to be honest.Every time dev is asked ""are there only maze puzzles"" the answer is always ""yes, there are only maze puzzles"" and I wonder why did he not take time to explain this, because this statement is incorrect.* Panels are not puzzles.Panels are not puzzles, but rather interactive interfaces in the game. They work on the similar principle, but do a lot of different stuff. They activate and deactivate different machinery, open doors and move elevators, they modify game environment, etc. Think of them as unorthodox touchscreens or gearboxes.* Puzzles are not mazes.Let's be honest: the variety of the puzzles in the game is insane. There are logic puzzles, but there are also optical puzzles based on the effects light and shadow or color mixture, there are sound puzzles, mechanical and kinetic puzzles, puzzles based on the environment and so on.There are typically three group of puzzles:* One is some sort of tutorial, where you learn the rules of the game in a seris of progressively more complex tasks.* Then there are puzzles that combine several rules at the same time.(They may be really confusign at fist, but it usually means that you don't have enough information or understanding of the game at this moment).* And finally there is a metagame level where you suddenly discover that established rules may work outside of their usual context if you start to think outside the box.Almost all of the game elements are interconnected in some way, and the main goal of the game is to find those connections. (Which is, needless to say, insanely addictive and fun)https://art.penny-arcade.com/photos/i-QxgsmCF/0/1050x10000/i-QxgsmCF-1050x10000.jpg----------------TL;DR:---------------Definitely not a game for everyone, but great nevertheless.

												One of the most challenging and satisfying puzzle games I've ever played. It challenges all of your abilities. Not just problem solving, but observation and imagination as well. At times it feels a bit obtuse, and that can get frustrating, but if you take a break and come back later with a fresh perspective, you can eventually figure it all out. The audio logs and such are hit-and-miss on their own, but add to the enigma of the island as a whole. And if you haven't noticed by the screenshots, that island looks incredible. Every new environment is jaw dropping.I completely forgot about this game on two seperate occasions during it's seemingly endless development. I thought maybe Jonathan Blow & his team might be a bit behind the times as far as indie games go after all this time, but I've been proven wrong. The Witness is uniquely fresh and strange, but also remarkably inviting.Recommended for fans of  Myst, The Talos Principle, Antichamber, Braid  "

												I bought this game for one simple reason: Jonathan Blow. I loved Braid and I was hoping to find the same mix of arts, story and gameplay that made Braid terrific in here.I honestly think that the professional reviewer are praising this game because of the fame of its creator and because it is ""strange"" enough to fill their mouth with the word ""art"". There is nothing revolutionary here, there is only an awesome graphics style that doesn't justify the hardware requirements and a series of repetitive puzzles.Apart from the people who say they liked the game without realizing to having thrown 50 hours of their life from the window, probably this game can be really appreciated only by somebody affected by autism.I stopped playing it quite soon, because I felt bored, plain and simply. Everything that could make you go on is missing and from other's reviews I can see that at the end you are left alone with all your questions unanswered. ♥♥♥♥♥ please, I don't want another Lost experience, damn you Jonathan Lindelof.

												I promised myself not to cheat by looking for guides and so far have made it almost to the end...but I have no interest in finishing it. To many damn hours spent on this game with no real purpose but to make you feel pain and have some eureka moment. I wouldn't mind if there was a story! (and ♥♥♥♥ those quotes)Sadly in this occasion one factor that makes me really annoyed is the price! I thought yeah I've never played a game like this and always wanted too, so I spent the £30. In short it's not worth that amount, for one form of puzzle (snake), no story, and some ♥♥♥♥ing outdated quotes - I feel ripped off.I could have spent that money on some really good games that I certainly want in 2016, I don't know about you but when I spend a certain amount of money on a game I expect the standard things, e.g. even though I don't like CoD for the price and genre you expect the standard campaign, multiplayer, other modes like zombies, good graphics etc. With witness you get two things: puzzles and graphics (looks good but it's just colour, shadows and reflections)for one small island. If this game was £20 I might not complain.I get what the developer was thinking with his philosophy but this game makes me think he's a pretentious♥♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't matter what emotion you feel the game still needs to be enjoyable and worthwhile.

												The game world is beautiful but sadly that's all the game has going for it. There is essentially no story to speak of. You appear and are free to do whatever. There is no obvious reason to do anything beyond unlock the first door so you can get out of the spawn location. Maybe if I invested  more time, there would be story but I doubt it. The lack of story isn't really what killed this game for me, its the lack of puzzles. For me, to solve a puzzle, one must figure out a solution. In this game to solve a puzzle one must solve a graph optimization problem. It is a purely computational effort with no creativity involved. All puzzles are variation on labyrinth solving, but since that is very simple, some constraints are added. For example, your solution path must outline a certain shape or separate light and dark areas of the board etc. Once you figure out the constants, the process of actually solving the puzzle becomes a tedious process of trying different permutations until you arrive at the right one... Or look up the solution online. To add insult to injury the mechanics are by no means obvious so any area that introduces a new mechanic also has an extensive tutorial system where you 'solve' progressively more difficult puzzles to get a handle on the rules of this specific  rule set. On the other hand, sprinkled thought the world are puzzles that assume advanced knowledge of mechanics that you have not yet found the tutorial for making solving them all but impossible. As a result, the game removes pretty much all elements of creative thinking from this 'puzzle' game. You either know the mechanic and the puzzle is little more than an equation that needs to be solved, or you don't know the mechanic and you have almost no hope of solving the puzzle at all.			"

												1. This is definitely a masterpiece, no matter if you believe it in the beginning.2. Never read any spoiler, the best experience comes from an empty mind.3. Never google any hint, just take a walk on the island if you stuck on a puzzle.4. Ignore all the nagative reviews that playtime less than 15 hours.			"

												This game in one word:  TEDIOUS In more words:All, ALL of the puzzles consist of drawing a continuous line from start to finish - as in maze puzzles - on panels. As you progress through the game, new rules on how to solve each puzzle are introduced, which you have to figure out on your own - which is fine, really. However, the fact that you keep doing the same thing over and over again - drawing a line for all puzzles, moving from one panel to the next -  makes the game exhaustingly repetitive and boring. There were a couple of times which seemed nice, where you had to consider your surroundings too, which spiced things up for just a moment, before it would get back to the same old thing again. It's like having hundrends of Sudoku puzzles, with the difference they are not irritating like this is.It starts off promising, but,  at some point the game starts feeling more like ""work"" and the fun is all gone.  It's just not fun anymore.Some  really  bad puzzles:  Towards the end, there is a row of panels whose grids are not steady and keep moving, with the last one even spinning around really fast. There are also puzzles with flashing lights which are really tiring.  I understand it if people get motion sickness from first person shooters, but tiring the audience like this in a puzzle game is outrageous - it feels like torturing the audience on purpose, rather than challenging their skills.  The sound puzzles in the forest. You see, the good thing with puzzles is that most people can at least have a go at them. Incorporating puzzles whose solution is solely based on sound, you immediately exclude part of the audience who may have hearing problems of some sort. NOT cool.  About the story:Well,  there is absolutely NO story whatsoever. You go through all these puzzles and in the end you have absolutely no idea who the hell you are, why on earth you are on this island, what those statues scattered all over the island are or why you need to keep an eye out to form those strange symbols around the island to fill up those black columns. After all this trouble you went through, there is no reward to satisfy your curiosity, not in the slightest. About the end:You  enter a sort of glass elevator and, like Willy Wonka, you start to hover over the island for a while as you watch and hear the panels you worked so hard to solve being turned off along with the sound of your heart being torn apart, since you realize that all of your hard work went to waste as you are mockingly sent right back to the beginning, right where you started. I also didn't like the fact that you can solve the puzzles even from miles away, provided you can aim at the panel. I found this very stupid - unless you are inspector Gadget.The only thing that is really good about this game is the graphics - and the sound of your footsteps. Really well-made graphics with vibrant, enticing colours. And... that's pretty much it.If you really want to play this game, I suggest you get it on sale. "

												The Witness was made for me. I love puzzles, and I'm a sucker for colourful worlds. Okay I'll admit it. I'm a fan, I've been waiting for this game since 2009 when I saw concept art. I will say my wait was worth it. However, this game is not for everyone. I have enjoyed my time with this game even if there was a bit of pain involved. Without spoiling anything the main thing I learned in the first few hours is puzzles just lead to more puzzles and if you get stuck simply stop and move on. This game is simply a long set of tough logic puzzles with a world around it. If your okay with this, You will love the witness.I'm recommending this game for people like me who will enjoy this game. I know some people don't agree with me but I feel like The Witness is a better Myst. I was never much of a fan of Myst. I feel the Witness is a much better game when it comes to helping you find your goal. Even if the journy there is a tough one. I will finish this game I'll update my review when its done. Thanks for reading.			"

												Don't buy it, watch somebody else play it.Why the bad review? While Braid was warm and inviting (and fun!), The Witness is just adverserial. Failed a puzzle? Redo the previous one as punishment! I'm the game, and I'm not even going to tell you why you failed! Oh, you actually solved that one? Good luck figuring out what just opened, because I'm not gonna tell you!It's been a while since a game gave me the finger this often, and I've had enough. It reached the point where it just felt like work, and I had no desire to see where it was going. I like a good puzzle, but this one left me cold. Even Myst's obtuse puzzles managed to make me come back for more.The good points? The art direction is gorgeous. The island is just beautiful and ripe for exploration.			"

												A really beautiful game, of which the enjoyment of exploring the island & the satisfaction of solving the puzzles (as well as the refreshing non-linearity of it all) would almost make you forget about the repetitive nature of the puzzles. Of course, this is a continuation of Jonathan Blow's design ethos from Braid, where he takes a simple premise (in that case platforming, in this one mazes) and gradually elaborates on it with each iteration, exploring its potentialities in a way that eases the player into figuring it out while taking it to its extremes, sort of. And yet somehow it seems inappropriate. The repetition of the same general mechanic with slight alterations from place to place, not to mention the fact that these puzzles are all on panels which connect to each other & to other objects through a series of wires, creates a separation of the gameplay, and consequently the player, from the surroundings from square one, and seems to imply that the whole island is meant to be an artifice (a suspicion which seems to be confirmed by many of the audio logs found scattered around the island, which are often tedious philosophical musings by various celebrated thinkers & explorers throughout history). This is not entirely unlike Myst, which used a variety of puzzles throughout yet always felt kind of unreal all the same (and had plenty of puzzles analogous to the kind of puzzles here); nor does it make The Witness dull or overly predictable, at least not if you're down for that kind of thing. At times it can become maddeningly difficult all the same, and at those moments you wish there could've been a little more variety to be had. And I guess this is my only gripe with this game, that the puzzles relate to the environment but at the same time aren't part of the environment, so much as the environment is set up to provide answers to the puzzles via the creation of coincidences. And in that aspect it's very much like Braid, which was all about manipulating coincidence & perspective in order to beat the levels, except of course that in Braid the mechanic of the puzzles was also the mechanic of the gameplay. In this respect The Witness diverges from Myst by remaining almost too narrow in scope, and kind of didactic in its approach to puzzles, when on occasion you wish you could interact more directly with your environment rather than just with a series of machines. I guess where most first person point & click exploration games focus on realism, The Witness is consciously surreal & mechanistic, and its puzzles are minimalistic. I guess the difference between Myst and The Witness would be similar to that between a science museum, where you learn how things interact with one another in the natural world & apply this information to solve puzzles, and a math textbook or book of mathematical puzzles, where you learn how abstract & often arbitrarily construed concepts can relate to one another, and which you progress linearly through, as each problem is a lesson in how to solve the ones after it, and so on - it's a neat idea, but a fully immersive environment seems like an odd place to implement it; it almost asks you to block out all the surrounding detail & sensory information that isn't related to the specific panel you're working on. And then of course, it lacks any kind of story, but it would seem that one doesn't need a story in order to find enjoyment in exploration & puzzle solving. At least, I didn't need one to play through this on the first go around, but the second time I felt a little more directionless. It's definitely cool to see Jonathan Blow do a first-person exploration game, and taken on their own the puzzles are pretty elegant, but put together they seem at odds with one another.In short, I wouldn't not recommend this game, but at the same time I don't think Jonathan Blow's previous design ethos translates as well to non-linear gaming & immersive realism as you might hope. Definitely a pretty game & a fun one if you like the same kinds of puzzles over & over again, getting gradually more complicated & relying on somewhat different mechanics from one area to the next, but if you get tired of panels that do things seemingly by magic, then, well....

Personally I enjoyed every moment and was amazed as to the level that the simple mechanics were taken, each new area had at least one ""eurka"" moment and the lack of hand-holding made the feeling of accomplishment all the more rewarding. Get this is you want an ingenious and devilish puzzle game that tests both your logic and understanding of the world you are exploring.			"

												The Witness is a game, where you solve puzzles of varying forms on a mysterious island. This review won't contain any spoilers, however if you want to go into the game completely blind, I'll advise you to skip to the conclusion.Gameplay: First and foremost The Witness is a puzzle game. You solve puzzles by drawing a line from A to B in various ways. Since there is no tutorial the puzzles difficulty ranges from very easy to very hard. Even though the premise sounds pretty simple the game gets really creative with it, so you rarely get bored doing the puzzles.Overall I would say that the puzzles are created very fairly. Once you figured out how a certain puzzle mechanic works, only very seldom there are ones, where the developers want to take you on a journey of thought that you can't quite follow. You only interact with the world by walking and drawing lines, which I prefer to other adventure games where you have gameplay mechanics such as items and dialogue, which sometimes lead to very questionable puzzles. The only thing that limits you in The Witness is your own knowledge or the lack thereof and much of the game is about advancing your knowledge and perception to solve problems you could not solve before.Presentation: The way that the puzzles are presented in the world is quite remarkable. The island itself with its clean graphics looks very beautiful. The island is what elevates this game from being a simple phone/tablet game to being a full fledged ""gaming-experience"".Pretty much from the start you have the whole island accessible, meaning you have to explore it in order to advance in the game. There is no given linear order on how to do things, you have to figure out yourself. Obviously this can be a double-edged sword, since on the one hand you have a great sense of exploration in the game and more significant AHA-moments, when you return to puzzles you couldn't previously solve. On the other hand however it requires you to be patient, observant and it can lead to frustration, when you don't know whether it is you or the game holding you back from solving a puzzle. Story:  I won't say much about the story to avoid spoilers. If you know Jonathan Blow, you know that he can be very pretentious about some of his ideas and that the inherent strength of his games lies in the gameplay itself, not so much in the story.Conclusion: If you like puzzle games or solving puzzles, by all means, get this game. However, don't get this game if you are ""in for the experience"" or the story. Puzzling is a very huge part of the game and if you don't enjoy that you probably won't enjoy the game. This game wasn't built to appeal to everyone.I would say the price point for the game is quite high. The price on release should have been something in the 20-25€ range. I myself got it through the humble monthly (12$) and would say that, even if it turns out, that the other games in this bundle are useless, it is still well worth the money.			"

												Ehhh.... the entire presentation is great - going around the island to find the next puzzles and hidden parts of the environment works really well - but the puzzles themselves are braindead. Nearly ALL of them fit into one of two categories: mazes, and spot-the-oddity. The former is mostly for filler, and the latter usually consists of the form ""notice something odd in the environment"". There's a distinct lack of puzzles that involve actually thinking things through.  This is fine if you don't particularly like traditional puzzle games, but if you're expecting more... puzzles in your puzzles, you're going to be sorely disappointed.There's other problems, too. Like how it seems to insist you hold down the Shift key at all times, how there's a lot of time wasted on discovery, and how there's a strong feeling that you're only solving puzzles to solve puzzles rather than the game actually going anywhere (until the very end), and I cannot get over how pretentious the audiologs are, and a whole load of problems with the later game that I don't want to say because I only know them from reviews. But they're less significant.			"

												The Witness is part puzzle-game and part walking simulator, leaving us with a puzzle-game that not only provides you with some of the most difficult and intuitive puzzles you've ever seen, but also a charming and beautiful way to interact with them....The thing about this game is that it is a puzzle-game in it's most purest form, theres no story, no characters, no boss battles, nothing.It is a puzzle-game, one in which you solve puzzles. If you do not enjoy the types of puzzles it provides, or solving puzzles in general, you will -not- enjoy this game.I guess the issue I have with this game is that it tries to be more than what it is: a puzzle-game. the world you explore is so beautiful and there so many little things that make you think there's SOMETHING going on. Human statues placed about, mysterious locked doors and plenty of INCREDIBLY artsy narration and video clips that ultimately have nothing to do with the actual game itself. I feel like the world provided gives the player this expectation of some sort of reward, like finding out why we're on this island, how we got there, what are these statues, what is in this cave, what happens if I solve all the puzzles?The answer is quite frankly, more puzzles. There is no inherent reward for completing any puzzle in the game, except for 2 things.1. Access to more ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles.2. Self satsfaction that you solved that ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle.It's kind of hard to say... it's just weird. I feel like J Blow wanted to make this beautiful world as something just to enjoy while solving puzzles (as well as being a puzzle itself), but I feel like it actually works AGAINST the game, making the player think that this game isn't just about solving ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles, when it is.Again I think this game IS good, the puzzles and mechanics of said puzzles are some of the most intuitive and clever i've ever seen, the visuals are so enjoyable to look at and experience, it's genuinely a good game. But I feel people will get the wrong idea and become dissapointed when they discover that the game is nothing more than just that.A puzzle-game!			"

												It is easy to dismiss the game as simply a puzzle game with pretty scentery to move around in, but do not take it so lightly. The use of the enviroment to hide both puzzles and solutions is incredible, and occasionally pretty mind-bending. However, this also hurts the game. The puzzles can become not simply obtuse, but deliberatly frustrating - nausiating color-cycling and obscure audio cues being two particularly troublesome mechanics required.What makes the game truly remarkable however is the vast amount of material that the game does not require you to find or solve. The 'rewards' are minor: Brief quotations of a dubiously profound nature, and snippets of video of a similar nature. None of this ticks any boxes or unlocks any achievements. It is simply... there. It's a fascinating art project, if nothing else.And finally, and in all seriousness: Screw 'The Challenge'.			"

												Phenomenally satisfying. The description of the puzzles as ""mazes,"" while technically accurate, does not do nearly enough justice to the cleverness of the mechanics the game introduces. After leaving the initial short tutorial area, there's so much to explore that it can it first feel a little overwhelming - but there's no reason to rush, and there's no enforced order as far as which area you choose to tackle first. Pick a spot to focus on and search it top to bottom, chipping away at the map piece by piece in this manner, and you'll manage just fine.			"

												It should be stated up front that this is not a game for everyone. If you are into atmospheric games that's heavy on the puzzles without a lot of narrative, this is a game for you. Otherwise, I can't recommend it.That said, this game is gorgeous. Just looking at the screenshots and videos should tell you that though. Not only that, but you can tell great care was taken in putting the whole island together. The environment around the island changes drastically between two area, yet every transition feels natural. And just looking around, you can find many hidden images by standing in the right spot (like say an octopus under the water made out of sand and rocks or a face in the trunk of a tree). Everything seems to have a purpose in how it was placed.And then there are the puzzles. I spent a whopping 48 hours looking for, thinking on, and solving what the community believes to be every puzzle in the game. And let me tell you, these are hard. I don't know if I've ever played a game that pushed already taught mechanics to this degree of difficulty in such a fair manner. If anything new is dropped on you, there's a place to learn it.This game is all exploration. You have to explore to learn. You have to explore to solve. You have to explore to do anything. And I loved ever minute of it. (Well, except the swamp, but that's just me.)			"

												The Witness is a game of puzzles.  It's very pretty to look at and pleasant to listen to.  There's one kind of puzzle, but there are a good variety of takes on that puzzle.  It's open-ended enough that if you get stumped, you can often wander off to try something else.  If you're a completionist (as I am), then starting The Witness is either terrific or terrible, because there is a LOT to find and check off - over 600 total puzzles.  100% took me about 30-40hrs.  It's got that ambiguous, artsy, ""mysterious"" plot that is either compelling and thought-provoking or pretentious, depending on your perspective.			"

Not only that, but you can tell great care was taken in putting the whole island together. The environment around the island changes drastically between two area, yet every transition feels natural. And just looking around, you can find many hidden images by standing in the right spot (like say an octopus under the water made out of sand and rocks or a face in the trunk of a tree). Everything seems to have a purpose in how it was placed.And then there are the puzzles. I spent a whopping 48 hours looking for, thinking on, and solving what the community believes to be every puzzle in the game. And let me tell you, these are hard. I don't know if I've ever played a game that pushed already taught mechanics to this degree of difficulty in such a fair manner. If anything new is dropped on you, there's a place to learn it.This game is all exploration. You have to explore to learn. You have to explore to solve. You have to explore to do anything. And I loved ever minute of it. (Well, except the swamp, but that's just me.)			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. The art style and the island are beautiful. The puzzles are challenging and there are a lot of puzzles. However those puzzles can be at times really challenging and get rather frustrating. Some hints to the puzzle solutions are really obscure. Also the amount of puzzles is at the same time a disadvantage, it can get quite tedious and repetitive and at the end you feel a bit relieved that it's over. I know there are still some puzzles to be done like ""the challenge"", but I really can't be bothered anymore.Also some puzzles are really unpleasant to solve, i.e. the sound puzzles and the moving and colour changing puzzles, they even make you nauseated. It feels like they're just purely in there to annoy the player.The story, if you can call it that, is extremely pretentious. It's just a heap of nonsense and philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown together. Nothing gets explained, you never find out what happened to the island. Even the ""Lost"" tv series explained more and made more sense than this.It would also be a bit better to guide the player more naturally from area to area: from the starting area you sort of naturally go to the symmetry area, but after that you get overwhelmed and wander from place to place on the island not understanding any of the puzzles until you finally find one that makes sense.

												The Witness is a game of puzzles.  It's very pretty to look at and pleasant to listen to.  There's one kind of puzzle, but there are a good variety of takes on that puzzle.  It's open-ended enough that if you get stumped, you can often wander off to try something else.  If you're a completionist (as I am), then starting The Witness is either terrific or terrible, because there is a LOT to find and check off - over 600 total puzzles.  100% took me about 30-40hrs.  It's got that ambiguous, artsy, ""mysterious"" plot that is either compelling and thought-provoking or pretentious, depending on your perspective.			"

Personally I enjoyed every moment and was amazed as to the level that the simple mechanics were taken, each new area had at least one ""eurka"" moment and the lack of hand-holding made the feeling of accomplishment all the more rewarding.

												You'll find criticisms of this game, and importantly, they are not wrong, from a certain point of view. Just like some of the puzzles in The Witness, the perspective you take with the game changes the kind of experience you'll have if you try it, and just like the puzzles, it can be difficult to both understand and appreciate the game as it is. Many of the design decisions they took with this game are not in line -- no pun intended -- with what most of us would consider ""modern game design."" It's an onion that is surprisingly difficult to pull the layers back on, with each new layer providing new and even more difficult challenges. There is no music in the game. The island you explore is ostensibly ""dead and lifeless."" Your reward for puzzle solving can seemingly be nothing, or -- if you're rewarded with some kind of change in the world itself -- seemingly useless in nature, one puzzle unceremoniously unlocking another. The puzzles themselves appear to be flat, mostly motionless panels that could be exist just as well in a book rather than a game. There are no direct hints in the game; it will not hold your hand through its toughest challenges. To an unwilling participant, the experience appears undirected -- go anywhere, do whatever, but what's the point of it all? Is there a point? This is all one perspective, but shift your approach and you'll find the image changes dramatically. Suddenly, and without warning, there is a consistant, logical sense for why the game has minimalistic sound design. You'll understand the ploy of the island, insofar as necessary, and realize that it is full of life in the strangest ways. You'll find reward around every corner -- and you'll find the game nearly literally speaking to you as you traverse its windy paths, opening up new areas, and finding its most hidden secrets. The puzzles will cease to be flat, unengaging billboards on the wall, and literally pop out into the world, becoming multi-dimensional in ways you never expected. You'll find the game talking to you, helping you, and sometimes confusing you -- but either way, it speaks. The Witness is a game about learning how to learn. It doesn't pave the roads you walk with arrows, but it always provides a path to take to get where you want to be. Its puzzles are hard, but never unfair, and even when things are at their toughest the sense of accomplishment you'll find for learning and solving the challenges it provides is second to none. At its core, its a brilliant, meditative experience that provides a ""Just one more puzzle"" draw -- addictive and challenging, when you're willing to let yourself stop and think. In a lot of ways, it's like trying to communicate with someone who speaks a different language; appearing impossible, the more time you spend with it, the more you begin to understand its language, and the more it can speak to you as both a player, helping you with its mechanics, but moreover, challenging the way you think about problem solving. There are other layers to the game as well. Some philosophical, some visual, maybe even layers you won't care for. It's by no means a perfect game, but what it is is something unique and wonderful and challenging. I cannot recommend this game if you don't like other puzzle games -- but if games like The Talos Principle, Portal, and Myst are your bag, and you're willing to have a game that really pushes back on you, challenging to unwind its complexities, not only is the game worth its asking price, but you may begin to think its one of the greatest puzzle games ever.Or you may completely hate it. In some ways, it's kind of up to you.			"

												It is easy to dismiss the game as simply a puzzle game with pretty scentery to move around in, but do not take it so lightly. The use of the enviroment to hide both puzzles and solutions is incredible, and occasionally pretty mind-bending. However, this also hurts the game. The puzzles can become not simply obtuse, but deliberatly frustrating - nausiating color-cycling and obscure audio cues being two particularly troublesome mechanics required.What makes the game truly remarkable however is the vast amount of material that the game does not require you to find or solve. The 'rewards' are minor: Brief quotations of a dubiously profound nature, and snippets of video of a similar nature. None of this ticks any boxes or unlocks any achievements. It is simply... there. It's a fascinating art project, if nothing else.And finally, and in all seriousness: Screw 'The Challenge'.			"

												Phenomenally satisfying. The description of the puzzles as ""mazes,"" while technically accurate, does not do nearly enough justice to the cleverness of the mechanics the game introduces. After leaving the initial short tutorial area, there's so much to explore that it can it first feel a little overwhelming - but there's no reason to rush, and there's no enforced order as far as which area you choose to tackle first. Pick a spot to focus on and search it top to bottom, chipping away at the map piece by piece in this manner, and you'll manage just fine.			"

												If you like puzzles, than this is a brilliant game. You keep discovering new possibilities for a long time. Do not expect a very interactive world though. The world is beautifull and it is full of beautifull vistas, but there is almost no change. There are only the puzzles. And looking for these puzzles, solving them is fun. Especially when you have been brooding for a couple of days on that one difficult puzzle, it is very satisfying to find the solution just in front of you.This game has had a broadening effect on my solving ability. The only real drawback is the end, which I found a bit disapointing, especially when I thought that all my solutions had been erased. Luckily there is an autosave system, which let me go back to that moment just before I finished the game.All in all a very relaxed and challenging game like no other.			"

												I am not seeing it. This game feels like a chore to play. Moving around the island is slow. I found a boat and it just takes forever to move from one point to the next. Then you find a puzzle which you cannot reasonably solve yet, so you have to take the slow ride back again.At some point I was doing well and then I was stuck. I didn't get it. Turns out the game is not color blind friendly. I figured out what I needed to do, but I couldn't do it. So I had to look up the solution.At another point I got stuck and looked up hints online. Not the solution, just a hint. Then I saw it. I didn't think ""That was clever. I should have found that"". No, all I thought was ""That was a stupid waste of time.""The game wants you to look around constantly, but I never really know what I am looking for. Sure, it is a pretty game, but so, so incredibly dull.			"

												This game is a challenge, and it is a good challenge.  You need to explore, and be patient.  You need to think hard, and remember what you've learned in detail.  GameplayThe Witness doesn't explain anything, so you have to figure out everything on your own.  The Witness is filled with tutorials which explain game mechanics, but you have to discover them.  They don't look any different than any other puzzle.Between the 30 minute and the 2 hour mark, The Witness can be confusing and overwhelming, but it is supposed to be this way.  If you push on, and figure out what you can about the way the world works, you are in for a great time.ArtThe Witness has a beautiful 'brush stroke' art style.  The textures are simplistic, but The Witness compensates with overwhelming color, beautiful environments, and detailed props.  The foliage on plants is some of the prettiest I've ever seen.Music/SoundThere is no music, which at first was alarming.  However, the lack of music actually highlights the incredible sound this game delivers.  The sound design is striking, and powerful.  Doors make deep, resonant clanging noises as they open.  Machines whine and groan as they operate.  There is no shortage of footstep sounds, and each surface you walk on feels unique, and immersive.StoryWhen it comes to writing, and voice acting, The Witness is somewhat similar to The Talos Principle.  It is somewhat abstract and metaphorical.  It 'speaks at a distance'. "

												""The Witness"" is a visually astonishing game, not a single fault found with the graphics but as many people know its not just the graphics makes a good game right? As for the Audio, well, there really isn't much to talk about here as there isn't much to listen to in the game as far as I know, there are Audio Logs that can be found scattered around the land but even then they don't tell you much if anything about the backstory of this game. The one positive about the Audio is Very Meaty footsteps that are needed to solve some puzzles.Now for the Puzzles, The puzzles are original and can get very complex very fast with new mechanics around every corner and very little to no help solving them, however they are possible after a few failed attempts. What this game does with perspective is extremely clever and it can really make you think outside the box, yet, that said some of the ""Forced Perspective"" puzzles can be quite tricky getting into the right place to solve but not impossible.As for the mood of the game it is calming and stress free mostly however, it can make you feel like a complete idiot by not seeing the larger picture but then again it does feel very satifying once you have cracked a puzzle that has been fustrating you for quite a while.Now for what some people look for in these types of games, The Story. I can't comment on the story just yet as im only 5 hours in but from that 5 hours of solving puzzles and wandering the land I can say that there isn't much of a story, You wake up in a tunnel and thats pretty much all your told, The audio logs are just Quotes from famous people and tell very little of the story and I haven't found anything that tells me what happened to the ""Others"" or what will happen once I solve the ""Final"" puzzle.TL:DR  Amazing Graphics, Very fun and original puzles, Not much of a story, Not much audio but still pretty good. I recommend this game to anybody that wants a good puzzle to solve.			"

												Such a brilliant game concept - simple character control and draw-board puzzles, but still so versatile.Although puzzles solutions are linked to line drawing and combination of shapes/colors, such a simple concept still makes every area on Island unique.It has fair learning curve, and if you get stuck you ""only"" need to visit\explore some other part of the Island, which has some hints\clues that can help you to understand the first thing you got stuck with.One or two times I had to seek for Internet help (I was determined not to, but those bloody tetris and E-marks). There where many moments when I was tempted to quit (and search for help), but then when I came back to game again (rest my thought) things where clear as day, and that was such a rewarding moment - to solve something on you own.The Witness is also symbolic game concept that can be related to any scientific process of discovering new things, where someone is using previously established concepts of Known to explain\solve the UnknownI'm so satisfied with value of this game and I can recommend it to anyone with a bit of interest in puzzle solving and exploration.Developers love and commitment are so evident throughout the game.This is the first game that I played with my wife (she isn't a gamer), which concludes on how well constructed game concept The Witness is:)			"

												So, I guess words fail me on this one. This game isn't fun... it's necessary. Although technically the puzzles progressively become harder, that's not the point. They progressively become more profound, and I'm surprised at how inspiring and thought provoking this puzzle game is. Excellently selected quotes from famous thinkers are sprinkled sparingly throughout the game to draw attention to the fact that there is art to be discovered in the puzzles - brilliance to be uncovered within yourself.Unlike games like ""the graveyard,"" which try way too hard to appear like art within the form of a game, this game truly is art. It is effortless, subtle. The game barely notices that you're there. You get exactly one instruction the whole time, and that's just the button to press to interact. The rest of the game is experienced through your own personal pursuit.If you desire introspection, if you want a slow and satisfying stroll through your mind, if every other game is starting to blur into one mess of combat and acquisition... the Witness is for you.

												I was expecting Myst or at least something like Myst which would expose a story as puzzles are completed. The Witness is not that. Instead it's back to back maze puzzles that never really seem to do anything. Solve a bunch of puzzles to open something, then solve another puzzle that looks like it's going to do something, then nothing. I've only been playing for around 5 hours now and this has happened to me several times. Even when I do complete puzzles there's been no big payoff so far which has killed my interest.There's also no plot and if you're expecting something to keep you going beyond another puzzle which may or may not do something it's not here. I thought I might have been missing something so I started reading spoiler reviews and there's no plot here. There's no clues, no memories, nothing, just maze puzzles. I'd go as far as to call the description for this game deceptive based on what I've seen so far.I want my $40 back.			"

This game requires a pen/(graph) paper.  There are certain puzzles that you will possibly not ever be able to complete.The bad - the mystery surrounding the game outside the puzzles is not my cup of tea and I feel it breaks immersion instead of enhancing it.

												The Witness sets out to be a modern day Myst. In that regards it had succeeded. Set on a mysterious island, you wander around completing puzzles. Rather impressively, these puzzles are all variants on the same mechanic, drawing lines on a grid. Don't let that simplicity fool you, these are hard puzzles that will leave you cursing the name of Johnathon Blow, the creator of The Witness.Like a teacher, Johnathon Blow will gently lead you through the mechanics so that you learn not just to solve the puzzles, but to understand them. A key difference in that brute forcing through them or randomly guessing will be punished. With many areas to explore, each with its own unique take on the line drawing mechanics, it always felt like that even if I was stuck somewhere, I could go somewhere else and bang my head against a different wall. All I can say is, change your perspective and be observant of the environment.One could even suggest that the island is like a metroidvania game, where the “item” is the knowledge you learn from each of the regions. This game is a chain of moments where you go “Aha!” and suddenly understand the key. While you might not be physically lifting that item above your head to the world like in Zelda, you are essentially doing that mentally. I am often reminded of Fez when playing this game. Although Fez has that one moment where suddenly you see the code of the matrix, this game has a lot more (although slightly lesser) moments. Then again, it can still surprise you and make you open your eyes to wonder just what were you missing this whole time and what else might be hiding in plain sight.Despite really enjoying this game, I did find a few pieces to dislike. While I can understand the choice in there being no music in this game, I disagree with it completely. But this is something that can be easily fixed by throwing some relaxing music on the music player. There are also certain classes of puzzles which some people might have a really hard time with. The “story” of The Witness is also very subtle and out of the way. Indeed the ending you get is rather disappointing. But it is a testament to the quality of the game that I didn't mind this all that much, helped very much by some of puzzles in the final area. Indeed the journey is much better than the destination. Even if all you get is the first ending after 25 hours, it is still a brilliant game that is well worth the asking price. But if you wish to delve deep into the depths of the mystery of The Witness, it can still be worth your while.			"

												I am not seeing it. This game feels like a chore to play. Moving around the island is slow. I found a boat and it just takes forever to move from one point to the next. Then you find a puzzle which you cannot reasonably solve yet, so you have to take the slow ride back again.At some point I was doing well and then I was stuck. I didn't get it. Turns out the game is not color blind friendly. I figured out what I needed to do, but I couldn't do it. So I had to look up the solution.At another point I got stuck and looked up hints online. Not the solution, just a hint. Then I saw it. I didn't think ""That was clever. I should have found that"". No, all I thought was ""That was a stupid waste of time.""The game wants you to look around constantly, but I never really know what I am looking for. Sure, it is a pretty game, but so, so incredibly dull.			"

												It is easy to dismiss the game as simply a puzzle game with pretty scentery to move around in, but do not take it so lightly. The use of the enviroment to hide both puzzles and solutions is incredible, and occasionally pretty mind-bending. However, this also hurts the game. The puzzles can become not simply obtuse, but deliberatly frustrating - nausiating color-cycling and obscure audio cues being two particularly troublesome mechanics required.What makes the game truly remarkable however is the vast amount of material that the game does not require you to find or solve. The 'rewards' are minor: Brief quotations of a dubiously profound nature, and snippets of video of a similar nature. None of this ticks any boxes or unlocks any achievements. It is simply... there. It's a fascinating art project, if nothing else.And finally, and in all seriousness: Screw 'The Challenge'.			"

												If you like puzzles, than this is a brilliant game. You keep discovering new possibilities for a long time. Do not expect a very interactive world though. The world is beautifull and it is full of beautifull vistas, but there is almost no change. There are only the puzzles. And looking for these puzzles, solving them is fun. Especially when you have been brooding for a couple of days on that one difficult puzzle, it is very satisfying to find the solution just in front of you.This game has had a broadening effect on my solving ability. The only real drawback is the end, which I found a bit disapointing, especially when I thought that all my solutions had been erased. Luckily there is an autosave system, which let me go back to that moment just before I finished the game.All in all a very relaxed and challenging game like no other.			"

												I'm seeing reviews left and right of people dissapointed with this game purely because it isn't Myst/and or isn't story heavy. Nobody should go into it expecting Myst. It is it's own thing entirely, and that's a great thing. If you're on the fence about this game, don't set yourself up for any expectations. All you need to know is that if you like exploring interesting, well crafted worlds and puzzle solving, then you WILL enjoy this. This game was in development for 7 years and it definitely shows. The game developer really put a lot of love and effort into this. The world is beautiful, mysterious, and fun to explore. Each time you solve a set of puzzles, open up new areas, and interact with the world you feel more and more like you're uncovering some great mystery. The gameplay really nails the essence of what an ""adventure"" game should be all about. There's no linearity here. You are literally on an adventure while playing, constantly discovering things by yourself. The lack of in your face tutorials and story adds to this adventure feeling and will give you huge satisfaction with each bit of progress you make. The game has intuitivity down to a science.I consider myself a pretty picky gamer, and I will lose interest quickly if I feel a game isn't worth my time, but 10 hours into this thing I only find myself more and more excited that I might only be 1/4th of the way finishing it. Most game purchases I make will leave me feeling like it wasn't worth the money, but The Witness has me feeling for the first time in a while that I'm getting every penny's worth. If you're interested in this game, but feeling discouraged by the negative Steam reviews, don't take them seriously. This game is getting near perfect scores all over the place by major media reviews, and it definitely deserves the praise. The complaints that all you do is draw lines in this game are rediculous, don't take those seriously either. The puzzles vary dramatically in style and techniques required to solve them. The panel system you draw on is just a good vehicle to give a good sense of progression and variety of puzzles. Buy this thing. I feel like it's a Magnum Opus of video games, if there ever was one.

Great puzzler, but it's not for everybody.Great puzzles, convoluted philosophical ramblings that border on annoyance rather than profundity, and  probably the most anticlimactic ending in the history of gaming.  The island could have at least collapsed in on itself, but I think Jonathan Blow was really going for that  ""huh""  ending to stick it to gaming traditionalists .  That being said, the simple mechanics and devious puzzles capitivated me in a way that few games have, hence the 30 hours of play, which is surprising considering the lack of narrative.  It's definitely not for everybody, but it's a must play for puzzle lovers.			"

												This is a love-it-or-hate-it thing.Yes, the whole game is maze puzzles. Yes, there's barely any explicit narrative -- and the little bit that *is* there is buried very, very deep. I went 50 hours in The Witness before I felt I understood what the island was, or why I was there. And there's still some doubt there, frankly.And... none of that bothers me. I found the puzzles tremendously engaging. I felt like a genius when I solved them, and discovering the endless, clever twists on the mechanics was a constant delight. I was happy when my puzzle-solving prowess was, inevitably, rewarded with more puzzles to solve. That's what I wanted to do: it's just like an FPS game rewarding you with a bigger gun, and more things to shoot with it.So this all hinges on whether or not you personally enjoy the puzzle mechanics of The Witness. If you do, the game will absolutely fascinate you; if you don't, it'll seem an interminable slog. I don't think there's much middle ground there, and there's just no way to know until you try it.If $40 seems like too big a risk, there's no shame in waiting for a sale. For me, though, the game was worth every penny, and then some.			"

												Somewhere around 19-20 hours, I got the 'ending' for the game.  I completed much more than was necessary by then, but there are definitely things in the world that I haven't completed yet.  I'm not a fan of the ending.  But I'm still enjoying the game.  Overall, I'd say it's been pretty great.People who don't enjoy pure puzzles will likely not like this game.  It's not a game that rewards you for solving puzzles.  It's a game that throws puzzles at you and the reward is having solved them.  That said, puzzles do prevent you from progressing, so some might consider that a reward, but I'm betting more people don't get the feeling from solving the puzzles.  While I could see it taking another 80 hours to finish the rest of the game, it would be incredibly boring if that were the case.  If the rest of the game, as far as I can see, takes another 20 hours, I'd say that's as far as it could stretch and not turn tedious.  And it's quite possible that even that number is optimistic.I consider myself a rather good puzzle solver, and most puzzles didn't take more than 30 seconds to a minute, and many were less than that, even.  Last I checked, I was at like 400-500+ puzzles solved.			"

												I went into this game, not knowing anything except that it was some kind of puzzle game. After playing it in a couple of brief spurts throughout the week, I came to realize it's more than just puzzles.For me, The Witness is like a piece of artwork. It looks pretty on the first glance.... And then you start taking a closer look. You start seeing significance in each brush stroke. There's meaning in almost every single thing in the game. It seems like almost every single pebble or twist of the branches in a tree are designed *just right* in order to create this world. And indeed, it's difficult to miss this while playing the game.Because while the game may start out as just maze puzzles, it forces you to start looking at your surroundings differently once you free yourself from the walls of the starting area. You look at some of the puzzles in the town, with their bizarre shapes and seemingly impossible answers. Then you start to explore, and then you start to learn. What were simple mazes are now tracings, or they're representations of what you hear or what you see around you. It makes you stop and think each time you go around the next bend.And now it should be noted that there are no instructions on how to solve anything in The Witness. This is the part of puzzle games that Jonathan Blow seems to understand. The joy of solving a puzzle doesn't come just from reaching the end (while there certainly is a great amount of relief in that) the enjoyment comes from trying to figure out the solution.If you're in it for the puzzles, then you'll be in for a treat. For anyone else.. If you subscribe to the philospohy that games can be works of art, I would recommend it to you. I think the game is worth it simply to explore the whole island. I can't think of any other game that has been put together with SO MUCH attention to detail. I can't count how many times I stopped playing just to take in a view, be it a grand vista, a tight, winding path in a forest, or the curious shapes the shadows of a tree make upon a wall. Every little bit of this game has been honed to perfection.			"

												If this had come out last year, it would have hands down been the best game of 2015. What actually is it? Maze puzzles. Lots of them - 658 in all. Each puzzle is simple - draw a line from a circle to a semicircle end, while following the rules that govern the individual panels upon which the mazes appear. Some puzzles are designed to challenge you, while some exist only to teach you a certain concept that will be used to solve more difficult puzzles in the future.There are no tutorials in any part of this game. There isn't even guidance to any of the rules that puzzle components follow. If you come across a panel maze involving stars, an L shaped Tetris piece and three different coloured squares, there is nothing wrong with leaving the puzzle and returning later. For almost all puzzle components, there is a sequence of learning puzzles involving that component only, for you to teach yourself the rules that apply to puzzles including it. And this is where the true beauty of the game lies. Seeing a complex array of never seen before shapes and colours, and knowing that one day you will be able to solve it with relative ease has something of a charm to it, which is very rewarding once it is followed through.The game is nice and long - at about 25-30 hours to reach the ending and 40-50 to get 100%. There is no story, characters, objectives, events or even music; it's just you and an island of beautiful areas filled with satisfying puzzles. The environment itself is a work of art - more than just a walkway between puzzles. The visual appearance of the island feels ALIVE, seemingly inspired by painters such as Signac and Seurat, and is truly breath-taking. Although there is no story, certain parts of the game contain narration, taken from the writings of philosophers and scientists through history, providing interesting exposition to an otherwise cold atmosphere. These writings provoke thought into areas such as religion, scientific theory, human behaviour and belief.The entry price is a point of discussion, but personally I am unreservedly satisfied with my enjoyment of The Witness. It should appeal to those who enjoyed the Portal series and especially fans of The Talos Principle.The whole game feels thoroughly thought out throughout. Wow.			"

												Epiphany accompanies the most seductive of illusions. -3 CorinthiansA very purified puzzle adventure game. Minimal narrative. You explore a lovely island in a free-roaming manner, and engage with deceptively simple maze puzzles. That's the one basic method of interaction with which to unlock doors, operate mechanisms, and otherwise make progress. Connections are made on multiple levels.If you get frustrated, I recommend perseverence. Take a break and come back later.			"

												Decent relaxing puzzle game for the first 10-15 hours with no issues at all, no stuckage no performance issues, no weird problems. Smooth sailing. Then when you start getting to the ""endgame"" the game is far more frustrating/anger inducing than relaxing like the original part of the game. Reason being is the solutions for things become so obscure and meaningless frustration. Not to mention having to repeat previous solved puzzles when you screw up the following one. Why? Then when you're in the final area flashing lights, colors, and spinning objects meet you and I wanted to throw up because it was so bad. By this point I was wondering, what were the developers thinking? You have a really good start of the game that was relaxing and quite challenging at times but then ruin it with this terrible ending. It's no longer about solving the puzzle in front of you, it's thinking about what redicioulus frustrating thing did the developer come up with to try and make this seem ""challenging"" but couldn't think of anything so was like, f the player, lets have them solve it while the puzzle spins at 1000 rotations a second.Beating the game was truly the best part(feel the sarcasm), you get into the elevator , start moving around then the game closes on its own, no errors, no warnings, no cutscenes, nothing. You get back in and you start over. Gee, thx devs what a great ending.Overall decent game especially the exploration part and early game but just completely ruined by the end game. Because of the poor end game I'll not recommend(especially not at $40, $10-15 max). If you do get it, enjoy the first 10 hours but once you start getting frustrated realize its going to get a lot worse.			"

												It's really tough. But pretty fun too, if you like a good challenge. All maze puzzles, but very inspired and creative at times. You'll be tasked to follow a certain set of rules then five puzzles later those rules will be flipped on their head. Then five puzzles after that you'll be using the rules with new rules and it'll be a lot to handle, but you'll overcome and you'll feel great about yourself and your superior genius. Then once you best those puzzles you'll step a few feet and find puzzles you've never seen before and have no idea how to handle. You may or may not cry.I chose not to cry.For real.			"

												The Witness is a beautiful game with a ton of ""Ah-HA!"" moments that well justify the purchase price. Some of the heavy-handed philosphy is actually quite meaningful and deep.My favorite moments were walking around and seeing imagry pop-up out of the shadows and from seemingly normal shapes. However, the biggest thing holding the Witness back is the sheer volume of head-up-their-own♥♥♥♥♥puzzles that do not add the gameplay as much as derail it.Puzzles should be progressively challenging but still be able to be overcome without the help of guides. When you have a variety of styles of puzzle it's easier to spread out the challenge but when every ♥♥♥♥ing one is a sliding line puzzle at a certian timeline it just feels like they padded the game.  I hate to admit I was so frustrated I resorted to using guides because I don't have 40 hours to spend decoding a 2 minute sound loop to ♥♥♥♥ing solve one sliding line puzzle.  I do not see how the developers thought ANYONE could beat this solo. It can be completely obtuse.  There is one puzzle that takes an hour of sitting around getting lectured.  No joke. All that being said, the game is clever for the most part, well thought out and enjoyable. Shame a few bad puzzles spoil the fun. I do recommend it for the initial experience of wonder and awe that I wish carried through the entire game.			"

I hope that in the future JBLOW (that's his nickname) does some type of talk about developing this game because I'd love to listen and I'm sure others in the development community would as well.While I don't think we all buy 600$ monitors, I think you should JBLOW.10/10 would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at squares again.Buy it.

The Witness takes a simple concept, that being mazes, and gradually introduces more and more depths, twists and mechanics along the way. There are over 600 different puzzles to be solved here and trust me, later on in the game they'll take you a while to figure out.

												I bought The Witness yesterday, and I've completed 249 of the game's puzzles in approximately 7.5 hours. There are still quite a few areas I haven't unlocked, and a few puzzles that I'm completely baffled by, but generally speaking, the game gives you enough freedom to keep discovering new areas and learning about different game mechanics in a way that allows you to progress continuously. There are several areas which I've finished completely, which taught some of the simpler mechanics that are built on in later puzzles.I want to give a little context on the way you learn about puzzle elements in this game, because I've seen some misconceptions in other reviews. The simplest puzzles are just moving a dot to connect a line from A to B, but quickly the game will start to introduce different symbols into the puzzles, each of which has a function and dictates something about the way you need to solve the puzzle.This is the important part: There is a tutorial area for each puzzle element that holds your hand through learning how it works.If you come across a puzzle that seems way too hard for you, then it probably is. The game is not encouraging you to try to guess the answer and get really frustrated. It's giving you a sign that you haven't learned the right tools to solve it yet, and you should be looking somewhere else. Every puzzle element, from black and white squares, to spiky dots, to a little tri-force looking thing that changes how different puzzle regions act, to things that look like Tetris blocks, every one of these elements is explained in a series of very basic puzzles (starting with just one or two squares as opposed to the usual 5x5 grid) that explains the mechanic. The rules, once you learn them, do not change. They are not arbitrary. They work the same way every time. There is a lot of challenge in finding a solution that fits all the conditions imposed by the different puzzle elements, but there is no guesswork.It's unfortunate to see a lot of reviewers quitting after an hour and a half of playtime because they got really frustrated with something they didn't understand and want a refund for the game. My own feeling is that the game does a really good job of slowly introducing you to new elements, as long as you just walk around and look for simpler puzzles before going straight to trying the most complicated-looking thing you can find. The game even turns off the puzzle panels if you try to brute-force an answer to a puzzle you can't solve yet--- take the hint.A few other things. The graphics are beautiful, with a very colorful, almost cel-shaded style. The different biomes of the island are each distinct and offer an impressive diversity of scenery, with each location having a different mood, and often with puzzle mechanics that relate loosely to the area (one region, overlooking a wide bay of calm water, teaches puzzles about reflection). The sound is minimal but effective; there are a few puzzles that actually require sound to complete, and because the rest of the soundtrack is relatively sparse, the auditory clues jumped out at me quickly. The one place where I think the game falters is in story, in that there really isn't one, even (at least as far as I've gotten) to be pieced together from the audio recordings and videos that can be found around the island. Myst or Riven this is not--- the game has a lot of atmosphere, but it doesn't have a narrative. As a fan of games with strong stories and generally of fiction with detailed world-building, it does seem like a little bit of a missed opportunity. But overall, I've really enjoyed my time with the game so far, and I'm looking forward to playing more.I'd rate this game an 8/10.			"

												The Witness sets out to be a modern day Myst. In that regards it had succeeded. Set on a mysterious island, you wander around completing puzzles. Rather impressively, these puzzles are all variants on the same mechanic, drawing lines on a grid. Don't let that simplicity fool you, these are hard puzzles that will leave you cursing the name of Johnathon Blow, the creator of The Witness.Like a teacher, Johnathon Blow will gently lead you through the mechanics so that you learn not just to solve the puzzles, but to understand them. A key difference in that brute forcing through them or randomly guessing will be punished. With many areas to explore, each with its own unique take on the line drawing mechanics, it always felt like that even if I was stuck somewhere, I could go somewhere else and bang my head against a different wall. All I can say is, change your perspective and be observant of the environment.One could even suggest that the island is like a metroidvania game, where the “item” is the knowledge you learn from each of the regions. This game is a chain of moments where you go “Aha!” and suddenly understand the key. While you might not be physically lifting that item above your head to the world like in Zelda, you are essentially doing that mentally. I am often reminded of Fez when playing this game. Although Fez has that one moment where suddenly you see the code of the matrix, this game has a lot more (although slightly lesser) moments. Then again, it can still surprise you and make you open your eyes to wonder just what were you missing this whole time and what else might be hiding in plain sight.Despite really enjoying this game, I did find a few pieces to dislike. While I can understand the choice in there being no music in this game, I disagree with it completely. But this is something that can be easily fixed by throwing some relaxing music on the music player. There are also certain classes of puzzles which some people might have a really hard time with. The “story” of The Witness is also very subtle and out of the way. Indeed the ending you get is rather disappointing. But it is a testament to the quality of the game that I didn't mind this all that much, helped very much by some of puzzles in the final area. Indeed the journey is much better than the destination. Even if all you get is the first ending after 25 hours, it is still a brilliant game that is well worth the asking price. But if you wish to delve deep into the depths of the mystery of The Witness, it can still be worth your while.			"

Probably just a personal preference thing, but I would have loved to have more audio elements in the puzzles, and much less color-masked stuff. - In the end game section, it seems like the developer is literally just trying to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, or give me an ****-ing seizure. Srsly, man, wtf?All in all, it has earned a place in my all-time favorites list. ""But the only puzzles in the entire game are 'draw a line from one point to another'."" ... Oh geez. What a narrow-minded, shallow interpretation. A great puzzle games doesn't throw fifty different concepts at you. It takes one simple concept and exhausts it completely. Just when I thought they couldn't possibly have more ways to keep the same concept fresh, they flip you upside down. It's awesome. This game let's you unravel it bit by bit, letting you feel challenged and intelligent without overwhelming you. And you do it at whatever pace you choose.  "

												I was expecting Myst or at least something like Myst which would expose a story as puzzles are completed. The Witness is not that. Instead it's back to back maze puzzles that never really seem to do anything. Solve a bunch of puzzles to open something, then solve another puzzle that looks like it's going to do something, then nothing. I've only been playing for around 5 hours now and this has happened to me several times. Even when I do complete puzzles there's been no big payoff so far which has killed my interest.There's also no plot and if you're expecting something to keep you going beyond another puzzle which may or may not do something it's not here. I thought I might have been missing something so I started reading spoiler reviews and there's no plot here. There's no clues, no memories, nothing, just maze puzzles. I'd go as far as to call the description for this game deceptive based on what I've seen so far.I want my $40 back.			"

												   Beautiful. A game of exploration and wonder, wherein thinking is the story. Your mind is both the tool and subject of this masterpiece. From simple perspective to complexe geometry, this game will challenge you far beyond your wits end and yet call you back all the same. Not because of the challenge, but because you don't know how the puzzle works. And that is the key to this game. It is not a game of solving puzzles. It is a game of understanding puzzles. Some of which can be painfully hard to decipher.   And is this game for everyone? Of course not! This is a game for thinkers. For the curious and the explorative. For those dedicated to the art of understanding. And while this game is far from being for everyone, I would say that all should try it. You might find that you are smarter than you think. And all the while you can enjoy a beautifuly crafted landscape full of all kinds of structures and hidden images. From puzzles placed before your very eyes to ones hidden withing the word itself, this game has enough to keep you going for quite some time.   So explore this world and look at everything from every angle, and in so doing, explore your ability to understand and bare witness to the power of your own mind.			"

												The Witness is a puzzle game and it is almost exclusively so. You will not find a story to speak of beyond the barest conceit. You will not find much music or action or RPG elements. There is nothing much to pull you through the game except the rather stunning scenery and your own sense of discovery. What you will find is a very compelling concept, stretched and explored in almost every conceivable way. It does not appear that way at first though. If you have do not have a little faith in the designer (by playing Braid for example), then you may be quick to dismiss it. It seems too simple. Too easy. But it builds upon itself over and over, folding inward and outward.By the end you will be swearing at Jonathan Blow. But again, that journey relies on you as a player. The game gives you everything you need, but never explicitly. You have to want to understand the underlying systems. Very often you will come across something unintelligible. Something you can’t solve yet because you don’t have the mental tools. You have to make note of it and come back later. I highly recommend taking notes. Pen and paper will be your best companions on this odd little island.This is a game that will change the way you look at the world and don’t mean that in some high-minded philosophical way, but in a very specific, rather funny way. That is something I don’t think I can say about any other game. For that alone, I think The Witness is worth playing.  "

												I give this game a thumbs up, but reluctantly so.  I think the idea behind the game is great and I would like to see more of the same.  90% of the puzzles were fantastic logic puzzles that challenges one sense of logic and critical thinking.  The artwork was also nice.The problem is that abpout 10% of the puzzles were just stupid.  They weren't logical, or critical thinking puzzles, they were stand in the right spot puzzles.  The reflection puzzles were fine as you could use logic to figure out where to stand, but some of the other puzzles were just random.  I was only able to solve those by pure permutation and looking up the answer online.  And those puzzles weren't even challenging.  If you know which arbitrary view is the right one, then you already have the answer, no thinking required.  You just have to view the puzzle from every angle and distance until something lines up.I want to get the answer by rational thought and logical pattern recognition, not by knowing where to arbitrarily stand.The other problem is that this game makes some of the puzzles hard by just assaulting your senses.  If you are color blind or, like me ,have bad hearing, then you are just screwed.  The puzzles would be simple if you could understand what you are seeing/hearing, but the game goes out of it's way to make it hard to view/hear the puzzles.  And I can only assume the puzzles at end game are designed to induce seizures and discriminate against the epeleptic.The sad part is that these crappy puzzles of arbitrary standing and sensory assaulting don't add anything to the game or make the challenge more rewarding.  It just makes it annoying, frustrating, painful, and forces one to look up the answer in order to finish.  I don't want to have to cheat to finish the game.To the author: You have a great game here.  It is fun, rewarding, enjoyable, and worth playing.  Just get your next game play tested by people and if somebody can't handle a puzzle due to hearing/sight/seizure problems then redesign it.  Even those who don't have bad hearing will thank you for it.			"

												I don't care what 2016 brings, this is likely my Game of the Year.At first I had zero interest in it, I could have glossed over it as just some puzzle game. It already had some hype at that point, but nothing about it particularly lept out at me. I then watched a friend show off the start of a new game, allowing me and a friend to solve the various puzzles on offer towards the beginning of the game.As soon as I arrived home I'd bought it and I made it my mission to clear through what I'd already seen, leaving only mysterious new locations and puzzles in my path. I've currently played 36 hours of this game, cleared a fair amount of it yet still there are things to solve and uncover.Whether you play through it on your own, with friends or a loved one... you're going to enjoy this game.

												For me The Witness is by far, the most provoking game in an intelectual scope that I have ever played. Not just by the puzzles, but by the subtle touch of Phylosophy and Scientific thinking. The game does not hold your hand and make things easy... Just like a scientist, you have to begin from scratch, find correlation between symbols and patters, test your hypothesis on what they mean, and keep making progress. Sometimes, you need to understand that you lack the specific knowledge to solve a puzzle. You need pursue that knowledge before trying, or you will be simply wasting your time.The Witness is not just about solving puzzles. It's about YOU. And when I say 'you', I don't mean you as the character of the game, but you as a person.I've never thought I would see things as profound as ""The Demon Haunted World"" on a game... This is the most important book of my life.Fragments of B. F. Skinner are also thought provoking and very well placed in the game. I'm not going to say more to not give any spoilers on this review, but that moment made me realize how brilliantly Jonathan Blow breaks the fourth wall in a way that is very rare and unique.I highly recommend The Witness.

												The Witness is a difficult game to review.This game seems to generate some very polarizing opinions and a common theme I see from people who dislike the game is that it seems they didn't really know what they were getting into.  Some expected a more narrative experience.  Some expected a more explicit instructions.  Some expected a more directed experience.  These are all fair points, but I think it's exceptionally important to define what kind of game The Witness is:The Witness is a Puzzle Game.  You solve puzzles.  If solving puzzles is not your jam, or if you need a overarching narrative to keep you interested, then this is not your the game for you.  If the idea of solving clever and complicated puzzles that tend to ask a lot out of the player makes you excited, then this is a game you will probably enjoy!I enjoyed The Witness immensely, but I knew what I was getting into:  A game about solving puzzles.

												You must ask yourself if this game is for you. It's not for everyone. There's no action, items, or enemies. The game is ponderous, challenging, and vague. Not everyone wants to spend over 25 hours solving puzzles, and thats ok. But if puzzle games are interesting to you, The Witness is certainly one of the best. To like this game, you must enjoy and be satisfied with learning new concepts and experiencing breakthrough moments in your understanding. If this sounds good, just buy the game, its fantastic. If its not enough, maybe skip it (or challenge yourself).This game is about puzzles, but it is also about learning, discovery and epistemology. In the end, it is about teaching you to solve its mazes while organically guiding you to moments of epiphany. While the game certainly takes itself seriously, I think that it deserves the attitude for how well it accomplishes its design goals. This game sticks to its morals and realizes them fully. The result is something beautifully unique that doesn't compromise if doing so would undermine its goals.It surprised me how versatile the maze puzzles are. The simple concept of drawing a line through a grid from the start to the finish is complicated by gaps in the grid and symbols whose meaning you must learn through sets of puzzles designed for that purpose. Eventually you are solving problems with multiple sets of symbols that must be satisfied simultaneously, speaking a new sort of visual language.Oh, and the visual are effing superb! Really, this game deserves to be played slowly, stop and look at all the pretty things (it may even be usefull...)			"

												This is a fantastically satisfying experience. The very moment that sold me on this game was the last of the apple tree puzzles. That showed me just how clever this game can be. However, as much as I love this game, I've began to have very frequent graphics driver crashes. The devs say they're working on it, however, and I hope they are able to fix it soon.Also note that many puzzle screens are out of reach or blank until you start solving the beginning of a ""chain"". There's obvious reasons for this, but it can still be disheartening to see some interesting puzzles behind a closed gate.It may start off slow and boring at first, but within the first two hours this game really kicks up in interest factor. It's a very nice feeling to realize what twist the puzzles have suddenly taken to ramp up their difficulty, as well as the solution to clever, out-of-the-box puzzles such as the aforementioned apple-tree puzzles, which are accessible within about 15-30 minutes of gameplay. Also, I thank the devs very much for adding a run button. Very smart choice!In short, I fell in love with this game, and hope to be able to play it again soon!			"

												I've spent over 40 hours playing this game, and I wish I could express how amazing it is. It's not a game for everyone. It's puzzle after puzzle and they get harder and harder. So hard, in fact, that you can spend a good 30 minutes trying to figure one of them out. But the puzzles are NEVER cheap, they are beyond clever, and as you get better and better, you start to realize what's going on. The game is trying to communicate with you, and it actually has a lot to say. Do not skip this game. If you get this game, and you're stuck at a puzzle, don't give up. Explore the world and come back to that puzzle later. Once you start to explore and begin to understand, you'll feel a strong attachment to the world, and you'll never want to leave.			"

												Alright, here's a spoiler free thing you need to know before buying the game: Good stuff:  - Amazing puzzle game. - You get exactly what you've heard in all official publications and reviews: it's a game about epiphany, and there will be epiphany. If you read more than this line about any of the puzzles, it's spoilers. - Beautiful world, I loved to wonder aimlessly through it and just enjoy the view. The Big Bad Stuff. There is no explicit story! People expected this. All story elements you hear are interesting, but disjointed. You don't have to agree with all of them, especially since sometimes they offer conflicting views. There's a lot of implicit storytelling in there (through architecture for example).Bottom line, the story is not the point of this game. There are cool story elements, but the story should NOT be the reason you get this.Other bad stuff: - Probably unplayable if you are colourblind. - Settings are very rudimentary. No control over keyboard layouts, game resolution... - No accessibility settings. Admittedly, Jon Blow recently tweeted that he's working on some accessibility features (mostly for motion sickness). - Spoilers for this game are worse than spoilers in general. The puzzles are designed to evoke specific feelings and experiences. Spoilers completely ruin those. - I really wish there was an ""Extras"" option in the menu. At minimum to replay all discovered audio logs.			"

If you're really having trouble, turn off the game and play another day. Keep at it, explore, be observant and aware. If you like puzzles, if you like exploring, if you can take it slow, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you prefer games with a faster pace, this isn't bad but it isn't for you.			"

												the amount of people on here who say there was no reward truly astounds me. not the game did not come out and give you some useless points or ranking or cutscene, but so what figuring out the puzzle was the reward. I have to say this is real show of lack of maturity this game gives you a more mature adult reward the joy in your work the puzzles were hard did you feel nothing when you figured them out. this game rewards you the same way that building a program or completing a work of art does a feeling of accomplishment. did those of you who say there was no reward do the puzzles yourself or did you look up the answer. i found this game after watching someone live stream the shadow puzzle and that was definitely the most hollow section for me.

												The Witness stands alone among recent releases as a pure puzzle game. As good puzzle games should do each element and mechanic is added in its simplest form and difficulty is achieved through iteration and mixing of different mechanics in logical, but sometimes tricky, ways. The closest thing to a text tutorial the game contains is the controls menu. While game options are sparse and the experience has some problems for some computer setups it receives reasonable support.The Witness is stunning and picturesque and its puzzles once mastered are deeply rewarding, and while some content in the form of audio and video logs leans towards nuage fare it is at the very least presented thoughtfully.

												The Witness is wonderful, meaning full of wonder, and awesome, meaning it elicits awe.I think this game could inspire a love for learning in a child.I'm only probably a tenth or so in to the game, but I've already gotten my money's worth. The island is opening up in layers of meaning, layers of understanding. The whole island is a series of allegories layered atop one another and beckoning the curious explorer.Blow's design objective -- to model epiphany -- requires inductive reasoning of the player. This game is entirely inductive reasoning. It's the most dense use of this rare mechanic that I've ever seen presented in a game.I heartily recommend this game as an excellent use of your time.			"

												While I agree that this game will not be for everyone, one thing that has impressed me has been the meticulous detail and care put into this game. As expressed by others this game will not hold your hand. So many people expect games to lead them by the nose and give them all the answers on a plate. You will not find that here. To say there is no tutorial is false. In fact, the way the tutorial content was designed is very well done.  This game issubtle and understated and much will likely be missed without repeated exploration. You will definitely be frustrated with the puzzles often. Edit: I originally wrote this before completing the game, as I didn't want to believe some of the negative reviews. I wanted to believe there was more to this game than puzzles upon puzzles to the point of almost ""player abuse."" The game seems to suggest there is some hidden meaning to be found. Howerver, after a $5 million dollar budget and 8 years of work from the developer, in the end this game sees players as a mere afterthought, as if a game can exist on the supposition that players don't matter. Bear this mind when buying this game. You may wan't to wait for it to go on sale as others have said.			"

												I enjoyed this game a great deal, but at certain times I found puzzle rules and basics were thrown out the door.  The sun  puzzle at the Quarry to get the ramp in the sawmill up totally disregarded the suns being in pairs and needing to separate them according to color.  Every sun puzzle up to that point followed the rules of suns being in pairs and different colored stars seperated.  But in that case ignored.  Took me forever till i solved it by accident.  Again inside the mountain they broke rules where the stars were not paired in the puzzle and the only solution was star to be paired with another cube.  This change the rules as you go approach taken in this game angered me a great deal.  It is why I can love and at times hate puzzle games.  However most times the game is faithful to its own rules for each puzzle type.   There is alot to explore and see.  Secret places that are hard to find.  I think this game is the first true successor of sorts to the Myst franchise.  It's definitely worth $40 dollars.			"

												Th Witness is a difficult game to talk about, but I am comfortable saying that it has been my favorite game this year and quite possibly my favorite game of all time (certainly in my top ten).Aside from ""I hate puzzle games"" and ""There is no plot"", most players who down vote this game do so because they lack whatever quality it is that would give them the big ""ah-ha"" moment. The Witness is just that: one big ah-ha moment. If something doesn't click for you and/or you get frustrated easily, The Witness may not be for you.For me, The Witness never went beyond your typical ""difficult"". It started easy, got harder, and challenged me to think outside of the box, but I never had to stop. I never really left an area stumped to return to it later. The ah-ha moment typically came between 10-15 minutes each time I was stuck. This created a VERY positive feedback loop for me as a player.But anyway, here are some recommendations if you want to give The Witness a chance:1) Play with a friend. I played with a fellow developer. Perhaps the fact that we are game designers helped, but if one of us got lost, the other person usually caught the solution right away. It was very seldom that we were both confused.2) Accept that not every area is required in order to complete the game. I have a very busy schedule and have yet to 100% the game. Only seven of eleven main areas are required (any seven) to view the game's ending. Many have complained that Blow did not work to accommodate the visually or hearing impaired. Puzzles like this are NOT required and he claims to have even worked hard to try to include a puzzle that was only accessible to the color-blind (sadly it didn't make the cut due to the large gamma differences across displays).3) Sleep on it. The ah-ha moment is what you're after. The puzzles are almost never any more difficult than the previous puzzles (to an extent). A fresh mind and a change of perspective can help.4) If all else fails, take it to paper. A lot of friends made paper models to work out some of the more difficult puzzles. I believe that my friend and I only had a sheet or two of paper notes, but I am assuming that we weren't the norm.Aside from all of that, the game is beautifully designed. Many, many memorable moments and puzzles. Great visual and audio design for a game that can seem so constrained by the overall plot/setting. A remarkable experience, in my opinion.My first Steam review and my first 10/10 in quite some time.			"

Big fan of puzzle games from Myst, Riven, Journey Man Project, 7th Guest all the way up to the new puzzlers: Talos, Portal, Kairo, Antichamber, etc.  This is top 10 adventure/puzzle games easy.Massive amount of content, 600+ puzzles, and I'm still trucking on with some puzzles left 80+ hours.As for the backlash, well........it's pretty clear that the new generation of non-puzzlers have arrived; this is to be a rude awakening - it's definitely as hard as some of the old school adventure/puzzle games without the pixel hunting. I plowed through the content with very few roadblocks although the extra puzzles will easily double the time of what is essentially a 40 hour full completion of the basic puzzles.  To the downvoters - you knew it wasn't Call of Duty.  Can't believe the flack this incredible game is getting.  Was the same with Dark Souls if I remember - harder gameplay = breakdowns.  And what is this need for a plot? Jesus.  I have yet to make any sense out of the story/plot - because there isn't any - you're trying too hard.  What's with the complaining about the puzzles? It's a puzzle game.  Hard to believe that getting stuck on a puzzle for longer than 10 minutes doesn't count as content any more.  I ran a dark souls boss for 5 hours until I nailed it.  Your weak!

It sort of has a calming effect while the puzzles fry your brain and frustrate you, kind of like sweet and sour although that may be a stretch.The puzzles are incredibly creative.

Weak!  Puzzle games aren't for the whiny or those who don't find puzzles entertaining - may want to stick with Uncharted, you filthy casual.  I kid. I kid.Most fun I""ve had in ages.  It's the ship door next. Gulp.			"

												I only recommend this game cause it's a very mind bending puzzle game. It doesn't seem like it at first but as soon as you get pass the first few, the difficulty just rises tremendously. I would say this is like the Dark Souls of puzzle games where the game doesn't tell you anything so you have to figure it out for yourself.Which leads to my biggest issue with this game... the lack of communication to tell you what to do! Now this can be very well argued since it can give the player the feeling of accomplishment since they figured it out by themselves so it makes you feel very smart. However in my case, I had absolutely no idea how to solve the first set of puzzles when it started to add more elements to them lol. I wouldn't have a problem if there was some type of tutorial for every new element in the game so I had an idea on how to solve. Maybe because I really suck at puzzle games in general but it became really REALLY frustrating for me that I ended up playing through the whole game with a guide lol.You can say I'm cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for using a guide through the whole game but I just couldn't handle the time and effort to put through this puzzle game since it kept on getting more intense that I wanted to be done with it. However I don't deny that this is a very beautiful and well crafted puzzle game. But if your like me that can't handle abstract objections that don't tell you what to do you will have a bad time.Rating: 6/10			"

												While I agree that this game will not be for everyone, one thing that has impressed me has been the meticulous detail and care put into this game. As expressed by others this game will not hold your hand. So many people expect games to lead them by the nose and give them all the answers on a plate. You will not find that here. To say there is no tutorial is false. In fact, the way the tutorial content was designed is very well done.  This game issubtle and understated and much will likely be missed without repeated exploration. You will definitely be frustrated with the puzzles often. Edit: I originally wrote this before completing the game, as I didn't want to believe some of the negative reviews. I wanted to believe there was more to this game than puzzles upon puzzles to the point of almost ""player abuse."" The game seems to suggest there is some hidden meaning to be found. Howerver, after a $5 million dollar budget and 8 years of work from the developer, in the end this game sees players as a mere afterthought, as if a game can exist on the supposition that players don't matter. Bear this mind when buying this game. You may wan't to wait for it to go on sale as others have said.			"

												I enjoyed this game a great deal, but at certain times I found puzzle rules and basics were thrown out the door.  The sun  puzzle at the Quarry to get the ramp in the sawmill up totally disregarded the suns being in pairs and needing to separate them according to color.  Every sun puzzle up to that point followed the rules of suns being in pairs and different colored stars seperated.  But in that case ignored.  Took me forever till i solved it by accident.  Again inside the mountain they broke rules where the stars were not paired in the puzzle and the only solution was star to be paired with another cube.  This change the rules as you go approach taken in this game angered me a great deal.  It is why I can love and at times hate puzzle games.  However most times the game is faithful to its own rules for each puzzle type.   There is alot to explore and see.  Secret places that are hard to find.  I think this game is the first true successor of sorts to the Myst franchise.  It's definitely worth $40 dollars.			"

												To preface this, I basically played The Witness for the puzzles. While it looks great that wasn't the reason why I played it. Same with any lore about the island or story (if there is one)I was able to ""finish"" all 11 zones (activated the laser) and access the end of the game but never got through that because I got sidetracked with other games and by now it's probably too late to go back to it, without replaying the game.Even though most of the puzzles are on panels, there are a lot of different types and I never got bored.Some puzzles were pretty easy. Sometimes I thought I knew a particular group of puzzles work, only to get stuck and having to completely re-think my approach. Some are just really challenging and it took me some time to get the answer.Overall, this game is pretty great and if you like puzzle games you should play it.			"

												You can pretty clearly tell Jonathan Blow spent 7 years developing this game. The has countless tiny details, almost as many as there are puzzles. The art is simple and beautiful. It sort of has a calming effect while the puzzles fry your brain and frustrate you, kind of like sweet and sour although that may be a stretch.The puzzles are incredibly creative. I've never been so immersed in a puzzle game before (it helps that it's in first person perspective). Buy this game if you want to punish your brain and you have a lot of spare time.			"

												This is a wonderfully well thought out and challenging puzzle game. 85/90% of it is excellent. My advice, once you have had your fill, and once you've unlocked the final area at the top of the game.... stop there. The final sections and end game are unfair and unsatisfying by comparason with bullsh*t ""broken"" puzzles. They will leave a bad taste in your mouth. Stop at the top and be satisfied, this is a good game otherwise.			"

												God, I hate this game.The puzzles are fine at first, but they soon start to wear on your intellect. This game doesn't polish your mind; it whittles it down, bit by bit, until all that's left is an urgent desire to feel again. So I took a break. When I returned, I found that I'd forgotten the rules for most of the puzzles.But I will defeat it.For in the moments where you can claim small victories over the enigmatic mass of agony that is The Witness, when you open that bamboo door and see the light stream into your eyes and take in the next vista, when you discover that underground cavern with a mysterious artifact you didn't know existed, when you forge a new path somewhere you didn't think possible, when the next laser shoots to the top of the mountain... Those moments make it all worth it.God, I love this game.			"

												I have always been a fan of unique adventure/puzzle games like Portal 2 and Myst, and now I can add a new favorite to that list.  The Witness is quite literally a view into the mind of its creator Johnathan Blow.  At the start, the game is a bit unnerving with how calm and still everything is, but it contrasts beautifullly with the gorgeous visuals and scereny island imagery.  The puzzles can be mind-bending and difficult, but never feel unfair or impossible.  The whole game is yours to explore and nothing is ever ""unlocked"" rather it is discovered.  Everyone may have a different experience playing the Witness, but personally, I thought it was engaging, satisfying, and a true wonder.  One word of warning to anyone interested in buying this game, do NOT watch any lets-plays or Twitch streams before you experience The Witness for yourself.  The game is designed to be experienced by yourself first and the awe-factor can be spoiled in a lets-play. I have few negatives to say but the one glaring issue I had was with one or two puzzles being exceptionally difficult with no reward for completion other than being able to tell yourself that you did it. I give this game a solid 10/10 for its visuals, gameplay experience, originality, and game design.			"

												1 hour played: I loved Braid and the way it forced you to think ""out of the box"". Rarely do I find games that give you intense moments where you actually start to smile when you finally figure the puzzle out without turning to google and youtube. The Witness is yet again one of these games. It's sort of like a zen version of Myst. It's hard to describe all the magic that this game has, but I seriously recommend to check it out if you yearn for something a bit different, challenging and inspiring. It's combination of Myst, Portal and Braid.2 hours played: Ok... Two words: Mind.... Blown.... So far I thought that I knew what this game was all about - finding panels and solving puzzles. But just a moment ago I suddenly, by accident realized that there was something else - an epiphany. And everything changed. And yet stayed the same.This game is the closest thing to zen koans I've ever run into.  Pure genius. Pure pure genius.4 hours played: I have to say that in addition to being genius, this game is also absolutely beautiful. It is a rare thing to run into a game that actually makes you calm as you play it. The scenery, the soundscape, the feeling and atmosphere. It is similar to walk and spend time in a japanese garden.			"

The puzzles are based on the same idea but are all vastly different, using the environment and whatnot. Some more challenging than others. It's like learning a language.

												[UPDATED - 4/20/17]The Witness is Jonathan Blow's long-awaited Myst-like puzzle/adventure game, set on beautiful and mysterious island.Pros: - Fantastic art direction- Exceedingly (and nearly endlessly) brilliant variations on the puzzle theme- Lots of secrets and hidden things- Room to think about what the game means, similar to Braid- Challenging but fair; rewards perception and thinking- That great feeling when you finally figure out the puzzle that has been stumping you for forever only to be stumped again by another one...theres lots of this here.- Rewards careful perception, analytical thinking, creative problem solving and perseverence- Fun to play with friends- Ultimately is a vehicle for thoughts about greater things outside the game itself, and does a decent job of this for those who lookNeutral observations:- No music for the most part- This game is not for everyone. If you dont like puzzles very much you wont like this game.Cons:- A very small number of puzzles I found to be too much of a challenge or too subtly explained, including a few which are non-optional- There are certain philosophical elements scattered in the game which obliquely craft the story, like Braid. Unfortunately the game's story is very difficult to piece together in a way that is more than a guess unless you access all of the hidden areas, which means it will be accessible only to the more hardcore players, or to those who look up solutions online. I believe this is by design, but I also believe it would have been better if some of the key details were more accessible.- Solving so many puzzles can be tiring after a while-----------Overall: One of the best games of 2016. Absolutely essential if you are into puzzle games. Worthwhile even if you're not. Get this.			"

												The Witness is different. Extremely different. The closest thing to it is probably The Talos Principle, or in a small sense Antichamber, but that's a stretch. The only reason I bring this up is because those are the only two other games I've bothered to review, because I've loved them so much. And same goes for the Witness.First, as every other review tells you, its a puzzle game with a philosophical flair. However, a significant portion of the challenges is just figuring out what the puzzles are themselves. I could go into depth as to how it does things differently, but I feel many of the other reviews have covered that. Instead, I want to focus on some of my key experiences playing the game, which hopefully will give everyone a fuller understanding as to the experience that is the Witness.Throughout the whole game, I could not stop feeling a sense of wonder. The artstyle, the lay of the land, everything was designed so you had to just stop and look around going ""whoa."" What's better is that there are so many little details that you don't notice on the first pass. Sometimes the second or third. But once you really start developing an understanding for the world, you start paying more and more attention. And when you do finally notice that little detail, you realize why you missed it the first time. Originally you didn't know what to expect, what mattered and what didn't, and what details even existed. This is what allows the game to have such depth; it's amazing world and level design.There were puzzles I didn't even realize were puzzles! This sounds annoying and frustrating, but it is actually wonderful design. It forces you to explore, to discover other types of puzzles in other areas, and building an understanding for the problems presented to you. Then, as you explore, you start thinking ""maybe I can apply this new technique to that puzzle I skipped way back when?"" BAM. Epiphany. Best feeling in the whole damn world.Building off of this, the exploration of the game is nonlinear. You do not have to work through areas in a predetermined order. It gives you total freedom. So I recommend not getting too stuck on areas, and instead just continue exploring and learning. Eventually you will have the knowledge to attack that one puzzle.This game is not easy. Even when you fully understand the puzzles presented to you, the challenge doesn't end there. It pushes you to actually use this new understanding in more and more complicated ways. Patience is truly a virtue in this game, but trust me, the rewards are worth it. In fact, I started writing some of the more difficult puzzles down to try and use logic to solve it. However, like all formal logic, you need some assumptions. Many times I made faulty assumptions. Eventually I'd realize it couldn't be solved, and I'd learn which assumption was false, and overall I'd learn more about the system. It's an amazing feeling.However, I think the best experience in the game for me is when I had ""beaten"" it. Instead of finishing the game, I chose not to. I thought about all the stuff I might have missed, or didn't fully understand. The actual process of exploration, discovery, and problem solving is just that rewarding.So, do I recommend this game? HELL YES. Do I think it's for everyone? HELL NO. Again, it's probably most similar to The Talos Principle or possibly Myst (never played it :( ). Hopefully this convinced someone on buying this game; if you have the patience, it is an experience you will never forget.Tips if you actually get the game:- Take a screenshot of the map as soon as you find it. It's helpful- Do not be afraid to scour the same places you were before and have ""completed""- As I said before, do not get bogged down by puzzles for too long, especially ones that you do not understand conceptually. Explore. You will most likely find something in your travels that will help you understand it.  - Take screenshots of puzzles or solutions if you feel it may be helpful later- Do not be afraid to write things down. Not at all necessary, but you might find it helpful as I did.- Open your mind. The overall experience is wonderful, but it easy to be bogged down by skepticism and impatience. Please, it is so much more enjoyable if you force yourself to be accepting and patient.			"

												This game is a masterpiece.  It takes the best elements of the puzzle/exploration genre (i.e. Myst, etc.) and completely eliminates the more frustrating elements of that genre.  For example, in Myst you could be stuck forever because you didn't realize some teeny-tiny pixel was a button that you needed to push.  The developers probably didn't even intend for that to be a hard puzzle, but you just didn't see it.  Well in The Witness every single puzzle is plainly displayed and very obvious.  Furthermore, the sequence of puzzles is obvious and the game does an incredible job of very fairly teaching you each rule you need to learn to solve each puzzle before later testing you on that knowledge.  This teaching was one of the more impressive elements of the game.  The end result is a type of puzzle where you could easily imagine the majority of them being in a straight puzzle game (no adventure or exploration, etc.) but that would be somewhat boring and The Witness has an excellent atmosphere of intrigue that makes you want to find out what is beyond the next gate.  The downside of this puzzle approach is that The Witness does not have the same immersive feeling as a game like Myst which had puzzles seamlessly integrated into the environment itself.  However, if that kind of immersive puzzle is something you love then The Witness actually has you covered there too!  I won't say anything that spoils the fun, but there is a whole set of puzzles that are not required to finish the game that do not show up on clearly marked panels...My recommendation to anyone who plays this game: DO NOT look up walkthroughs!  Seriously, you can figure it out.  If you're stuck on a puzzle just walk away and come back another day.  I can't count the number of times I was so close to giving up and looking up a walkthrough and when I came back the next day I was able to figure it out.  I'll admit I did use one hint and that was for one of the bird call puzzles.  But most of the fun of this game is in the moments of finally figuring out a hard puzzle by yourself.			"

												The Witness is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It's a challenging puzzle game, yet like the best puzzle games, it makes the player feel like a genius for solving its puzzles, and it was never frustrating.It's a masterpiece for how a single mechanic can still teach and feel rewarding after 40 hours. This mechanic, essentially drawing colored lines on a grid, is made constantly fresh by introducing new rules to the player for solving these puzzles. In fact, the biggest challenge is often simply figuring out what the rules for each puzzle element are. Often, careful observation of the environment is required, as visual and audio clues may guide you to a solution. The game takes place on a beautiful, deserted island. It's rich in color, and yours to explore, almost in its entirety, from the moment you start. What works so well about the puzzle solving is that when you get stuck, and you often will, you can simply go to another area and try new puzzles there. You can skip many of the puzzles and still complete the game. Exploring one part of the island sometimes reveals a way to solve another puzzle that you couldn't figure out. Sometimes, the quiet, contemplative nature of the island puts you in the right frame of mind to solve another puzzle.Perspective, finally, is another major feature of the game, and when I finally saw it clicking in the puzzle and in the world itself, I was amazed.I was worried that the story would rub me the wrong way, as the developer's previous game had quite a few pretentious story elements (and one very clever twist). Here, though, all the written or spoken story elements are more or less optional. There are hidden audio and visual clips to be found or unlocked. I never felt like there was some hidden meaning that was being kept from me; rather, they were all interesting moments that I was free to interpret as I choose. I did feel that there were one or two major themes of the game, but it's left up to the player's own interpretation.The Witness smoothly teaches its mechanics to the player, and without needing words it does this teaching in a way that makes it feel like a discovery that the player made, not something explicitly authored by the developer. Out hundreds of puzzles solved, only a couple felt unfair to me.I strongly recommend The Witness for the meditative calm  of its aesthetics and the feeling of quiet success that comes from its excellent puzzles.

The downside of this puzzle approach is that The Witness does not have the same immersive feeling as a game like Myst which had puzzles seamlessly integrated into the environment itself.  However, if that kind of immersive puzzle is something you love then The Witness actually has you covered there too!  I won't say anything that spoils the fun, but there is a whole set of puzzles that are not required to finish the game that do not show up on clearly marked panels...My recommendation to anyone who plays this game: DO NOT look up walkthroughs!  Seriously, you can figure it out.  If you're stuck on a puzzle just walk away and come back another day.  I can't count the number of times I was so close to giving up and looking up a walkthrough and when I came back the next day I was able to figure it out.  I'll admit I did use one hint and that was for one of the bird call puzzles.  But most of the fun of this game is in the moments of finally figuring out a hard puzzle by yourself.			"

												The Witness is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It's a challenging puzzle game, yet like the best puzzle games, it makes the player feel like a genius for solving its puzzles, and it was never frustrating.It's a masterpiece for how a single mechanic can still teach and feel rewarding after 40 hours. This mechanic, essentially drawing colored lines on a grid, is made constantly fresh by introducing new rules to the player for solving these puzzles. In fact, the biggest challenge is often simply figuring out what the rules for each puzzle element are. Often, careful observation of the environment is required, as visual and audio clues may guide you to a solution. The game takes place on a beautiful, deserted island. It's rich in color, and yours to explore, almost in its entirety, from the moment you start. What works so well about the puzzle solving is that when you get stuck, and you often will, you can simply go to another area and try new puzzles there. You can skip many of the puzzles and still complete the game. Exploring one part of the island sometimes reveals a way to solve another puzzle that you couldn't figure out. Sometimes, the quiet, contemplative nature of the island puts you in the right frame of mind to solve another puzzle.Perspective, finally, is another major feature of the game, and when I finally saw it clicking in the puzzle and in the world itself, I was amazed.I was worried that the story would rub me the wrong way, as the developer's previous game had quite a few pretentious story elements (and one very clever twist). Here, though, all the written or spoken story elements are more or less optional. There are hidden audio and visual clips to be found or unlocked. I never felt like there was some hidden meaning that was being kept from me; rather, they were all interesting moments that I was free to interpret as I choose. I did feel that there were one or two major themes of the game, but it's left up to the player's own interpretation.The Witness smoothly teaches its mechanics to the player, and without needing words it does this teaching in a way that makes it feel like a discovery that the player made, not something explicitly authored by the developer. Out hundreds of puzzles solved, only a couple felt unfair to me.I strongly recommend The Witness for the meditative calm  of its aesthetics and the feeling of quiet success that comes from its excellent puzzles.

												1 hour played: I loved Braid and the way it forced you to think ""out of the box"". Rarely do I find games that give you intense moments where you actually start to smile when you finally figure the puzzle out without turning to google and youtube. The Witness is yet again one of these games. It's sort of like a zen version of Myst. It's hard to describe all the magic that this game has, but I seriously recommend to check it out if you yearn for something a bit different, challenging and inspiring. It's combination of Myst, Portal and Braid.2 hours played: Ok... Two words: Mind.... Blown.... So far I thought that I knew what this game was all about - finding panels and solving puzzles. But just a moment ago I suddenly, by accident realized that there was something else - an epiphany. And everything changed. And yet stayed the same.This game is the closest thing to zen koans I've ever run into.  Pure genius. Pure pure genius.4 hours played: I have to say that in addition to being genius, this game is also absolutely beautiful. It is a rare thing to run into a game that actually makes you calm as you play it. The scenery, the soundscape, the feeling and atmosphere. It is similar to walk and spend time in a japanese garden.			"

There is meaning in everything even where you least expect it. I doubt anyone will ever find all of the secrets and easter eggs in this game.

												This game is a work of art that pushes the medium of games forward. It explores communication directly through game mechanics and the phenomenon of epipheny. It's incredibly fun, rewarding, challenging, and personal. The island feels like a crystalizartion of the incredible 7 year journey jonathan blow and his team went on to make this game. A manifestation of their collective internal states made into a virtual world you can inhabit. The sound design is the best I've ever encountered in any game, and the visuals are stunning.Playing this game is an enriching experience.			"

												Incredible amount of things to do and discover. I played 13 hours the day it released, and I still feel like the end isn't really in sight. And that's not to say that the puzzles get repetitive and mundane. On the contrary, the more I play, the more I am able to understand and engage with the more difficult puzzles, some of which are truly brilliant in design.However, be aware that MUCH of what you do in this game will be drawing lines in a grid interface. However, so much discovery and exploration happens outside of that interface, and much of that discovery unveils new puzzle mechanics, which let you progress further into the vast and mysterious island in The Witness. This game absolutely might not be for you if you can't get over the puzzle input mechanism. But if you want to be dropped in a world with endless places and puzzles to discover and solve, The Witness is the game for you.			"

												TL;DR: This is not the puzzle game you're looking for. It's not like 'Portal' or 'The Talos Principle'... it's more like 'Lyne'.Thing I hate in this game:- Invisible walls ... like really? What is this? Lego island?- You can't jump, you can't climb ... so this is an ""Open World"" game isn't it? - Lack of background music. ... Suffer in silence.- If you fail a puzzle you have to solve the previous one again too? Did I understand it right?- The game does not reward you with anything. ""Did you solve the cherry tree garden puzzle? Good here is a F*CKING PLATE OF APPLE SLICES YOU CAN'T EVEN EAT.- My PC met the recommended requirements, but it's stuttering like hell at some places.- The price ... like... seriously? What the f*ck? Better puzzle games cost much less.Things I love in this game:- The scenery is really nice. The Biome variations are kinda magical.I know you have the urge to purchase this game, but for the puzzle's sake... wait 'till it goes on an at least 75% sale...			"

												I liked this a lot! It looks great, I love the aesthetic, I quickly came to appreciate how intricately every inch of the island has been designed. This game is full of ""eureka!"" moments and made me feel like a genius, but then I also haven't really played any puzzle games outside of the Portal series and the original Myst.Onto caveats!There are two different end states, and neither are affected by finding all of the secrets, but the game seems to telegraph a reward for uncovering them all. There isn't actually any reason to dig deeper than the eleven main objectives unless you, too, are a crazy person. (That said, some of my highest highs definitely came from beating these optional objectives.)There's scattered recorded musings from philosophers, theologians, and scientists that I think mostly add to the experience, but most people find them grating.If you have color blindness or have hearing trouble: I'd guess roughly a fifth of the game requires you to distinguish between shades of red and green, and about a tenth also requires detecting shifts in pitch. There are guides that've been written to help you out with hints or outright solutions, but that's obviously not ideal. "

												TL;DR: In short, the game does not have many puzzles that require much thought. In most cases instead the game just makes the actual act of solving the puzzle difficult.If you're looking for a puzzle game that requires actual thought, get this instead: https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/pushy/id322110989Here's the point where i personally gave up:Ran into the sound puzzles. Puzzles where one has to draw lines at heights indicated by bird song. Doable. Then the game overlays cellphones, wood instruments and more birds. These were entirely impossible for me. Game provides no way to make them easier whatsoever, and has no compassion for people who aren't great of hearing.--- Some more rambly details:The game is basically a very beautiful, mostly static 3d landscape you walk around in. It might actually be kind of relaxing if that was the point, but the point of the game is puzzles.The game's puzzles are largely not ""solved"". There are a few exceptions, but for most puzzles you don't look at and think about them much. In fact, for many of them the solution is just to look around and trace the line as indicated  by shadows, reflections, bird chirps or similar. (If you're colorblind an entire section of puzzles will be impossible, as the game lies even to non-colorblind people.)That is, for many puzzles the ""puzzle"" part is in finding where in the surroundings the solution is hidden so you can enter it. Usually they're either not hidden at all, or hidden such that you need to work out how the reflections ingame work (i.e. not at all like in the real world).Then there is a number of *actual* puzzle that require pausing and thinking. Those are actually more annoying than the previous ones, because the *actual* puzzle in them is figuring out what the rules of the puzzle are. You're literally just reverse-engineering a black box. This would be fine if there were a lot of different things to try, maybe have the ability to rearrange the pieces on the board and see how that changes the solution. Instead however you have a fixed set of inputs to which you can add your solution and get a yes or no for whether it is right. Sadly often the inputs don't explain all the details of the rules however, so when the complexity steps up, you're just left guessing and hoping and eventually brute-forcing it.Some rule-based puzzles i still don't know what the rules are, even after having looked up the solutions, and i'm a programmer by trade.There's also no story. All you get is a bunch of mp3s of scientists of various ages telling you how science is actually religion.			"

They perfectly achieved what Braid did to side-scrollers.On the puzzle side, I enjoyed most of the sets, the wonderful swamp more than the digging site with the reflections, the shadows of twigs more than the interchangeable apple trees. I hated some, especially those that were so obvious, afterwards, and I loved those that became more and more complex and required more backtracking, like those in the Endgame.I would recommend it to anyone who liked Portal. Take your time to discover, and refrain from cheating (seriously! did it once, destroyed the experience...)			"

												The Witness is my current favorite game, and I want to tell everyone all about it. The only problem is, if I tell people about what makes it so great, it will ruin the best part about the game, which is experiencing it for one's self. Its one of those games that I wish I could go back and experience it again for the first time. Its definitely not for everyone, and that's fine. If you don't like semi-difficult puzzles, you probably won't like this game, but I encourage everyone to give it a try I also recommend that you go in blind, which I understand the irony of including in a review of the game. I've done everything there is to do in the game, as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few deep secrets that I missed, that will eventually be unearthed by those with more free time than myself. More secrets or not, I have absolutely enjoyed every bit of The Witness, and am completely satisfied with my experience.			"

												First of all, I highly recommend this game. It is bizarre and frustrating and incomprehensible at times, but I can't stop thinking about it. The puzzles can be very difficult, but the game does a good job of leading you up to more and more difficult concepts. One hint for new players--the island feels quite large, but is actually rather small and it's quick to run all the way across. There are many times when you will need to leave a sequence of puzzles unfinished in order to learn something new in another place; rather than cheating, just leave off where you are and try something different for a while.And finally: all panels are puzzles, but not all puzzles are in panels...Amazing game.

												The Witness is a beguiling game of deceptive simplicity. You'll see a lot of criticism aimed at it from people who have only scratched the surface of the game distiling the game down to ""just tracing line puzzles"". While it is true a large selection of the game are maze-like puzzles where you attempt to trace one unbroken line to the end without overlapping itself, the variations on this are vast and fascinating. Whie traversing this beautifully constructed digital island you unravel the various ruleset of these puzzles with non-verbal communication. This game has a lot more in common with the Cyan Worlds games (Myst, Riven, etc.) but instead of pushing an archaic, aging button to activate a portion of a puzzle like in Myst, The Witness unifies all contraptions into a unified puzzle language which serves to thematically tie all puzzles together.But the true beauty is in the story and narrative provided. You have to work hard in order to piece together the ""story"" of this place you find yourself in, but its a grand combination of philosophies from a myriad of schools of thought presented in a way that only video/computer games can provide. The story being told in The Witness isn't one of sci-fi mysticism, but instead the story presented wants you to meet it more than halfway. It wants to hear your own ideas and preceptions as much as it wants to present its own.This is also a hard game to talk about without giving away a lot of what makes it so special, and that discovery is a large part of its genius. So $39.99 is really a cheap ticket of entry for an experience that is priceless, but I also realize that the experience isn't for everyone but it was definitely an experience I enjoyed thoroughly.

												Honestly this game is fairly overrated.  The puzzles are all interesting enough but it has a pretty big problem with tutorializing.  Due to the open world nature, you can often stumble into puzzles that you have not been taught.  This can end in three ways: 1) you realize that you have not been taught this puzzle and leave. 2) You beat your head against it untill you give up, then eventually find the tutorial and come back. 3) you figure out the rule, then feel cheated when you evenutally find the intended tutorial.  In this way, while I like the game and recommend it fully to anyone who likes puzzlers, the Witness has a nasty habit of wasting your time.  Boats and platforms take forever to move.  This is a game that does not respect you or care about you.... but it's still good... great puzzles, interesting puzzle types, and a beautiful world.  My only advice: give up on puzzles early.			"

												Jonathan Blow showed his game dev prowess again by releasing 'The Witness' this year, proving one more time that he deserves the crown when it comes to puzzle games.The Witness is a complex first-person puzzle game where you roam around an island and discover its secrets. On the surface this is a game where you connect dots on monitors scattered around the island, but after a while of playing you realize that it is so much more than that.The controls are simple: You can walk around, interact with monitors and draw lines through mazes, that's it. You might think that just drawing lines through mazes is not enough for a 20-30hour game full of content, but believe me, it is.The attention to detail and love put into the environment (which is part of many puzzles!) is out of this world. The island is HUGE and with time you realize that every little detail could be a clue to a puzzle on the island.If you love putting your brain to work and enjoy being stuck for an hour at one single puzzle, then go ahead and buy this game. It combines simple puzzles with a gorgeous world full of discovery and makes you feel like a genius when solving a particularly hard puzzle.Personally, The Witness is my favorite game of 2016.			"

												Very beautiful graphics and soothing sound, excellent atmosphere and feeling.The difficulty of puzzles is next to impossible to evaluate because many are easy, some medium and few are hard. Some are even impossible or require unbelievable will to solve -- but for every person it is different. There may be a kind of probability but I was stuck on an extremely simple puzzle for a long time and then swept through many following puzzles without a hitch, and it was not a matter of comprehension. It is just a bit of luck on how you look at it and not necessarily a matter of comprehension, intelligence or other personal traits.You'll have to live with those ""dumb feeling"" moments if you want to enjoy the game.My advise is to play as far as you feel comfortable without spoilers but if you feel like you need it, don't think it is wrong to cheat and look solutions up on the 'net. Afterwards you'll feel guilty and like you've ruined the fun, so do this with caution. But sometimes I can tell you some very hard puzzles I was HAPPY to have them looked up, because I knew I could never do those. For example the ones where you have to pay attention to ""something"" (I don't want to spoil here) and then ""translate"" that ""something"" into the solution. Well, it happens that I simply can't perceive that ""something"" even if I know what it is, I have the solution and try hard. I simply don't ""perceive"" it that way so I'd never come up with that solution.Other times I solved puzzles without having a clue how, even hourse later and all, I still don't know how I did some. Maybe just luck?Then there are the citations from literature. They are interesting but they feel more like overshooting or wannabe genius. No denying that ""The Witness"" is a masterpiece that will be remembered for a very very long time. I value it a lot, it's one of the best games I've played in the last years. But, come on. Einstein and philosophers? It certainly is meant as a tribute to those luminaries, but this is still a game and a COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, not a piece of art.To be true art it must be something to put into a museum, teach in school or to release into the public domain for all humanity to enjoy for free. And neither of these is the case. This is still a commercial game, and as such the altruistic citations don't sound sincere enough to me.You want the real deal? Stop playing computer games and read an academic text about any topic (philosophy, art, social sciences or whatever) that you can download for free from any university. You'll get pretty soon the difference between this ""intellectual posing"" and the real thing.That said, I still recommend it over and over again. If you like puzzles, Myst or exploration games on solitary islands.. then this is the best you can get.Also, take some screenshots of beautiful sights and use them as desktop wallpapers! You'll be surprised how beautiful this game really looks.			"

												The Witness is a puzzle game with a minimal amount of story but an absolutely beautiful world to explore, with an excellent merging of the puzzles you solve and the environment you're in.It is unabashedly a puzzle game, and it has extremely well-crafted and insanely difficult puzzles, while still providing a natural learning progression without hand-holding and annoying tutorials. You start by solving easy puzzles, then harder, then harder still. The reward for solving puzzles is most often more puzzles, like the games Hexcells, Hook, or Snakebird. Occasionally you find audio logs that give philosophical perspective from famous thinkers like Einstein, Nicholas of Cusa or Heisenberg.But make no mistake about it - this is a puzzle game, and like the other games I listed, the reward for tackling a grueling puzzle is solving it. Some people will not like the lack of RPG Puzzle Experience Points™ or new and exciting guns with which to take down tougher puzzles, but it's not that kind of game.  The game is about taking in the surrounding and using it to solve puzzles.The puzzles themselves are brilliant. Even though they all take the same general form (You need to find a path through a maze) there is an ENORMOUS amount of variety. Furthermore they are brilliantly paced and the game does an excellent job of teaching you the rules non-verbally. You'll come up across two or three puzzles with a new symbol, think you understand it, but then the game will force you to deal with a puzzle that makes you tweak the way you thought it worked.  Regardless of what some detractors say, there is not a single puzzle in the game that 'breaks the rules'. It is perfectly consistent.Some real criticisms: The trailer promises a story about regaining your memory, but that is absolutely 100% not in the game. Some of the areas are incredibly unfriendly to people with disabilities like color-blindness or deafness. Some of the quick but tough puzzles turn off on wrong guesses (to stop people from bruteforcing them) and you need to resolve the previous puzzle (the solution remains on the panel, so it's not difficult) so that can be annoying.However these flaws are minor compared to the excellent puzzle crafting, the beauty of the island, and the mind-opening fusion of the two. This game is heartily recommended to people who like puzzle games.Small spoiler for people who ""don't get it"": If all you've done is walk from puzzle to puzzle, making guesses until you move on, and then finish the game without looking around, you're going to have a bad time. The environment MATTERS. Go to the mountain. Take a look down at the river. Open your eyes.			"

												I may not have played much, but I can still tell that this is quite the game. Very open and easy to be distracted. I still don't understand what I'm doing wrong in pretty much every puzzle. I do think there should be some sort of multiplayer in this. Something like a create your own puzzle/island and share it with the world to play. That would for sure convince people that this game is worth the $40			"

												One of the best puzzle games I've played.There are a lot of different puzzles, some of which will be hard for different players. However there is very little required ordering so it's best just to skip a puzzle you can't figure out. You're very likely to run across puzzles which you haven't yet been given a set of easier puzzles to learn mechanics. Additionally you can 'beat' the game while only completing ~40% (maybe less) of the puzzles. Though the game continues to be rewarding as you play further, in particular there's some great end game content which isn't accessable without a significantly higher completion rate.			"

												The Witness is an Incredible game for those wanting a challenging, intelligent puzzle game. The game leaves you alone to discover and explore the mysterious world at your own pace. It's like the Dark Souls of puzzle games.The attention to detail is incredible. Every direction and angle you look in the world is telling you a story. it's just amazing. That said, navigating the world can be a bit grating, but when all you want to do is explore the magical world, yet the limitations placed on the player character's movement can be frustrating.Once you accept those limitations, this game opens up and is full of the wonders of discovery that games in the 80s (and early 90s) had, before handholding became a trade practice. The Witness treats you like an adult and let's you learn things on your own, let's you fail, let's you choose where to go next.I love this game. Well done, Jon Blow and team.			"

I have made sure to have audio, as I heard there was audio puzzles, but I was shocked when I finally found one, and it wasn't obvious! I plan to try and 100% the game with no spoilers, but I know it will take a lot. 5 stars, 10/10, 100%, pick a rating system and I give it a perfect score!!!If you enjoy puzzles, indirect clues, and a lot of immersion, this game is for you!

												When I first started this game, I was underwhelmed.  A puzzle game where you walk around an island by yourself, solving the same type of line-puzzle over and over.  Yawn.  30 minutes in, I nearly refunded the game.Instead, I gave it another 30 minutes, and wow am I glad I did.  As you play, you begin to notice tiny details around the island.  Little easter eggs, things that make you smile.  Soon, you realize this isn't just a mere puzzle game with copy+pasted scenery between each panel.  You stop running from puzzle to puzzle, and actually look around.  And you're amazed at what you see.And that's just the first laser.I realize I'm being extremely vague; that's intentional.  I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone.  All I can say is:  If you're a fan of games like The Stanley Parable or Antichamber, games that blow your mind and defy categorization, you will enjoy this game.			"

												The Witness is truly a wonder of unified game design. Every aspect -- art, mechanics, audio, pacing, visual narrative, teaching -- is designed with regard to, and to work with, each of the others to lead the player toward the conclusions that drive the experience. It fully explores the mechanics involved, in ways that are simultaneously unexpected and completely natural.This is the single best puzzle game I've ever played; it's probably one of the best puzzle games ever made.

												Both a very good puzzle game and a beautiful world, a very nice,  artsy  and atmospheric walking simulator+puzzle game.Firstly, let me point out 2 major flaws, this game might come off as deaf friendly and colour-blind friendly, but it is not.A very large amount of the puzzles are colour based, and the game does not have a colour-blind mode.1 Section of the game requires your ears, but to be honest you can just look up a tutorial for those puzzles, only a very small percentage of the puzzles require your ears. So it shouldn't be that big of a problem.Now, let me get into the game, firstly, the quality of the actual puzzles.They are great. They are just the right amount of challenging and they keep you engaged, and at least for me personally they didn't bore me. But, if you pay no attention and just try to blast through it you will most likely have troubles, you are in some way or another told subtly how all the different puzzles wok, but if you do not pay attention to those tips you will be clueless.When you solve the more harder puzzles you get a good feeling, you feel smart, and rightfully so.The art style, the actual world is beautiful. If you enjoy looking at games like these for the art, the scenery and the atmospheric vibe, that might be the big selling point for you, forget the puzzles, get your screenshot button ready.If you're going to 100% this game without looking up guides you will net maybe 40-50 hours, and you will enjoy every second of it, when you're blasting through puzzles in one area you feel great and you're having fun, when you're stuck on a puzzle, learn to not be angry, learn to sit back and reflect on the scenery of the world while you try to figure it out.The game is extremely good.9/10, a must buy for any puzzle fanatic or walking simulator fanatic.But, let me say again, I am extremely disappointed that there is no colour blind mode for this game, that is absolutely ridiculous.

												I reviewed this really shortly after the game came out, but I feel differently about it now that it's had time to sink in, so I deleted it and am leaving this one instead.On the surface, this is a puzzle game. You explore an island while solving puzzles involving drawing lines on panels. Despite how repetitive it may sound, you can get a lot of enjoyment, surprise, and satisfaction out of this game just from that surface layer. There are some preachy sounding quotes you can find, and there isn't much of a story, but if you focus on the puzzles and you like puzzles, you'll like this game.However. The game goes deeper than that. If you really pay attention to everything you're doing, and pay attention to the environment, and really listen to what the quotes are saying in relation to the game's design rather than just dismissing them for sounding pretentious, it's like a whole other game. My first playthrough took about 14 hours to activate all the lasers and reach the ""minimum completion"" ending. Since then, I've probably put in three times as much time just going back and understanding the significance of random things in the game (the rest has been speedrunning mostly). You can solve all the puzzles multiple times and still notice new things in consecutive playthroughs. This game has layers, but they're subtle layers; the game gives back what you put into it. And I think that's what makes this game truly special.Anyway, back to surface level stuff: eventually you realize there is a story. Finding that is cool. And the ""Complete a certain challenge"" achievement is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Art and sound design are great, although there is no soundtrack, so the silence can make the game feel ""empty"" at times, depending on your take of it.tl;dr - Fantastic puzzle and art design. Game may feel empty and pointless at times, but look a little deeper and you'll find a reason for pretty much everything.			"

												Quick summary: The Witness is a great first person puzzle game with little exploration and a lot less story.Pros:+ The game has tons of optional content so it can be finished by practically any adult but still offers a lot of challenge to those who are willing and able.+ The average quality of the puzzles is great.+ There is a surprising amount of variety in the puzzles regardless of the simple basic concept (drawing lines on a grid).+ The game doesn't use tips, manuals, guides or anything else in teaching the mechanics to the player. It uses the player's own deduction.Cons:- Some of the puzzles are more about eliminating impossible approaches than figuring out the possible ones.- Due to the game challenging the player in so many ways, some people will have limitations that can make some of the puzzles feel impossible, unfair or illogical.- At least I wasn't able to find a proper story or similar experience in the game.More in-depth thoughts:I strongly recommend The WItness to any puzzle fan. I also strongly recommend playing the game ""in the right"" way: stop to think about each puzzle you can find but if after trying to solve it, it feels impossible, move on and come back later. Solving puzzles in The Witness can be divided into three steps:1. Find the puzzle.2. Figure out the rules of the puzzle.3. Solve the puzzle.And each step can be a puzzle on its own. This means that you will be missing a lot of puzzles at first but realize it later. This means that you will find puzzles that use rules you haven't yet figured out, and it is not reasonable to try to figure them out there. This also means that you'll get those 'Heureka!' moments all the time when you realize something you had missed or misinterpreted, or something similar, earlier.Playing The Witness made me feel that Jonathan Blow wanted to challenge himself after the huge success with Braid and set to make an excellent puzzle game with a core mechanic so simple that a child could have made it with pen and paper centuries ago. It was a delight to see how amazingly varied the puzzles ended up being with such a simple core mechanic. This is one of the only games where few video reviews did practically nothing to provide me an understanding of the gameplay. All I can say is that the grid is not the puzzle, it is nothing more than an input mechanism. The input mechnism could be writing, shooting, jumping, etc. The quality, depth and the variety of the puzzles lies in the puzzles themselves, not in the input mechanism.			"

												Oh boy...this is a tough one to review.At the time of this review I only put 1 hour into The Witness.  I believe after scouring most of the island and doing alot of the puzzles, I can make an accurate first impression.  So you load in and find yourself in a tunnel.  You walk through it and find yourself in a beautiful fort area.  The graphics here were really well done.  Very colorful and differentiated.  After solving the first puzzle, you leave this closed area and can traverse the island freely.  After seeing a few more puzzles and completing them you begin to see a pattern.  All the puzzles use the same mechanic. You draw a line from one area to another area, and usually have to cover all the dots along the way.  I've seen this before in a tablet game called Lyne.  So the whole time, you are walking around admiring the scenery.  You notice there's no soundtrack, no monologue or narration.  No notes, books or posters...basically what I'm getting at here is, nothing to tell you about where you are or what this place is.  In a way, this can be helpful to the overall immersion of the island.  For me however, growing up with games like Myst and Riven, this was a deterent.  I never felt immersed in TW.  I just felt bored after that first hour.  I found that none of the puzzles made any sense in their placement.  You've got a shed area here, giving you 5 screens of the same puzzle that just gets harder.  Then over there, maybe 50 ft away, you've got a tree puzzle with the same line mechanic on different screens.  Then another 100 ft down a path, you've got a laser puzzle.  There is no lore.  It just feels like an island of puzzles condensed in a small area.I will give TW credit where credit is due.  Some of the puzzles are difficult and you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing them.  But with a price tag 0f 40 USD, I don't think this game is worth it.  Some polish needs to be done.  Like in the very beginning fort region, you can just walk through a sofa.  I feel like if they just added some music or more sound effects other than the wind, it would be a lot more immersive.  Maybe change up the puzzle design here and there.  Some of the puzzles require you to just look at the environment.  No spoilers, but the tree puzzle is a lot easier if you look at the placement of the trees.  In the end, I just didn't feel like I was a part of this world.  Almost felt like it was a tech demo that the developer of Braid made to see if he could do a puzzle game.  I wouldn't even call this an adventure game.  Once the price comes down to 20 USD I'd say pick it up.			"

												The Witness is one of those games that’s hard to describe due to spoilers. In the most basic sense, it’s a puzzle game in which you interact with panels that are simple mazes, but really, the game gets so much more complex. Every area of the island in The Witness has a set of rules that govern the puzzles found there. You will learn what those rules are through what you could say are tutorial puzzles. Some later puzzles in areas will draw from the rules of other areas, so you start mixing two, three, four, etc… rule sets together and this results in some seriously complex puzzles. Again, I cannot say too much as I don’t want to spoil anything, but many of these puzzles got so complex that I found myself grabbing a pen and some paper and actually writing notes and drawing diagrams. I took more notes while playing The Witness than I did while working on my Master’s degree. One puzzle, not due to the difficulty of it, but due to how it’s presented to the player, gave me a headache. This isn’t entirely bad and I can’t really explain why, again due to spoilers, but I just want to try and let you know as much as I can without spoiling, that the game does really spice things up and is far more than just solving some simple mazes.I should also add that I played The Witness in a sort of co-op mode. I played it along with a buddy of mine and we went from puzzle to puzzle, area to area in our own respective game while we communicated via TeamSpeak. Where one of us struggled, the other helped. This made it so that we never had to resort to using any online walkthroughs. We never really lost that sense of accomplishment in solving the puzzles by having to cheat online. The Witness is a game that will make you feel like a genius just as many times as it makes you feel like an idiot. It will haunt your dreams and warp your brain once you’ve finished it. You will start to see things in the real world and you will want to interact with them as you had in The Witness. The is most likely my favorite game of 2016, I’m sure it will have a place in my top 10 games of the last decade, and it is even in the running for one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time. 5/5 "

												I am well over half way done with the game and I must say that I very much enjoy. I enjoyed Portal/Portal 2, and The Talos Principle. Basically if you enjoy those two games and have a lot of patience then you will enjoy The Witness. Some times I will get on for 15-20 minutes and just get too frustrated... other times I will be on for 2 hours. It's a love/hate relationship, but in the end the reward of solving a puzzle and moving forward outweighs the frustration. If you want a game that's truly challenging, has thought provoking quotes, and pushing your mind to the limits within a game... then pick it up!  "

												Absolutely fantastic game for anyone who likes puzzles and philisophical thought! The only possible drawback is that the only reward for solving puzzles is more puzzles, so it may end up feeling unrewarding. I happened to like the puzzles so that wasn't a problem for me. And even so, the fact that knowledge simply begets more knowledge to no end is one major theme of the game, so I guess it all makes sense.Don't come here looking for story. Pretty much nothing is explained as far as I've gotten and in some ways a lack of coherent meaning is also one of the major themes of the game.			"

The puzzles themselves were complex but not overly complicated, causing me to really think about the solutions (get actual paper and write them down) and learn it's language in the process, with the relaxing world complimenting the gameplay itself by allowing you to take a break from the puzzles within it's setting. Everything slowly meshes together overtime and even now I find myself returning to the island to figure out more about the world itself.

If you are like me and enjoy interesting, challenging, intellectually stimulating games, you owe it to yourself to purchase this game.  I have completed all 11 beacons and that other room (trying to avoid spoiler), and can tell you that, though abstract, in my mind there is a definite story and almost a narrative based on your own personal experiences.

												The Witness is a dreadfully difficult game to review. In part because, as a puzzle game, most of the joy comes from discovery and the understanding of what the game is trying to teach you, and so it is dangerous to say too much... But also because I could write entire essays about why I'm so thrilled about it. I'll try to keep it concise.This is the best puzzle game I've ever played. It is no doubt a worthy and logical successor to Braid, even if the games have nothing in common on a mechanical level. It's downright amazing how elegant the puzzle mechanics are, just how much mileage Mr. Blow and friends got out of them, and how simultaneously intuitive and challenging it can be to grasp them.At this point, if you know that you really do like puzzles, you should probably just buy this game.The biggest praise, coming from me, is that I've ""beaten"" the game several days prior to writing this, but I still don't feel done with it. Whereas something like Antichamber kept my attention for about two hours before losing me, after which I didn't feel engaged to keep trying to find my way through it, and many other puzzle games keep me focused for half the length of the game before impatience and headaches get the better of me and I beeline it to the ending, never looking back, I keep returning to the eerily perfect island of The Witness. Just a few minutes a day, just to wander around and hopefully discover something new. I wish I could explain why I'm not sick of it yet, but I can't. I just know there's more to do, and though I feel frustrated one day for not making progress, I'll come back another time and feel as if it was obvious all along.At this point, if it's the pricetag the worries you, or the concept of a silent world devoid of anything but puzzles and nothing to keep you going, then don't worry. There is plenty of substance to The Witness. Perhaps there won't be an exciting, driving narrative to push you onward, or interesting characters to meet and have demand things of you, but you will find reasons to engage yourself in the world, and plenty of things to discover. If you're anything like me, you won't want to leave until you've unwound every single loose thread you can find. And even the ones you can't. Because it's only a matter of time.Bottom line, I don't think I've ever played a game that has managed to make the simple pleasures of discovery and understanding feel so thoroughly rewarding. I don't do ratings, but if I did, this game would get five stars out of five. Puzzles will never be the same.			"

												2:30 am, sitting in my chair and asking myself what I just experienced. Or should I say... WITNESSED?The Witness is a gorgeous puzzle game mainly created by Johnathan Blow. And that's basically it. It's puzzles. You won't have a portal 2 narrative that takes you through the game, no narrative at all to be precise. On the surface it's all about the puzzles. They start out simple with starting at a Dot, drawing a line to a rounded end. After you did that for your first solved puzzle you see a door with stuff in the puzzle you don't understand. It's not just lines anymore, there are things inbetween the squares! Not knowing what you need to do you will fail for a few minutes and go on or go on immediately. You will find yourself infront of a few new panels. Oh hey! They have the same elements on them as the ones on the door you couldn't open just a few steps before. These are much easier though and you get the hang of the way these obstacles work. You now know how to deal with this obstacle and which rule they integrate to the puzzle scheme. The door is yours to open now. And this is how the witness basically does every bit of puzzling. But sometimes the solution for puzzles are not only the mechanics within them but looking at them with different coloured light, using sound or using the environment for clues are also things you need to do to solve for probably 1/3rd of the puzzles. Yet most of the time you see something new and don't quite understand what to do but a few steps away (or in a different region of the open world island) you find panels explaining you the rules this new obstacle establishes and you can then go back to what you found to solve the puzzle you couldn't solve before. The open world of the witness really serves it well. Stuck at a certain point in an area? No problem, look into another one or explore the world to find new ones and come back later to get a new perspective without any preoccupation on the solution. Introducing new mechanics is something the witness does exceptionally well without saying or writing a single word about them.You might ask yourself what motivates you during this journey, all on your own and without any narrative, which is a great question.The moment you solve a puzzle, the right idea pops in mind and you realize it was your own head standing in your way the whole time but you just overcame this hurdle, is amazing. And even though I found this to be even more fulfilling in the witness, I see that many people will probably have a problem with that form of motivation but normally you are probably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that a puzzle takes you out of the narrative of the game just for you to solve this puzzle which might even take you a good while - In that case the puzzles stand in the way of the narrative yet in the witness the puzzles motivate for more puzzles so you have nothing that they stand in the way of. The only thing in this game that stands in somethings way is your own head standing inbetween you and the solution.The witness isnot about anything really and yet making you ask many questions, not about the game, but yourself. There are loads of audio pieces (and actually videos as well) in this game that I would say, either make you think about them or make you not do anything at all. What I mean by that is that there is no real middle ground between the two. Most of these extras are talking about the way humans think, how they express what they know, what they even know, if they want to know more and why as well as just overall interesting stuff (I found so at least) about scientists and also spiritual topics. There are people and sites (destructoid for example) talking critical about the game, the values it seems to praise and the effect it has on the industry and the people thinking highly of it. And some of the criticism is surely deserved......but I personally found myself enjoying the little audio pieces and the clips that I watched in combination with the way the game introduced mechanics, the exploration, it's aesthetics + sound design and of course the puzzles themselves.So I would surely recommend The Witness, even for 40€ you get at around 20 hours of amazing puzzling and exploration. I'm looking forward to coming back to it and solve more puzzles I've missed in my 20 hours because the game surely changes your perception of where the puzzles are and they might not even need panels for them to be puzzles...

												This is, with only a hint of exaggeration, one of the most engrossing games I have played in almost two decades. It manages to conjure up a sense of curiosity, wonder, and intelligence that I haven't felt since playing Riven so many years ago.Maybe The Witness isn't for everyone. You'll need patience. You'll need perseverance. You'll need to stay away from walkthroughs and other spoilers. But as a reward, The Witness will make you think, it will make you feel smart... And it'll make you wonder how long you'll have to wait to find another game as exquisitely crafted, as full of purpose and intent.			"

												So, I guess words fail me on this one. This game isn't fun... it's necessary. Although technically the puzzles progressively become harder, that's not the point. They progressively become more profound, and I'm surprised at how inspiring and thought provoking this puzzle game is. Excellently selected quotes from famous thinkers are sprinkled sparingly throughout the game to draw attention to the fact that there is art to be discovered in the puzzles - brilliance to be uncovered within yourself.Unlike games like ""the graveyard,"" which try way too hard to appear like art within the form of a game, this game truly is art. It is effortless, subtle. The game barely notices that you're there. You get exactly one instruction the whole time, and that's just the button to press to interact. The rest of the game is experienced through your own personal pursuit.If you desire introspection, if you want a slow and satisfying stroll through your mind, if every other game is starting to blur into one mess of combat and acquisition... the Witness is for you.

												Such a brilliant game concept - simple character control and draw-board puzzles, but still so versatile.Although puzzles solutions are linked to line drawing and combination of shapes/colors, such a simple concept still makes every area on Island unique.It has fair learning curve, and if you get stuck you ""only"" need to visit\explore some other part of the Island, which has some hints\clues that can help you to understand the first thing you got stuck with.One or two times I had to seek for Internet help (I was determined not to, but those bloody tetris and E-marks). There where many moments when I was tempted to quit (and search for help), but then when I came back to game again (rest my thought) things where clear as day, and that was such a rewarding moment - to solve something on you own.The Witness is also symbolic game concept that can be related to any scientific process of discovering new things, where someone is using previously established concepts of Known to explain\solve the UnknownI'm so satisfied with value of this game and I can recommend it to anyone with a bit of interest in puzzle solving and exploration.Developers love and commitment are so evident throughout the game.This is the first game that I played with my wife (she isn't a gamer), which concludes on how well constructed game concept The Witness is:)			"

It might sound strange to say that the game is played entirely through line-through-a-maze transport puzzles, but the variety of ways these puzzles interact with the environment is rather astounding.Beautiful game, very interesting puzzles, very difficult puzzles too (though if you find any too hard, most of them are optional; you can reach the ending by a lot of different routes). The lack of soundtrack is notable, though I suppose it puts an emphasis on the sound effects.Very good game. I'll be playing this one for some time, I'm sure.			"

												This game was way too hyped.  It's a good puzzle game, if you can get over the fact that the puzzles ARE repetitive.  It's the same puzzle with different twists.   The game is pretty, but that doesn't make up for the lack of everything except colors and the game grid puzzle.  I can see how some people would like this game, but it's not my cup of tea.  I simply find it...boring.  There were people hyping this with whispers of an early ""game of the year"" nomination.  If this represents the best of what is coming out in 2017, it's going to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥year for gaming.$40 is too high for this game.  I think it'd be a solid $20.			"

												The Witness is, at it's core, a puzzle magazine.The most beautiful, creative, detailed, immersive, intriguing (and, let's be honest, expensive) puzzle magazine I have ever seen. But it's a puzzle magazine.There is no gun. There is no inventory. 100% of your interactions are done by solving increasingly complex maze puzzles of some sort. This could very quickly grow tiresome if not for the absolutely brilliant design behind it all, as the game continuously asks you to understand what makes a solution a solution, then proceeds to twist that to create something new, again and again and again and again. The puzzles and locations are crafted with an unparalleled amount of detail. Everything has a purpose, and all of the greatest moments in The Witness come around when you realize just that. The game is pretty much guaranteed to put a huge smile in your face at one point or another.But... it's a puzzle magazine.If you are looking for something with a riveting (or, you know, existing) storyline or fast-paced action, this is not it. There'll be better ways to spend $40.If, instead, you are the kind of person who enjoys sitting down and solving puzzles, if you just love the feeling when something *clicks* in your head and suddenly things make sense, then The Witness is without a doubt the game for you.

												Absolutely loved this game! One of the few ones in a long time i actually couldn't put down and just wanted to finish from the get go.Never ever had the urge to even try and look at a guide or something, even though some puzzles took quite some thinking I never got frustrated. There was no pressure at all, such a peaceful game with a fantastic environment.Even though you get thrown into it with no hand holding nor a clear direction of where to go or what is going on, it doesn't matter. Just pick a route and see where it leads you and solve the puzzles you find (or move to other ones if you are confused and return to them at a later point). There is no correct order. Its was such a refreshing experience.Tons of clever puzzles, the only ones I disliked were probably 2-3 of the audio ones.The only negative thing in my opinion is that you dont have to complete all the puzzles to finish the game. I really really really wanted to complete the last few puzzles i left out along the way only to realize that the game resets after you finish it. That was a let down for me. Hate leaving things undone. So if you are like me then make sure to complete everything before you start the puzzles at the mountain top! I might have to replay part of it just to get them done :) "

												The Witness, Welcome to my all-time favorites list.I love the no-hand-holding puzzles.  You have to learn the rules for yourself.  The world is beautiful even if the visuals are a bit simplistic, and everywhere you look you wonder what its all about and you want to find everything.The only thing I didn't like was the ""Challenge"" area.  I don't want to spoil what it is so I'll just say it took the game in a different direction that felt like a big letdown.  I was expected that with only two achievements and one called ""Challenge"" I was going to get a giant ultimate puzzle with every mechanic in the game that would take me hours, days... who knows how long to solve.  What I got instead felt more like a crapshoot.If you don't like puzzles and exploring, this is not for you.  If you are like me, on the other hand, and you like a little mystery sprinkled on top then The Witness is definitely your jam.			"

												The Witness is a beautiful game with a ton of ""Ah-HA!"" moments that well justify the purchase price. Some of the heavy-handed philosphy is actually quite meaningful and deep.My favorite moments were walking around and seeing imagry pop-up out of the shadows and from seemingly normal shapes. However, the biggest thing holding the Witness back is the sheer volume of head-up-their-own♥♥♥♥♥puzzles that do not add the gameplay as much as derail it.Puzzles should be progressively challenging but still be able to be overcome without the help of guides. When you have a variety of styles of puzzle it's easier to spread out the challenge but when every ♥♥♥♥ing one is a sliding line puzzle at a certian timeline it just feels like they padded the game.  I hate to admit I was so frustrated I resorted to using guides because I don't have 40 hours to spend decoding a 2 minute sound loop to ♥♥♥♥ing solve one sliding line puzzle.  I do not see how the developers thought ANYONE could beat this solo. It can be completely obtuse.  There is one puzzle that takes an hour of sitting around getting lectured.  No joke. All that being said, the game is clever for the most part, well thought out and enjoyable. Shame a few bad puzzles spoil the fun. I do recommend it for the initial experience of wonder and awe that I wish carried through the entire game.			"

												Somewhere around 19-20 hours, I got the 'ending' for the game.  I completed much more than was necessary by then, but there are definitely things in the world that I haven't completed yet.  I'm not a fan of the ending.  But I'm still enjoying the game.  Overall, I'd say it's been pretty great.People who don't enjoy pure puzzles will likely not like this game.  It's not a game that rewards you for solving puzzles.  It's a game that throws puzzles at you and the reward is having solved them.  That said, puzzles do prevent you from progressing, so some might consider that a reward, but I'm betting more people don't get the feeling from solving the puzzles.  While I could see it taking another 80 hours to finish the rest of the game, it would be incredibly boring if that were the case.  If the rest of the game, as far as I can see, takes another 20 hours, I'd say that's as far as it could stretch and not turn tedious.  And it's quite possible that even that number is optimistic.I consider myself a rather good puzzle solver, and most puzzles didn't take more than 30 seconds to a minute, and many were less than that, even.  Last I checked, I was at like 400-500+ puzzles solved.			"

												I went into this game, not knowing anything except that it was some kind of puzzle game. After playing it in a couple of brief spurts throughout the week, I came to realize it's more than just puzzles.For me, The Witness is like a piece of artwork. It looks pretty on the first glance.... And then you start taking a closer look. You start seeing significance in each brush stroke. There's meaning in almost every single thing in the game. It seems like almost every single pebble or twist of the branches in a tree are designed *just right* in order to create this world. And indeed, it's difficult to miss this while playing the game.Because while the game may start out as just maze puzzles, it forces you to start looking at your surroundings differently once you free yourself from the walls of the starting area. You look at some of the puzzles in the town, with their bizarre shapes and seemingly impossible answers. Then you start to explore, and then you start to learn. What were simple mazes are now tracings, or they're representations of what you hear or what you see around you. It makes you stop and think each time you go around the next bend.And now it should be noted that there are no instructions on how to solve anything in The Witness. This is the part of puzzle games that Jonathan Blow seems to understand. The joy of solving a puzzle doesn't come just from reaching the end (while there certainly is a great amount of relief in that) the enjoyment comes from trying to figure out the solution.If you're in it for the puzzles, then you'll be in for a treat. For anyone else.. If you subscribe to the philospohy that games can be works of art, I would recommend it to you. I think the game is worth it simply to explore the whole island. I can't think of any other game that has been put together with SO MUCH attention to detail. I can't count how many times I stopped playing just to take in a view, be it a grand vista, a tight, winding path in a forest, or the curious shapes the shadows of a tree make upon a wall. Every little bit of this game has been honed to perfection.			"

You explore a lovely island in a free-roaming manner, and engage with deceptively simple maze puzzles. That's the one basic method of interaction with which to unlock doors, operate mechanisms, and otherwise make progress. Connections are made on multiple levels.If you get frustrated, I recommend perseverence. Take a break and come back later.			"

												""The Witness"" is a visually astonishing game, not a single fault found with the graphics but as many people know its not just the graphics makes a good game right? As for the Audio, well, there really isn't much to talk about here as there isn't much to listen to in the game as far as I know, there are Audio Logs that can be found scattered around the land but even then they don't tell you much if anything about the backstory of this game. The one positive about the Audio is Very Meaty footsteps that are needed to solve some puzzles.Now for the Puzzles, The puzzles are original and can get very complex very fast with new mechanics around every corner and very little to no help solving them, however they are possible after a few failed attempts. What this game does with perspective is extremely clever and it can really make you think outside the box, yet, that said some of the ""Forced Perspective"" puzzles can be quite tricky getting into the right place to solve but not impossible.As for the mood of the game it is calming and stress free mostly however, it can make you feel like a complete idiot by not seeing the larger picture but then again it does feel very satifying once you have cracked a puzzle that has been fustrating you for quite a while.Now for what some people look for in these types of games, The Story. I can't comment on the story just yet as im only 5 hours in but from that 5 hours of solving puzzles and wandering the land I can say that there isn't much of a story, You wake up in a tunnel and thats pretty much all your told, The audio logs are just Quotes from famous people and tell very little of the story and I haven't found anything that tells me what happened to the ""Others"" or what will happen once I solve the ""Final"" puzzle.TL:DR  Amazing Graphics, Very fun and original puzles, Not much of a story, Not much audio but still pretty good. I recommend this game to anybody that wants a good puzzle to solve.			"

												Some people cannot enjoy puzzle games no matter how perfect it is. This is why a perfect game has an 87 on metacritic.I have not heard a legitimate criticism levied at this game. Here are a few that I will go through: -Frustrating/Too hardYou can't criticise a game for being too hard, especially puzzle games where there's no way to adjust difficulty. That's like disliking a classic novel because your reading comprehension is fifth grade. Or hating Dark Souls cause you don't want to git gud. If The Witness is too hard, go and play some easier puzzle games, read a math/logic textbook, and come back.-No StoryThe Rubicks cude, Tetris, and Sudoku don't have stories. They wouldn't be better games if they did. No story is a plus, because it doesn't distract you from the puzzles. If you want story go read a book, watch a movie, or play a game that's made with story in mind.-No rewards for doing puzzles/Only puzzles after puzzlesIf you need a reward for completing puzzles, I have news for you: you don't like puzzles. If you don't like puzzles, don't play puzzle games. Imagine if this game had the best story ever and rewarded players with an addictive score system. Wow, then people who want to experience the story or reward would have to play a game they don't like to get to those parts. What a terrible idea.10/1020 hours to beat (note that some people report 40 hours to beat, so keep in mind that puzzle games can vary quite a bit depending on how fast you ""get it"")			"

												This is a love-it-or-hate-it thing.Yes, the whole game is maze puzzles. Yes, there's barely any explicit narrative -- and the little bit that *is* there is buried very, very deep. I went 50 hours in The Witness before I felt I understood what the island was, or why I was there. And there's still some doubt there, frankly.And... none of that bothers me. I found the puzzles tremendously engaging. I felt like a genius when I solved them, and discovering the endless, clever twists on the mechanics was a constant delight. I was happy when my puzzle-solving prowess was, inevitably, rewarded with more puzzles to solve. That's what I wanted to do: it's just like an FPS game rewarding you with a bigger gun, and more things to shoot with it.So this all hinges on whether or not you personally enjoy the puzzle mechanics of The Witness. If you do, the game will absolutely fascinate you; if you don't, it'll seem an interminable slog. I don't think there's much middle ground there, and there's just no way to know until you try it.If $40 seems like too big a risk, there's no shame in waiting for a sale. For me, though, the game was worth every penny, and then some.			"

												An outstanding puzzle game, with no narrative, but discussing very interesting themes.I found 2-3 puzzles to be unfair to the player or not working well in a full 3d movement environment and also a few that where quite frustrating to solve. Also there is at least one section with color based puzzles, but I managed to solve that on my own, even though I am partially colorblind. Evidently, it took me more time to figure the solution, and I had to do it the alternative way as opposed to the straight forward way I later watched people do it. There was one color-based puzzle I was unable to solve without hints, that this is... well, optional.Other than that the puzzles are excellent. There is a simple goal but too many variations and combinations of rules on how the puzzle panels work. And then, there are some mind blowing moments in the gameplay that you just have to experience by yourself without anyone spoiling them for you. One of my favorite candidates for my Game of the Year 2016.			"

												When I had my first oh my god moment after exploring enough, it actually startled me.This review may be premature, but it's definitely worth recommending if you enjoy exploratory puzzle games the likes of MOTAS (the Mystery of Time and Space), but *moreso* if you enjoyed Antichamber. There are a number of other indie puzzle games I'm dying to mention, but I hope you'll remember some of them when you stumble on what prompted me to write this immediately.Beautiful art style and importantly: ART DIRECTION. I can already see why this game took so much time to make.The philosophical aspect is relevant to the game and inspires curiousity.The game absolutely does have tutorials, but allows you to find them and revisit old puzzles in a natural flow that kept me from being stumped so far.Supplemental Post-GameStill enjoyed the game overall, but there were some puzzles whose design were straight up frustrating and was glad to avoid having to solve. Aids such as photoshop were a massive help with some of those, but I don't know if that was intended as a solution, given the game was designed around the PS4 first (as far as I can tell)...In any case, I still highly recommend this game.It is still narratively thin, but I believe that its thematic strength and how it's married to the gameplay more than makes up for what a lot of people believe is plot vagueness.

												The Design is perfect, the puzzles range from easy to cry on the floor. It is open and if you are stuck just go to a different puzzle or sleep over it. The Game is very well designed ex. when you leave the start area you pass near a door. You could try crack it open or go further and learn how the puzzle works, get back to the door and crack it open after you've learned how the puzzle works, thus making it easy. Each set of puzzles are starting with an initial idea. If you got the concept the starting puzzles are easy and get harder the further you get.			"

												Having finished the game (not 100%, but all 488 puzzles i could find, in 12 hours) I definitly recommend it for everyone interested in puzzle games. Positiv:- many different variations in the puzzles, each with its own ruleset- inclusion of the enviroment into the puzzles in very interesting ways- stunning stylized visuals- very detailed enviroments and places- no ""hand holding"" by the game, you learn the game by playing it- nice sound design even without byckground musicNegativ:- controls can by clunky in some situations- rarely puzzles can by frustrating due to lack of tutorials- a lot shorter than advertised and nearly no replay valueI will try to 100% the game and may update the review.

												You are in front of a mathematics test paper, taking an examination. A seemingly impossible fill-in-the-blank question has bugged you for a long time, you realize that with the given conditions, even if you exhausted all methods you have learned so far, it is still far from solvable. The clock is ticking, you fall in despair.Unexpectedly, a wind blows the paper onto the floor. While picking it up, you notice a semicircular coffee cup stain on the back of the paper, which makes up a perfect circle with the organic pattern of the marble tile on the floor. Circle was reminiscent of the sun, you stare into the sun outside the window, have your faith replenished, partly. Through a mere reflection on the glass facade of the opposite building, your split vision lands on the apple tree on the playground. It is an apple tree with birds on branches: a pigeon, a sparrow and a crow. That is, three birds in total, you ponder. Three, was reminiscent of triangle; Triangle symbolizes the Illuminati; Illuminati was founded in 1776 at Bavaria, Germany. Wait a second, the country code for Germany is …... 49!A sense of epiphany overwhelms your mind, you know you have made it. You write the answer 49 onto the paper, with a contented smile on your face.--- The Witness in a Nutshell[All Achievements Acquired on 4 Feb, 2016][Final Verdict: 78/100] "

												This is an interesting specimen. It's very similar to Myst, in that it's an island filled with puzzles. However, while Myst's puzzles are all combination locks with a note hidden somewhere, The Witness' puzzles all require some serious grey matter.The Witness' gameplay is incredibly simple. A first-person game where you explore an island and solve puzzles. These puzzles all take the form of maze panels. Each maze has a set of different mechanics. These mechanics, depending on where you start, are very simplistic, at first so you can get your bearings and understand how these mechanics work. The mechanics become more and more complicated and even mix into each other.The puzzles are definitely the best part of the game. Not only do they become more complicated, but the way you find the solutions are absolutely mind-boggling. The island is crawling with clues. Not in the form of notes, but in the form of the island's decor. The plants, the rock formations, the architectures...almost everything on the island is a clue. Look closely! These puzzles are incredibly well-designed and implemented.The game is also completely open. Each area of the island is yours to explore. This design choice also benefits the player if they are stuck on a puzzle, allowing them to walk away, clear their heads, and/or look to new puzzles to solve if you want. The game's setting is absolutely beautiful. Each part of the island is completely distinctive and wildly imaginative. A looming fortress, a forest set in eternal autumn, a beautiful orchard, a bamboo forest that could serve as a panda preserve, Journey-esque desert, and many more that I wish to not spoil.I have yet to 100% complete this game, but I'm fully absorbed in it's incredibly complex design.However, this game lacks a story (as far as I know and if it does, please don't spoil it for me). The game has several audio logs scattered about, but they're all real-world quotes that have no context.This game leaves me feeling both befuddled, confused, frustrated, and fulfilled when I find the solution (Though, I often need a pad of graph paper on-hand. In fact, I have a pad specifically for this game. The puzzles are extremely well designed, they're simple to complete, yet complex in execution, and absolutely beautiful to look at. If you're a fan of deep, intricate games, I highly recommend it			"

												Edit: A more in depth review, now that I played a bit.The Witness is a puzzle game that I personally only recommend for the most hardcore puzzle fan.You wake up on an island that seems to be completely empty. You have to explore it and figure out why you are on there, and what happened.The story is pretty light. Aside from some voice messages and videos of psychological and philosophical nature, there isn't really much story to speak of until, maybe, the end (I am not there yet).You progress through the island by solving the same type of puzzle over and over. Now, I am actually impressed by the amount of variations this game has for just the same type ofpuzzle. It starts off easy - draw a line from a starting point to an end point. As the game progresses, new symbols will be introduced that make solving these puzzles way harder, and sometimes even the environment will take part in the solution. For having only one type of puzzle, the game varies it a lot, keeping you busy and on your toes.The puzzles themselves are generally on the harder side, but if you love puzzles, you will want to solve them all without looking into a walkthrough. Trust me, the experience is better that way.Now, it is of course not all gold and sunshine. Here are my personal pros and cons for the game:Pro:+GraphicsThe graphics are nice and sufficient. The island has lush colours, the graphic style is detailed enough without being overbearing, and everything is generally nice to look at and resourceful enough to work on any type of graphics card, really.+Puzzles/CreativityWhile the game only has one type of basic puzzle, it varies so much over the course of its 500+ puzzles that it has more variation in it than 10 types of puzzles could ever hope to achieve. Symbols, dots, tetris pieces and much more will make every area you explore a little different and keep you on your toes.+SoundsThe sounds are well done. The footsteps are the primary sound you will hear, and they are just as satisfying to listen to as the wirring of machinery after a solved puzzle, or the buzzing of an activated computer panel.+SecretsThe island has a lot of secret puzzles and secret locations. Exploring it is in general very fun and rewarding.+Voice MessagesI like the voice messages in the game. While they are all only quotes of famous philosophers, scientists and the like, the people reading them really bring in some atmosphere. They do a great job, especially since everything else is so quiet.Eh:-+No HintsThere are no real hints or a way to progress should you ever not understand a puzzle. Now, the entire game is logical, and everything can be solved with logic, but should you ever not get something, then you can either explore somewhere else, or, if you don't understand a symbol, look at a walkthrough. It can be frustrating, but that is not necessarily a con - it makes you have to think about things.-+No MusicThere is no music in the game. Aside from the sound, everything is quiet. Some say it helps build up atmosphere, some find it annoying. It is up to you.-+ClaustrophobiaThe game feels downright claustrophobic at times, which is weird. The island holds a lot of structures like castles, deserts, houses, and so on, but sometimes it feels so cramped full of things that it seems unnecessary. That could have been avoided by just making the island a bit larger.Cons:-No MapThis is probably my personal worst point. There is a fast travel system by using a boat you unlock at some point, and it shows a map - but there is no map you can call on at any point. The island itself isn't huge, but there are so many things to discover that a map would be really useful at times - the game is kept minimalistic for a reason, yes, but that doesn't mean it isn't annoying.-No story (to speak of)Aside from, what I heard, the end, the entire game has no story, really. Yes, apparently something happened on this island, but until the end, you won't know what - that can make solving puzzles feel meaningless.-No rewardAside from progressing over the island (sometimes), a lot of the puzzles don't have more rewards, except more puzzles. The reward is, I suppose, getting to solve them. Which is why I recommend the game only for diehard puzzle fans.Overall, I think it is a game worth playing, but only if you love puzzles, can deal with a(n apparent) nonexistent story and no music, and like the atmosphere of exploring an abandoned island.My personal rating: 7/10			"

												Okay, this game isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea; it's hard as hell and some people might just brush the puzzles off as being dumb minigames that belong on an iPad.  I can see where those people are coming from but there's so much more going on here.First off, let's state the obvious: The visuals are gorgeous.  Like this is probably the best looking game I've ever played, it's so pretty it blows my mind.This game will NOT hold your hand in any way shape or form.  You can accidentally end up in areas where you shouldn't be and won't have a single hope of knowing how to solve the puzzles there.  Even though the puzzle mechanic of drawing lines on a grid remains the same, the game slowly introduces new different ways that the puzzles work, but each time a new thing is added you essentially have to figure out how it works yourself with no help!  Sometimes it's obvious and other times you'll scratch your head and feel like you're about to tear out your hair before suddenly having an epiphany and feeling like an absolute genius.  I like that a lot and it adds an incredibly surprising level of depth to what some might assume would just be the same thing over and over again.If you're looking for something fast paced with lots of action, this really isn't for you.  This game requires insane amounts of patience and persistence, getting stuck is painful but once you get your breakthrough it feels fantastic.			"

												Probably the best puzzle game I've ever played by far. You'd think after a while a game with 400 maze puzzles would get repetitive after a while, but each area has it's own unique genius method needed to solve those particular ones. The only thing I found slightly frustrating is that some mechanics are explained in a specific area, and it's possible that you'll find more way more complicated versions of that mechanic before being shown the ""tutorial"" ones - so if something appears totally new then you may need to walk away and come back later.Either way, my gripes with this game are minor - The puzzles are incredibly rewarding to complete and if you even remotely enjoy puzzle games (I'm a huge sucker for them), then you probably already know that you'll enjoy this title. Don't let the higher than expected price tag put you off - it's worth it and then some.Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ tetris.			"

												An incredible experience set in a beautful, surreal world. The feeling of mystery, exploration and intellectual development which was first introduced by Myst 20 years ago is further developed here. This is a game that makes you work to understand, not only the systems that govern the puzzles of the island, but the way you interpret and feel about this place. This game treads new ground intellectually, and philsophically and is unprecedented for the medium. Jonathan Blow, you are an artist and this game is a masterpiece.

												The Witness is an incredible puzzle game.  each puzzle is fair - it's not like myst or monkey island, where you might have to do something unorthodox, like combine a monkey and a wrench to get a ""monkey wrench"".  this game eshews the concept of an inventory in favour of having each puzzle represented as a glowing maze panel.  in doing so, The Witness removes all ambiguity between what *is* and what *isn't* a puzzle, which was a really smart design choice.this game was designed and iterated upon for nearly 10 years after the release of Braid, the developer's previous game, and the amount of polish and attention to detail in the island is, quite frankly, astonishing.  the island is dense, packed with puzzles, shortcuts between areas, and gorgeous views; it's one of the most engaging worlds i've explored in a game, right up there with Dark Souls.  one aspect of the world design that i was not fond of, however, were the audio logs scattered throughout the island.  they don't explain the plot of the game, but are rather a collection of miscellaneous, thematic quotes from famous philosophers and mathematicians.  these audio logs feel a little pretentious, and very superfluous (it's a tight, polished puzzle game, but it has audio logs arbitrarily tacked on).i have a few other minor gripes about the game, including the lack of a conclusive ending, but this isn't a game i played for its plot.  over the course of my first playthrough, i had countless ""a-ha!"" moments, which is a benchmark for any puzzle game.  The Witness is so rewarding and well-designed that the game's few flaws can be easily overlooked.			"

												Phenomenal, VERY TOUGH puzzle exploration game that requires great observational and spatial skills. Don't be fooled some of the reviews. The gameplay is much about carefully observing and understanding the world as it is about the spatial and reasoning skills of the line puzzles. The world is intricately, full of mystery, and ripe for exploration.Be warned though: this game is not for The Witless, it is extremely challenging. It's not just that you have to formulate solutions for tough challenges based on complex mechanics, but you'll also have to constantly reconsider what those mechanics actually are, which seems to fit in with the game's early theme of the scientific method.

												Can't say I'd recommend it. Really poorly designed. Puzzles are thrown all over with next to no organization. You're going to run into puzzles you haven't been taught to solve yet randomly, and you'll end up having to leave areas half completed until you find the one bit of information you need to solve it.Credit where it's due, there's some really nifty secrets and interesting puzzles. Sometimes it's totally ordinary, sometimes you have to use sound to complete the puzzle, and sometimes there's hidden puzzles hidden in bricks and flowers. But the lack of direction really kills it. Running into dead ends isn't fun, challenging, or rewarding, it's just frustrating. If there was any indication as to where you should next, it would be way better, I might even recommend it. But the fact that there's absolutely no guidance and you'd have no idea how to complete some areas until you've learned what to do in other areas is really bad.Basically, almost good, no direction, gets really boring before you can figure out what you're supposed to do next.

												The Witness is a fantastic puzzle game with a beautiful world to explore. While the only puzzle mechanic is, more or less, about connecting lines and dots, it does this in a wide variety of ways, from special rules, mirroring lines, and more. After the first couple dozen puzzles, the environment begins to have an effect on them, whether by being part of the puzzle itself from shadows, or from outside objects changing how a puzzle needs to be solved, or preventing it from being solved until later.The game has its flaws, though. There is no story to guide you, no outright given reason why you are here. This is a detriment to some folks, which I can understand. There are little hints, bits of audio, other things you can find, and there is apparently an underlying story and reason if you dig deep enough. But, as I said, without it being presented up front, that may or may not be an issue to you.The negative reaction of ""It's only line puzzles stuck on panels!"" is, to me, slightly silly. Yes, it's only line puzzles, but they get complex and interesting, and keep ramping that up with new rules the more puzzles you find. And its hard not to spoil things, but I will say that there are puzzles outside of thense 'panels'.Another negative is this game does not hold your hand. It does not explain how a puzzle mechanic works outside of a set of 'tutorial' panels for each one, which are scattered around with the other puzzle panels. You may be able to discern what the rules are for a certain puzzle piece, though. Sometimes you might not know if a puzzle is actually solvable without changing the environment somehow via a different puzzle. These can make it frustrating, but a good solution is if you can't solve a puzzle after a bit, move on for now and come back.The last issue is something I see a bunch of negative reviews and comments on here and elsewhere : That people were expecting Myst becuase thats what it kind of looked like, but didn't get Myst. That's a fairly big aspiration for a game, but don't pass off on a game because it wasn't what you were expecting it to be.So, summing it up : PROS : Lots of puzzles. Beautiful world. Interesting mechanics.CONS : Puzzles based off the same Line type. Very little story drive. Limited graphics options.			"

												Buy it only if you are super-super nerd who loves abstract puzzles above anything else. Beware of possible bad experience from the game.Review:The beginning of a game has too many repetitive puzzles. I was forcing myself through the beginning and the middle of it. Sometimes I felt frustration because of seldom rewards from puzzles. Too many of easy puzzles there and that felt like a drudge-work. Where is all the fun? The worst experience was when I solved couple of puzzles and nothing just happened. What was the point? The end-game puzzles were really good and they gave me a feeling of hand crafted experience. But I am sure that not many of you will get to the end-game to enjoy it. End-game puzzles cannot compensate for the overall boring process of the game.The game has ended too-indie-like (read it as no real ending at all). This game lacks the story, in fact it lacks almost everything except nice views here and there and puzzles. Sad face.The whole island feels like a crazy big tutorial with too stretched learning experience of too many puzzles. The end-game felt like the game finally has started, but it was not long enough to compensate for boring exploration experience of the island.But again. No mystery gets uncovered in the game. There is no plot, no story, no nothing to think about afterwards. Random philospohy felt like a sand into my eye. Too cheap, sorry.Compared to Braid it is:a) a step back as a gameb) a step forward in nerdiness of puzzles.			"

												Thoroughly enjoying my experience so far.While the game is technically all line puzzles, the methods you use to solve these puzzles are really diverse, so there's plenty of variety.The game is also gorgeous.			"

												Pretty, but tedious. Part of the disappointment I experienced playing this game was due to the hype and visuals I'd taken in before hand. While the visuals can be very soothing at times, the gameplay is extremely tedious.I had avoided watching any play-throughs as I wanted to enjoy the discovery for myself, with fresh eyes.Because it was compared to Myst so often, and refered to as a puzzle game with a story. I assumed that thepuzzles would be more varied in nature. They are not. It could be compared to something like Sudoku or Minesweeper.Slowly progressing in difficulty, but always the same type of puzzle. The type one would expect to play on their mobile during the commute to work. Occassionally new elements are injected, without explanation. While I do like the element of discovery and not being coddled, I did find some of the puzzles later in the game irritating, rather than challenging.  And after 6 hours of play I finally gave up. If there was an interesting story I may have kept playing, however for the 6 hours I played is almost non existant.			"

												This game (much like Fez) forces your brain to flip from one thought process to another in a heartbeat.  In short, it's another piece of genius from J-Blo.  It makes me feel like my brain is being ravaged by a bigger brain, whilst dangling an obvious answer right in front of my semi-ravaged brain face.If you learn to think outside the box and look at the environment - you'll get to grips with this pretty fast.  If you only work on the puzzle that's in front of you... you're boned.12 out of 10. Would definitely get brain-ravaged again.			"

												Definitely not a game for everyone:If you want something relaxing (unless you consider mental exercises as relaxing), this isn't it.It you want something that doesn't remind you of math blaster, this isn't it.If you want something with puzzles where you don't need to draw on paper or take screenshots, this isn't it.If you want to feel like your not working or in school, this isn't it.I'm not sure who would have the drive needed to work on a game like this one for seven years, but it was done. The love for these maze puzzles needs to be extensive for a player to ever complete this thing.I'm not sure I'd ever complete it even if paid to do so as I don't like those puzzle anywhere near that much.There's a reviewer out there that said maze puzzles for 25-30+ hours should be what you should consider to play this game. That's no joke. Take it seriously. If your not sure, its likely not for you. I wasn't sure and its totally not for me.Addition: The Myst series even with its flaws and taking the worst one, are still better. Some of the puzzles are similar, such as the one in the fireplace, but many are more relaxing and more entertaining, and the puzzles are far more varied. The Witness is just interesting. Its solve the maze puzzle to see what's next or walk over there to see what's next. Myst also has a nice story and doesn't feel completely lonely.This game also has invisible walls which for first person game that's no good. You can't fall off anything when you want to.There's no jumping so forget that.Its all about the maze puzzles and roaming for a good amount of time. That's what you do. You better like it.They do a good job of making the maze puzzles more interesting with the sound effect and the look. It helps make them less dull, but that's it.			"

												This is more than ""just a game"". This is a piece of interactable art. You as a player are part of it. In 20 years of gaming very few games blew me away like this one. In some places I get a sensation like I got from the first Portal game or Antichamber. You are constantly challenged to think outside the box and the game manages to reward you for doing so in a very gentle manner...Also compared to Portal this game is accessible to a lot more people because it does not seem to be about speed and reflexes (I am not done with it, so I cannot completely confirm this, yet).Do not watch spoiling reviews or videos. Just jump in blindly and do not underestimate the ""simplicity"" of the ""simple mechanic"". It is brilliant, beautiful, mindblowing. Thank you Jonathan for an extraordinary experience! 40 bucks well spent.			"

												There's a lot to cover so we'll dive right in;This is one of the worst puzzle games I have ever had the displeasure of playing.The effort is here, it is all here.  Every element for success has been tucked into the product, every bit of potential is bursting at the seems, and so it becomes the most insulting, most disappointing, most infuriating thing to see every single one of those aspects fail over, and over, and over, and over again.It is hard to summize everything wrong with The Witness, and almost impossible to do so in a short period, so if you just want a brief summary, it is as follows; there is no original writing, the visuals are fine, there's no music, the puzzles range from fantastic to utter garbage, and the two endings I've gotten thus far are some of the most pretentious, boring crap I've sat through in a long time.   Everything the Witness does, a game like Talos Principle will do better, so save yourself time and money and buy that instead.----------A breakdown;BAD PUZZLES:The puzzles are simple in theory, difficult in practice as any good puzzle game should be.  You click a circle, draw a line, and connect that line to the 'end' of the area.  This can be anything from a straight line to an entire maze.  This works on paper, and could even work in practice, were it not for the fact that it becomes tedious within the first hour or two.  Puzzles begin to include symbols and icons that change the rules of the individual mazes, and infuriatingly, these rules are not immediately explained.  Natural puzzle progression from good games in the genre will introduce a concept, make it more difficult, expand on it, and then incorporate it into larger concepts.  The Witness tries to do something similar, but will hide the tutorials in far removed areas of the island.  You will walk by puzzles with unknown, unexplained symbols twenty, thirty, FIFTY times before finding the area that explains how they work.  This non-linearity is not a point in the game's favor, as frustration will inevitably cause players to brute-force puzzles and work out at least some aspects of them before being TAUGHT.What is worse, and what some have mind-bogglingly listed as POSITIVE of this title, some puzzles will force you to rely entirely on the environment to solve, with no indication or hint as to what they want from you.  You may need to leave the immediate area, stand on a raised platform and notice the shadows mark out a rough path.  You may need to stand behind a specific area of a specific tree and line up the branches to show where you can't go on a maze.  You may need to line up SEVERAL branches, see if those are the branches the game wants, fail, and then try another set.  Over and over and over.  It is not so much being presented with a 100-piece jigsaw puzzle and being asked to solve it, but being presented with a 100-piece puzzle that only has 99 pieces, and being mocked when you didn't realize the last piece was being hidden under a newspaper in the corner of the room.  LAZY WRITING:The writing and dialogue is highly interesting, highly thought-provoking, and highly engrossing as you find collectibles all over the map.  The problem is that NONE OF IT is original writing!  Every scrap of it is ripped directly from lectures, quotations and speeches made from all across human history, and while almost all of it is incredibly interesting to listen to, you can't give a point to the game for it when all of it is also accessible from Google.  The developers and designers have not even attempted to put their own spin or perspective on the issues they are putting forth, instead drowning the player in sourced quotations from folk like Einstein.  BAD PUZZLE COLLECTIBLES:On top of the interesting collectibles in the form of small data-sticks or videos, there are also the much more boring collectibles in the form off hidden mazes.  These are puzzles that are hidden in the environment themselves, forcing you to line up a balloon-and-string, for example, to form the circle and line that you then trace down and complete.  The issue here is that they rarely are ever actually PUZZLES; the difficulty is in finding the markings in the sand or rocks, or standing in the right place to see the metal girder match up with the stone wall.  Once you find it, it takes half a second to complete, and then off you go searching for another and there are DOZENS of these in the world. LACK OF MUSIC:There is no music, and the only sound is that of your footsteps and the occasional ambiance.  The developers used if memory serves something like 10,000 footstep sound samples for the game, and while I adore that kind of dedication and wish it was used more, I was desperately wishing at times for some actual background music while I stared blankly at a puzzle I'd been stuck on for 20 minutes.  INSULTING FINAL LEVEL:The longer I played, the more irritated and frustrated I became with the poor design choices.  I will admit freely to using a guide at times and, by the final 'level', almost exclusively, because I became so tired with the cheap and childish tactics that I simply couldn't bring myself to care any longer.  Not only do you have to deal with puzzles not providing you with enough information to be solved, not only do you have to deal with trying to find where you should stand before you CAN solve certain puzzles, or if this is one of those puzzles you need to be somewhere else and that's the reason you cannot complete it, but by the final area, it genuinely feels as if the developers threw their hands up and stopped trying.Where in most puzzle game, and good games period, the final areas are a compilation of all the tests and challenges you've faced, where you have to rely on the accumulation of your knowledge from time spent with the game, the final areas of the Witness simply couldn't be bothered.  Instead of becoming more difficult, they instead resort to pathetic, childish distractions.  Instead of solving a difficult puzzle, you have to solve a moderately-difficult puzzle while your screen flashes at you in distraction.  Or while the colors invert, or while the puzzle itself spins uncontrollably and you have to fight the controls to do what you want.  Even elsewhere in the game this is present, making you feel frustrated not because you are failing a logic puzzle, but because you can't control your mouse properly even after you know the solution.BAD ENDINGS:And to top it all off, the endings are garbage.  Pretentious, monotonous, BORING garbage.  Without spoiling specifics or location, one ending even has the audacity to fly you in near silence through the map you have just spent 15+ hours completing, showing as it erases all your progress and resets all the puzzles and work you have done.  FINAL THOUGHTS:If you have read through this entire review, it should be clear that nobody who loathes a game would spend this much time writing about it.  I wanted, DESPERATELY wanted to enjoy this game, and the fact I spent more than 15 hours on a single run should prove that.  But every design decision fails, the mixing of good-with-bad puzzles leaves you frustrated and without the glorious ""AH-HA!"" moment you reach when solving a difficult challenge, the graphics are good, the story is lazy, the soundtrack is nonexistent, and every single thing this game does, the Talos Principle (which was released over a year or more before this) does better.  It is incredibly disappointing to see so much effort and talent go into a product that, ultimately, comes out as a 4.5/10, average or slightly worse than average, title.  Even after spending only 2$, roughly, on this product in a humble-bundle, I would advise any potential buyers to steer clear and spend their money elsewhere.+Visuals+Atmosphere-Gameplay-Sound-Puzzles-Story-Endings-Difficulty4.5/10			"

												I am a couple hours into the game and I am shocked. Without giving too much away, the game allows you to learn for yourself. There is no tutorial or guidance in any way. Instead, you become your own tutorial once you experience those ""DUH, that makes sense"" type of moments. The world is there for you to unlock and digs into your peronal thoughts and how you perceieve the world around you. I couldn't believe on day one release that so many people posted negative comments and have demanded refunds. I guess those people just don't understand the meaning of ""The Witness.""			"

Posted: March 14, 2016
												This review contains no spoilers.Warning: I would be very cautious about reading other reviews and being robbed of some of the best experiences the game has to offer.The Witness is hands down the best puzzle game I have ever played.The bite-sized puzzles never feel too imposing - you just about never look at a puzzle and think ""I don't think I'm up for that. I think I'll come back to it tomorrow."".The essence of the gameplay is the combination of those basic logic puzzles (the fundamental concepts of the puzzle boards) and a huge variety of environmental complications like colored panes of glass and tree limbs and erased lines and more. No other game mixes environmental puzzles and symbolic logic puzzles together so masterfully.Another consequence of this unifying concept of the puzzle board is that you always know when you're looking at one. The game almost entirely lacks that Myst situation where you're wandering around unsure of where the next puzzle is. It also lacks the Myst problem of puzzles that are available, but impossible to solve until some other puzzle is solved first.The method of teaching the ""rules"" of the symbols on the puzzle boards through carefully designed challenges without ever using any explicit explanation is downright brilliant. They're carefully designed to make you think you understand a rule, to give you a series of puzzles where the rule you've come up with will work, but then to suddenly confront you with a puzzle where you have to rethink. You'll frequently discover that you convinced yourself something was impossible without ever seeing evidence of that.And none of the puzzles ever require guess-and-check.If you're guessing and checking, you're making a mistake. You can play Sudoku by guessing numbers and seeing how far they get you - you'll eventually solve any Sudoku puzzle that way - but you're not really playing Sudoku if you do that. So it is with The Witness.Once you understand all the pieces of the puzzle, it is always possible to solve it completely deductively. Learning the different ways to do this is a huge part of the game. Many complaints about the game center around the idea that the reviewer ""learned all the rules"" and then just spent hours and hours boringly brute-forcing puzzles. Learning the ""rules"" is just the start. The bulk of the game is not spent learning the rules, but learning the logical consequences of the rules that allow you to deductively solve puzzles. It isn't just about learning the rules of the dots, it's about learning that the rules of the dots imply that certain configurations are impossible. After you learn the rules, the subsequent boards will be about teaching you these implications.The audio logs and videos can feel a bit preachy at times, but having listened to all of them now, I understand a lot beter what purpose they served. They can initially come across as a pretentious affectation, like some college student going around spouting random philosophy quotes to seem ""deep"", but in time I think the game does actually reveal a fairly legitimate depth to what it's trying to express.And the final challenge, past the ""end"" of the game, is downright beautiful. While opinions may differ, I also found the reward for completing it to be far more worthwhile than the final rewards in most other games.Fundamentally though, The Witness is a game about changes in perception. It's a game about looking at something again and again and then suddenly and very viscerally seeing it in a totally different light. Sometimes that's puzzles - sometimes it's re-examining how you think a symbol works or how you reason about a certain kind of puzzle. Other times the shift in perspective is more profound.Penultimate warning: You will almost certainly want some paper and a pen. Maybe even some scissors.Final warning: If you use a guide to get through much of the game, there is a very real possibility, thanks to a brilliant pieces of design near the end, that you will find yourself unable to complete it.

												The Witness is the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Incredibly brutal, yet never unfair. If you are willing to learn from your mistakes, from your surroundings, from the deepest recesses of your brain without losing it, you will be able to do everything in this game. It's just a matter of learning, exploration and discovery.Do me a favour. Don't look at a guide unless you've gone away, tried to do other things, and thought about it for considerable time. There are things you won't understand straight away - this is because you haven't gathered the necessary information yet. And if you are forced to look up an answer, make sure to find out WHY. Because if you don't understand puzzle A yet, you probably won't understand puzzle B either.You can ""finish"" this game (achievement one) without ever really uncovering the plot (achievement two). Yes, there is a plot, and you will smash your head in trying to piece it together. :P But it's worth it, trust me. I did NOT see it coming.			"

												The Witness is the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Incredibly brutal, yet never unfair. If you are willing to learn from your mistakes, from your surroundings, from the deepest recesses of your brain without losing it, you will be able to do everything in this game. It's just a matter of learning, exploration and discovery.Do me a favour. Don't look at a guide unless you've gone away, tried to do other things, and thought about it for considerable time. There are things you won't understand straight away - this is because you haven't gathered the necessary information yet. And if you are forced to look up an answer, make sure to find out WHY. Because if you don't understand puzzle A yet, you probably won't understand puzzle B either.You can ""finish"" this game (achievement one) without ever really uncovering the plot (achievement two). Yes, there is a plot, and you will smash your head in trying to piece it together. :P But it's worth it, trust me. I did NOT see it coming.			"

												This is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It is not an adventure puzzler, it is a pure puzzle game - and it pulls that off perfectly. People complain you ""only draw lines on squares"", but that's like saying ""you only shoot portals on walls"" (Portal/Portal 2) or ""you only hit a ball into a hole"" (Golf), or ""you only shoot enemies."" (Every FPS in existence). The puzzles evolve using the same basic mechanic. Without words or instructions it guides you through every nuance of each mechanic.The feeling of a puzzle clicking in your mind after being stuck in this game is one of the best feelings a game has ever given me. I found myself smiling in pride after many puzzles. Understand what this game is and isn't before you buy it. But understand that it's one of the best pure puzzle experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing.			"

Figuring out thougher puzzles fills you with satisfaction and you feel really smart :). Really clever puzzle design which very often is interconnected with enviromental clues.

												The game is fantastic, and the type of game you know you will only find a few times in your life. I loved every second in the island, the puzzles and the setting. All the untold story.However, the tricky part is that I don't think this is for everyone. You must really thrive as a puzzle solver, and lover.It's not just about puzzles, but I really can't say anything else =)			"

												I am a couple hours into the game and I am shocked. Without giving too much away, the game allows you to learn for yourself. There is no tutorial or guidance in any way. Instead, you become your own tutorial once you experience those ""DUH, that makes sense"" type of moments. The world is there for you to unlock and digs into your peronal thoughts and how you perceieve the world around you. I couldn't believe on day one release that so many people posted negative comments and have demanded refunds. I guess those people just don't understand the meaning of ""The Witness.""			"

												This review contains no spoilers.Warning: I would be very cautious about reading other reviews and being robbed of some of the best experiences the game has to offer.The Witness is hands down the best puzzle game I have ever played.The bite-sized puzzles never feel too imposing - you just about never look at a puzzle and think ""I don't think I'm up for that. I think I'll come back to it tomorrow."".The essence of the gameplay is the combination of those basic logic puzzles (the fundamental concepts of the puzzle boards) and a huge variety of environmental complications like colored panes of glass and tree limbs and erased lines and more. No other game mixes environmental puzzles and symbolic logic puzzles together so masterfully.Another consequence of this unifying concept of the puzzle board is that you always know when you're looking at one. The game almost entirely lacks that Myst situation where you're wandering around unsure of where the next puzzle is. It also lacks the Myst problem of puzzles that are available, but impossible to solve until some other puzzle is solved first.The method of teaching the ""rules"" of the symbols on the puzzle boards through carefully designed challenges without ever using any explicit explanation is downright brilliant. They're carefully designed to make you think you understand a rule, to give you a series of puzzles where the rule you've come up with will work, but then to suddenly confront you with a puzzle where you have to rethink. You'll frequently discover that you convinced yourself something was impossible without ever seeing evidence of that.And none of the puzzles ever require guess-and-check.If you're guessing and checking, you're making a mistake. You can play Sudoku by guessing numbers and seeing how far they get you - you'll eventually solve any Sudoku puzzle that way - but you're not really playing Sudoku if you do that. So it is with The Witness.Once you understand all the pieces of the puzzle, it is always possible to solve it completely deductively. Learning the different ways to do this is a huge part of the game. Many complaints about the game center around the idea that the reviewer ""learned all the rules"" and then just spent hours and hours boringly brute-forcing puzzles. Learning the ""rules"" is just the start. The bulk of the game is not spent learning the rules, but learning the logical consequences of the rules that allow you to deductively solve puzzles. It isn't just about learning the rules of the dots, it's about learning that the rules of the dots imply that certain configurations are impossible. After you learn the rules, the subsequent boards will be about teaching you these implications.The audio logs and videos can feel a bit preachy at times, but having listened to all of them now, I understand a lot beter what purpose they served. They can initially come across as a pretentious affectation, like some college student going around spouting random philosophy quotes to seem ""deep"", but in time I think the game does actually reveal a fairly legitimate depth to what it's trying to express.And the final challenge, past the ""end"" of the game, is downright beautiful. While opinions may differ, I also found the reward for completing it to be far more worthwhile than the final rewards in most other games.Fundamentally though, The Witness is a game about changes in perception. It's a game about looking at something again and again and then suddenly and very viscerally seeing it in a totally different light. Sometimes that's puzzles - sometimes it's re-examining how you think a symbol works or how you reason about a certain kind of puzzle. Other times the shift in perspective is more profound.Penultimate warning: You will almost certainly want some paper and a pen. Maybe even some scissors.Final warning: If you use a guide to get through much of the game, there is a very real possibility, thanks to a brilliant pieces of design near the end, that you will find yourself unable to complete it.

Some of these are required for completion of the game.+Intricate puzzles that I really have to think to solve, and remain fresh and challenging throughout the game.+Beautiful visuals, with strategically placed ledges to look over the island from+Incorporates the world into the maze style puzzles often and in various ways+Well presented tutorial for each kind of puzzle, without ever actually explaining how to solve them+Hidden puzzle paths in the environment, requiring proper perspective to find and activate.   -No idea what these are for-Slow machinery.  It build the atmosphere, but I would rather make progress than wait for an elevator.-Almost too difficult.  There are no difficulty options, if you can't finish you can't finish.-Hidden puzzle paths in the environment are very obscure and difficult to find.  Getting 100% is nearly impossible.			"

												The Witness for me has been a presentation in opposites - beautiful and ugly, graceful and clumsy, plain-spoken and pompous. I wish I could give this game a rating between thumbs-up and thumbs-down, but since that's not possible, I'm going to have to choose not to recommend this game, despite the fact that there are many things about it I really like.The game places you on an island, and the way to move forward is to solve various puzzles throughout the island, which all have different rules and different levels of difficulty. Most of these puzzles take place on flat-panel screens, and involve using a cursor to draw on the panels and solve the puzzles by obeying the varous rules, like keeping blocks of a certain color together or blocking out specific tetris-like shapes. First, the quick pros and cons: +Island is beautiful, at least in terms of color palette and geometry.+Seems to run fairly well.+Puzzle rules are very clever, and you will feel smart when you figure out the hard ones.+Teaches you the rules organically, you learn the rules naturally most of the time.-Island is pretty, but there isn't much to actually do on it, other than interact with panel puzzles. Invisible walls are everywhere and it ends up feeling like a pretty-looking, but ultimately shallow façade.-Puzzle difficulty ramps up quickly, a bit too quickly sometimes. Prepare to be frustrated.-Story is so threadbare it might as well not exist. Bits and pieces are around, but nothing is ever explained, which along with the non-interactive island makes the setting feel even more pointless.-no musical score.-Some puzzles feel downright cheap. I'm not sure how people with vision/hearing problems will even complete this game.-Puzzles are presented in the most repetitious, boring way possible. In summary.... At first glance, The Witness appears to have a lot of things going for it, but when you spend some time with it you find out that all it really has to fall back on are the puzzles themselves. The problem with this is that the puzzles are presented to you in such a monotonous fashion that by the endgame I was getting pretty bored. Combine this with the non-existent story and un-interactive setting, and this feels like a ""game"" I could play on a piece of paper.Jon Blow wants to make games for smart people and I get that, but there is a difference between not suffering fools and spitting on them. It's been a while since I've played a game that felt so hostile to the player. Some of the stuff the game pulls near the end feels less like an intellectual challenge and more like a big middle finger.If you are a puzzle junkie AND you are good at them, you will probably enjoy this game. If not, look elsewhere. "

												The steep price point is more than justified, The Witness is without overstatement the single most well designed game I've seen. Everything is connected to everything else on The Island. The simplistic, yet complex line puzzles might look similar, but are in fact extremely varied: there's always a new twist to them that gets introduced.The game is however undeniably not for everyone. The puzzles will get hard, and you do need a certain type of logical thinking to get through them.Unfortunately it is near impossible to truly show or explain what The Witness really is. It is a gaming experience that has never been seen before. If you like puzzle games and would like a challenge, buy it right now.

The Witness is probably the most ""pure"" single-player puzzle game in existence in that respect because it's a fully immersive experience that's rewarding, thoughtful, and never too difficult or easy. The perfect level of challenge persists throughout and even if you don't finish it you're going to love every minute you spend with it. 10/10, my personal GOTY so far next to DOOM and Hyper Light Drifter.

												Lets just dive straight into the meat of the game. The puzzles.Some puzzles are quite puzzling and challenging, but quite do-able. Others are pretty easy and self-explanatory... And then there are puzzles that make no freaking sense at all. Those are the puzzles you just try combination after combination after combination trying to figure out the EXACT path you are supposed to travel to complete that puzzle.The game doesn't exactly teach you about the puzzles, you more or less are supposed to just figure it out. Expect to go online and be reading up on the different puzzles and strategies to beat them. Then get used to trial and error before going back to just look up the solved puzzle.It's cool, but with how infuriating some of the puzzles are I can't really recommend this game. A lot of it just resorts to you as a player NEEDING to guess as some puzzle solutions are half-hidden or very unclear.			"

												Initally, I got the impression that I was in an amusement part. Roam the different themed parks at my disgression, ride the rides and participate in the little easter egg ""find-the-hidden-mickey"" between coasters. After tackling a majority of the themed areas, I quickly to the realization that:- EVERY SINGLE GOD DAMN PUZZLE (on a rudimentary level) IS THE ♥♥♥♥ING SAME- Puzzles range from obsurdly easy to illogically contrustcted- Does anything but treat the player's time as precious (ESPECIALLY WITH THE FOOTAGE PUZZLE AND THE BOAT PUZZLE)- The attempts at political/social undertones are far-fetched- The ""find-the hidden-mickey"" aspect ranges from blatantly obvious to you're going to need a ♥♥♥♥ing protractor to get the circle just right.The game is quite pretty with extremely vibrant but not blindingly bright colors, the varity in themed areas was a pleasent surprise, The open world aspect (IMO) is done quite well with what you're being given. The direction of progression is obvious but not forced and exploring is relaxing.Overall, its yet another game that is increadibly beautiful to look at, but crippled by repetative yet irronically incohesive puzzles. At 40$, hell ♥♥♥♥ing no.... Maybe at 10-15$ MAX....			"

												Would only recommend if you really like line puzzle games. While the island is beautiful and alluring, unless you are very into the central mechanic, you won't have much motivation to press forward. It would have been nice if at some point line puzzles became fully environmental puzzles, or if you could interact with the beautiful environment in any meaningful way, but unfortunately that is not the case.

												""The Witness"" is an incredible game and holds many secrets. On the island you do not only discover a huge amount of puzzles, but you also gain an insight into philosphy, meditation, Zen and much more. I would say it is more than just a ""puzzle game"" - in my eyes it is a completely new genre and very unique. Of course, some details make you remember the Myst games, e.g. the final flight sequence or a couple of sounds and animations. Although I played the game on a six-year-old laptop, the island looked great even on minimal graphics settings. ""The Witness"" can be very hard sometimes, but it is definitely worth a try. It took me 33 hours to finish the game on my own, even though I have not yet solved all the puzzles on the island (which is not required to finish the game). I certainly will return on the island soon to discover more.			"

												I have played this in excess of 80 hours if you combine what I played on the Playstation 4 and without a doubt I can say that I will recommend this game fully if you want a great puzzle game.   The controls are solid although a bit touchy with a mouse, but that is coming from a person whom played it on the Playstation 4 first.   Visuals are stunning if you have the capibilty to run it at the highest graphics settings. Music although mostly non-existant is actually a plus in this game & the sounds of the game is amazing.   The lack of traditional tutorials are actually a bouns.   I hope everyone takes the opertunity to buy this game & support a great development team.			"

												I really wanted to be able to reccomend this game but after playing it through I honestly can't. From the overhead view of the map I saw this beautiful world like the island of myst and out of nostalgic glee I snapped it up and started playing straight away. I encountered my first line puzzle in a long laboratory-esque corridor, which seemed fitting. I then emerged bright eyed into a beautiful and genorously coloured environment, each area with its own unique charm. I looked around to find my fist puzzle, ready to see what strange environmental mechanisms would stand in my way when I saw, another line puzzle.I hope you like line puzzles, I really do, because it is all you will do in this game. Not to spoil it but you will literally start seeing line puzzles in the environment. Not that you get to see the environment much, just plonked in Ipads with a cereal box puzzle plastered on the screens. Not only do the puzzles become increasingly boring, they also get arbitrarily more difficult, in a way the dosen't feel earned or deserved.This game feels like the environment was built first and then some spod emulating the riddler with less creativity decided to scatter jarring puzzles everywhere and lock every door.If you like to listen to podcasts and waste time acheiving nothing, buy this game, Otherwise don't bother, you're not missing anything.

												This game is Oh. My. God. good. Without spoiling anything, it drops you on an island without telling you what you have to do. But it teaches you what you have to do. The pace at which the game grows is very linear. You're super lost at first, but the game teaches you what to do with this confusion which is awesome. Also, there's a meta part to the game that blew my mind when I found it, and if you play a second time through, you find things you never can't even access in the first playthrough. 10/10 Very fun, very well made, makes you think about a lot of cool stuff.

												This game is so good I couldn't keep myself away from it for too long!The atmosphere is amazing. I love the colour palettes the developers chose, and the way there is so much happening on this fairly small island. They packed so much stuff in there! It looks so meticulously designed!The puzzles are quite well thought out. It takes this kind of path tracing puzzle concept and runs with it; it goes through many different rule sets all based on this one type of puzzle. The way in which it is done is awe-inspiring. I found myself excited whenever I figured out what one of those variations was.The game definitely lived up to the promise of a challenge - nothing was given for free (or at least, not much). However, as a puzzle game fan (and adventure game fan) myself, I found that to be quite entertaining. I was often faced with a puzzle that I at first thought was impossible. However, in every case, I would come around to the answer. It was really cool how they managed to get the puzzle's rule set accross without actually saying anything. I love games that give me these mental exercises without holding my hand, but still make it just enough of a challenge to be solvable without breaking your brain.The only drawback with the game (and it isn't a big one at all), is that some of the clips you find on the island are a little long. They vary from 10 minutes to more than an hour. Thankfully, though, there aren't that many to find. If you play this game, you'll know why I know about the lengths... ;) The videos overall (mixed with the audio clips strewn about the landscape) give you an interesting mix of perspectives on the human condition. However, I do feel that while they don't exactly fit within the context of this game, they do provide food for thought.In short, I would recommend this game to any puzzle or adventure game fan out there. As some have mentioned, there isn't much of a story, but I really don't care. It gives just enough to be mysterious, and that's enough for me.			"

												Spoilers: I have 100% completed this game.  Then I went to bed.  When I woke up I found myself asking a few questions about it.  First, did I enjoy the experience while playing it?  Yes.  I enjoy a good puzzle and this game offered plenty of them.  They varied in difficulty and strategy and combined in interesting and creative ways.  I relished the ""Ah-Ha"" moments of finally solving a puzzle that had been stumping you for 10 minutes.  It was a well realized and truly enjoyable experience.  Second, would I play this game again?  No.  The primary issue of this game is that once it is learned then no challenge remains.  This is hardly a unique criticism of a puzzle game as the same can be said of Myst and it is still held up as a classic, but it does degrade the overall joy the game can bring me.  I have found that the best games are ones that can be played over and over for years bringing something new each time.  Unfortunately this game can not offer that.  Third, what did it all mean?  On this I am unsure.  If we are to take it at face value as a puzzle game then it holds up well for the reasons given above.  This does however raise an issue.  If the game is really about just solving puzzles then the only plot and story we are given is philosophical readings then why bother to include it those readings at all?  The Witness quickly teaches you that nothing is arbitrary.  If something is shaped in a strange or odd way, then it is a puzzle.  The game, from the onset, demonstrates that it is not haphazardly constructed and that all of the minute things that are included are deeply necessary for some reason that may not yet be clear.  It shows you that if you just dig deeper you can find the answer; you can solve the puzzle.  From this core concept of the game we must conclude that the philosophical readings have a function, a purpose, in the larger game.  Unfortunately, that is the flaw in this experience.  No plot resolution is given.  (Yes even with both endings.)  Saying ""It was all a dream, or a simulation"" doesn't inform the philosophy discussed.  It doesn't illuminate the goals or purpose of the people whose voices we have heard.  Who are they?  What are they doing?  Why should we care?  The game spends its entire span showing you that answers will come to those persistent and clever enough to find them.  Then it changes the rules with 10 seconds left on the clock and unfortunately declares: None of that Matters.  It wasn't real.  This is a critical mishandling of an otherwise perfect setup.  I can and have thought of literally 10 better endings since I started writing this.  Sadly this game falls woefully short in that respect.  With that said, perhaps overly harshly, I still did truly enjoy the game as I played it and I will recommend it to friends.  Unfortunately, I will be recommending it as a puzzle solving game.  Just a puzzle solving game.  This had the potential to be so much more.  There is perhaps nothing so tragic as a wasted opportunity.			"

												If a peaceful brain-teaser game, a mind-bending scavenger hunt, and an existential crisis decided to have a threesome together, this wonderful game would be the glorious miracle child they conceived.The Witness is the best puzzle game I've ever played, there is so much unique and engaging content to explore and discover it's insane to think this is an indie game. There are hundreds of puzzles to be solved and plenty more secrets waiting to be found. The $40 pricetag is pretty daunting, I know, but I don't feel cheated at all considering what I've gotten out of it and catching it on sale is an absolute bargain.**Definitely take a look at other reviews if you have color blindness, deafness, or you become motion sick easily because some of the puzzles are centered around color or sound and I know people have had problems with those. You can always avoid those puzzles or use a guide if you need to but it's worth noting for sure.**			"

												Brilliant. I would recommend this game only for people who have a passion for puzzle-gaming.I would not recommend to do the game with a soluce. The full satisfaction of finishing a puzzle by yourself is really the engine and the motivation. Solving each puzzle with a soluce kills the self-satisfaction. I agree with some people saying that a few puzzles are very tricky or are sometimes in contradiction with the learning steps. I admit that for a few puzzles, luck was with me (if there are not too many combinations, I was trying each combination until I realize at the end what was the real solution...)			"

												Really one of the best games I've played in ages. I'm not generally a fan of puzzle games. In fact, this game, Portal, and The Talos Principle are probably the only puzzle games I've finished. But this game just hooked me in and made me constantly want more. By taking away the constant stream of rewards that we're used to in modern games, it initially left me feeling a little cast off. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to play through a game if they weren't going to pull me through it, but once I started taking satisfaction in the completion of these truly mind-bending puzzles, I found myself absolutely enraptured. This is an experience I wish I could have again, and am so incredibly happy that the Witness turned out how Jonathan Blow wanted it to.			"

												The witness is a beautiful game and it was nice to play for a few hours, but then it became increasily boring until I decided to quit and move on to other games. 90% of the gameplay is you staring at some kind of maze puzzle on a panel, the other 10% is walking around the island looking for more panels to stare at. There seems to be some kind of story, but in 16h I didn't see much of it, just some audiotapes of someone reading a text aloud. It was 16h of puzzle on a panel after puzzle on a panel after puzzle on a panel OMG I spent 16h staring a puzzles  on  panels!			"

												If you like puzzles, this is your game, end of story. If not, it's not your game. I am surprised by some of the negative remarks.People say there's too much of the same puzzle. Well, you bought a puzzle game, so that's astute of you to notice. And if you think the puzzles never change, then you quit after 5 minutes. There is only one type of puzzle, but it's a deliberate choice. This game uses one basic method of interaction - find a path through a maze - and layers different rulesets on top of it. Some of the later puzzles are nothing short of meta, where your solution will end up represented in the ""real world,"" or you will have to solve mazes on top of each other. Really, the game takes one idea and does it perfect, taking it as far as it can go. I personally dislike when games try to have ""variety"" but only end up doing 5,000 thing mediocre. If you want something else, buy something else and quit whining.People also say it's pretentious. Well, it's Jonathan Blow. What did you expect? I honestly didn't find the game itself pretentious, but the audio logs and videos you find throughout the game certainly are. But hey, you don't *have* to watch/listen to any of them, so if you dislike that kind of thing, no harm, no foul.People also say the ending is terrible. Well, there's no way to say this without spoilers... but you didn't actually find the ending!People also say it's too much money. I sympathize with that because $40 is sometimes a person's entire games budget for a month, or season, or even year. Just wait until it goes on sale. Whatever you do, DON'T pirate it. Don't be that guy. You think you're sending the message to Jonathan Blow that he needs to reduce the price, but the real message you send (and the one he got) is that he should put DRM on his next game. Don't. Just wait until a sale. I think it is worth the $40, though, so if you are able to spend that kind of cash and you like puzzle games you have no excuse.People also say it has no replay value. This makes sense because I never played Myst or Riven again after I beat them once. Oh wait that was sarcasm.Just buy the damn thing			"

												There really wasn't something there to glue all those different areas together, there was no gradual scaling in the complexity of the puzzles and it was plain frustrating to wander around seeing all these panels with no indication whatsoever as to how to solve the new rules that randomly pepper up in the many panels. I saw the ending on YouTube and I'm glad I didn't waste my time proding around a desolate world to get there.Check out a Let's Play of it and see if it suits you, because it might, but be aware that this is a very divisive game so make sure you understand where you're stepping before buying. Regret may ensue.EDIT: I had forgotten about this, but then I read another review stating the same - It made me feel nauseous - and I'm not saying this has anything to do with the gameplay.

												This game is amazing. The atmosphere is dreamy and wonderful. The puzzles are taught with no words via small examples first and when they finally click they make you feel like a genius. It is not an action game but for me it's definitely one of the best games I played in a long time.			"

												There really wasn't something there to glue all those different areas together, there was no gradual scaling in the complexity of the puzzles and it was plain frustrating to wander around seeing all these panels with no indication whatsoever as to how to solve the new rules that randomly pepper up in the many panels. I saw the ending on YouTube and I'm glad I didn't waste my time proding around a desolate world to get there.Check out a Let's Play of it and see if it suits you, because it might, but be aware that this is a very divisive game so make sure you understand where you're stepping before buying. Regret may ensue.EDIT: I had forgotten about this, but then I read another review stating the same - It made me feel nauseous - and I'm not saying this has anything to do with the gameplay. I literally felt it.			"

												The Witness is quite a weird and unique game. You find yourself on a beautiful island painted with radiant colours and filled with line puzzles. The environment is quite captivating and just wondering around is a pleasure in itself. The main strength of the game, though, lies in puzzles.I generally like puzzles and challenges so when I discovered this game along with statements like ""it's really hard to complete"", I instantely knew that I have to buy it. I can say now with certainty that it was the right choice. I really love the way the game teaches you how to solve puzzles. You start by easier ones and once you figured out the logic behind them you move onto the more complicated ones. It really feels like the game talks to you and I have never experienced anything quite like that in a game before. Sometimes it takes a long time to solve a puzzle and some people complain that even though you solve a really hard puzzle, you won't get a proper reward, but for me, personally, every puzzle I've completed felt like an accomplishment and I didn't really need any other rewards. When a hard puzzle opened up a way to even a harder puzzle, I usually just yelled ""Bring it on!"" at the scrreen. (Maybe I'm a masochist??) I am proud that I managed to complete the game without any walkthrough and that I solved the ""red door"" puzzle in the shipwreck not by brute-force but by actually understanding the puzzle. I promise you, there is a logic behind all the puzzles, nothing is random. If you are clueless on how to solve one, just look somewhere else and come back once you've learned the principle (or try to focus more on your environment). Mechanisms behind some of the puzzles were so brilliant I had to laugh. (Maybe I'm mad??)Seriously, if you like puzzles, just buy this game! If you don't like puzzles, I'm not sure why you're even looking at it. Buying it just because of the visuals is probably not worth it. Honestly, the ""hidden/nonexistent"" storyline in the game was too abstract for me. I listened to all the voice messages and watched all the videos and some of them are quite interesting and worth thinking about, but overall it didn't make much sense. The game is most likely intended as ""open for interpretation,"" but I didn't get any clear message out of it except for some hints that making of the game was a pain. I feel like the story aspect could have been done better. Nevertheless, it didn't bother me very much and I would still recommend you to buy this game! I enjoyed it very much.			"

												A mix of positive and negative. I cannot really recommend it, and under no circumstances should you even consider this game if you have any visual or audio impairment, whether in your computer or your head. The game will require things that are physically impossible for you and not even explain that.When it works, it works, and when it doesn't, you Google and probably find that you were wasting your time because you needed to solve some other puzzles before this one had enough information/pieces/whatever. If that sounds fun, this is for you.Puzzles do not explain their rules, so you are stuck with trial and error to find what this puzzle wants. Except that maybe there were a series of introductory puzzles for this rule type, but you happened to walk into an advanced puzzle before a basic one and nothing explained that the rules changed. ""What do you want from me?!"" If that sounds fun, this is for you.Half the puzzle is finding the puzzles. Some need a chain of other puzzles or precise placement. Some need to be activated in a long series of steps, so make sure to backtrack and see if finishing puzzles A, C, D, E, F, and K opened B.Not friendly to visual impairments. Some things look like logic puzzles but are instead puzzles of ""can you walk to the right spot and turn at the right angle to find a visual effect that just gives you the answer?"" Once you have that down, you get multiple steps, like (1) find the puzzle, (2) activate it, (3) find the right angle for part a, (4) find the switch to change the puzzle's angle, (5) find the right angle for part b, (6) maybe repeat those steps for a few letters, and (7) put it together and answer (from the right spot) (from the right angle). That probably sounds fun to some folks, so this is for you. I am told it does the same for audio impairments later; I have not gotten that far.This may be surprising for some players or developers, but there is a range of human visual function and memory. Some people cannot see some colors. If a puzzle requires color vision, the game is over for those players at that point, and they will not even see why until they Google it. Some people have literally no visual memory or ability to picture things in their heads. If a puzzle requires combining multiple visuals, that could be surmountable with screenshots. And so on with other perception difficulties.I am going to play a bit further in search of epiphanies, but the mix of ""figure out the rules, we won't tell you"" and ""sometimes the rule is neurologically unlikely for you to even perceive"" is bad for me, like giving a game requiring pixel-perfect placement to someone with Parkinson's.

												This might be the most polarizing game experience of my life... On one hand, The Witness is both beautiful and brilliant from an artistic and design sense. The lighting, materials and rendering are pure eye candy. The entire island integrates perfectly to form a continuous chain of incredibly intelligent puzzles. On the other hand, The Witness is also one of the most boring, poorly paced and non sensical games I have ever played. The story is told through audio logs which have no consitant theme and are mostly told out of context. While the rendering is great, the envirronment itself is bland comprised mostly of generic trees, rocks, cave walls, brick walls, wood planks, etc. Almost nothing has character in this world. The vast majority of the puzzles consist of standing in front of a grid and drawing lines to separate different icons. This gets very old and repetitive. Regardless of the low entertainment value, I have to reccomend this game beacuse it is just too inteligently designed to pass up. There are a lot of great ideas here.  Everyone should witness at least the first few hours of brilliance before the repetitive bordem sets in.			"

												The Witness pushes the envelope and demonstrates what can be done with video games as an artistic canvas. It succeeds on every level, graphics and game play are both outstanding, but structurally this is peerless. It is not only the antithesis of modern gaming trends but an achievement that transcends the medium. For the first time we have a game that can stand along side the best offerings from the worlds of cinema and literature. It is beautiful, deep, mysteroius and meaningful in ways that make all other games seem simplistic and shallow. I know that even the game's most ardent fans have said that this is not a game for everyone, but please, please try it. There are many who won't fancy The Witness who will then play it and find themselves drawn in to this amazing game. The beauty, the detail and the variety of the island alone could probably justify the purchase. It wont take long before you realize the genius and the depth of The Witness and many, like myself, will conclude that this is a masterpiece and the best video game yet made.			"

No story, no drive to go ahead and ... little spolier ... no ending either.They realy tried hard to make a ""mystery"" of where, why, who, purpose etc. but at the end, the real mystery is, why you should play completely empty (real word for the ""mystery"") game.

												This might be the most polarizing game experience of my life... On one hand, The Witness is both beautiful and brilliant from an artistic and design sense. The lighting, materials and rendering are pure eye candy. The entire island integrates perfectly to form a continuous chain of incredibly intelligent puzzles. On the other hand, The Witness is also one of the most boring, poorly paced and non sensical games I have ever played. The story is told through audio logs which have no consitant theme and are mostly told out of context. While the rendering is great, the envirronment itself is bland comprised mostly of generic trees, rocks, cave walls, brick walls, wood planks, etc. Almost nothing has character in this world. The vast majority of the puzzles consist of standing in front of a grid and drawing lines to separate different icons. This gets very old and repetitive. Regardless of the low entertainment value, I have to reccomend this game beacuse it is just too inteligently designed to pass up. There are a lot of great ideas here.  Everyone should witness at least the first few hours of brilliance before the repetitive bordem sets in.			"

												There are definitely some nice puzzles here, which may keep you entertained for a while. But most of the game is not so much the solving of puzzles, as guessing what the about 15 different symbols are supposed to mean.Each symbol is one ""rule"" you have to follow to solve the puzzle and apart from the tetris symbols they give no indication of their meaning. I ended up reading online which symbol meant what as i like actual puzzles (logical), not wild guessing and almost infinite trial&error ways to learn these meanings of symbols.If you manage to follow the path through game from easy to hard puzzles you have a much easier time to learn the rules, but as it is of an open world kind of style with hard puzzles hidden at the same places as the easy ones you would have to have a lot of luck and running around to find the easy ones first.

												Got the game from the ""Humble Monthly"", I really enjoyed The Talos Principle and thought I'd give this game a go.Played 15 hours approx, had some fun, overall feeling somewhat disappointed.Liked:-Nice aesthetics (Probably the best feature of the game)-Learning the puzzle mechanics was fun-Astonished how far they could stretch the ""drag a path to the end"" basic puzzle designDisliked:-Finding the ""Puzzle rules tutorials"" is annoying since there's no indication anywhere where they are, you basically have to run around hoping you run into them.-Gets really repetitive once you figure out all the ""puzzle rules""-Sometimes it feels like the game throws you to the hard puzzles too quickly (Blue tetris blocks really come to mind)-I'm tone deaf and the sound based puzzles felt like I was being cheated.-The whole end game (mountain) puzzles felt like a ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to my face, especially the ending itself.-Movement speed is really slow compared to how big the map is-Some areas require you to solve the same puzzle several times to move between them, and then wait as the slowest mechanics ever move your platform to the other area, and then you realize in order to get back you have to do that again. -Don't know if the boat was supposed to be a ""fast travel"", since it's so slow (even at full throttle) it's better to just walk to where you want to go.-Often the game felt like it's being annoying on purpose, either forcing you to take screenshots, travel a long corridor only to have nothing on the other side (Closed door most likely), or the audio logs being so tiny I only realized they were a thing halfway through the game. -Audio logs felt pretentious and detached from the game, maybe there's a ""true ending"" that makes sense of them but honestly I'm not interested enough to figure it out.

												Starting The Witness I hoped for a good game – I loved Antichamber, Portal and Talos Principle and I was hoping for something similar. I was disappointed. There’s no story in the game and no introduction to puzzle solving mechanics. It wouldn’t be much of a problem if mechanics stayed consistent. Unfortunately once functioning of puzzle mechanics is discovered than there’s no guarantee that game won’t change the rules all of sudden which it does! It ruins the experience. It’s just like someone said “Oh, you just spent 20 minutes discovering how the puzzle work? Let’s change the rules completely! I don’t care if the puzzle looks almost the same like before. Figure new way out of this”. What’s more a lot of riddles depends not on your logical skills but on being observant paying attention to the environment. All in all everything comes to try & error mechanic which I just hate. It’s illogical. You’re just hoping to think like an author of puzzles instead of actually using your brain. I mean, good puzzles are based on some logical fundaments. If you’re creating riddle intended to solve, you can’t think of everything you want. You need to base your thoughts on some logical background or leave some clues of your thought process. Without it you can create the most ridiculous enigmas which actually can never be solved. Or rather surely, some people given enough time will solve it, but it’ll never be as rewarding as actually figuring things out based on things I mentioned. Even though I figured out some of the puzzles I couldn’t help the feeling that’s all of it is pointless. If there was a bit of mystery and story behind the game than maybe I could be dragged in. Instead we get a game which ultimately is a set of riddles – nothing more. Once you finish some of it you just loose the appetite for more. Game had the potential. Pity it wasn’t used.			"

												The Witness pushes the envelope and demonstrates what can be done with video games as an artistic canvas. It succeeds on every level, graphics and game play are both outstanding, but structurally this is peerless. It is not only the antithesis of modern gaming trends but an achievement that transcends the medium. For the first time we have a game that can stand along side the best offerings from the worlds of cinema and literature. It is beautiful, deep, mysteroius and meaningful in ways that make all other games seem simplistic and shallow. I know that even the game's most ardent fans have said that this is not a game for everyone, but please, please try it. There are many who won't fancy The Witness who will then play it and find themselves drawn in to this amazing game. The beauty, the detail and the variety of the island alone could probably justify the purchase. It wont take long before you realize the genius and the depth of The Witness and many, like myself, will conclude that this is a masterpiece and the best video game yet made.			"

Good thing there are 400 more puzzles I can do before this one!5th hour: I've got three lasers done already and it's only been about an hour, I don't know why people say it takes at least 12 hours to beat!!!6th hour: *checks the time*f@!k.9/10.  the 1 point missing is for the music you have to provide yourself.

												I recommend this game with a warning. The way I see it, the payoff you get from buying this game is the aesthetics and the puzzles. Slight spoiler:  The normal puzzles are very similar in form, so many people might feel like the game gets stale after a while. There is also no major payoff as far as story/plot goes.  I would not recommend this game if you are the sort of person who easily gets tired of simple puzzles (that is simple, not easy). The game is also fairly expensive for the content, but you can spend a considerable amount of time completing the game 100%. It looks great and is pretty relaxing.			"

												This game, The witness is the indie-puzzle game.As a puzzle-lover, I like this game very much!This game offers various types of puzzle with some basic tutorials.Even though there is no story to keep me to solve the puzzles, I like the puzzles itself.Thus, I think this game could be briefed as below.ProsVery sceneric graphic!!Puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.Conshell of puzzles [if you don't like puzzles]Lack of stories [compared to Portal, The Talos Principle]Somewhat expensive price [$ 39.99] Totally, I recommend this game to those love puzzle itself, otherwise it is merely the beautiful trash.

												This is an absolutely marvelous game that I really enjoyed playing. Despite what other people may say, there is a story in the game, but it is (purposefully) very well hidden. You might play this game for hours and hours and not find a shred of story. That's not a bad thing: this game is still awesome even without any story at all, because the puzzles are great. However, once you find out what the game *is* trying to tell you, the experience becomes even better.			"

												At the beginning, this game seems funny. It's very challenging and sort of makes you open your mind, see things from new perspectives, be creative, think laterally. But later in game, it gets kind of stressfull, as it gets out of ideas and instead of adding more mechanics, it simply puts obstacles that get on your nerves.			"

												I am at a loss for what to say in reviewing this game.  While it has all the elements that are required to define it as a video game, I find it difficult to simply lump it into that category which, on the whole, contains so very many things that are so dissimilar to The Witness as to bear virtually no resemblance to it.  A technical manual for operating an industrial machine, a government report on options to boost supply chain efficiency, a bodice-ripper novella, the Bible - these are all books.  What clarity of understanding is gained by lumping them all together, as though all books were basically the same kind of thing?This is the problem (at least, the reviewing problem) I have when it comes to say anything about The Witness.  It is an artefact that has been made in a specific way to be interacted with in order to provide you an experience.  I could try to review this game, but the game itself is not what I would actually be talking about.  Anything that I might try to tell you that would explain why I love this game would ultimately be about me and my experiences, and it would only be about The Witness in the most indirect and unhelpful way, for you.The Witness has made me feel very uncomfortable.  It has shaken me.  It has elated me.  It has brought me into the light of new understanding about basic elements of my existence, and my way of relating to it and the existence of others.  I feel a renewed capacity for awe; the world and my self are more glorious and more terrible for it.  I am more, and less, than when I began The Witness.  Long after I no longer launch the executable, I will still be ""playing"" this ""game"".  I approached it openly, made a place for it within me, and invited it in.  The most important part of this game is not taking place on the computer or the screen, but within the player.  I cannot say whether this game will be worth anything to you, because more than any other thing of this kind I have ever interacted with, the experiences this game produces depends on the player.Yet, in spite of this, I am compelled to recommend it to you.  Don't look anything up online.  Don't read anything else.  Just start the game, and pay attention.  Think about where you are and what you are doing.  Perhaps you will not find anything like what I did.  But I would say that you owe it to yourself to try, as what I found were experiences that expanded and enriched my humanity - and that I desperately wish every person could have.			"

												The Witness is about exploration and puzzles. Solutions to puzzles allow you to explore new areas, and exploration of areas allows you to learn rules to solve puzzles. Amazingly, early on you can progress by assuming simplistic solutions to the puzzles, but as the game goes on you need to challenge your assumptions and refine your understanding of the basic rules.The game has no story. The second you look for answers online the Witness loses it's appeal. The game provides solutions to puzzles, not answers to story. This game rewards you by teaching you how to solve puzzles.There were moments of realization in this game that far exceeded any plot twist in other games. One moment in particular (a moment that can happen at differeent times/places, depending on the player) makes you view the entire game in a different way, and is more exciting than anything I've encountered in gaming in a really long time.

												The Witness is a fab game. It is super rewarding and super challenging. Before going into the witness I did a bit of reasearch about the game and the puzzles. THIS HELPED ME GET INTO THE GAME. There are 2 types of puzzle, logical and observational. logical puzzules are exactly what you think, however when you walk up to a puzzle and have literally no ♥♥♥♥ing clue how to solve it, this is an observational puzzle. This means that you have to look at the puzzle from a different persepctive, for example look at a tree or at some patterns in a wall. I am yet to complete this game as I have found it to be brutal due to the total savagery that is the later areas of the game that takes everything you know and says ♥♥♥♥ you and reverses everything that you have learned so far. So, the main issues: the price. Yes this game is so over priced it's unreal! Thankfully it has very few updates, is complete and there is no online so in a sense you won't be falling behind by waiting for a sale. If you want it now go to♥♥♥♥♥ it'll save a whole lotta money <3 Also, did I mention this game is incredibly pretty!			"

												This was good! If you're on this page then you probably have heard a general summary of how this game works. If that sounds at all like ""your kind of game"", then you will probably be very happy with The Witness, as its execution on indie-puzzle-FPS-exploration is top notch, and there's really never been another game quite like it. It's kind of like a ""Metroidvania"" game where you gain new abilities to reach new areas and defeat new challenges...except instead of your character gaining, like, new boots that let you jump higher, YOU, the player, learn things that let you access new areas and solve new puzzles you couldn't do before.  The whole thing is a lush learning experience with an entirely new type of brainteaser, like the first time you ever sat down with a crossword puzzle or a sudoku book.If you are not super into puzzles, probably not for you; it's not quite on the level of something like Portal, where it's going to convert folks into puzzle diehards who would never have been otherwise. But like I said, if the basic description sounds like your cup of tea, then you'll like it quite a lot.			"

												This game is a one-of-a-kind Myst-like experience. Its a sheer marvel whose brilliance never ceases to amaze. Well, at least it never ceases to amaze for the hours of game time that leads up to consulting a walkthrough for all the puzzles and pixelhunting recorders, that you'll inevitably miss.This game isn't a PERFECT marvel. For one, the ending is barely there. The WORST ending will require you to reload an earlier save. I didn't know that reloading was an option, so I spent 18 more hours cursing and redoing the entire game world, until I got back to where I was, so at this point I'm sick of this marvellous game. 53 hours. That's how long I spent with this game.I'll commit the name Jonathan Blow to memory. He has distinguished himself as a developer wonder with this game.			"

												The Witness is a beautiful puzzle island with some light philosophical elements. Every detail of this game has been sculpted immaculately. I was pleasantly surprised, considering the game's metacritic score. If you like puzzle games, I'm confident that you'll like this one. If you are looking for a puzzler with a narrative, similar to Portal or The talos Prinicple, you won't find it here.I should mention that I paid 12 dollars for the game through Humble Bundle. I'm not sure I recommend it at full price, considering what 40 bucks can buy you, but I'd happily pay 20-30.			"

												Aaaah. It started so great. And it still is so great in many ways. This title is in the middle for me, but it leans slighlty more to a no recommendation. I hope that this review can make you deside better if this is for you or not. Don't take my review as the game is no good. It is a good game, but not for me, and hence I wouldn't recommend it. Read on!Ultimately it comes down to if you enjoy the game-mechanic or not, and if it has a satiesfying conclusion. Well, in my case, it doesn't, even if starts off well.Look, if you like serious, die-hard, puzzle-challenges and have loads of patience, this game is for you, and I will give it a great recommendation. The puzzle mechanic is interesting and eventuelly very challenging. But I feel the game gets lost in what it tries to tell. The premise doesn't hold up, and doesn't evolve well.The good:Well, I loved how it started. I really enjoyed ""witnessing"" everything around you, finding solutions and ways to see things in a new perspecive by simply looking a little deeper around you. I truly enjoyed finding patterns in the environment. The game also looks and sounds great. It is enjoyable to walk around taking in the sites. I almost felt it could be kind of a meditation practice just walking around, observing and solving fairly easy puzzles (in the beginning) if you simply take your time and look. There is a lot of puzzles, and lots of extras even after ""completing"" the game.The not so good:Well, perhaps I don't enjoy puzzle-games as much as another. But for me, the game just becomes too hard, too fast, AND the point of the game is lost: In the beginning a solution feels like ""Oh, I got it, I see now, I understand!"" and it relies on you observing around you, looking deeper. The later puzzles do not have the same ""aha"" moments and evolution like the way it started so beautifully, just more complications. It almost feels like the puzzles weren't challenging enough, so ""complications"" were added. For example, ""follow line to end"", but later ""follow line to end while the puzzle is blurry and spinning"". That doesn't feel clever, just annoying. It is like solving a math problem while your kid is jumping on you, screaming in your ear. You still know the solution, it is just harder to do, but for other reasons, not because the problem itself is interesting.For example, after a while (depending on how you traverse the island of course) you will start to encounter tetris symbols in the puzzles. No spoilers here, but they are not easy to solve. Because these puzzles depend on visualising the solution. And there is no clever solution or real ""aha"" moment here except a lot of mindbeding visualizations that take a while to solve, trust me. Sure, the easy ones are ok at first, but after a while the fun just stopped, dead. And then it got even worse.It feels like the initial mechanics are ""observe"", while the later mechanics are ""visualize"", and here is becomes really really tricky at times, especially if you are not so good at visualizing. And I feel the game loses its premise, where the ""witnessing"" is now happening inside your skull more than in the actual game. You don't need the surroundings in order to solve the puzzles at later stages. You need to be really good at visualizing the solutions. Yes, not all puzzles, but the ones with tetris symbols in them, or when the puzzle itself starts to ""spin out of control"".And there are so many puzzles, that you eventually tire, because each take a while to solve at later stages. Sure, if you like this, then this is a paradise of puzzles, litterally. But it is then more like doing hard sudoku (or similar) on the train. The puzzle is the only thing, not the surroundings. It doesn't matter what happens around you. What is the point of being on a beautiful island? None, and I think the game utilized this idea really well in the beginning, but not later on.I started to look up the solutions online. For one or two puzzles, this can happen to the best of us and no big deal, but for when you start to feel you have to look all of them up... The alternative was to sit and think and vizualize which took me out of the game completely, and like the above mentioned sudoko on the train example - I'm not in the game, I'm in my own head and the immersion is lost. Alternatively I could just try a solution randomly, but that is not that much fun either after a lot of tries. I don't feel like I am learning either like in the earlier puzzles. I also though what is the point in playing this game, looking up all the answers? Exactly. So, I did not finish this game. But got about 15 hours out of it. I still enjoyed 75% of that time.If you managed all by yourself to solve all these puzzles, I admire your wits AND your free time.I loved this game for the idea of exploring your surroundings and finding solutions. I hated it for bending my mind in half while different colors flashed in front of my eyes, puzzles started rotating, and those damn tetris puzzles....This game is a masterpiece in many ways no doubt, but a masterpiece where the message got lost and the mechanics became a pain.If you really want to try it, wait for a sale.

												I have many problems with this game, but the two big ones are the puzzle design and the ending. No spoilers, but the ending is extremely dissappointing and tells you nothing about the game's possible story. The puzzles are sometimes ridiculously hard requring pen and paper - which if included in the game via some type of UI widget, might not have been so obnoxious. Along with that, there is no recognition of options for people with diseases such as colorblindness or epilepsy. I happen to get migraines from flashing colors and I get motion sick from fast movement - the end of the game has lots of this, which made it not only frustating but very physically sickening. This is a puzzle game for masochists and I recieved about half an hour of fun out of it. Only buy it through a sale or something, because it is not worth the money, unless you like to punish yourself.			"

												I don't think there is a good way to convey my opinions of this game. I generally very much enjoy puzzle games but I didn't really enjoy this one, I ended up finishing it out of feeling that I should instead of wanting to. The basic structuring of the game is that you draw lines, these lines vary quite a bit in what they need to accomplish though. You start out in a small tutorial area that only teaches you to draw a line and follow wires it doesn't explain at all that lines will need to function in 20 different ways through the entire game.The game is easy for the most part once you learn those 20 different line functions but the game never explains any of them to you. This is very frustrating when you first start the game and walk up to a puzzle that ""You have to seperate these colored blocks from the three other colors while pairing those stars and making that shape and if you get it wrong you have to waste time doing the last puzzle again."" This is an example of a puzzle intended to be done later in the game but that itself is another problem, the game doesn't provide any direction for you to follow so that you progress properly it gives you a pretty world that starts off very confusing. In most puzzle games I am generally against using guides but in this one due to the amount of puzzles and the obnoxiousness of having to repeat them if you fail I would actually encourage using a guide if you get stuck. However at the end of the game there are puzzles that are randomly generated as well and they can be unsolvable so a guide won't help here.While I didn't enjoy the gameplay and puzzle design I did really enjoy the general aesthetic of the game. The environments are very well designed and obviously had countless hours spent on making them perfect, this is apparent in how many hidden environmental puzzles there are thankfully they are entirely optional to complete or the game would be harder and about 6X longer.Overall I think the game might be worth buying for anyone who likes puzzle games but only around a $15 price point not $40. If you want a first person puzzle game The Talos Principle is much better.			"

												Usually I really like puzzle games, even though ironically, I tend to suck at them. So given that people’s reactions to this game were so positive, I was quite anxious to see that this was part of the last Humble Monthly Bundle. Because I had a feeling that paying $40 for this game would be quite steep from what I’ve seen and heard, but at $1.50 I’ll certainly take a look.Having now played the game I can’t really say that I enjoyed myself for the bigger part of the experience. The developer may claim that this game has over 500 puzzles, but in reality, there are maybe a dozen repeated ad nauseam. Because the central mechanic is based around line-drawing puzzles that incorporate a variety of different rules you have to follow. Some are based on blocked paths, sometimes with the addition of a symmetrical line being drawn on the board so you have to keep track of two lines simultaneously. Some require you to divide the board up as indicated by Tetris shapes or by colored rectangles and suns and all of them have different rule that sometimes get combined. So in essence there are these few rules that apply spread out over hundreds of more or less identical panels. And it gets boring after a while.Now don’t get me wrong, the game does evoke a sense of wonder. Traversing the island, finding secret passages and making quick progress through the first couple of puzzles is interesting. But eventually, you’ll hit a roadblock. Because the rules are not properly explained at any point. You have to infer them through tutorial puzzles that are way too easy to accidentally solve or brute force your way through, that they hardly ensure you’ve actually understood the concepts they’re trying to teach you. And the fact that the island is open for exploration means that you’ll almost certainly wander into an area that uses rules from other parts of the island that you haven’t even encountered yet. Just take my word and ignore the town at the center of the island until you’ve done everything else, because you’ll be gnashing your teeth. With this lack of direction also comes a lack of narrative. The only payoff for solving these puzzles is opening up doors to even more puzzles. Sometimes you’ll find audiologs and they’re seldom of any use. If you’re lucky, you’ll find a room containing a hexagonal pattern that can be input at a certain point in the game for some videos that ostensibly have to do with what the game is about at its core. But honestly, the game does such a terrible job of informing the player both mechanically and narratively what it wants to be about that I simply couldn’t care less about the artsy fartsy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it’s trying to communicate. Once you get the hang of it, the puzzles become entertaining again during the mid-game and if you keep your eyes open you’ll see environmental puzzles as well hidden literally in plain sight, right before your eyes and that revelation is really cool. However, it just drags on and on with puzzle after puzzle giving you no reward whatsoever. And the difficulty spikes between certain puzzles are insane. Sometimes you’ll be breezing through a handful of puzzles without breaking a sweat but every so often in confronts you with one that you can’t easily solve. And if you’re anything like me, in those situations, you’ll look up guides online to find the solutions because god damn it, I understood the mechanic, I just can’t be arsed to sit here with my thumb up my♥♥♥♥♥for 10 minutes trying to figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out. And once you get to that stage, you’ll notice that none of the guides provide explanations on how they’ve reached the solutions. They’ll just give you screenshots of the correct lines you’ve got to draw, which made me want to choke each and every last one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But that’s not the fault of the game.What is are the people the game will most certainly exclude from playing it. If you have any sort of color deficiency in your vision, just skip this game altogether, there’s no way you’ll be able to beat it on your own. The same goes if somethings wrong with your hearing, some puzzles rely heavily on what you’re able to hear. Speaking of which, for some utterly bizarre reason, there’s no music in this game. The only thing you’ll hear are your footsteps, a few environmental sounds and the aforementioned sound indicators for certain puzzles. In the end, I enjoyed certain sections of the game, no doubt about it. But it just goes on way too long with terrible tutorials and absolutely no payoff whatsoever. I didn’t 100% complete it, because ♥♥♥♥ that noise, but I’ve seen the secret ending on YouTube. Sure, it expands on the point the game has about seeing things from a different perspective, since that also what most of the game is about, but there’s no actual point being delivered, no argument made. It tries to sound deep and meaningful when it isn’t. And as such, I can’t recommend it, especially not at the ludicrous price they’re asking for. Get Antichamber instead, it also taxes your lateral thinking muscles way more gracefully than this with far more varied puzzles. It’s got the same amount of narrative as well but isn’t pretentious about itself and only costs $20, so there you go. Sorry Blow Johnny, didn’t like it as much as I did Braid.			"

												Oh man, this game!Where do I even start?A beautiful adventure game filled with puzzles (even more than you think) with a deep message (if care to explore more than required). It's true that puzzles get kinda repetitive and tedious after a certain time (for me it was around 300th puzzle) but just when I thought that there was nothing in this game that could surprise me I've entered the mountain (bit spoilerish, sorry)...It's my personal Game of the Year 2016 (maybe Obduction will change that).

												Aaaah. It started so great. And it still is so great in many ways. This title is in the middle for me, but it leans slighlty more to a no recommendation. I hope that this review can make you deside better if this is for you or not. Don't take my review as the game is no good. It is a good game, but not for me, and hence I wouldn't recommend it. Read on!Ultimately it comes down to if you enjoy the game-mechanic or not, and if it has a satiesfying conclusion. Well, in my case, it doesn't, even if starts off well.Look, if you like serious, die-hard, puzzle-challenges and have loads of patience, this game is for you, and I will give it a great recommendation. The puzzle mechanic is interesting and eventuelly very challenging. But I feel the game gets lost in what it tries to tell. The premise doesn't hold up, and doesn't evolve well.The good:Well, I loved how it started. I really enjoyed ""witnessing"" everything around you, finding solutions and ways to see things in a new perspecive by simply looking a little deeper around you. I truly enjoyed finding patterns in the environment. The game also looks and sounds great. It is enjoyable to walk around taking in the sites. I almost felt it could be kind of a meditation practice just walking around, observing and solving fairly easy puzzles (in the beginning) if you simply take your time and look. There is a lot of puzzles, and lots of extras even after ""completing"" the game.The not so good:Well, perhaps I don't enjoy puzzle-games as much as another. But for me, the game just becomes too hard, too fast, AND the point of the game is lost: In the beginning a solution feels like ""Oh, I got it, I see now, I understand!"" and it relies on you observing around you, looking deeper. The later puzzles do not have the same ""aha"" moments and evolution like the way it started so beautifully, just more complications. It almost feels like the puzzles weren't challenging enough, so ""complications"" were added. For example, ""follow line to end"", but later ""follow line to end while the puzzle is blurry and spinning"". That doesn't feel clever, just annoying. It is like solving a math problem while your kid is jumping on you, screaming in your ear. You still know the solution, it is just harder to do, but for other reasons, not because the problem itself is interesting.For example, after a while (depending on how you traverse the island of course) you will start to encounter tetris symbols in the puzzles. No spoilers here, but they are not easy to solve. Because these puzzles depend on visualising the solution. And there is no clever solution or real ""aha"" moment here except a lot of mindbeding visualizations that take a while to solve, trust me. Sure, the easy ones are ok at first, but after a while the fun just stopped, dead. And then it got even worse.It feels like the initial mechanics are ""observe"", while the later mechanics are ""visualize"", and here is becomes really really tricky at times, especially if you are not so good at visualizing. And I feel the game loses its premise, where the ""witnessing"" is now happening inside your skull more than in the actual game. You don't need the surroundings in order to solve the puzzles at later stages. You need to be really good at visualizing the solutions. Yes, not all puzzles, but the ones with tetris symbols in them, or when the puzzle itself starts to ""spin out of control"".And there are so many puzzles, that you eventually tire, because each take a while to solve at later stages. Sure, if you like this, then this is a paradise of puzzles, litterally. But it is then more like doing hard sudoku (or similar) on the train. The puzzle is the only thing, not the surroundings. It doesn't matter what happens around you. What is the point of being on a beautiful island? None, and I think the game utilized this idea really well in the beginning, but not later on.I started to look up the solutions online. For one or two puzzles, this can happen to the best of us and no big deal, but for when you start to feel you have to look all of them up... The alternative was to sit and think and vizualize which took me out of the game completely, and like the above mentioned sudoko on the train example - I'm not in the game, I'm in my own head and the immersion is lost. Alternatively I could just try a solution randomly, but that is not that much fun either after a lot of tries. I don't feel like I am learning either like in the earlier puzzles. I also though what is the point in playing this game, looking up all the answers? Exactly. So, I did not finish this game. But got about 15 hours out of it. I still enjoyed 75% of that time.If you managed all by yourself to solve all these puzzles, I admire your wits AND your free time.I loved this game for the idea of exploring your surroundings and finding solutions.

												I'm loving The Witness. It's a beautiful game, and challenges me in a way very different from just about any other puzzle game I can think of. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a brain teaser and something off the beaten path of modern games.Now, for those that do pick up the game, I wanted to offer some tips but can't say too much because the process of discovery is a major part of the game, so here you go.First, PAY ATTENTION. Everything on the island is intentional and there are lots of things you could easily miss if you're not paying attention. Every intricate detail can be important, or at the very least, is worth a second look.Second, IF YOU GET STUCK, MOVE ON. Don't go looking up hints/solutions online every time you're having some difficulties. Due to the way the game is laid out you will not have all the information to solve every puzzle as soon as you come upon them. Even if you do have all the information you may not know exactly how to put it together to form a solution. In these situations just take a break from that puzzle/area and move to the next. Come back later and try again.Along those same lines, EXPLORE. There's much to do and see and learn by exploring and the beauty of the island only increases with every new discovery.Lastly, ENJOY THE JOURNEY. There is an ""end"" in the conventional sense but in my opinion the majority of the fun comes from the journey itself. Take your time. Don't worry about what's next or what's at the end. Simply appreciate what is.			"

												This game is amazing. Sure, NZ$50 is a bit steep. Sure, there isn't really a story (That I know of). But this game makes up for it in challenging puzzles and a less linear game than other puzzle games. And I can't go without mentioning the graphics. They are nothing short of stunning, and deserve to be everyone's wallpaper. Disclaimer: I did get this in a Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay full price for the game			"

												First Impressions:Its been compared to puzzle games like Talos Principle and Portal, made by Johnathan Blow who made Braid. Nice calm puzzle game. It lacks any music so far and doesn't have gamepad support (update its now working?) as advertised, otherwise its a nice game. Its a quick download that takes up little space due to the unique graphic style. The emphasis is on creative or critical thinking, deductive reasoning, finding trends and themes to apply to puzzles, trial and error and some searching. 9/10Just some another puzzle game recommendation: VHS Rewind.

												My biggest concern with getting this game was it looked like a simple puzzle phone app (which I like, but just for a few minutes on the phone) with an unnecessary 3d perspective to basically choose different levels (which would be tedious). At first that's what the game feels like. However, before that wears out it's welcome, you start to see a point to the 3d perspective. It becomes not just a way to get from puzzle to puzzle, but the puzzles become integrated in the 3d perspective experience. I wasn't looking to get a deep meaning from a puzzle game, but it seems some reviewers are. There is meaning to the game, but it's light. As I think it should be. The meaning is abstract, about about the perspective experience, which is what the puzzles are about also, so it's well integrated. The absract nature means even the meaning could be considered open to interpretation, and what is interpretation if not perspective. But so far into my gameplay, that's it. I don't expect it to get any deeper than that. And I don't feel the game is trying to be super deep, but it's deep enough. If you go in thinking this is a deep meaningful experience, yeah, you'd be dissapointed. If you go in thinking the delevopers are trying to hard to be artistic, yeah, you could be dissapointed again. But if you go in thinking the game has some meaning sprinkled about in a way that compliments the play experience in a moderate way, then you'll be pleasantly satisfied. And I think that's all the developers are trying to do. Sometimes (in any medium, not just games) if you take in an artistic experience (like viewing a painting), you will be dissapointed with the same outlooks that could make you dissapointed in this. And satisfied with the same outlook that would make you satisfied with this. So it's up to your perspective if you think the games trying to hard. I'm fortunate enough to think it's trying just hard enough. Finally (this could be percieved as a slight spoiler as it is a general clue for when you get stuck, so feel free to stop reading), the game does a good job at teaching you how to solve the puzzles without throwing it in your face. You still have to look for it. There are rows of puzzles that start simple and introduce a new concept. If you get stuck on something you've never seen before, take that as a clue that you are jumping ahead. Come back to it once you've found the learning row(s) for that type of puzzle. You do get to a point pretty quickly where you are expected to know a lot of the puzzle types. So just contine exploring, you'll figure it out. I enjoy that part of the puzzle is knowing when to stop and do a puzzle, and when to move along and come back later. I enjoy that the ""tutorial"" are scattered through the game, and somewhat of a minor puzzle to figure out the best way to let the game teach you. The teaching is very subtle, but guided in a good way where they respect your intelligence. This is a risky way to do things, but I think it works here. I can't say if I'll be able to solve the game entirely on my own, but it's a good experience so far. I took a risk because the developer has a good reputation. Even if I stopped playing now, I'd say the experience has been worth it.			"

												This game is a lengthy, chill puzzle game... most of the way through. Then near the end you get the carpet pulled out from under you and are thrown into an RNG-based time-attack which, if you're anything like me, will just make you angry. So I recommend avoiding this one, unless both 50+ hours of super-chill puzzle exploration and stressful, randomized time-attacks that you will fail repeatedy sound like fun to you.			"

												This game managed to make simple mechanics into something condescending. It over-sells itself in the description, but if you're looking for a bunch of puzzles, you found 'em. The biggest puzzle is why the developers felt that this game was ready to ship:- A decent number of the puzzles will give you ZERO feedback for why you failed to solve them ""properly""- Every once in a while, the puzzles will introduce new rules. This is good. What's not good is the way the rules are communicated. I've solved maybe 20-or-so puzzles without knowing why my solution was the ""right"" one.- Most puzzles can be solved systematically, and this is very unsatisfying. Systematically figuring out the combination for a combolock is not fun. Neither is systematically trying every turn on the grid by eliminating obviously unviable options and trialing the potentially correct paths.- While the world has variety, it has no life. This may be intentional, but it does not make me want to explore it any more than I have to in order to find my next puzzle.- Finding the puzzles is almost less rewarding than solving them systematically. ""Oh great, after wandering for an hour, I've stumbled upon yet another glorified combolock.""There's only two good things about the game so far:- Lots of puzzles. LOTS. More puzzles than I will ever want in any game. This is almost a negative.- The first handful of puzzles aren't terrible, and occassionally, there's one (read it: ONE) puzzle that makes me feel smart or accomplished.Other than that, this game is just a giant slog of combolock after combolock after mindless wandering after combolock.

												The puzzles are cute enough and certainly have hints of Braid about them but they are set in an empty world with no soul and no explantaion as to why I should want to solve the puzzles, except for the reward of solving more puzzles. That in itself is an excercise in frustration that without any apparent advancement or reward becomes a pretty futile excercise. Often you will barely notice you have even solved a puzzle as it is so rare to see anything happen once you have solved them. If you are looking for something to fill the vacuum created by the Talos Principle, you will not find it here.			"

												As a fan of puzzle games, I find it hard to recommend The Witness.The price point is very steep, the storyline is very barebones and pretentious, the (normal) ending is a royal kick in the balls, and the rules to new puzzles are often poorly represented. There are even some solutions that require you to take screenshots and solve them outside of the game. I'm not sure about everyone, but I prefer to have all the tools to solve a game within the game itself. I'm not a fan of solutions that break immersion.It's a shame because I would consider myself a fan of Jonathan Blow. Even with the game's faults, the environment is gorgeous with thought provoking set peices. Despite everything feeling 'dead' and 'sterile', there is a persistent sense of mystery that makes you want to explore all that the world has to offer. Every zone has a theme, every theme has a new rule, and every new rule causes you to think differently. On paper, this sounds like a lot of fun, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have fun, but in practice this game is designed to be solved very slowly with every zone containing several mental road blocks. While I'm all for challenge in video games, it should not come at the cost of proper pacing. There are quite a few puzzles to solve and though some are genuinely clever, most involve contorting the camera to the 'exact' angle required to complete a path, look at the environment a certain way, see through a specific window, look at just the right reflection, and so on. It gets to be more awkward than enjoyable.If you're a fan of puzzle/artsy games, I would pick this up for a 1/4 of its current price. Everyone else: Avoid.			"

												This game is beautiful. It's just that it has absolutely no story, ONE type of puzzle, and that frustrating puzzle is the only way you interact with the world at all. This was a REALLY pretty game. Absolutely stunning visually. However, I felt like it was missing something. A storyline, perhaps? What am I going to witness in this world that's so spectacular? What are you going to get for finally finishing this line of puzzles? A new element to make those annoying tile puzzles even more complicated! Then what will you get? More of those puzzles...There was so much they could have done in this amazing world, but instead they filled it with tile puzzles. That's it, that's the game. Nothing else to it.			"

												This is one puzzle stretched out into hundreds of different ones. The rules limit your thinking instead of requiring you to think creatively to solve them. If you get stuck on a puzzle, then there's no way to get through it or come back without having to resort to looking it up. I prefer Braid's style of introducing a mechanic and then letting the player figure out all the different ways for that mechanic to be used and combined with your moveset.			"

												Sadly I cannot recommend this and I wanted to like it. The world is beautiful, yet it feels so bare. Aside from the random audio logs dotted around the island that do very little for the atmosphere. What I experienced in my short time was a world filled with 2d tablets, tablets with Ipad lock screens. I'm not kidding, that's all it is. 2d puzzles followed by 2d puzzles. I did have a few ""oh that's clever"" moments but nothing mind blowing. Unfortunately I cannot confirm these tablets remain throughout the whole game, but they stretched as far as my GPU could render.To sum up. It's not portal. It's not Talos Principle. It's a walking simulator in a world inhabited by Ipads.			"

												I love puzzle games, and count Myst, Portal and The Talos Principle among my favorite ever, but I just can't stand the puzzles in The Witness. I find them boring, tedious, and pretentiously difficult. Anyone can make difficult puzzles by working backwards from the solution, and obfuscating the steps, but it takes real design prowess to make puzzles that are fun and rewarding to solve. The Witness just mocks you constantly, and dares you to think you have a brain. I got to a point where I solved a puzzle, then it gave me the exact same puzzle again, but with the paths broken so I had to find another solution. It really just felt like a big middle finger. And I just don't want to have to sit through any more of the videos and sound bites. As soon as I had the thought, ""maybe I should just use a walk through to solve all the annoying puzzles so I can see what there is to the rest of this game"" then I knew it was over for me. I have zero desire to play any more. It's sad, because it's a really beautiful game and really has a Myst vibe. I don't know how far I am in the game, but I've gotten a couple of the lasers and quite a ways through several others.			"

												I really, really wanted to enjoy this game. I've been anticipating its release since I first heard about it and I even preordered the game. Simply put, I did not find the game enjoyable. There's probably depth to it that I didn't understand in my 30 mintues of play time, but I just got exceptionally bored playing the game. It feels like puzzles you'd find in a cheap mobile app, but this game costs $40. I might pick it up whenever it hits $5 in a sale but I just can't justify full price. The world is very beautiful, however I couldn't find anything interactive about it. The world just seems to link together all of the mobile phone game puzzles. You also are very limited in movement: you can't jump or drop small ledges. This is an annoyance.			"

												Luckily, I really like line-drawing puzzles.6 hr update: I really, really like them.40 hour update: this game isn't about line-drawing puzzles at all. Drawing lines is just the interface, the language, which the player uses to interact with the game. The puzzles themselves are vast and varied, it just so happens that you speak in Snake to answer them. Even at this point I am discovering new stuff and starting to appreciate the weightier themes of the game as I peel back the onion skin a layer further. I'm not even dismissing the audio logs as pretentious nonsense anymore. It really does all fit together. Just to give one little magic moment without spoiling anything too much. There is a statue you find of a man who is raising his hands to the sky and looks as though he is despairing. Viewed from a slightly different angle, however, his shadow aligns with stones on the ground and suddenly he looks like a guy juggling. And that's the game in a nutshell. It's a masterpiece, one of the very best if not THE best game I have ever played. Thank you Mr. Blow.			"

												The art style suits surprisingly well the the puzzles. Beautiful environment. However puzzle mechanisms are not interesting enough to keep me playing.Jonathan Blow(the director) himself said ""The more that a puzzle is about something real and something specific, and the less it's about some arbitrary challenge, the more meaningful that epiphany is."" Yet the game doesn't reach the same levels of Braid at all. The puzzles are not smart, the difficulty feels artificial. Gameplay is generally not satisfying and feels like a waste of time trying to solve it.It's not for me. But I would recommend if you saw the gameplay and think it's interesting. If you like the puzzles you'll most certainly like the game.			"

												Almost certainly the best puzzle game ever made!First, a caveat: I'm a little miffed (as others have pointed out) that the world isn't as interactive as we'd believed. At its core, the game is, in fact, a series of puzzles, albeit with plenty of twists and turns along the way. (Some of the puzzles point to a much more interesting interaction model for the second half of the game, but we'll see how that goes.) Personally, I would have preferred more explicit adventure game elements, especially since the game never eases up on you. It feels like the Kreedz Climbing of puzzles!Still -- the island is GORGEOUS, the (micro-)story is intriguing, and the feeling of progress is quite intoxicating. (There's even a bit of humor! Who knew that abstract line puzzles could be funny?) Aside from being a marvel of game design -- everything is taught through the puzzles -- this is clearly a very personal work for its creator. I've put in 10 hours so far and I'm still as engaged as when I first started.Highly recommended!			"

												The witness is a puzzle game, with mild elements of exploration. Having come into this game expecting akin to Braid I was sorely disappointed. I am dissapointed, not because this game doesn't have puzzles or atmosphere, but because its a very isolating game. While figuring out the puzzles there is no background music, no overarching narrative - just the complusion to better your puzzle solving skills.Don't get me wrong, the puzzles in this game are great. The build up of the puzzle design is great. The art design is great - but it feels hollow overall. I guess I could liken this game to someone making a rubiks cube simulator with hundreds of different rubiks cubes. Is there hours of game play here - yeah - is it misleading in its purpose - no. Would I play it for hours on end - no.In regards to the puzzles specifically, as mentioned previously I feel like they are well done, but at the same time some of them start to feel gimmicky. I can't think of a good example of this, but I feel like puzzles should be self-contained, and should not require the environment outside of the puzzle to solve.Is the witness a good puzzle game? YesIs the witness a game that I would recommend? No			"

Having said that I wasted no time putting stylus to tablet and marking out as many notes, sketches, etc as I possible could as I begun this new beast know as The Witness. After about 2 hours of play time, Blow and team deliver on clever puzzles, entirely live up to ""I want the player to continue to reform their opinions as they play"", and execute with an incredibly visually beautiful game. Again, after Braid I can't figure out if I'm obsessing over nothing or actually drawing conclusions from the environment which can only lead me to believe ""Well then the game must be 'working'""Genuine congrats to Jonathan ""The Riddler"" Blow on creating (so far) a genuinely awesome, unique, challenging and rewarding experience.

												I just love how the game refuses to confirm your theories about how the general puzzle mechanics work, other than approving/rejecting your solutions. Assumptions that are wrong, or only partially true, can seem correct after having some puzzles approved, but a couple of minutes/hours later you will hit a brick wall when the game uses your false assumptions against you. I am sure this will be topped, but my biggest ""aha moment"" this far was discovering the true properties of black/white/colored blocks: I initially assumed that the point was to close vertical and horizontal ""line of sight"" between differently colored blocks with my lines, which solved a couple of puzzles, but then inexplicably stopped working. After failing to apply my theory to more and more puzzles, I started to doubt my assumptions, and understood that the point was to border off differently colored blocks in separate spaces. This was not enough, though, because I later learned (after banging my head against the wall for almost one hour) that the same color could be bordered off in multiple spaces.A corollary to this great feature is that cheating on even a single puzzle should be a surefire way of sucking the fun out of the game. If you avoid that kind of thing, my early impression is that this is a phenomenal puzzle game. It is a must-play for anyone who likes puzzle games with brain teasers, really.			"

												- Warning: You might find this review as a little spoiler - I normally love puzzle games, but this one tries to be profound making the player waiting for a profound story, but in the end if you do the last step of the game you won't have the chance to finish it 100% and there doesn't seem to be a complete story telling what the witness observes.All the stone statues make you curious, but you won't be told what it's all about.If you are finished all that you have done will be reset - very frustrating.There are only two achievements of which one you will receive if you finish the game.. :/I love the many different puzzle types very much, but the further you get in the game of each type the numbers of puzzles become less.In addition the puzzles start easy and only after a few they become very hard. The difficulty level raises too abrupt, a more smooth difficulty raising would be more nice.This game is I think in parts more appropriate for hard core puzzlers :o), because you do not only need to find out the solution for a puzzle, but first of all the rules for the puzzle/how it is meant to be solved.This game is not suitable for relaxing after-work hours in my opinion :o)The graphics are very nice, it's a beautiful island, but for such a nice environment and the basically great idea the sound is really awkward. It sounds more like a horror/shock game. You would wait for something creepy to happen or something to scare you, but it wouldn't come.I would have expected more cheerful soundtracks.The sound when solving puzzles steals my concentration and is fraught. I thought of this game a more relaxing gameplay.It's a pity, but I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Your character wakes up in a room, no intro, no diaglog, no context. You're expected to know where to go next and what to do. That's fine, some players like mystery and figuring out what to do on their own.Then you realize thats the rest of the game. It never tells you what level you should do next. It never explains to you the new mechanic each level introduces for a puzzle. It never actually explains the context for the game, why your character is doing puzzles or context for anything.I think anyone like me, who doesn't have infinite free time, will resort to looking up solutions when they get stuck for over an hour. You first think, ""man I wish I wasn't bad at this game and didn't have to look up answers"". Then once you look up the answer, you realize you're not stupid, the game just sucks and some puzzles it does a really bad job with. Solutions to puzzles should make sense, and some are done so poorly they just don't.My biggest problem with this game is it's very smug and pretentious, and thinks it's clever by not ""holding your hand"".Trust me buy portal 2 instead: its 3 dollars right now with the steam sale. It's a fun expereinmce, has a story, and feels like an actual game. Each level teaches the player new concepts and builds upon what they already know, the witness simply says ""figure it out, I don't care if it doesn't make sense"".I recomend watching a youtube video summarizing the game instead. The experience will be far less frustrating and save you time and money.			"

												The Witness manages to be less, much less than the sum of its parts.The game seems to be a collection of puzzles, so these are the ""parts"".To me these puzzles seemed interesting, smart and original, but then again im not a big fan of puzzles so what seemed smart and original to me could be silly old stuff for somebody more puzzle oriented.To sum it up, i really enjoyed the puzzles i encountered so far and the way to solve them but...as a videogame this thing is an atrocity, a heresy, an insult.Its a shame to see so much potential go to waste because the developer couldnt afford a game designer.They packaged chef d'oeuvre puzzle candies in a moldy cardboard box full of grease stains and with some flies and worms for good measure.There is nothing wrong with puzzles but, when you are thrown into a semi open world environment that is full of potential puzzles that might or might not be solvable at that point, its way too easy to oversee a puzzle that might be doable and insist on doing one that is undoable, not to mention a lot of pointless tracking and backtracking through environments that are not very pretty but feel very empty.Its a shame that a game that had the potential to be an exercise for the mind, turned into an exercise in patience, perseverence and  resistance to tedium, for the sole reason of poor design.Once i get to a series of puzzles that are doable, i finish them almost without effort and i have to admit i have some satisfaction from that but....too much time wasted finding the puzzles, more time finding a puzzle than solving it....not good.The way the puzzles are presented to the player is lacking, and there is a lack of purpose for the whole thing.Yeah ok im solving these puzzles and i feel good and smart but...why am i doing this? Just to prove myself i can do it? Cuz it sure aint fun.All this game needed to be a masterpiece, was a halfway decent game designer.The developer created a very nice set of puzzles (imho), but they completely failed to implement these puzzles into a coherent and satisfying game.To sum it up, i consider the puzzles to be superb but the implementation to be awful. As a rather unusual and possibly satisfying puzzle experience (if you are very resistant to tedium), i would give it a big thumbs up, but as a videogame, a huge thumbs down, and since this was sold as a videogame...i can only give it a thumbs down.Also worth mentioning is that no matter how you look at it, this product is not worth the asking price, since not only it is not a fancy A+ game, but its hardly a game at all.Only got this in my collection because im subscribed to humble monthly, but if i paid the asking price for this game, i would be refunding with a rage.

												The puzzles on this game are very repititive and limited. I was expecting more diversity (the good kind) but all this game seems to be is drawing lines. I mean sure, it's fun for a while but it's so damn limited. After doing the puzzles for an hour it gets so repetitive that it kinda feels more like work than gaming.  I usually love doing puzzles but this game is like doing Sudokus for 12 hours, it gets boring as ♥♥♥♥.Okayish game i guess, still wouldn't recommend it			"

												8 years later and Braid still haunts me with it's various intricacies. Having said that I wasted no time putting stylus to tablet and marking out as many notes, sketches, etc as I possible could as I begun this new beast know as The Witness. After about 2 hours of play time, Blow and team deliver on clever puzzles, entirely live up to ""I want the player to continue to reform their opinions as they play"", and execute with an incredibly visually beautiful game. Again, after Braid I can't figure out if I'm obsessing over nothing or actually drawing conclusions from the environment which can only lead me to believe ""Well then the game must be 'working'""Genuine congrats to Jonathan ""The Riddler"" Blow on creating (so far) a genuinely awesome, unique, challenging and rewarding experience.

												The Witness is a puzzle game that makes you uninterested in solving puzzles. Most of your time will be spent trying to figure out what the mechanics of the puzzle are. The puzzles themselves are fairly trivial once you know how they work, mostly they're a chore. There is no discernible story, just a bunch of audio recordings about having faith and believing in God. The ending is so bad it feels like a hoax.tl;dr Looks stunning, plays horribly.			"

												I've never wrote a negative review for any game in my life, even for games I didn't like or even hated.But this is a special circumstance.On the one hand, the atmosphere in the game, combined with relaxing graphics and landscapes, and brilliant puzzles.On the other hand, the game is way too hard, overall.It's not about being smart enough to solve the puzzles, it's way beyond it.The game becomes very confusing at some point, where it's not fun anymore. Instead of feeling joy when solving a tough puzzle, it will make you just.. sigh. Sigh out of relief. That is not what a game should make you feel.Unless you're the one who literally made the game, or a genius, there is maybe 5% chances you'll be able to finish the game on your own. Not to mention getting all 100% of the puzzles and secrets. It's basically impossible. You'll get annoyed by it's difficuly or you will not have a clue what to do next, then you'll close the game and you won't have any desire to launch it again. Or you'll look for solutions online, whice, at some point, will take all the fun out of it.Yes, it has brilliant puzzles. The entire game is a big puzzle actually.It does a lot of things right, but at the bottom line - it will just upset you and you'll feel frustrated and annoyed, whice is why I give this game a negative review.If you're a real puzzle fan, and you want a challenge, you should play this game. But for everyone else out there.. you can skip it. You'll just end up rage-quitting it at some point.			"

This is a game for your brain that expect and respect intelligence.The game teaches you without any dialogue or text how the mechanics work and lets you come to your own understanding of the rules by slowly upping the complexity. Your rewards for this are simply more puzzles. And more puzzles from that game is the best reward.Go in with the least info possible for the greatest experience! ;)			"

												Wooooah what is this doing not in my list of recommended games??? This is probably the best puzzle game I have ever played (yes, better than Portal, Fez, and Braid). This was directed by the maker of Braid and is very comparable to Fez in that there are enviromental clues everywhere and there are constantly deeper and deeper layers to all of the puzzles. This game grabbed me so hard and didn't let go until I was done. I played 30+ hours in a single weekend. That's how enthralled I was by the puzzles.The main idea of this game is that it never teaches you any of the rules to the puzzles. You learn through solving simpler versions of the puzzles and working your way up to the harder ones. I loooved that this game just trusted you to be smart enough to solve everything on your own and that concept made everything so interesting. I'd often come across new mechanics, having no idea how to solve them and end up super curious about it, to the point that I couldn't tear myself away until I knew how to solve that mechanic.This game also had by far the coolest puzzle I have ever seen in a game (the hardest one too). Solving that made me feel like the smartest guy on the planet. Just for that puzzle alone, this game was worth it. I cannot recommend this enough. A must play for everyone who even slightly enjoys puzzle games			"

The Witness is not the game I expected. The trailer focused on exploration and a beautiful soundtrack. I expected a game like Braid or Myst. Instead, The Witness is a puzzle book in the medium of a video game. There's no story, no characters, no music. Only a beautiful island filled with nuanced sounds, disconnected philosophical musings, and oodles of puzzles. The puzzles are their own reward.The primary gameplay is solving puzzles in silence. The puzzles come in just one variety: mazes. They differ only in rules required to solve. Advanced mazes can depend on abstract and surprising interactions between unrelated rules. I often felt The Witness was gloating over my failure: Some puzzles resort to frustrating gimmicks like visual obstruction, loud noises, or timers.The Witness provides no accesibility features. Some puzzles require perception of sound or color to solve. These puzzles are optional, but these puzzles are not (and cannot be) clearly marked. Deaf or colorblind players should avoid.			"

												I'm gonna thumbs down this one so far.  I was expecting an island full of puzzles, but not an island full of nearly the exact same puzzle repeated a hundred times just with slightly different configuration and mechanics.  I haven't finished it but so far having done the same puzzle type 20 times, and that being the only puzzle type I've encountered, I'm already bored of it.  There's no narrative to carry you through like Talos Principal or Portal, just a series of ""here's a grid, find your way to the end,  Good, that unlocks the next puzzle.  Now repeat that a ton of times.""			"

												It's unfortunate that many people might skip on this game because they think it is a “mobile app in a pretty world” or something. And from the trailer, it's understandable people may think that.But this is not true and anybody who says so did not play for more than an hour. This game needs its 3d world or else most of its puzzles would either be unsolvable or simply not exist. So why don't the trailers try to explain this? Because unlike say Portal, many puzzles are easily spoiled and showing them dampens the fun and discovery.In The Witness, you are dropped in a open world surrounded by hundreds of puzzles with no instruction on how to solve any of them. This game doesn't want to make you feel smart because it believes that you are smart. Yes, the game gets hard. Very hard, but it's just so satisfying. So be warned.Also, know that this game is puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. With out much story, The Witness is only for those who really like puzzles. Each of these puzzles managing to bring in an interesting new concept while building from others. Not a single puzzle felt repetitive. Which is pretty amazing, over 600 puzzles about drawling lines? I know it sounds like it would get old fast. But it doesn't. When I was 40 hours in, 50 hours in, 60 hours in, I was still discovering things that change the way I look at the game and its future puzzles. There is so much cool hidden stuff that continued to surprise me, because everything in the game has reasons behind why it exists and why it is where it is.			"

												I started solving puzzles on TV monitors right after the game began.  There was a good looking world around, but I didn't seem to interact much with it, only the puzzle screens.  To solve these puzzles, you have a starting point and drag a line like ""Snake"" along a grid to the end point.  Every puzzle has this base.  The rules change, but the game does a good job of letting you know what the rules are without explicitly stating them.   Some of the puzzles required thought and were well made.  However, you walk from screen to screen, and that seems to be it.  It isn't like Braid where you interact with the level.  If you have ever played Hitman/Tomb Raider/Deus Ex Go mobile games, The Witness is comparable except everything is dots and lines and not turn-based.I solved something like 100 puzzles and got bored.  I opened up a walkthrough on Youtube and scanned through parts in the middle and end.  It looks like it is just more puzzle screens, so I gave up on the game.  If this was a flash game (which it could be), it would have held my attention for about 10 minutes.  I gave this game more of a chance because I figured there was more to it.  This would be a real letdown for the full price, but since I got it as part of the freedom bundle, I got this and other games with all of the money going to the ALCU and other orgs.  Props to the developer for that, but I cannot recommend this game.			"

												The first few hours are magical. Then the tedium sets in. And the unresolved questions: What are all these panels doing here? What's up with the statues? Where am I?It's one thing to be vague or mysterious or suggestive. It's quite another thing to not even attempt any kind of explanation. This game was clearly a victim of its years-long development process. It is beautiful and occasionally brilliant. But only occasionally. The rest of the time it is opaque, directionless, repetitive, and--the cardinal sin for any game--boring.			"

												If vidoegames are novels, the Witness is a poem that doesn't rhyme in an alien language.  I don't know what's worse - the world that exists where I played this game to completion or the one where I never bought it and wondered how amazing it is.  Either way, the island is nice to walk around.  Then, like satan, Jonathan Blow possesses your soul with puzzle after unsolvable puzzle like a negative reinforcement experiment straight out of Ghostbusters where the only reward is a Willy Wonka elevator ride and the knowledge that if you haven't 100% completed this game you have to do all that over again to find anything new.  Jonathan Blow is both Albert Einstein and Ed Gein rolled into one.  I love you.			"

												Beautiful puzzle game with NO explanations on anything. Mainly enjoyed this because of Ansel the Nvidia game photography suite. Got to the brown puzzles in the ruins and gave up. Even with a video walkthrough it became difficult to understand how the puzzles worked. Not sure how this was supposed to work, but the fact it made a big splash and vanished shortly after reveals how well thought out it was. The initial intrigue of this confusing puzzler pulls you in, it's visual beauty awes you, and a few hours later you realize you have no real idea what's going on, how any of the puzzles work or if you're actually working towards anything. There are no directions, the start is the closest thing you get to any tutorial or 'path'. Once you finish that you literally have no heading, you can walk anywhere and see everything, that's not locked of course. There isn't exactly a specific order to how to beat this, however there certainly are harder and easier puzzles and going the wrong direction can rapidly up the difficultly of the puzzles.			"

												I wanted to like this game. Sadly, no.I engaged with it initially - it has an expansive vision, and the graphics were peculiar, the absence of music notable in it's attempt to make the player more mindful. Essentially, that's what the game is about: mindfulness and puzzle-solving. But I think it goes too far into the mindfulness side, and forgets the fun.I enjoyed Braid - it's a different experience (obviously), but it had drama, and atmosphere, and something about it.On a technical side, the game suffers from an extreme lack of necessary linearity - I found myself traipsing from one end of the isle to the other, in an attempt to find tutorial sections for the given puzzle 'types', which, after a while, becomes frustrating and distracting. Also after a while there was no 'flow' - some puzzles simply came down to guessing what the author intended - not unlike an adventure game - rather than deduction.It has it's merits, but at the end of the day, I didn't enjoy it.

												Straight to the point, I love the puzzles, I'd say it eases you into if I didn't start the game in the ""Looking"" mode or whatever having to figure out which button to press to toggle being able to walk, tried hunting it down in the options, not there, I didn't experience to much of the game at the time of writing this, but I liked what I saw but I can not for the life of me say it's worth throwing $40 USD down for it, maybe on a nice sale, or if you're in a financial situation where you can do so. Love the game, but not the price point, decide on it yourself.			"

												The witness is exactly what it looks like... and mabey just a bit more idk. The start of the game is really slow, just solving really ez puzzles with no attachment to the world around u (which is beatiful, varied, and relaxing). However, once u get out of the start area, the game picks up, puzzles get really **************ing hard, the environment becomes important rather than a backdrop, and gives a sense of mystery/story with zero narration/story telling.There is SOOO much stuff in this game,  a lot of people say its relaxing, and i c where they come from, but this game is a pain. The puzzles are always SOOO frustrating because ur always so close and you have the answer, but the developer(s) knew you would do that and put one *tiny* roadblock in ur way to completely change the solution... but once u solve the puzzle, its a whole great feeling..... when u solve something really complicated, that employs a whole bunch of game mechanics and subtle environmental queues, you feel like a lord among men.... and there is no shortage of hard puzzles, get the game "

												Skip it. I would say go for a game like the Talos Principle or something similar. When you solve a puzzle in the game, as a player, you want some sort of recognition/reward for it. I felt like the design was extremely condescending. Like every person is supposed to know every obscure concept that the designer has in mind. I'm not against non-linear gameplay but i would expect some reward in the game when i actually solve some puzzles.When you solve the first pzzle, a door opens to a huge island. That's it. After that, you are left on your own to understand the premise, puzzles, completion of the game. I know that the game probably has a more deeper, philosophical meaning to it but i fail to see it.

												First and foremost: this game does not have a story, nor does it reward your gameplay in any other form. The puzzles aren't fun. It is effectvely a choreI don't mean to say that games need a story or get into any of that exhausted argument. But I played through the whole game expecting small hints at a cool secretive story (and answers to: what is this place?, where are all the people?, why are the f***ing line pizzles everywhere?), or at the very least, an ending that gave some kind of insight to things. You wont get anything of the sort.Scenery is gorgeous. Gameplay (read: ignoring the scenery and doing one hundred billion slight variants of the same tedious graph puzzle). It is nicely challenging, but has ZERO reward for your efforts. The only thing you get for completing puzzles is more puzzles. Which for some games is enough, because the puzzles are crazy fun, unlike dragging a line through a grid on a flat screen			"

												It feels...empty.pros:     -Great looking game, instantly reminded me of talos principle, or pneuma      -hidden things around the island are a lot of fun to discovercons:     -the puzzles are all the same, just with a different set of rules to follow, but they do not tell you these rules.it can be fun to discover some of the rules yourself, but the more complicated ones...forget it.      -no story, no reason for me to want to keep playing. Its just solve puzzle, walk to next puzzle, repeat.     -color based puzzles with no colorblind options so if you are colorblind count on having to just look up the solutions for these, i read that there are sound based ones as well so watch outOverall empty, left me struggling to find a reason to keep playing.4/10 too much mobile gameplay stuffed into a 3d environment			"

												Despite amazing graphics, music and the overall concept, one problem prevents me from enjoying this game.The world is way too large for a puzzle game.After the initial section, you are pretty much free to explore the whole world. You can go wherever you want. WITHOUT A MAP. I know there's a boat and stuff but what I need is a carry-on map that prevents me from getting lost all the time.The non-linear-ness of the world naturally leads to another problem. Whenever I wander into a puzzle that I cannot solve - which happens all the time - I have no idea if it's because I'm stupid, or I missed a tutorial puzzle in another area. And I tend to think it's the former.Please be aware that this is entirely personal. You may actually enjoy exploring an unknown world and taking on unexplained challenges all on your own. But I just really wished the game could gradually open up areas and lead me through them in the intended order, just like most other open world games do.			"

This game is MYST on steroids.For whoever has enough lifetime to spend to dig into the loosly explained puzzles and like myst-esque game-design, you will feel at home. For everyone else, there is no need to buy this game, maybe for its looks yet definetly not for its puzzles.This game isn't fun, it's work!MYST was good or more okay-ish in the 90s because there was nothing else to play really but today with what the market offers only the masochistic puzzle solvers will like to spend their time with this game.Clues about the puzzles are everywhere and don't follow coherency. The mechanics / basics you are taught, or more likely thrown at you to be solved and understood are irrational. They only follow their internal logic which is often not explained but left for you to figure out.If you did not get the intended logic to a puzzle at first hand you will be left alone. Progress will halt aprubtly and you will have to either use online help or trial and error. This is bad game-design.The game demands, without telling you to do so, to test any variant with every tutorial plate you get to ""maybe"" grasp the underlying puzzle mechanic. Though they often do not offer enough variance to heave those parts to the surface.Solving a puzzle is not a solution in this game. Re-engineering it is.So you will be confronted with them on a next puzzle and you are in charge to trial and error it. Maybe you got the idea then, maybe not. The game does not care.I played and solved MYST in the 90s, i like also physical games like talos principle or portal, i am not afraid of assambler but this game is really pushing too hard on being devious with it's puzzles for absolutely no reason as MYST did back then.So when you don't care to completely re-engineer a puzzle to surface it's logic you might enjoy it, for everyone else, stay away from it, spend time on the plethora of games out there.Several hours wasted on this would give you the possibility of playing 4-5 other good games.And if you look for a story in this game, there isn't any. The world exists you have to make your own story.That's even what the PR text says : ""in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory""And one thing is even a blatant lie: ""This game respects you as an intelligent player and it treats your time as precious""It wastes it, on purpose. It wants you to feel it being difficult for wasting your time. That's not what difficulty is. It's just tedious.			"

												I really want to enjoy The Witness - I like puzzle games, and it's certainly a unique one. But, well... I don't, so far.Let's get the good out of the way. The Witness is an incredibly pretty game, and honestly, just wandering around the island and seeing all the environments is pretty enjoyable itself. The way the game takes its base puzzle concept and builds on it is clever and interesting as well. The audio logs remind me of BioShock, which is a good thing in my book.Now, the not so good things. While the island is very pretty and fun to explore, there's an in-built amount of backtracking you're going to end up doing (unless you're following a guide, I guess). In some cases, this is literally just to get to the other side of a gap because there's no way to lower a bridge or something from the side you're on. There's no fast-travel mechanic, either - you're stuck either on foot or taking the boat, if you've activated the dock at your destination. There are also things like a moving bridge in one area, that moves incredibly slowly. The store description saying that The Witness ""treats your time as precious"" is completely inaccurate.The way the game expands on its foundation is interesting, but some of the new puzzle mechanics are obtuse - there were several times where I ended up ""solving"" a puzzle without really understanding what I'd done correctly compared to the past few attempts. While I suppose it's a necessary evil of leaving the player to figure out the ""rules"" on their own, I feel that it works against the game more often than for it - The Witness doesn't give me that ""eureka moment"" feeling as often as games like Portal do, when the pieces of a puzzle suddenly snap into place and the solution becomes clear. When that eureka moment does hit, it feels good! The thing is, for me, it's overshadowed by the times when it misses. Which brings me to my next point: While highly subjective, I found The Witness to run its different concepts into the ground hard. The pattern I found most of the areas in the game to have was simple: Introduce puzzle mechanic -> Ramp up difficulty/complexity gradually -> Increase difficulty/complexity to the point of being obnoxious. This applied to almost every area, and almost every mechanic, and it's as damning as it sounds. Some areas were fun and relatively intuitive the whole way through, but most of them just... weren't. Most areas would start out fun, but around halfway through, the puzzles went from ""Well, that was pretty clever,"" to ""Come on, this is just dumb."" Some would start out frustrating and only get worse. More than once, I found myself leaving an area half-finished just because I couldn't be bothered to jump through the same set of hoops any longer, so I'd search out a new set and return to it later.The impression I've gotten from other reviews is that I've only scratched the surface of what this game is so far. If that's the case, this review could be completely wrong, and the bulk of the iceberg could be absolutely phenomenal. I don't know yet!Even if that's the case, though: At the time of writing, Steam says I've played The Witness for fourteen hours. I've reached the ending, or at least an ending of some sort. I've completed hundreds of puzzles - more than half of the lower threshold of 500 that the store page lists. Even if 14 hours is miniscule compared to the actual size of the game, that's a long time to keep pushing forward with an uncertain assumption that ""it gets better later."" Will I keep pushing on? Probably. If the time comes where the game shows its true colours and it turns out to be a wonderful game that overturns my complaints and exceeds all of my expectations, then I'll gladly recant this entire review. The more time I spend wandering around aimlessly, though, the less likely that is to happen.The Witness is currently $44 CAD. I simply can't recommend that in good conscience, sorry.			"

												There's no arguement that the game is gorgeous. The puzzles, however, are linerar (pun intended) and repetitive. They are fun, but I don't see the point in this being a full blown PC game. This is something I'd rather do on my phone or tablet while at a doctor's office. Yes, that would take away from the graphics, but the graphics isn't what keeps you playing. It's just a background for puzzles. ALL the puzzles.			"

												This is an extremely interesting game to me because it tries to practice what it teachs and feels like a metaphor for life. You're dropped into the world and there are hints about whats going on everywhere around you if you pay attention to them, but nothing is directly and forcefullly explained. Any explanation is won through quiet contemplation and observation leading to insight. If you're the type of person who likes to relax and explore, and enjoyes free-form thinking and puzzle-solving, then this is for you.			"

												This game is not going to be for everyone. If you're looking for a game that has action, violence, and an engaging plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look elsewhere. If you're impatient, and if you don't want your brain to hurt, this isn't the game for you. With that being said, in the amount of time I've invested in The Witness so far, it's already one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. The game takes the basic concept of maze puzzles, and introduces new mechanics to them to make you think. It then takes those new mechanics, and gives them a little twist, to make you think even more. And then once you think you've mastered that mechanic, it mixes it with another mechanic that you've previously learned, or even a brand new one. This game is hard, and it doesn't make any attempt to hold your hand. This game is going to make you want to smash your head onto your desk, but in a good way, because you want to conquer this latest puzzle so badly.The game has an incredible atmosphere, with gorgeous visuals and ambient sounds immersing you into this island world. There aren't any graphics settings, which is a huge bummer, but hopefully that is something that could be patched into the game. The vibrant colors of the island really pop off the screen, and the different locations throughout the game are really neat. You can also listen to some audio diaries located throughout the island, which have different quotes from all sorts of different people. This would be a great game to have a podcast on in the background. Not that the sounds are bad, they do a good enough job to keep you immersed in the game while you're playing, but it might be nice to have something else to listen to as well. The controls work great, on both a controller and a keyboard and mouse. Pick whichever one you're more comfortable with. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the $40 price tag, but from what I've played so far, it seems absolutely worth it. There are a ton of puzzles in here, and it's going to take you awhile to beat the game.tl;dr I you want something different than a complex puzzle game that keeps you on your toes with a great atmosphere, you're going to want to look elsewhere. But if you've been craving a game like The Talos Principle or Portal, you should absolutely pick this up.

												If you like this game, okay. However, in my opinion, this game is a joke. It's basically a glorified tablet game. Draw lines, WOW DUDE, SO INNOVATIVE. It has that smarmy ""2deep4u"" approach to storytelling. There's no reason for this game to cost $40 when all you do is draw lines and stick your head up your♥♥♥♥♥trying to figure out what philosophical nonsense the game wants you to understand. It is also disrespectful towards your time, at one point, though optional If I remember correctly, you have to watch a series of videos, one of them is about an HOUR LONG. ONE HOUR. You have to sit in the same spot in order to complete a line for one whole hour.Strip away the environments and what you have is a line drawing game meant for tablets that should cost maybe $5. But because it's by Blow and has environments, that somehow makes it worth $40? Yeah, NO. Should have been $20 max.Therefore, The Witness would not have been my choice for Best Puzzle game. It was OK, the world was beautiful, the progression of the puzzles was well done, but in the end, it wasn't very engaging. There's no real plot to speak of, so there's nothing to keep you interested in the world. I just got bored and lost motivation around the 5-7 hour mark.I much prefer a game has an actual narrative, and provides some intrigue and mystery from start to finish. Also, there's a certain creativity to having your puzzles integrated into the environment, as opposed to just having a TV monitor on stand screaming out THIS IS A PUZZLE, SOLVE ME. I thought that part was lame, and sort of lazy, to be honest anyone can do that. "

												An excellent puzzler for those with an open mind, and a wonderful example of good design. can't figure out a puzzle? take a walk around the island, eventually you will find what you need. this game heavily rewards observation, and even though i have yet to finish it, I can't help but reccomend it.The story itself, too, is arguably a puzzle, as rather than be explained to you it must be inferred from your surroundings. a statue here, some tech there, and you begin to get a glimpse of what the hell happened to the people on the island. it isn't straight forward, but rather more of a silent, postapocalyptic log.over all, if you aren't convinced, wait to grab it on sale. this is one of those games that you won't enjoy if you don't go in with an open mind- and i mean very open. if you're the type to get frustrated and give up, or need positive re-enforcement, this probably isn't the game for you; this is a bad analogy, but i'd almost consider this the dark souls equivalent of a puzzle game.10/10 would have an epiphany on how i need to split a puzzle in half on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again.

												I got a bit of a conundrum for you: How do you spoil something, that has nothing to be spoiled?This ""piece-of-art"" is ambiguous, pretentious and most of all annoying. Instead of being a puzzle game with mystery or even a story, it does just one thing over—and—over—and—over—and—over—again. Not adding challenge but nuisances. The forest part comes to mind. You've got to have a glutton for punishment to enjoy this.But what about the audio-logs and secrets!?!?-What about them? They are used to cover up the hollow emptiness and are nothing more than smart phrases written in helvetica over vintage filtered photographs. I'm rather angry seeing quotes of great minds like Feynman being abused for this.Jonathan Blow got a very special skill, to create interesting ideas and games which leaves you furious behind. This one is no exception.p.s. Yeah I know, I don't ""get it"", I'm too stupid to understand the greatness etc.			"

												(Yeah, I've rated your favorite game with a thumbs down, so instead of reading my points, you might as well skip to the bottom and give my review a thumbs down. Boo-hoo)I'm so sad to have disliked this game. I had great expectations. Perhaps too great. Could've been an ok experience if it costed about 10% of its full price. Anyone comparing this to Talos Principle is absolutely nuts.- Some nice puzzles, but all of them follow the same style (create a path from point A to point B, but with tons of rules). It gets repetitive very quickly, even with the different obscure rules (way too obscure sometimes) you have to figure out. They're okay, but again, I expected more than just hundreds of maze puzzles. A great part of the point of this game is about figuring out the rules of the puzzles, perhaps mroe than figuring out the solution to each of them.- Absolutely no music. Some people call it ""minimalistic sound design"", but I call it BS- Colorful, large enough world that's beautiful in a cartoonish kind of way, but it doesn't feel at all immersive- No clear goal, no context, no story, only a few interview videos and some audio logs with citation of someone famous (the narration is poor, btw). I got close to beating the game before I decided it just wasn't fun anymore and I couldn't find any original text. The overview says: ""You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you."" That's pretty much the whole story, at least until very close to the end. And while I did get challenged hard and a lot, I was never surprised.- A few annoying aspects, like slow movement, no autorun option.Basically, this game relies on promising more than it actually delivers. It's always about the promise, about the obscurity, but there's little being delivered here. It feels like their budget was poorly distributed among the different aspects of the game.Is it a /bad/ game? Hmm, no, if you disregard how much it costs. For me, it got boring and I felt cheated out of my money. I can't recommend this game at all. I bought it at 50% off, but I'd say it only starts being worth it at 80% discounts. I'm sad I decided to give it a chance instead of requesting a refund when I still could.This was the game I was looking forward to playing the most this year, and it was the biggest disappointment as well. Shame =(			"

												Truman Show meets wang drawing puzzles in the garden. Ever looked at a cloud and thought ""That kind of looks like a wang?"", that's this game in a nutshell x500 nuts. Actually, there is only 1 real wang puzzle with about 500 variations to be fair. While this review is ""negative"", its more a ~ which means its OK, not a bad game by any metric, but nowhere near worth the asking price of $40usd ($60aud at time of writing). I could do a lot with $60, but I chose to buy the witness and cannot refund it, so I'll do the next most cynical thing and not recommend it at full price. $10 definitely, I doubt you'd get your $$ worth at asking price. Consider yourself warned.Here's some pro's and cons:Pro:- Pretty to look at- Its fun to solve the first 100 puzzles or soCon:- Every single puzzle is draw a wang line on a board or a figurative wang on a figurative board. Would have been nicer to have other puzzles, but in essence there are 100's of variations of ""draw a line from entry to exit, but with a twist(s)"".- Some puzzle quest-lines just stop, with no ""reward"" or payoff, unless you consider half-baked ""holier than thou, look how intelligent I am"" philosophy a payoff. Some things in the game ask you to think or look at yourself or something. Not everyone can appreciate intellectual smugness, I certainly do not, The Witness is dripping out the wang full of it.- Many, many puzzles are just frustrating. Do you enjoy being stumped for hours looking at a single puzzle hopeless to try and figure it out? Then in a flash of inspiration you solve it, seemingly unsure how you never saw the answer before, only to be rewarded with an even more obtuse and harder puzzle in the same vein that you have to stare at for hours? Some are so obtuse until you run around half the island to find the ""tutorial"" puzzle teaching you how to actually do it. Even once you have learned a puzzle rule-set, some can be just a flat-out waste of time actually pulling off.- Many times you can see a puzzle solution staring you right in the face, you can literally see the wang right there in front of you, but have no clue how to pull it off.- Some of the hardest puzzle's only reward is more puzzles, or a simple puzzle, which are by themselves are super obtuse (hard to explain without spoilers). Some could consider that good game-play design, I consider it a waste of time. I don't find partitioning of knowledge endearing, I play games to understand the rules then enact those rules towards victory with various levels of skill:success. The Witness too often feels like playing a game of chess and trying to solve a check without knowing how half the pieces move, all while Johnny Blow laughs at you on the other side of the board.- The whole game feels like pseudo-intellectual ♥♥♥♥♥♥y. Extremely pretentious high-minded faff, ITS FREAKIN WANG MAZE PUZZLES MANG, get over yourself sheesh. - In all reality, this could have been a $10 puzzle game without all the highfalutin window dressing of ""an open world"". The $40 ($60aud) you pay is basically for a super pretty but painfully un-interactive ""open-world"" with absolutely  nothing going on and very little to no story or payoff for all the work you put in. And no, I don't consider drawing wangs in the scenery to be ""interaction"", even if you have to position yourself *just right* to see the wang fully. - It almost seems designed to reign you in for over 2 hours so that by the time you realise there's :A: Nothing going on but wang puzzles :B: There is no story or point to the wang puzzles besides very minor (basically pointless) spoilers :C: The first 100 puzzles or so aren't so bad, but staring down the barrel of 4-500 more is not a fun experience... more than 2 hours has passed and you can't get your refund.Save your money, buy x-com, and maybe consider watching an LP of the best friends doing this game after the hype has died down.

												Possible spoilers.  This is an exploration/puzzle game.  Knowing literally anything about the way it plays could be considered a spoiler.  If this describes how you feel about such games, read with caution.I haven't beaten it yet.  Don't know if I care to.  I'm not sure a game has made me legitimately angry at its creator before.I absolutely loved Braid.  Very clever game, premise, puzzles.  A satisfying sort of headscratcher.  I'll admit I had to look up how to get (or mainly, where to find) a few of the stars.This...just...hum.  I liked it at first.  It has worn me down and made me regret my rare early-adoption.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have chosen to give Jon Blow $40 for it.  Sadly I have more than two hours of patience.Good: - Very many puzzles - A pretty game, with an artistic style and varying biomes and color palettes - A fair amount of cleverness in the way many of the puzzles (and their rules) are implementedBad: - Inconsistent design; the game feels like it is designed well in some ways and intentionally poorly in others - Default movement speed is pretty slow (running should be a toggle, not a hold) - Voice recorders hidden throughout the island, as well as difficult-to-solve optional puzzles, 'reward' you with philosophical preaching and quotes which feel shoehorned-in and fake-deep, rather than thought-provokingIn the areas you are likely to interact with the earliest, the experience is the smoothest.  There are sets of panels throughout the game that are clearly intended to teach you a puzzle mechanic (without explicitly telling you what it is).  The earlier-introduced mechanics or puzzle rules are, I would say, inherently easier to grasp in an intuitive manner.  The ones you find later (further from the starting point, generally speaking - village puzzles a notable exception) are much less obvious.  This is all fine on its own.  These various rules leave a lot of room for interpretation, to where your understanding of them is gradually refined based on how you solved this one, but later tried to solve another one with the same line of thinking and it just didn't work.  In many cases it amounts to ""I just was looking at it the wrong way,"" in a figurative and/or literal sense.  That is a consistent theme throughout this game: perception.  In the beginning, it seems brilliant.The game's design philosophy of ""just look at it from a different angle"" begins to work against it as you proceed in the game.  For some puzzles, the precise literal angle from which you have to look can be so obscure that I think some players may have no recourse but to look up the solution or simply never solve it.  Looking up the solution obviously ruins the whole premise and takes the fun out of it, but there have been times where I left a puzzle, came back to it, left it again, came back again, and finally had to conclude that I just was not going to see how to do it on my own.  I've seen the words ""frustration tolerance"" in at least one review of this game, and I've come to find that it has greatly reduced mine.Then there are design decisions that just do not make sense to me, especially given that you can tell they are conscious, intentional design decisions and not something they might explain as ""that's just the way we did it.""  For example, the default movement speed is an irritatingly slow walk.  I'm tired of holding down the shift key.  Another weird decision will become apparent at some point when you fail a puzzle in a series - a ""series"" being when a number of puzzles are either all lined up next to each other, or simply linked by wires that glow and activate the next puzzle panel (also helpfully leading you to it).  For reasons I cannot fathom, some of these puzzles will deactivate when you input an incorrect solution.  To reactivate the puzzle, you have to go back to the previous panel (wherever it is) and re-input the correct solution, which will still be lit up on the panel for you.  Then you can go back (again) to the one you just failed, and try another solution (and be prepared to walk back to the previous panel again, if you are on the wrong track).  For a game whose creator claims he wants to ""trust in the intelligence of the player,"" I'm feeling a disturbing lack of respect for the time I'm putting into it.  While I walk back and forth between panels repeatedly, arbitrarily wasting time in penance for having the audacity to suggest -that- was the solution, I imagine I could be doing something fun.Finally, there is a distinct effort to establish, early on, clear methods of game-to-player communication.  The glowing wires from puzzle to puzzle.  The short series of easy puzzles to introduce you to a concept.  The fact that you can activate literally anything that looks like a circle with a line coming away from it.  These are all solid design choices that create a feeling of consistency.  And then, there are arbitrary decisions that erode that consistency and my confidence that I've made the correct choice in how to spend my time.  Sometimes you can finish a puzzle and follow the wire to what should be the next one, only to see it leading into some crevice, maybe coming out somewhere else that simply cannot be found.  However, these are not cases of ""well you just didn't look hard enough."" I walked around the whole area multiple times and finally googled it to find that there just isn't another puzzle in that series.  Then why is there a wire leading away from the last one?  What does it do?   Why should I trust anything the game communicates now?  Reminds me of how convinced I was to buy this based solely on how good Braid was.The ""story"" appears to consist of what you can find in hidden-to-sort-of-hidden voice recorders.  Most of which (of the ones I've found) seem to consist of Einstein quotes.  I don't really care about that, it's not a story.  It's not what I care to hear, so I just stopped clicking on them.  It doesn't feel like a mystery, it feels like someone trying to convince you of how smart they are.  I wasn't exactly expecting a blockbuster story or anything, but it gives the whole thing an extra layer of pretentiousness and makes me even less interested in whatever the ""ending"" consists of.  If I'm missing out on actual story because of this, I can't help but point to the design decision of ""put pretentious science-vs.-religion quotes in voice recorders"" as the cause.  I might have been more receptive to that kind of message if I found something actually written for this game first.I now feel like I am having a conversation with Jonathan Blow if I play this game, where I might say, ""I liked that stuff over there, but not this part.  Why is it like this?  It doesn't make sense.""  And he might say, ""Well, it doesn't have to make sense, and we don't have to agree.  You're obviously doing it wrong.  I'm not holding your hand.  Go put in that other puzzle solution again if you want to keep bashing your head on this.""I can (and may) just stop playing it out of spite, but he's already got my money either way.			"

												I enjoy puzzle games and I really wanted to like this game, but there are no words to describe how mind numbingly boring this game is!  On the positive side, the game utilises an attractive Island setting filled with every variation of a slide puzzle imaginable, often working the puzzle in with the environment.  However there is no intro to the game, there is no music, and there is no commentary on our progress (a sarcastic/abusive GLaDOS or a fatherly Elohim would have been a welcome break from the monotony).  There are a few audio logs scattered throughout the game, however the drivel they contain is so unbelievably pretentious they somehow make the game even more boring.  Combine this with the fact most of the puzzles feel exactly the same and you will realise playing this game is a deeply tedious experience.			"

												I enjoyed this game for about 30 minutes before needing to take a long break due to motion sickness. I tried changing a few of the settings and played for a little bit more, but the damage had already been done and I decided to uninstall the game. It's unfortunate, because I really did enjoy the parts that I saw.  Luckily, Steam was able to give me a refund. I've had a similar reaction to Half-Life 2. Portal and Portal 2 didn't make me as sick for undetermined reasons.Edit: For clarification, I liked the game, but it made me sick. I downvoted it so that when other people who also get motion sickness from certain games are trying to evaluate whether they should play the game or not, they can find reviews that let them know that this game might make them sick (despite it being mostly a puzzle game).

The puzzles have a lot of depth and a ""language"" of how they're solved, and requires you to think in terms of symmetry, visual perspective, and topology. You definitely have to push yourself to think outside the box beyond the last puzzle's solution.

												It's pretty. It's like Myst. If you liked Myst, you will probably like this. Some of the puzzles are fun, but what were the devs thinking, making you go back and re-solve puzzles you've already solved? I cannot fathom what was going through their heads. So, for example you have to solve a maze, draw a path through this grid so it covers all of these dots and none of those dots. Okay, good, you do that, find the solution, and then you move on to the next one, which is the same idea but harder this time. The problem is, if you fail the hard one, you then have to GO BACK to the one you just solved, erase your solution, and enter the exact same solution again. Every time. Every single time you need to retry the hard puzzle, you have to go back and erase and re-solve the one you already finished. What in the world could have possessed them to put such a tedious and boring mechanic in a puzzle game? It's like being forced to erase all your answers from a crossword puzzle and then write them in again, exactly the same. Over and over. Who would want to do that!? Meh. The puzzles are fine, although some of them seem to be a bit less ""solve this logic problem"" and more ""guess what I'm thinking of"", since I'm faily sure I found working solutions to a few puzzles only to have the game reject them because a different solution was expected. So then you get to go back and try to find another solution, even though you already found a perfectly good one. Maybe there was some reason why the solution that eventually worked was better than the one I initially came up with, but if so I can't work it out. Anyway. The world looks good. It would be great if it supported VR--which it doesn't. Having to go back and fill out puzzles you've already completed is a boring waste of time. If that sounds like something you're okay with, play it. But wait for it to go on sale.I don't regret buying it. But I don't recommend it.			"

												The Witness starts off great. It has beautiful visuals and just leaves you to its devices, which teach you how to play the game without just flat out telling you, making you feel very rewarded when you learn a new mechanic. However, The Witness starts dragging its feet after the first few hours. Everything The Witness has to offer is centered around solving geometric puzzles on panels, very few of which are easy, and there's roughly about 50,000,000,000 of them. Maybe the designers didn't want the player lacking for content, or maybe they didn't want to you finish the game so quickly and just take in the world, but they went to the other extreme. There's just too much of it. You'll start to get bored, and progress will be too slow coming in the game. Opening a can of soup in the world of The Witness is a 20 puzzle affair and 3 hour ordeal. As this drags on, the beatiful visuals and atmosphere will start to become meaningless, and The Witness will feel like a very large Sudoku book. Fun to play in very short bursts when you're bored, but you don't go through the whole book in few sittings like you do a game. If you play this game, I'd have a walkthrough near by, take 30 seconds to solve a puzzle on your own, and if you can get it, look at that walkthrough and move on to the next one. Don't worry about feeling cheated, there's plenty of opportunity to solve puzzles on your own. But there lies the problem with this game. It doesn't respect the law of diminishing returns. All there is to The Witness is these mountain of puzzles, and by the end of the game, you'll be sick of them and sick of The Witness.			"

												Sterile. Indifferent. Infuriating. The Witness strums a single note throughout, and offers no reward beyond the sublime satisfaction of pressing uninstall when it is finally over. There is a fine line between challenging and maddening. I don't know where it is, but neither does Mr. Blow.			"

												Of all the games I've downloaded on Steam, The Witness has been the biggest ripoff. It was a huge disappointment. I had read the mixed reviews, but still felt it would be a game I would be interested in. I was wrong. The puzzles are all variations of the exact same puzzle, but there is no real rhyme or reason the the cues that are meant to guide you to a solution for each. All of the puzzles are either absurdly easy or impossibly difficult. It feels like a terrible mobile game. It is a failed attempt at greater meaning. It was as a shallow a game as I've played, and it just plain and simple wasn't fun at all to play.			"

												The puzzles where you have to work things out are fun but there are far too many puzzles based on the light and the shape of the things around you, which would be fine if you didn't have to twist the camera so much to work them out.  Moving the camera around endlessly to work out the solution to a puzzle is just not fun and get tedious and frustrating far too quickly.Also the fact that The Witness has no real storyline makes the island feel bland and uninteresting despite the island being very colourful.  The intellectual documents you find around the place feel out of place and somewhat pretentious.If this game was two-thirds of the price it is now then it'd probably be okay but right now the scope of gameplay far limited and frustrating to be worth what The Witness is charging.

												Brain usage is go! If you like exploration and maze puzzles, get this now. I haven't had this much fun with a puzzle game since MYST. Gameplay: There is no hand holding, which is a good thing. Getting stuck is part of the fun. If you can't solve a puzzle, just go exploring the island and find one you can. Chances are you will learn a new piece of the puzzle language to solve the one you were stuck on before. Graphics: Beautiful and full of vibrant colors.This is one of the best games I've played in a long time.			"

												This is not a game. This is a standing simulator with ""guess what the dev was thinking"" elements thrown in.Ok, three nice things: 1. It is very beautiful2. The initial puzzles have a good difficulty curve.3. ???4. Profit.Now some bad things:1. To say that the puzzles are similar is an exteme understatement. They are all pretty much exactly the same, with a few elements changed out.2. Some puzzles have ""hints"". Unfortunately, there is no guidance to find the hint, or how to interpret the hint.3. As many other reviewers have stated, there is no payoff to any of the areas, or for the whole game (spoiler alert).4. Some areas have puzzles that cannot be solved until you have completed a previous area. There is no indication that you don't have the info for this, or that you may need something that you don't have yet.5. Some reviewers call this game ""hard"". It is not hard. It is ""Nintendo Hard"" meaning you need pixel perfect solutions for some of the puzzles. The problem with this is that you are in a 3D enviroment, meaning you have to align yourself on X, Y and Z coordinates.			"

												I'm definatly not disappointed in The Witness. There is just something about racking your brain on a problematic puzzle and finding that little piece of information to push it over the edge. This is definatly a brain teaser, with complex puzzles and mechanics meshed together in diabolical and seemingly simple ways. Even still it never feels unfair or cheap with it's challenges. So far the entire game is about learning new ways of problem solving. And frankly I'm beyond impressed with how seamless the entire learning processes is. The game never holds your hand or directly tells you to do anything. This is definatly a specialized game and won't appeal to everyone. Rounding that out, is the game perfect? Not by a long shot, but at least for me the faults have not deminished the enjoyment I've gotten out of the game.I cannot judge performance too harshly as I realize I am running this on an older card, but I have had several issues with studdering and extreme LOD popin. Both of which I can understand, like I said old card, but the lack of graphical settings means I cannot attempt to midgate these issues myself apart from some very basic quality setting.Finally I look forward to playing many more hours of this game, and solving the many mysteries that will haunt my dreams. PS: If your like me and have the memory of a leaky bucket, I recommend playing with a smart phone camera and notepad handy.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but this game is worth it. The Witness has been one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a while. It has a Myst like quality with the island being a giant puzzle and there being a point to it all that is masked behind an abundance of small, tablet like puzzles.A lot of the hate I've read on here praises the game for its beauty and bashes it for the puzzles that are simplistic in nature originally, but progress in unique and clever ways throughout. Boiling this game down to ""Snake puzzles on a boring island"" is reductionist in the worst way because what this game does best is keep the mind swirling with where to go and what to do next while teaching you along the way.The way that teaching occurs in this game is so organic that at times it is hard to realize that you've added a new piece of the puzzle solving to your mind. This cleverness and subtelty combined with the beauty and mystery of the game make this puzzle game worth checking out.The price tag is a bit steep if these aren't your types of games so wait for a sale and pick it up as soon as you can.10/10			"

												I really thought I would like this game. Unfortunately, I don't have a gaming PC, and the bad framerate, terrible looking visuals on low quality, and occasional visual glitches even on lowest settings gave a terrible first impression. The puzzles can be clever, I was even impressed by some of the more innovative ones that used the surroundings, but it seems as if it's mostly the same puzzle with a new twist for all of those 500 puzzles, which can only be fun to a point. I love puzzle games, but I guess it was my fault for expecting this to be another Portal 2 or Talos Principle, which it is very different from. Luckily, Steam refunds are very forgiving, so I'm glad that I at least got to try the game out and see what I thought. If considering getting this game, make sure you have a pretty good PC, and you might like it.			"

												Buying and Playing the Witness: A MetaphorYou meet a really insanely beautiful girl, and she seems interested. She quotes all of your favorite philosophers in normal conversation, which is intriguing. When you ask her questions she has a way of coyly ignoring them entirely and turning the question around on you. The first date is a frankly overpriced dinner and then a film series of lectures at the local college. Some interesting things are said but the movies drag on for an awkwardly long time. She wants to take it slow and frankly so do you, this is all so new and exciting!Well long story short, when you do finally(weeks later) spend the night with her.  In the morning you find that she only has a single book in the house and it is ""500 Famous Quotations."" Many of which she has already casually slipped into conversation. You go out to breakfast and it slowly dawns on you that she is actually a shallow and incredibly boring girl, and the verbal game she plays to avoid people finding this out about her is wearing thin. But hey, there might be something you missed there right? Maybe? I mean she's SOOOOOO Beautiful. Maybe if you just stick with it...Well take it from the Ex-boyfriend, THERE ISN'T. You will only grow to hate her in time. BAIL NOW!			"

												You expect many types of puzzles in this game however they are all based on the block and line draw idea (albeit with many variants). This becomes boring very quickly. Solving puzzles does not move on the story since there is hardly any story to speak off. I expected it to be like Obduction or Quern (open world; adventure; puzzle; good atmospere and story) but it is completely different (i.e. a lot worse). I played it for more than 2 hours in the hope that it would become better but it didn't and couldn't get a refund due to the playtime. Then used a walkthrough to get through the game in hoping to get some entertainment from the story but that also was a waste of time. Highly not recommended; buying a sudoku book is cheaper and more fun.			"

												This is one of those games I'm not really sure if I recommend.  TL;DR: only play it if you want a visually-appealing puzzler.It's a good puzzle game with a variety of mechanics and it does a great job of teaching you how they work without explicitly telling you.  While there is some relationship between the puzzles and the world, the puzzles are, for the most part, 2D, so don't pick this up expecting a 3D puzzler.  The island is very pretty, but it doesn't feel alive, which I found kind of offputting.  This game tries way too hard to be profound and completely fails in my opinion; it's just pretentious.  REALLY pretentious.  Like there are up to 10+ minute video/audio clips on philosophy taken completely out of context scattered around the island pretentious.  Don't expect any resemblence of a plot either.			"

												This is not just a puzzle-game, it's a work of art. Both graphically, but also how geniously the puzzles tie this world together. They show us how just one single simple puzzle concept, can take shape in 500 ways. That is the definition of beauty.For me, a solid 10/10.			"

												Do you like the cardgame Mao?This game functions a lot like that. Rules will occasionally be added without indication or explanation and stumbilng across them may inconsistently set you back as previous puzzles unsolve themselves. Add to this a lack of anything resembling a progression, explanation or, hell, even a map let alone something resembling a plot and you end up with an irritating rule-guessing game.Personally, I can't stand it.

												Frustrating for all the wrong reasons.I like puzzles. I even like stupidly hard puzzles, assuming the solution is fair. The game isn't frustrating because the puzzles are hard.It's frustrating because you can't tell if a puzzle is solvable. In an attempt to be artsy and deep, there are no tutorials or instructions. Instead, there are tutorial puzzles that teach you fundamental rules, and some rules you have to figure out on your own. That's okay too, but it's very easy to end up at a puzzle without having encountered the relevant tutorial puzzles. You constantly wonder, ""Am I just not figuring out the puzzle? Or am I just unable to solve the puzzle at this point in the game? Do I spend 10 minutes attempting to solve a puzzle that might be impossible, or do I wander around an island looking for another tutorial that may or may not exist?""			"

												Horrible slow, boring puzzles. definitely a ""genre"" game.Loved Braid but i utterly despise this.Without a guide i dont know how you would ever work out some of the puzzle rule sets unless you where already familiar with that way of thinkingFor example the icon that causes your ""line"" to miss 1 icon, like if your dividing different coloured dots up it causes one dot to be ignored. nothing i come across explained that or made it clear so ive just been brute forcing it which is no way to enjoy the game.Same as the Star icon, how would you ever know that they needed to be cut up into pairs????? sure perhaps im coming along puzzles not in the right order and perhaps further exploration there may be a simple star puzzle that makes this clear but in the quarry your presented with this puzzle and no explanation on how to defeat it.sure exploring this giant open world area may yield a clue to this but that for me is rubbish game design and a way to artificially extend game lifeGah, just thinking about this pretentious time wasting game makes me madplay if you like pure puzzles, if not avoid(even if you loved braid)			"

												20 hours in on the PS4 version (and about 30% through the game), but had to chime in here.This game is the Dark Souls of puzzle games. Period. No hand holding. No hints or tips. Very challenging. This game will test you.Puzzle-wise this is up there with Portal, Antichamber, and Talos Principle. This game is design quality across the board. The puzzles range from easy to medium to hard, to mind-bendingly infuriating. But, they all make sense, and once you ""get it"", your frustration will go away. You will get stuck in this game. A lot. You need to be willing to be ok with being stuck, and trial and error, and moving on and coming back to puzzles later.I see some reviews dismiss this as ""LOL an iPad puzzle game"". Guessing that they played an hour and didn't even scratch the surface of what this game has to offer. Of course it starts off easy. There is insane depth and complexity in the panel puzzles as you progress.Visually gorgeous. The island is large and has a ton of different biomes on it. You are never bored of the same area, and you are constantly discovering new areas. I thought I had a feel for the overall island and found to new major areas. The island is also easy to navigate due to the biome diversity.I can't really recommend this game enough, but it's not going to be for everyone. You need to have an attention span, and enjoy puzzles and enjoy a severe challenge (without hopefully running to YouTube for solutions every 10 minutes). Those that do enjoy this game should be rewarded with one of the best puzzle game exeriences of all time.			"

												I'm a massive fan of the Talos Principle, to which many are comparing this game. I can't agree, and haven't enjoyed The Witness nearly as much. My major problem is that this game broadcasts that IT'S IMPORTANT at every chance. The game is silent because IT'S IMPORTANT.  There is no motivation for the puzzles because IT'S IMPORTANT. There are no rewards for solving puzzles because THE GAME IS IMPORTANT. There's no story BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT. And so on, and so forth. And just 2 Achievements makes me mad. So I'm a human being and like making some visible progress in games. Sue me. I feel like somebody in the crowd watching the Emperor go by in his new clothes, except for the fact that he's completely naked.			"

												Hands down most beautiful game I've ever played, without a doubt. The island's biomes are impossibly calming and wonderful to walk around and they each feel natural and flow into each other well.The puzzles, however, are incredibly frustrating. I'm not the best at puzzle games, nor are these types of puzzles my speciality but I don't find running around randomly, hoping to catch a glimpse of a hint at what to do to begin solving a puzzle, particularly enjoyable. Many puzzle mechanics feel like 'guess my number, it's between 1 and 100'.Also, the design choice to force the player to REDO the last puzzle if they fail one is probably the dumbest feature of all time for a puzzle game. What is the point? The puzzles are all too large for brute forcing anyway, and even if I did want to brute force it, why stop me?Loved looking at it, hated playing it.			"

But for me, it cost too much for what it is and the only difference between this game and the cell phone games is you have to walk each puzzle. The graphics and sound are nice, but this is not like Myst at all. If that's what your looking for. It may look like it, but it's not.

												My Short Review of ""The Witness""What makes The Witness a sublime game is that the mechanics continue to build upon themselves in profound ways. However, going into more detail about the WAYS in which these continue to expand and evolve really would spoil the experience. I am willing to say is the following:1) Despite how it may first appear, it isn't all just simple line puzzles on series of monitors about ""connecting the dots."" This mechanic forms the heart of the game, but it develops beyond that in really cool ways.  These include expanding out into the world surrounding the puzzles so that the game and the world work in symbiosis.2) It's going to push you to constantly re-examine the assumptions you've made about how the game plays and maybe even larger assumptions about the way you think in general, about the limitations of human perception and the way we make meaning.  I can say that of very few games.Very few puzzle games are of the caliber of the Witness. I've put about 20 hours into it thus far and I would rank it with the likes of Portal. It's going for something very different tonally (The Witness is austere where Portal is satirical), but it is that caliber of puzzle game and similarly highly unique.And that's not to mention the aesthetics of the world it establishes. It's a beautiful world with shades of Myst. Imagine the ambling about the lost city of Pompey with a proliferation of pastel coloring at every angle.  And it has a polish goes goes all the way down to the satisfying ""thump"" when you lock a puzzle in place or the ping when you query the cursor. This isn't a cheaply made thing. It is a thing made with the type of loving care to detail that is very rare. There's no jankiness or weird graphical glitches or animation hitches we've come to expect with modern game design's growing pains anywhere to be seen. Nothing but a high caliber sheen. I would just like to end by discussing the supposedly controversial price point of the ""The Witness."" If you are someone who plays games but doesn't think this game is worth $40 then there are really only two possible explanations:1) You have not played it yet and don't realize you are profoundly wrong. Profoundly. 2) You are a very stupid person. In the first case, allow this review to inspire you to give it a shot. In the second case, you are likely too dumb to appreciate this game anyway and someone should probably come and take that $40 away from you before you accidentally shove it up your nostrils and suffocate in your idiot confusion over trying to use your mouth as a breathing apparatus.

												As much as I would like to enjoy this game, it is incredibly hard to because of the constant stream of philosophical ideas being thrown at the player whenever they find a secret or solve a hard puzzle. I don't want to hear the philosophy, I just want to explore an island full of puzzles and solve as many as I can find. From what I've seen, game designers have a bad habit of forcing the player to listen to ideas such as those in puzzle games, encouraging the player to not only think about the puzzle, but the ideas, too.If you don't want to deal with annoying things like that, then do not buy this game.

												Some negative reviews mention that they do not like the game because ultimately, it's a challenging and repetitive puzzle game about a line on a grid. However for me that would be forgetting the thing that makes the whole difference: it is making you travel and wander in a beautiful, extremely dense and detailed universe, full of questions and history.It does something very few  games do right, that is capturing an ambient, pushing you in a universe that's here not only as a filler, but also something that questions you in a very subtle and progressive way.Not many games make me think about their universe after I'm done playing them, and The Witness definitely does that about its puzzle and environment.It also makes you feel like you are travelling and exploring something alive, which is too rare in games for me.I got back the sensation I had when playing games like The Wind Waker, Journey or the Metroid series, this sensation of exploring something natural and alive, coherent. And that's worth way more than 40 bucks.AND it makes something that no puzzle game do, that is managing to teach you very complex rules little by little, without using any text. When you get to realize you just learnt something all by yourself, that's the greatest reward you can get and yes, it's more than enough for me to keep on going. If you want to get some fireworks, explosions and pumped up music everytime you do something great, then sure you won't like the game. But honestly, is it really what matters?The Witness tells you to enjoy the trip not the destination, and it does it in a remarkable way.			"

												GOOD:Clean, minimalistic, vivid graphics and beautiful environments.Good learning curve, seamless and unintrisive tutorials, high difficulty and sense of rewardA lot of different and clever uses for a singular puzzle mechanic - drawing a line from point A to point BSpoiler: Landscape puzzles (and perspective-based mini-secrets) are easily the best thing about the game and its selling point for me. Discovering one for the first time was definitely a ""wow"" moment.BAD:Greatly overpriced for what it offersThe insitence to have the line-drawing mechanic be the only way to interact with the world makes some interfaces needlesly cumbersome and complexPlaying with pen and paper at hand is nearly a must - some kind of system to take notes within the game would be appreciatedFor a game that claims to ""treat (the player's) time as precious"" it has a fair share of deliberately slow sequences forcing the player to waitThe biggest flaw: Instead of actual writing, or even an attempt at writing, the game only has audio recordings of quotes by scientists, philosophers, and other famous people. Most of them are taken out of context and have nothing to do with the puzzle/s at hand. A good part of them is overly long or spoken out with undue emphasis - it quickly becomes evident that they're meant to be read, not listened to. One particular quote from the top of the mountatin is extremely long-winded, naive, and generally poorly written - which is no surprise considering its author is not even a writer - proving distracting and ruining the atmosphere. All in all they add the feeling of unpleasant, clumsy pretentiousness and holier-than-thou attitude to what would otherwise be a humble, minimalist game like Braid was.BOTTOM LINE:If you like inventive puzzles, beautiful scenery and good writing, buy Talos Principle.If you like inventive puzzles, beautiful scenery, and dislike good writing, go for Witness - when it gets a 50% discount.

												As one of the few people to actually 'beat' The Witness (I was able to get it refunded after ~10 hours of gameplay), this is one of the least rewarding gaming experiences I have ever had.  The Professor Layton games are good because on top of the puzzles there are charming characters and a narrative.  Same with the Puzzle Agent games.  This game would lose very little if it was instead published as a puzzle book next to crossword and Sudoku books. If you want a good puzzle game, buy those previous games or The Talos Principle. You can probably get all of them for the same price.  And they are all good games.Edited to add Fez.  Wow, what a game. Fez is a game with a good meta.			"

												The WitnessI purchased this game, because I listened to a group of people talk about it on a podcast.  I enjoyed roughly the first 6 hours.  The puzzles were really enjoyable and I felt a great sense of achievement once I conquered some rather difficult puzzles.After about 6 hours, I had no sense of direction where to go.  I kept getting lost, and wondered if I was going into an area that maybe too difficult and frustrating, and there might be a little easier spot I should be in.  Then I arrived to a place where I decided to quit the game.  In this particular area on the island I was at a puzzle that kept stumping me.  I tried every single pattern I could thing of(I solved the one Tile previous) but I couldnt come up with a solution.  I gave up about after an hour and looked online for a tip.  Unaware, I had no idea I had to be listening to background noises.  I am tone-deaf and I thought every sound I heard in the background was just static and was just there to keep the game from getting too quiet.  I knew there were enviromental aspects to puzzles, so I LOOKED around for clues.  If I didn't look that up, I could never have completed the game.  If I knew the game would be this crypic and had rely on my ear for particular pitches, I would have NOT purchased the game.  The 80 puzzles, I did complete though were very fun and quiet enjoyable.  I just wasn't prepared for the PT(Silent Hills) type stuff for this title. "

												Omg! Don't buy this game unless you're a freaking Zen Buddhist! I like puzzle games. I even like walking simulators and I love the artwork of The Witness. So I figured I'd ignore the bad reviews and give it a shot since it was on sale for 35% off. Oh man I wish I hadn't. I played a good amount on my first two play throughs and then I wandered into an area where the walkway I was standing on turned into a moving platform when I solved the puzzle. Cool. Only the next two puzzles were too confusing to figure out. No big deal, I'll just go back. Hmm... can't jump back there's no jump key... I know, I'll fail the puzzle and it should put the walkway back to it's original position. Nope? That's frustrating. Oh well, I'll start a new game because I finally made sense of some earlier nonsense. An hour and a half later I'm feeling better cause I'm making a lot more progress than I did before. Hmmm what's this? A puzzle where it incorporates the rocks in the background into the solution. Oh that's neat! Next... ok these are interesting but... hmmm why can't I figure out this one with only a single rock in it? 20 minutes and a hundred attempts later ""Eff it, I don't care if I can't solve them all let's check a walkthrough. Ok WTF? You have to position your character 45 degrees to the left of the sign and then you'll see some rocks that line up properly so you can solve it. Urgh that was lame... next puzzle... oh, looks like they want me to do it again? Check the walkthrough. Nope, it's these trees in the background... but wait a minute that solution doesn't even make sense when they tell me the answer! Ok Eff this game!My hat is off to those that can actually solve these isoteric nonsensical puzzles and somehow enoy themselves at the same time, but holy crap I  haven't had a game make me want to rage quit this much since... ever! If it wasn't a digital download I'd turn the disc into a shuriken and throw it at the wall!AAARRRRRRRGGGGGGH!			"

												This is the most frustrating puzzle game I have ever played. In here you will guess a solution, hear a buzz, guess again, etc. until you figure out the mechanic on your own. Would it be too much to ask for a one sentence description of how the new mechanics work? Some of the new mechanics have a bank of tutorial puzzles that are easier and supposed to teach you how to use them. Or you will end up doing what I did and solve some your first try and not understand at all what you are doing. The game world looks amazing and the puzzles are ok once you know the mechanics, but the lack of instructions make this more frustrating than fun. I am about halfway through and can't take anymore.

												Since it's described as a challenging, good-looking puzzle game on a mysterious island, I hoped this game would be more like the Myst series (still some of the best puzzle games out there). Unfortunately the puzzles aren't integrated into the landscape at all. In Myst, by contrast, all of the puzzles make sense in context. Granted, that context is sometimes more fantastic than realistic, but the puzzles are cool enough to make sense as elements of fantasy. But you can't ask me to suspend my disbelief far enough to believe that someone would lock all their doors with little puzzle games on tablet computers. I look at a puzzle in The Witness and I think, ""There is no possible way to explain that thing in the lore except as a puzzle for visitors. It could have been a game of tic-tac-toe or a game of Minesweeper and it would make as much sense in context.""Which is too bad, because the world looks really cool. I just have no interest in doing brainteasers that have no apparent connection to that world.			"

												You can say many things about John Blow, but there's one thing which is impossible to deny. He is one hell of a great designer. To be able to squeeze so much fun from such a basic puzzle like the ones presented in the Witness requires nothing short of a genius. My favourite puzzle game, after just a few hours of playing. Undoubtedly worth it at any price.			"

												To reiterate what others have said, it's just not worth the asking price of $40.Walking through the world can be nice, but the puzzles are so one-dimensional I felt like I was playing one of those free-to-play puzzlers available on the phone. And at least I can play those while on the toilet! I know I didn't get far into the story, but the puzzles simply weren't captivating enough to invest me in any semblence of a story it might have had.I'd probably go for it if it gets under $10. Otherwise not worth it.			"

												One of the most colorful games I've ever played, so far it's really beautiful. It starts off with simple puzzles that gradually increase in it's level of abstraction and difficulty as you go along, a lot of hamilton and euluer circuits, The developer spent a good deal of time playing with forced perspective and lots of interesting visual tricks, each new surprise along the way is filled with intrigue and tinge of awe.

												""You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home.""They got the alone on a strange island part right.  The problem is, the puzzles are on these incongruous pads littered all over the landscape.  You draw a colored line from the round start pad to the exit.  Now draw it while separating these colored dots from those colored dots, or while covering dots on the path.  Or something else.  There's literally nothing to explain any of this to you - you figure it out by trial and error.Some of the pads are pretty self-explantory.  Others you sit there scratching your head and wondering what on earth you're intended to do.  Once you've figured one type of pad out, you'll easily plow through others of the same type... but that won't be any help at all with the weird unmarked hexagon pad that you were scratching your head about.  Now I enjoy a good puzzle as much as most people, but somehow I'm not getting my jollies when I'm drawing lines on pads to get power to more pads so I can draw lines on them - it's just dull.In the two hours I spent as of this review, I've wandered around a few different areas and completed one.  My reward for this completion was a laser pointing way off into the distance.  What does the laser do?  Why does this island have hundreds of panels devoted to drawing lines, simply to power it and presumably other lasers?  Maybe you'll get some sort of plot exposition at the end of the game, but you certainly won't for the rest of it.  You're alone on a strange island, deal with it.			"

												Most of the game is very fun. Its satisfying to solve puzzles and explore the island. However, the endsequence of the game is just...awful. Without spoiling anything, you have to solve several randomized puzzles in about ten seconds each, before they reset to new ones. And they are randomized to the point where most of the ones they show you are literally impossible to solve. If you can play a game and just enjoy the beginning parts without feeling like you need to beat it, than you might enjoy this. If youre like me and a bad last level will ruin the game, avoid.			"

												Well ... after a couple of hours playing, enjoying the atmosphere and art, solving a couple of the puzzle types ... the game simply didn't have anything to offer, just the same repetitive puzzles and mechanics ... the same atmospheric environments ... and nothing more. I got so very bored that I simply quit and won't play it again. If you are into repetitive and gradated puzzles - you can play them here on a nice atristic bacground, but this is all this game can offer. You can simply buy a paper magazine with puzzles and sudoku and solve those ... I don't recommend this game.			"

												I love puzzle games such as Portal, The Talos Principle and Braid, but i can't enjoy this game. All puzzles are the same square which you drag a line from start to finish with a little twist on rules to complete it. The biggest problem I have is that the game doesn't gives you a hint how the rules work. You could be stuck a long time before you figured it out. It would not be so bad if you could quickly and easily get to another puzzle to solve. But how you navigate through the island is a joke. The boat is awfully slow. There is no jumping which means that the slightest little rock or uphill on the road hinders your movement which forces you to use the lane on the ground. To many things to be frustrated at in order to recommend this game.			"

												In a bright and vibrant world that hurts your eyes; Johnathan Blow shows how pretentious he can be in not-so-complicated-if-you-know-what-to-do puzzle design that drags all across a small island, whilst you find audio logs that quote Einstein at you that are hard to follow and make you feel stupid in contrast, seeing that you're playing an overly complicated maze game that ""respects your intelligence"".I didn't play much but as a slow individual I am it seems like the kind of journey I'll leave more confused than what I went in on. I wanted to like it but the only premise I had of discovery is that if you don't enjoy the core aspect of listening to footstep noises and solving monkey puzzles you won't enjoy this game.Price tag is kinda heafty too - but whatever puts food on Mr.Blow's gilded table, man.

												This is truly the best puzzle game I've played so far,and this is coming from someone who has played hundreds before.Of course, if you absolutely hate puzzle games, this may not be for you,but if you've ever enjoyed games such as Portal, The Room, Talos Principle,Braid, Myst, etc, this game is the pinnacle of puzzle games.The preview is purposefully vague, and if you look for videos online,what you will find will look fairly repetitive and dull, but this game is so far from that.At no point it feels like a grind or a chore like many other puzzle games do.In this game, each puzzle brings something new, each puzzle makes you feel smart.But not artificially, the game is all about letting you have real epiphanies.It never hand holds you, you have to do all the work, and that's why it's satisfying.This game, unlike many other puzzle games, isn't about solving a puzzle given a clearset of rules, but rather about figure out the rules yourself. It first teaches you a simple""puzzle language"", but then beyond that, it runs wild and you have to follow on your own.The main gameplay aside, the gorgeous scenes is probably what you first notice lookingat all the media and trailers. It definitely helps the experience, and is refreshing to look atbetween solving puzzles. There are also hidden audiologs throughout the world (withamazing voice acting) which again can be soothing inbetween puzzles.The one big complaint I do have about the game is slow animations. Anythingthat movies is painfully slow, and I'm guessing it is to get you to enjoy the scenery,but I think that's bad game design.All in all, I truly think this game is a work of art which will remembered yearsin the future. It does so many things right and brings a lot to the genre.			"

												The game feels repetitve, and the world feels lifeless.  The puzzles are all samey trace-through-a-maze-with-caveats.  Many puzzles to me seemed sort of post-facto rationalized, by that I mean, they don't construct/progress very intuitively/naturally from first principles and only tended to ""make sense"" after they're finished (if then).  There are quasi-religious ""recordings"" laying around here and there, which are utterly pointless.  After a few I just stopped activating them.Ultimately, this game had zero reason to be a ""first person"" game.  It's merely an affectation here, and the walking around is a time wasting mechanic to add padding.  It should've just been a Flash game on Newgrounds.I haven't finished the game and I don't see any point in continuing.  Maybe the island explodes in the end or something.  Who cares.			"

												If you really like puzzles, are a completionist, and are very self-motivated, then I suppose I could recommend this game to you. As for everyone else, I wouldn't bother with The Witness.My biggest problem with the game is that I found it incredibly un-rewarding. I have never played through a game, made it to the end, and been so unengaged that I felt as if I was wasting my time by bothering to watch the ending. If this game had some semblance of a storyline to follow, like the Talos Principle did, I would think much more highly of this game.The game is presented marvelously. The visuals and audio were really a pleasure. Interacting with the environment and puzzles all felt very impactful and responsive.The puzzles were very well designed and the game does a good job of teaching you new mechanics without a single word. Though I would say that it does very little more than a good job at this. Getting stuck on a puzzle in this game was not at all a pleasant experience because of the lack of instruction. The puzzles force you to think outside the box, but the game gives very little guidance on how you should go about doing so. So you often get stuck on a puzzle just because you have not yet been able to guess the mechanic used in the puzzle.Apart from the visuals and the difficulty of the puzzles, the secrets very fun to search for and find. If only there was more of a reward for doing so, I could honestly see myself coming back just to search for secrets.All in all, if you're itching for more first person puzzles like Talos Principle and Anticamber and have already played through both, you can give The Witness a shot. Though be prepared for it to be an unrewarding experience.			"

												The game has a beautiful art style. But I just can't comprehend how this game deserves more than 5/10 for anyone. It's not really a game? There are puzzles. But the puzzles could be done on paper. Don't get me wrong, the puzzles are difficult, but there isn't anything that requires this to be on a computer if that makes any sense.I kind of get the vibe that this game is more of an ""experience"" than it is a game... IE: Supposed to be meditative. Would explain why ""the witness"" (Buddhism reference) is used as the title. If I'm correct on this, its fine for what it is. But its definitely not what I would call an enjoyable experience.			"

												I went into this game almost completely blind. I just knew it was gonna have puzzles and that Jonathan Blow designed it, but otherwise I didn't read about it.I can only afford like 2-3 full priced games per year, and so far this game has been a lot of fun. I'll update my review as I play more. The puzzles are a lot less ""mechanical"" than most puzzle games. Instead, they slowly build your intuition of how to solve related puzzles, and how they connect to one another. Whenever you see a row of panels, it's usually a tutorial introducing a new mechanic, or new combination of existing mechanics. It's hard to explain, but it almost feels like learning a sport. The exploration aspect is pretty great too, and directly influences how to solve some panels. Beautiful art style and graphics.Very decent framerate on my cheap laptop with a AMD A6-6310 (1.8GHz) and AMD R4 GPU (2 GCN cores), using medium settings, which is pretty good considering this laptop struggles to play Bioshock 1.I'm not usually into puzzle games, but I'd recommend this one./edit1: ah, that explains the lack of graphics options besides low/med/high. In this game, various graphical effects are important to puzzles. For example, if you were to disable shadows, it would break some puzzles.			"

												There is some enjoyment to be gained from figuring out the puzzle patterns and progressing through the game.  At a lower price point, it would be worth it, but right now they have priced this much too high for what it is.The puzzles very quickly get repetitive, and the story (which had a lot of potential) ends up falling flat by the end, perhaps through some misguided desire to leave any interesting details up to the player's imagination.

There's always some total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gimmick blocking your way from enjoying what would otherwise be an actually interesting and intellectually stimulating puzzle game. Instead, the gimmicks often force you into tedious guesswork and brute-force searches for solutions.

Nearly every puzzle in the game is the type of panel puzzle you see at the very beginning of the video.  It's like solving a book of puzzles in a park, the park is pleasant but is msotly there for ambience.  If I'd known that going in perhaps I'd give it a thumbs up but from the videos up there and the screen shots I thought it would be more of an adventure puzzle game where the environment played a large part instead of just a token amount.This game will be absolutly loved by some people but will completely turn off some as well.

												A great puzzle game.Like other great puzzle games, the basic mechanic (the 2d puzzle mazes) is consistent and at the same time completely reinvented with interesting new ideas throughout the game. In the same way that Portal ""only"" lets you shoot portals throughout the game, The Witness ""only"" lets you draw line puzzles. It keeps the game elegant and primarily a puzzle game, not an ""is this interactible or is this important?"" game.The beautiful 3d environment is not wasted. It's important for both solving the puzzles and for providing the freedom to explore puzzles in any order you prefer. You will need to pay close attention to the environment and certain 3d objects for puzzles and secrets. I find this more rewarding than filling the island with interactible ""story"" objects that you can pick up and examine. The environment does not hide useless items. It hides information.Like Antichamber, there's no typical story in The Witness, but there are mysteries. You should play this game if you consider yourself an explorer and enjoy uncovering mysteries.			"

Some expected, some unexpected. Check. The puzzles are hard. Check. The rules are unclear and are a puzzle themselves. Check. I'm still with you. But as a multi-hour game, a narrative and an experiential mystery? I'm not feeling it.The moments that transcend the little puzzles and hint at the broader, bigger game come across as pretentious monologuing. Further, they lack a connection to each other and fail to propel the character forward in a meaningful way. I can guess what's coming based on these discoveries and it's clear it will all be revealed at the END.The game is full of ""consider your own existence"", ""reflect on your place in this life"" stuff, but considering I'm 8 hours in and am beginning to look up puzzle solutions just to get to the end more quickly... It's starting to feel like the joke's on me. I quitting The Witness to consider the meaning of life elsewhere.			"

												Puzzles so far are remarkably varied given they're all ""maze""-type, and the difficulty is also comfortably mind-racking. The graphics are drop-dead gorgeous, this is literally one of the prettiest, most soothing games I've ever played and there's a real sense of ~mystery~ that pervades everything. Haven't played long but what I have played, I've liked.Extremely reminiscent of Myst in spirit, which is allegedly what the devs were after, and it's just so damn comfy it's unreal.			"

												This is a good game but an INCREDIBLY lazy PC port.The puzzle mechanics are covered by other reviews.  I find them overall enjoyable with a good degree of difficulty.  The PC experience, however, leaves a lot to be desired:1) You have to use the mouse to navigate most of the game, but the mouse does NOT work in the menu.  Thus whenever I want to quit I have to shift my hands over to the arrow keys and enter.2) Controls aren't particularly customizable.  You can FINALLY remap WASD, but all other options are pretty much mapped to left click.  It would be nice to see the ability to map things to different mouse buttons, to solve the puzzles with the arrow keys on the keyboard instead of with the mouse, or anything else that actually utilized PC controls rather than being optimized for a controller3) Resolution choices are incredibly limited - 1080p/720p/Display Size.  Due to the puzzle nature of the game I would love to be able to have the game take up most of my screen with a small window to the side to take notes on, but due to the resolution of my system (3000x2000), none of these options work for that.4) Most of the XBox/PSN achievements aren't hooked up to Steam Achievements.  A couple are, so they clearly have the infrastructure, they simply didn't bother finishing the job.5) If I change audio devices (on my machine, that's as simple as unplugging and replugging my headphones) the game doesn't cope well at all.This isn't a bad GAME, but this is undeniably the worst PLATFORM to purchase the game on at the moment.  It's a console game with a very thin veneer rather than a PC game.			"

												This is a beautiful game with a great atmosphere. The only problem with it is that it is boring as hell. The puzzles are all connect the dot like puzzles with small variations. The game also does not do a good job at explaining how to solve the different variants of the puzzles. For example there were numerous puzzles in a town that had different colored symbols. I was not able to find any help in finding a solution to these puzzles as the game doesn't explain it. I'm really disappointed in this game as I was fairly excited for it after seeing the trailers. In the end I requested a refund and I unfortunately can't recommend this game to anyone. If you're looking for a good 3D puzzle game, just stick to Portal and The Talos Principle.			"

												Starts great, offering puzzles that each build on the previous puzzle with clear rules. Then starts offering puzzles where you can learn the wrong rules. Then adds puzzles that don't tell you what you do wrong, so if you've learned the wrong rules - rules that apply to all the previous puzzles but not this one, you can't do it.Then it adds stupid as ♥♥♥♥ puzzles like the symmetrical tracing, which rely on you suddenly realising the background, a thing important in no puzzle before, is now key.

I would definitely reccomend this game if tough puzzles and exploring are your thing.			"

												This is likely a perfect game for people who aren't me. I don't find the puzzle mechanics to be engaging (think mazes with some twists; it feels like they would better be solved on a phone) nor rewarding when I solved them. The first person exploration bored me. There are a lot of colors on display, but in my brief time with the game, it wasn't a world that gripped me (like Valley did in its first open area). And the story seems to be ""you're in an area we haven't explained to you. Figure it out?"" though with no text, no context, and no goal (other than find the nearest thing that appears to be a puzzle and solve it to find the next one) I'm just bored and don't want to return.For reference, I love things like Portal, Talos Principle, and Valley. This feels very different and a lot less engaging. It is much more of a true puzzle game that you walk around in for some reason (there was one puzzle set I did get to that used this mechanic where you had to replicate a puzzle that was behind you without visual queues. There's nothing clever about it, but it did technically require you to be able to walk in the world for it to be at al solvable)Again, well done for what it is. It's just not for me.			"

												Game is so much less than I expected. Somehow I expected a real riddle game with a bandwidth  of different types of riddles. Instead I got lots an lots of puzzles, every single one puzzle is a panel, on which you have to draw the line in the right way. And thats it. Want to see a real riddle game? Try Myst. It is like 20 years old, but it has environmental riddles. Like sound riddles, or colour riddles. You have to actually think, follow hints and sometimes you just try. And a unfolding story in a stunning environment (at least it was stunning 20+ years ago :P) I bought this game in a humble bundle, still not worth it. I tried not to read things about this game to not spoil me the joy of riddling. I must say I'm disappointed on more than one level and I cannot, under no circumstances, imagine to whom I should recommend this game. Maybe a chimp but I don't want to insult the chimps intelligence.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. I have no idea what's going on with the people in the ratings here who compare it to Snake or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ because this is not only the hardest puzzle game I've ever seen (and I've been around since Myst at least) but it's the most rewarding, and the deepest, and in small moments, piece by piece, it builds to incredible ideas. It's philosophically deep and extremely powerful in terms of emotion, but still totally accessible. It is the pinnacle of how complexity can be achieved through a simple set of mechanics.The people rating this game poorly probably didn't like things like The Talos Principle or Portal either, let alone things like Myst or Riven. This game will challenge you at every step, and while it seems obtuse at first, it definitely has a thread and a message and something it wants to say.If ever there was a game that is at once an amazing gaming experience *and* can be considered a monumental piece of art, it is this game. This was seven years work for the company/people that made it, and it shows. At no moment does it compromise, and it never, in any way, cheapens itself. This game is a love letter to science, and to religion, and to games and puzzles and space and Earth and if you let it, probably the inside of your own brain too.10/10? ♥♥♥♥ that. It's unrateable. It defies categorization or ratings.			"

												The entire game is based around a single simple mechanic — solving maze puzzles — which it twists and warps as you move throughout the open-world map, resulting in some of the most interesting and innovative mechanics ever in a puzzle game. The game doesn't hold your hand and it doesn't tell you anything; you must learn the world's rules through experience and thought, and it's significantly more satisfying as a result. There will be moments when you want to get out of your chair and yell ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ NO WAY"".This is a very difficult and long game, and it's not for the impatient or faint of heart.

												The Witness is beautiful and relaxing, at times. If you enjoy difficult puzzles then you will thoroughly enjoy yourself as you continue to delve deeper into this unique puzzle world.The puzzles themselves can be quite challenging, and often times cannot be completed. Others however I find are simple hit and miss guessing games where you have to find the correct path (combination) and can be very tiresome as you have no actual clues to go off. It's a sit down and draw every combination possible and hope to get it. That I find can be quite annoying and it's about at that point where you take a break.I love puzzles, I dislike guessing games.Enjoy the long grind, and the mystery surrounding it.			"

												The short:  The Witness is a beautiful, immersive puzzle game that can surprise you with its depth, with puzzles that are conceptually simple yet continuously evolving.  It doesn't hold your hand, but it doesn't make you guess either.  It just is.The longer:  The game is stunningly gorgeous with bright colors and high contrast to make the world feel alive, but it the artistic style contrasts with the absolute desolation you feel while exploring the island.  There is no sound except what a deserted island would traditionally give you, not even any background music.  And it works together to put you in this strange world.The game begins immediately and begins tasking you with puzzles that teach you how to play as you move forward.  There are no traditional tutorials, just simple puzzles that teach you concepts before they get crazier.  They're carefully designed and incremental in such a way that it gives you a clear avenue in HOW to learn what everything is doing and why it works.  It doesn't make you guess, but it gives you the avenue to learn.  It teaches you to fish, so to speak.And it's refreshing.  The atmosphere is foreboding in spite of its simplicity.  Silent in spite of the loud colors.  The world is building and you're becoming a part of it.  I haven't felt this INTO a puzzle game since Portal, yet it is nothing like Portal in absolutely the best way.Also, you can watch me play through it here:

If you're into endless silent puzzles, prepare to be delighted, but I was truly hoping for some sort of plot, or just any sort narrative. The Witness is just a hipster art show that you need a strong fortitude to get through.Edit: It is on sale, apparently. Still not worth it.			"

												the first hour I didn't get it. I thought I was going to be doing the same puzzle over and over. But as I explored I learned that it's not the same puzzle, and they start to get a lot crazier and more meaningful. The only con is that I feel super sick after playing.			"

												Visuals are fantastic, story seems non existent. So why am I solving these boring 2D line puzzles again? Audiologs seem pretty random. Some are really really bad, while some are good. Either way there aren't many and they all seem to just be  historical quotes which scream lazy. I found gameplay to be rather terrible, it's just not fun 98% of the time. Mechanics aren't well explained, and very often I'd find myself just brute forcing through a series of puzzles with no understanding of the particular uderlying mechanic whatsoever, then getting stuck when puzzle complexity with given mechanic went beyond what's possible to brute force by luck due to too many possible permutations.I did really enjoy just walking around exploring the visuals, but that's about it. If it was marketed as a transcedental visual no-gameply experience, such as Proteus, and had comparable price, then it could have deserved a positive review.			"

So far this game seem really interesting. The puzzles are starting to get complicated after an hour of gameplay but as the devs an player states, move away from the puzzle if you don't get it. There will be other puzzles to do which might aid you in other puzzles you previosly couldn't solve. Other than that, the game looks beautiful but the lack of graphical settings is anoying. And so far into the game there is no music att all which makes the game a bit too quiet.			"

												This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ I have been playing about 5 hours, and while the game starts out relatively easy, it doesn't take long before you will pull your hair out in agony. It's filled with clever puzzles that will challenge your memory, critical thinking and observations.But the game is not without its flaws:1.  It doesn't have any coherent story, which can both be good and bad.2.  it doesn't have any ingame music, and only ambiant sounds will be heard during the game. I think that's a shame.But overall i'm definitely glad I purchased this game.			"

												First of all this game is for people who enjoys puzzle games. This games has good graphics, the puzzles are also challenging as you clear out different stages. There is not too much of a story its just you roam around the island and search for puzzles then you solve them. To be honest I enjoying the game eventhough I am not too much into the game yet, but props to devs for making this awsome game keep up the good work!! :)			"

												Masterpiece of ambience, soul and puzzle solving.  Don't listen to any who might claim that the puzzles are samey or repetitive. This would be a mistake on the part of the unobservant.  While the core mechanic of many puzzles does indeed borrow from the same design, you will be utilizing this toolkit in myriad unexpected ways.  Both the environment around you and the techniques you learn along the way will be central to perservering.  This is the premiere dynamic and deceptively difficult minimalist thinking-person's game which has been too scarcely represented this generation.			"

Don't listen to people tear it down because of ""simple design"" or cost. This game is well worth $40.			"

Wish it could have been moved to at least third-person.

												Absolutely gorgeous graphics but the gameplay is boring as snot. Every puzzle is basically just the same thing - a bunch of 2D mazes and pretty much the only potential challenge to solving any of them is understanding the rules, there's no tools or mechanics to master or anything like that. If 'playing' 'games' like Sudoku doesn't make you wish you were dead then you might actually enjoy this but for everyone else just save your money unless you're happy paying this much for a bunch of pretty screenshots.

												I like the concept, solve puzzles and solve a mistery, Talos Priciple style. Sadly this game is very ffrustrating to control. There are no tutorials so half the time you have no clue what to do. One time I was atop a castle wall, and saw something down inside the castle that I wanted to check out, so I tried to jump down, only to find out you cannot jump down anywhere in this game, because invisible walls block you. Took me literaly 3 minutes to walk around. If you are like me, and you play puzzle games to relax, don't play this. It will frustrate you more than anything else. A shame, because it looked so promising.			"

												It's a puzzle how Jonathan Blow could make such a boring game. I love Braid and I love Myst so I bought this game. I can't stand it. There's only one good thing about it - it's pretty. That made me walk around for about half an hour to see the world. The other two hours I spent grinding through simple numerous repetitive puzzles. I can't fathom how Mr Blow thought that little maze puzzles would be at all interesting. There was some intriguing stuff with perspective, but it couldn't make up for walking slowly around a corner and finding a bank of six puzzles all minutely expanding on the same idea. It is a horrible way to do a tutorial. Just tell me what the mechanic is and give me a hard puzzle, not these puzzles for babies. Unfortunately, I've played more than two hours so I am unable to get a refund, but you can still save your money - Do Not Buy This Game!			"

You want to solve puzzles, but you mostly run around in circles.Also expect 100% only grid puzzles, there's nothing else.Expect no red line, expect no story, expect no explanations.You just randomly walk in a seasonal landscape, then a puzzle pops up, you hope you've learned the trick, or you will have to search for an ""easier"" puzzle to start with.Also there's no feeling of reward completing a puzzle, it just clears, and then, you search for a new one which you've learned the trick to (which can take a ♥♥♥♥ing long time)Everything in the video is taken out of context, do not trust it.This game is one which would actually be better if it was linear.

												While I had really looked forward to this game for some time now, it ended up being unplayable on my system configuration.  Hardware and OS are within the recommended specifications, drivers have been udpated for GPU and peripherals, game still crashes to desktop and doesn't consistently save with the ""auto save"" feature.Loads successfully and plays through the tutorial area well enough and I really did thoroughly enjoy it... then loads the first video sequence.  The video plays through to the end, faces the sky and then crashes to desktop without a log or executable popup error.Attemtped to migrate steam app directory to another storage drive off of the OS drive in case it had been UAC or permissions nonsense but same CTD issue.  Ran game under each quality setting and windowed mode with/without vsync, same issue.  Not using SLI or windows 10.CPU - Intel 4770kGPU - Nvidia GTX 780Windows 8.1Don't have time to spend troubleshooting it as I'm just under the 2 hour mark alone with testing settings to try and get it running and would surpass the refund window.

												As someone who loved Braid and is a massive fan of The Talos Principle, I went in excited and ready to explore and solve a bunch of clever puzzles. It was immediately beautiful and spotting a little secret made me excited to discover how the game would reward exploration. This is where it slowly became apparent the game wouldn't have those story threads that I wanted from it. The game is priced at 36,99€ which is quite a lot for what is essentially a collection of maze puzzles.Pros:Gorgeous visual style, runs greatThe core mechanic of the mazes works wellInteresting use of environment in the puzzlesCould skip and try other puzzle areas if stuckCons:Price!No straight support for resolutions over 1920, had to manually edit the config fileNo straight support for adjusting FOV. This has caused nausea for a lot of people, but as in most cases can be fixed through raising the FOV in the config file. Check PC gaming wiki for more info.Game doesn't tell you there's a sprint button (shift). No keybinds in the menu and no way to know such a keybind exists without getting frustrated and randomly discovering it by pressing a bunch of keys.Not much story content and the little there is mostly relies on your imagination.Some of the different areas do a poor job with their tutorial puzzles as it wasn't always fully clear what the ruleset for a particular zone was even after doing 5+ puzzles in them. Some might view this as a positive, but I found it needlessly frustrating. As quickly as one puzzle gave me the ""a-ha!"" feeling, the next one seemed to change the rules.No clear sense of progression or a goal other than ""solve everything you see"" "

Posted: January 30, 2016
												I was fairly disappointed in this game.  I can't recommend it.  The puzzle aspect will appeal to certain players though.The island:  was not beautiful.  It's just simplistic looking polygonal objects in positively garish, over-bright and over-saturated colors.  Exploring the island was distinctly unpleasant.  Maybe it was the tight FOV that made me feel like I had blinders on.  Maybe it was how the camera moved.  Maybe it was a combination of things, but moving around the world was not an enjoyable experience.  And usually I love exploring game worlds.  I explored every little thing in the Talos Principle, for example, and positively got lost in the Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Skyrim.  I was really surprised at my own reaction to the island in this game.  I found the world very off-putting.The puzzles:  the difficulty, for me, wasn't so much of a learning curve as it was steep learning steps.  Puzzle progression repeatedly went from mildly challenging to WTH?  I also ran into a healthy dose of puzzles where I couldn't find anything mentally to work with; just a grid with a zillion different ways to draw the line without any apparent direction at all.  I did a lot of wandering around the island looking for puzzles I could actually do.  Too much wandering given how unappealing I found the environment.  I thought the difficultly curve was handled poorly.Several reviews I read spoke of a language in this game about how the solutions to the puzzles should look, the rules you should apply when drawing the line to solve them.  Learning that language was kind of fun.  You stumble into an area with a bank of panels and solve the first one.  Getting the first solution is pretty easy.  Then you look at the panel and wonder why that solution worked.  You can probably come up with half a dozen explanations.  Then the next panel further illuminates that rule.  You may or may not eliminate some of those explanations.  By the 5th or 6th puzzle you've probably gotten a decent handle on the rule at play, but further variations show that you don't have it down all that well.  More variations unpack unapparent complexities in that particular rule.  And just when you think you understand the rule and its sublties you come to a panel where the rule as you've learned it just doesn't work anymore, or it just doesn't look possible to draw the line and stick to the rule.  A brick wall so to speak.  I ran into a lot of those.Also, the borders of the puzzles were confusing to me.  It seemed to  me that the rules about drawing the line to solve the puzzle broke down at the borders/edges.  I'm not sure, maybe I needed to think that through better.  Maybe it was just my (flawed) understanding of the rule that broke at the edges not the actual rule.  I didn't play enough to really nail down which was the case.No key binding:  I type DVORAK.  Most games today either adjust automatically or have key binding options.  (I own $20 Early Access games with key binding.)  The Witness does neither.  Not acceptable for a $40 game.Menus:  Launching the game starts up a little window to choose your graphics options.  ""Use Defaults"" is the default choice.  What are those?  Who knows?  I picked ""High"" instead.  The game ran fine but the next time I launched I had to choose ""High"" graphics options all over again.  The game didn't remember my choice.  You can interact with this window (and the game) with your mouse.  But when I exited the game mouse control vanished and I had to switch to keyboard controls to quit.  And then to confirm I wanted to quit.  Really, in 2016 for $40 I couldn't use the mouse to click ""Quit"" twice.  It's bad enough I have to confirm I want to quit.  I found it quite jarring to use the mouse so much in this game only to lose mouse support on the exit menus.  I hate to nitpick, but for $40 I expect better attention to such things.  The launch and exit menus look and feel totally last minute.Story:  none that I found in my time with the game.  I found a few audio logs with some philosophical exposition.  But we're not talking the Talos Principle here.  That game had a great story; it really touched me and brought everything together.  If there's a story in The Witness, it seems to be a very minor component of this game.Other thoughts:  FOV usually doesn't bother me, but it did in this game.  I didn't get nauseous, but it felt like I was wearing blinders.  I stumbled across a thread in the forums with a link on how to add a line in some ini file to change the FOV.  Editing ini files to change game settings is pretty horrible; that's a strike against this game for me.  I will say though that increasing the FOV helped a bit.  After making that change I found exploring the island a lot less unpleasant.  But it was still an oddly unenjoyable experience.  I think that might be due to the very bold colors.  There's no restraint with the color scheme here; it's loud, loud, loud all the way.I confess I owned this game for about 2 hrs before refunding it.  I was impressed enough by the reviews to purchase it, and a good puzzle game would have been really appealing to me right now.  But The Witness just didn't cut it.  Not for the money.  Most of my comments should absolutely be read in the context of the price I paid.  If I had picked this up for $20 or less I would have been more tolerant of the game's faults and slapped together menus.  Maybe someday I'll pick this up on a steep discount and put myself through what appears to be a really interesting mental challenge.  As it stands though, I totally regretted my purchase.			"

												Its a shame people buy this game and imediately refund it just to give it a bad review .This will be the first game iam going to review cause i have been waiting for it so long..My interest for this game has just grown every year since I have seen the Ps4 Trailer back in 2012.I like the creative and non traditional approach of the game , its refreshing instead of the other open world games that are getting published  today with often cliche storys and excessive use of the  more or less  same settings, the witness actually makes me intersted in the world.Not because it has much content and not because it has a cool historical setting  i like which i might have seen many times before. Just because its a world i cant really grasp and didnt saw a hundred times before, that is whats getting me exited for this game. Its the unknown . I dont know what i will find in those lands cause it doesnt really exist nor is it based on anything that really happened.For the Moment i will give it a thumps up although i didnt played the game a minute just to neutralize the ignorant reviews that give this a thumb down after 10 minutes just because they dont know any better .Of course i will update this review as i play this game and might give this game even a thumps down although i dont think that will happen , i will write a full review when i actually finished the game. Iam so exited to finally play it .Have fun everybody!Update 1:Played around 3 hours so far and i love it .The game keeps astonishing me with the creative use of the at first simple appearing puzzle.The way those puzzles often make you not only think about the puzzle itself but about the environment around it is really inovative and the visuals are jaw dropping.I have completet 70 Puzzles so far of 600+			"

												Graphic is terrible, I feel so dizzy (it's not about first personal, see my hours in csgo). It's 2016, such poor graphic is insanely bad.No BGM, come on. A game without BGM, last time was before FC?I also feel the puzzles really really boring. You only have a finger to cross a maze. The ""mine craft"" looking environment means nothing in the game. Probably it means something, like at the very beginning of the game, you get to the wall, and walk around. It takes you some time, but you can do nothing. You cannot jump down, so you need to waste that same amount of time to go back. Great! Is this a joke that this game is 40 dollars? This game is fully capable on IOS system (maybe even better since you can really move your finger on it), and do you want to pay 40 dollars for a puzzle solving game?

												If you like puzzle games and are up for a challenge, The Witness is your game. A beautiful island full of hundreds of little puzzles awaits you. And although all puzzles look pretty similar, if you see them on screenshots, there is a lot of variation. Also, while there is no traditional story, there are little story pieces to be discovered, scattered around the world. The Witness may not be a game for everyone, but it most certainly is one for me. ;)			"

												Zero explanation and zero hand-holding. If you want a cryptic puzzle game that will require a walkthrough to progress, then get this game. Personally, I give up. I don't want to play a game that requires a guide to beat it. Am I just stupid? Why don't you find out for only $39.99! It's pretty though. There's that.EDIT: I didn't give up. I'm still playing it and still relying on a guide when I can't figure something out rather than spending hours doing trial and error. I still don't recommend this to the general user, only people who like very difficult puzzles.			"

												This game is a pile of hipster bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ Had i spent 42$ on it, as steam seems to want me to in Canada, I would've been immensley disappointed. That said, it came with Humble Monthly so I guess the indie games/other games i get at the end of the month will make up for it.I beat it, spent a fair amount of time with a guide online, and really what I can say from that time is that it's kind of a mess. It's not fun - I like puzzle games, but this doesn't really work along those tropes. Generally speaking, the game sets up rules for how to do things, and that's great and all, but those rules tend to fall apart as the game progresses.No to it, not that there has to be one, but anyone imposing a narrative on it is really just jerkin' their gherkin to justify their enjoyment of the game.Buy it if you like hipster♥♥♥♥♥♥ but expect to spend 10+ hours to get your hipster rocks off.

												Curiosity, exploration, patience and learning are very close experiences as The Witness proves. They complete each other and learning proves itself rewarding. In life discovery is fun not because you get powerful armours but because you find a way to fulfil your curiosity.The first few minutes of Super Mario are to teach how to play and it does so via events. (Braid quotes Mario in these first few minutes quite a lot). That kind of tutorial is an intelligent learning experience. There are obvious actions to take, suggested actions and hidden actions to experiment if you are curious. The Witness is a whole game dedicated to this!This game is not for casual gamers because it could walk as master example in a philosophy book titled: Phenomenology of learning.			"

This game is 3d for no reason and it is sad how popular it is even though it has essentially no real game content and a bunch of irrelevant art.I wonder if Johnathan Blow realized he would never be able to get physics into his engine so he fell back to simple 2d mazes.  He could've made this in unreal in maybe 2 years max, and if it was just the mazes then 2 months.			"

												Update: Now that I have completed the game 100%, I can easily say this is one of my all time favorite games.I love games where exploration feels like a mechanic, and The Witness does that wonderfully. It's not only about solving puzzles, it's about finding and gathering knowledge of them.The Witness perfectly balances its learning curve, open world freedom, and environmental storytelling. You are instantly introduced on how to make progress in the game. Even in the first minutes, you're already wondering ""what's over there?"" Some puzzles require you to learn new rules from elsewhere, some require you to pay attention to the world. The graphics are beautiful and the sound design is immersive. There are some really evocative scenes in the game and I'm finding myself constantly looking at the world in awe.Highly recommended. It's a really beautiful game, full of wonder, inspiration, and great puzzles. Similar games include Myst, The Talos Principle, and Portal.			"

												This game is not fun.  It is not a game.  It's a bunch of crappy line ""puzzles"" that you have to have to get high on your own farts to come up with a nonsensical abstract or brute force ""solution"" to.  Pretty island, but that's not enough when the gameplay consists of walk slowly to a display, play with the line until it's solved by some unspoken ""logic"" or you get tired of trying to imagine what crack-addled rules the puzzle abides by, give up, slowly walk to a new display and repeat.God, what a frustrating pretentious nonsensical game.

I keep reinstalling it thinking ""maybe this time will be the time I get through it"" but then I hit another puzzle that hates its own players and it ends up wiped from my machine again.

As it so happens, I really, really didn't like the concept all that much.  That concept, of course, was moving a dot along a small maze to achieve certain goals.  If that sounds fun, hey, maybe this game is for you.  But for me, it's too late now to get a refund, but caveat emptor, I suppose.			"

												I don't normally write reviews for games on Steam, I'm going to take a minute to write one here:I bought this game because it's by the creator of Braid. I loved Braid. I hold Braid as one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time. It was a fantastic game, and every now and again, I go back and play it. I've bought it on every platform it's been available on, just because I want to support more people having access to the game.This game is not Braid. It's a series of quiet puzzles that, while satisfying to solve, quickly wore on me. I got to about my tenth series of flat puzzles that could just as easily be a flash game, and then I looked up a Let's Play of the game on YouTube. To my astonishment, the flat puzzle mechanic continues to the end of the game. This is not Braid. Do not buy it thinking it is Braid. If you like to sit and tinker with puzzles for hours and hours on end, this game will do you well. I did not, and I do not, and therefore I cannot recommend it.As a side note: the game is gorgeous. It's a shame you spend most of it looking at ugly puzzles.			"

												Do you like drawing lines?  Then this game is for you.  I was intrigued for the 1st five minutes then it occured to me...the whole @#$%^& game is like this.This is without a doubt (IMPO) the most boring game I have every played.  Innovative?  No.  Action packed? No.Interesting? For a short minute.Fun?  HELLLLL to the no.Yah, there's videos of people going through the whole game and there's a community that thinks this game is awesome and hey...more power to them.  However, I would rather go to work then play this game.  Yah...it's that boring.  You might be fooled by watching the short clips and think to yourself ""Oh it has a beautiful environment and it's a puzzle game!  Maybe this is like Portal or something cool!""  No...sooo no.I really believe the company should pay me for the time I wasted playing the game after I purchased it.  I asked Steam for a refund after trying it out.  May my suffering shelter you from making the same mistake. "

												For $40 this is an overpriced pile of garbage, my philosophy for a game to be worth the price is that one dollar for one hour, and yet this game has so little to offer, which is why i cannot play it for more than 10 minutes and it deserves this negative review. The game looks like an autistic 3 year olds art painting that the parents tell it thats its beautiful out of spite that  they dont want to make the child cry, the point is the art style is boring and offers very little to the eyes. The puzzles are uniaginative and very simple when you just take time to look at it, furthermore the puzzles feel like they were rushed or thought of on the spot and said ""that will do"". None of them made me think for the first 20 i did. And fanboys please tell me how they get so much better as you progress. The shadow of the player was very poorly done, the sounds of the footsteps and the actual footsteps themselves are time.d way off. This game feels lazy and it's disgusting that this is what gamers feel deserves an 85% positive review on steam, because in all honesty the steam review system is a joke. If you know you wont like a game you dont buy it, so you can never get a true rating on a game,			"

												SPOILERS (?) AHEADI want my 9.3 hours back. I cheated to beat this game and I'm so glad I did. (There was some essential puzzle rules that escaped me.) I was seeing all these statues of people around in the game. I was intrigued by some sort of story that I was 'witnessing' but no. After getting frustrated with the puzzles, I cheated to get to the fat of the game. And there is nothing. No story, no big reveal, no solution to the mystery. In fact, after every thing is done, you go by watching the game undo all your hard work. (unless you cheated of course, then I suppose it's someone else's hard work and your, suddenly realized, wasted labour.)I understand this is supposed to be about understanding puzzles, but c'mon. You couldn't just throw a story in there? All it would take is a little story. Instead, it just seems like a puzzle game where the developers choose philosophy and poetry quotes like they were laid on a dart board. It practically glorified bejeweled at this point.			"

												Low playtime is due to a refund. I can't say I'm entirely convinced the game is bad but I'm not going to risk $40 on a game that has failed to grab me and shows no real signs of doing so in the near future.Puzzles are at the level you'd find in one of your better games on the app store, but no better than that. So far they've lacked any actual difficulty and have attempted to compensate for this with excessive obfuscation. Given the numbers they gave I think I'm slightly over 1/4th of the puzzles in the game. Athough I know this changes later, so far I haven't found anything to interact with in the overworld aside from the puzzles and rather hamfisted audiologs featuring quotes from real life people that don't appear to serve any purpose aside from making the game look deep. Who knows, maybe the game gets fantastic later on, but so far I haven't found anything to compell me to keep playing, let alone to pay $40 for it. A mobile style puzzle game with distinctive graphics and ""look at how deep I am!"" quotes probably won't ever be worth $40 to me.			"

The default preset is a joke because Medium looks very, very ugly as compared to High. I would have loved to have the ability to tweak around and choose a middle ground between Medium and High. It's a damn shame cause I was eagerly waiting to play this game. Launcher screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/NdqEwOP.png "

												First up. £30.Let's just get that out of the way. Thirty whole British Pounds.The Witness is the new puzzle game from Jon Blow, the Braid man. Apparently it took 7 years to make. I have no idea why.My big issue with The Witness is the same issue I had with a similar game, Fez. Neither The Witness nor Fez have any need to be video games and basically trick you into *thinking* they're video games by using a nice, appealing video game facade to present boring puzzles that make zero effort to take advantage of the medium.Fez was boring AR puzzles. Each, when solved, would spell out a button combo to input on your controller, always a combination of L, R and A buttons. While you could run around and rotate these puzzle rooms, they might as well have just been pages on a website, so detached from the actual ""game"" they were.The Witness suffers from an identical problem, only instead of boring AR puzzles, it's boring Line Drawing puzzles. These puzzles, again, make no use of the video game medium and could just as well exist in the puzzle books you get free with the weekend's newspaper.One thing I will say, is that the Island itself, as inconsequential as it is, looks utterly fantastic. The problem is that there's no reason to explore it other than to find more boring line drawing puzzles.Note: For those wondering, I only played this for around an hour. In that time I completed around 60-70 line drawing puzzles (out of a reported 600). A bit of research then confirmed my fear that was what the entire game was. I refunded my purchase.Oh, and did I mention it's THIRTY ♥♥♥♥ING POUNDS?			"

												TL:DR The Witness is a game with a beautiful setting and decent puzzles but I felt it didnt quite live up to the level of hype it received on release. Still worth it if you enjoy puzzle gamesFull Version:The Witness places you on a beautiful but mysterious island, with this particular island being full of puzzles to solve. So sort of similar to Myst, but unlike Myst this games puzzles are all similar. Every puzzle gives you a grid and you have to draw a continuous line from one point to the other. Of course there is more to these puzzles than just that and theres a decent bit of variation to the basic formula. So for example one type requires you to draw the line in a way to seperate squares of different colors or another type requires you to trace a specific shape as part of the solution.The quality of the puzzles varies a lot as well. I loved the environmental ones that required use of light or sounds or change in persepective to solve but i hated the tetris shape ones. I think how much you'll enjoy the different variants of puzzles will come down to personal preference. I think the games reliance on one ""type"" of puzzle, that being drawing a line on a grid, hurts it in the long run and towards the end it felt like a chore. Even the different variations arent enough to stave off  the staleness that creeps in.My favourite thing about this game is the setting. The island looks gorgeous and is bright and colourful and a joy to explore. Unfortunately most of the game will be spent looking at the grids you solve the puzzles on however there are times when the setting is factored into the puzzles. Theres also secrets to uncover on the island but ultimately the game failed in compelling me to unearth these secrets. When I played Myst or the Talos Principle I was engaged enough to want to uncover the secrets and stories in those games. The Witness never gave me that urge. I did uncover some stuff but at no point did I feel like I wanted to know more.Overall The Witness is a good puzzle game although one I feel was massively over rated at release. Good points:- the island is a beautiful setting and well worth just walking around and taking in the scenery- I found the creativity in the puzzle variations was impressive particularly the environmental ones.Bad points:- the over reliance on the line drawing type of puzzle means even with all the variation it still starts to get stale after a while - A minor gripe, but some of the puzzles are arranged in sequence (so you have to do the first to unlock the second and so on), and on some of these failing the puzzle would reset that puzzle so you'd have to go back and redo the previous one to unlock the one you failed. This felt pointless and was quite annoying.			"

												One of the most innovative, challenging, and rewarding puzzle games I've ever played.This game does not hold your hand in the least. It can be frustrating sometimes, but the experience is ultimately rewarding, as it gives you chance to decide where to go and what to do, and lets you toy with puzzles as much as you like without interupting you with tutorials. If one puzzle type stumps you, move to a new area. You have to beat a certain number of areas to win the game, but you don't have to beat all of them, so you can pick and choose which areas are worth finishing to some extent (I really wish I knew this before getting to the end of the game). Each puzzle type is a new twist on the same puzzle format, so everything feels fresh yet related. This makes it easy to combine puzzle types, which makes the late game very interesting. The whole game feels liek a huge connected island with small sections that are completely their own thing yet part of the bigger picture. It works wonderfully.I don't want to spoil anything to specific. I just want to say that the puzzles are extremely creative and I I found myself gitty to try and solve each problem I found. The more you play, the more you begin to understand the game, and the more fun you having solving it. It's an elegantly designed experience that is a must-try for any puzzle fans.			"

												I was initially reticent to purchase the game but was convinced of its quality almost instantly once I ran it. First of all, it's pretty. The art style is unique and striking, and I very much love to look at it. Second, the puzzles are rewarding. I've hit a spot of bother at the moment after encountering a new set of puzzles, but I'm certain that I will figure them out. The developers have struck a lovely balance between making the puzzles very difficult at times but never frustrating, and that seems like a particularly delicate challenge for this type of game. I never expected to be as impressed with it as I am. It's very well done.			"

The Witness is basically a Metroidvania, except all the gear upgrades happen inside your own brain.An absolute masterpiece of puzzle game design. Enormous and varied, carefully crafted to the tiniest detail, gorgeous and, most importantly, astonishingly clever and extremely satisfying to unpack and understand. An intricate machine where everything fits just right and everything has a purpose. A brilliant, brilliant game.(And yes, it's also more than a little snobbish, but you know what, if there's one game that has earned the right to be snobbish, this is it.)			"

												It's not a perfect game, far from it. Just know what to expect: if you like unconnected puzzles and good-looking artistry, this is a good game. But if you like a clear storyline and well-explained reasons for doing stuff, or if you hate doing maze after maze, do not come even close this game.			"

												Pretty good game if you like solving puzzles. All puzzles and interactions with anything are done using just the one mechanic of connecting a circle to an end point by tracing a line, they took this single mechanic and really built the entire game around it and it's pretty impressive the amount of variations they got out of it and IMO they did an excellent job, the down side is that if you don't like the mechanic then you will not like this game as that is literally all the game has. The ""story"" is minimal at best, just some vague hints as to one through a handful of audio logs hidden around the place, and   apart from the ones in a hidden area at the end of the game most are just semi-random quotes from various interlectuals from the past. There's really very little drive urging you to progress other than your own desire to complete puzzles.There is also a fair bit of time wasting in this game, and I don't mean grind, I mean literally just waiting and doing nothing. Some of the optional puzzles can take 10+ minutes of patience to complete because although you know how to solve it you have to wait on something you can't control to line up right and you can't do anything else while waiting (except something like leaving the PC to make and eat a meal, which I did, and it had only progressed a quarter of the way through when I got back).I would recommend The Talos Principal, which is a VERY similar kind of game, over The Witness, The Witness has some good puzzles and the mechanic is very polished, but that's all there is to it, on the other had while the mechanics in The Talos Principal aren't as polished they are a lot more interesting and varied and with much less rigid solutions, The Talos Principal also has some good story elements keeping you interested throughout the game (especially in the Road to Gehenna DLC which was AMAZING).On the whole though I quite enjoyed The Witness if you have already played The Talos Principal and Road to Gehenna then this is definitely worth checking out.

												The Witness puts you on an island, alone, and presents a beautiful world to explore, and hundreds of puzzles to solve within it. I had a blast discovering the serine island, and gradually learning and solving the many different types of puzzles. The Witness has many unique ways it uses the environment to help the players solve its puzzles, and many of its puzzles are actually in the environment itself. I was stumped over and over whenever I entered a new area and couldn't solve the puzzles, but was overjoyed again and again when I discovered how to solve them. The Witness is not only about puzzles, however. As you discover the island, the developers lead you on a journey of contemplating differing ""religions"" or philosophies in a way that allows you to see those philosophies, and even your own, with a fresh pair of eyes. This game was an incredible experience. However, it still has its problems. The solution methods for some of the puzzle types are too vague, causing uneeded frustration; especially for those who feel they have failed if they look up a guide. Also, Jonathon Blow doesn't seem to understand the concept that you shouldn't keep your player waiting for too long, as some areas require long journeys to reach everytime you want to visit, and there are several solutions to puzzles that require long backtracking journeys, or even hour long waits (the puzzle mentioned here is uneccessary to beat the game, just needed to 100% it). I think to sum up my complaint I would say: I spent 35 hours on this game and could have spent a lot longer if I used no help whatsoever, and it just doesn't need to be that long. However, if you are more patient than I am, you will enjoy the experience start to finish.In summary, The Witness is a brilliantly designed and unique puzzle game that I would definetely recommend to any puzzle game fan.

												A tremendous amount of work was put into this game.  Technically and creatively, it succeeds.  There is a nice variety of spatial, environmental and audio/visual puzzles.Unfortunately, I feel that some of the puzzles elements were introduced too quickly.  Many of the puzzles are incredibly difficult.  Compare to Portal, which I felt was completely ""fair"" in that all its solutions were logical in hindsight.  In The Witness, solutions can involve items that are easy to overlook.  The player is often put into a situation where it is unclear if the puzzle is just broken, if the solution involves puzzle elements that were missed, or if they just aren't smart enough to figure it out.I think the game wasn't playtested with a general audience.  The frustration level would have been clear to the designer.  It looks to be created for an audience of very skilled, patient puzzle solvers, who are very good at visualizing spatial problems.  It looks like I am not a member of this audience, because I was frustrated early and often.I am still giving this a thumbs up, with the caveat that I think the game is unsolvable without help for 99.9% of players.  I admire the vision of the designer to create a game that really pushes the boundary of the genre, even though I ultimately found the difficulty to limit the fun I had with the game.			"

												I'm pretty conflicted over this game. The ""panel"" puzzles which make up the bulk of the game's main story are geniuniely tedious, which each new type of puzzle introducing a leap in thinking which can be quite exciting, and then usually following that up with a good hour of frustrating head-scratchers that require lots of experimentation and note-taking.Then there's the secret part of the game, which involves exploring every nook and cranny of the beautiful island on which the game is set, searching for hidden shapes in the environment - this part is consistently fun throughout.Overall, I'm glad I bought the game, but it does have significant flaws. If you're someone who loves doing abstract puzzles just for the sake of it, you might well have fun all the way through. Otherwise, just be prepared to put up with some boredom and frustration along the way, and try to take your mind off it by admiring the pretty scenery and searching for secrets.			"

												I just finished ""The Witness"" this afternoon in 20 hours in total. The ending might not have been the perfect ending, because I haven't solved all of the puzzles yet (390 so far) and there are still some more areas to explore. The ending I got wasn't very satisfying and I read some reviews that said the same thing. However, I don't actually expect a more engaging ending after solving the other areas. But I will try to finish them. So far I solved every puzzle without help of a walkthrough, and I like to see how far I can get. I don't really care for a better ending. I guess one could compare this game to a paper edition of logical puzzles. When you buy one of those, you know there will be a first page and a last page. And then that's the end of it. It's not about the ending, it's about the puzzles in there and the satisfaction of solving them. Some puzzles in ""The Witness"" are very hard and require creative thinking. There is more to most of the puzzles than just the panels themselves. But I don't want to spoil anything, so you will have to find out for yourself. One helpful hint though to prevent thinking you can't proceed: if you do get stuck on larger panels with a new kind of puzzle you can't solve, there is probably a learning set of the same kind of puzzle somewhere else on the island. The island itself looks beautiful and the puzzles are nicely integrated in the environment, though the power wires lying around everywhere might just break through the illusion of paradise a bit ;). And somehow I think they are meant to.I can really recommend this game if you like logic puzzles. And, I must admit, there is enough to see and think about besides the puzzles. The island itself is also one big puzzle. But not one I expect to solve. And I actually don't even think we are really supposed to. As long as you are okay with that, you will have a great time with this title.			"

												There's a Buddihist's reason to try this game out. Ofc, there are many other valid reasons you'd want to play this beautifully deep game. In my Buddhist's ""perspective"", this game felt like a great training session that reveals a path for higher awareness (sati, or more popular term being mindfulness) and the iteration of my perspective. I felt this game is highly revealing of many Buddhist teachings and therefore, thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. This game may feel like a Via Dolorosa at many points of your gameplay, but sitting through enough, you will be in. Welcome.			"

The Witness is another great puzzle game from the mind of Jonathan BlowIf you want to be ""rewarded"" from completing puzzles turn back. A routine complaint I've seen of this game is that there is no reward for completing the puzzles, and in a sense that is correct. If you enjoy puzzles for there own sake this is a game for you. The puzzles, in essence, are incredibly simple. There is a starting and ending point on a panel. You must drag a line to the ending point. Puzzle complete. This, however, is quickly complicated with new caviots and rulesets which are never explicitly explained. This game is an excercise in teaching the player new concepts without telling them. It lets the player feel out the rulesets themselves and, in truth, this is what most of the gameplay is. It isn't shy about letting the player misunderstand a ruleset and this will sometimes happen, but it always gives a way to learn what is wrong about your current mindset. The puzzles exist, often in sets, on an island with various areas. Each area has its own rules and theme. The world will often blend itself into the puzzles whether directly being a part of it or through somthing like the asthetic. The world is very well designed. This is a very beautiful game. The game has a painting-esque look to it and often uses diverse colors to striking effect. The environments and purpose of having these puzzles abstractly placed on pads may seem pointless at first but the island and panels serve a purpose.The game wouldn't be the same if you simply flipped through a book of each puzzle. The game, in fact, would not be able to exist as it is now.I don't want to spoil some of the fun of the puzzles in The Witness so I'll close by saying this. The puzzles in the witness can seem a bit trial and error like at times, but I don't believe this is the case. The Witness is simply a puzzle game that is trying to say some things about the way we learn. It is a must play game for fans of puzzles or great world design.			"

												The Witness is a good looking game with some very clever puzzles. I strongly recommend it for those who really like puzzles and who appreciate not being catered for like a small child. It means you are left on your own on the lone island, and nobody is going to explain you anything. What the game brings you in abundance is a sense of discovery of the places and of the rules governing the world. I had only one problem, the monastery section, I completely abandoned the small tree inside and didn't think it was important and necessary for opening the windows, because you can solve the first of the three walls by looking at the rocks arrangement closest to it. But probably I'd rather blame myself there.I'd also point out the narrative. It is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I listened to it at first but then just didn't bother, it is plain pretentious words soup. Of the videos, I have only seen the first and the last ones. And the last video, I don't know who that woman is, but I hope she had been taken care of. Sounded like some kind of religious indoctrination.In any case, this is a great puzzle game, and I totally recommend it as that.			"

												You awake alone on an beautiful island full of puzzles. The puzzles share a central theme where you must draw a line starting from a ball, through a grid, and to the end point. It starts very simple and gets complex. There is, however, a greater truth to be found about your origin, the island, and universe itself.There is no meaningful dialogue and no tutorials in the game so you must figure out this truth on your own.If you enjoy laid back puzzle games, buy this now.

												I think this is the third review I have ever written, so it must be something big!!! And friends, let me tell you, it sure is.The Witness is a much needed game. Not only for the intention of making people think again, but also for the way it does so. Many, in fact almost all, new games cater to the young and those with extremely limited attention spans. These games are supposed to be fast-paced and easy to learn and etc.The Witness, on the other hand, will challenge you. Challenge you completely, and there will not be any sugarcoating. There is no extensive tutorial that will show you how to solve the puzzles. You will have to use sight and sound and brains to figure that out by yourself. It will challenge your preconceived notions of how things work and teach you the concept of ""confirmation bias"" - which basically is a way of saying that people more often selectively believe in things that fit their pre-existing beliefs, and that people tend to seek out similar information in the future.If you want to play this game just prepare to get annoyed at your own lack of neuroplasticity. Expect that you will have to rewire your brain to allow it to stop believing that the knowledge you already possess is the one truth and the only truth.This game can teach you how you should view life in general. It is about perspective. It is about to be able to accept certain truths that at a first glance will seem false, or incorrect.This game is philosophy!			"

												First off, I'm too stupid for this game. I think I knew this going into it, but pushed it to the back of my head because I heard great things about this game. I don't know where I'm at completion-wise at this point; I have 3 lazers fixated on the mountain thing. I don't get too much payoff when I finally do finish a puzzle and that's more a problem with me than the game and I will openly admit right now that I've had to look up guides for the the tetris puzzles. That♥♥♥♥♥♥went straight over my head without even stopping to say hello.It's a beautifully done game aesthetically. The visuals and the sound design are brilliant. I did enjoy walking around the island and seeing the different biomes on it. I dont know if this is really a spoiler, but there's a boat you will find to help you get around and it does come in handy when you want to completly transverse the island.There isn't much I have to say bad about this game except that for some reason it just didn't resonate with me in the end. Somewhere, something went wrong and I don't know if I'm going to go back and finish it. I wish I could have a mixed review for this, but I will go ahead and recommend it because I think you need to experience it for yourself before you can make a sure judgment on it.			"
