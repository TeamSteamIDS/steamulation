												Now that I'm a working adult, I rarely have the energy or time to play games. Even the most engaging epics (Xenoblade Chronicles, Skyrim, etc) can only hold my attention for a few hours, MAX, before I need to do something else. Maybe it's because they don't feel as rewarding any more, or the stories just aren't as engaging as they used to be, but I know that I peeled off the ""hardcore"" label from my gamer card long ago.I tell you this anecdote because I just spent nearly 10 straight hours playing Volgarr, and didn't even realize it.This game is a pungent distillation of everything that I loved and hated about video games in the 80's and 90's. Back then, memory was at a premium, so in order to make a game feel like it was worth the $50 price tag, developers make them hard as nails in order to extend the play time you would need to devote in order to complete the game. This meant hours upon hours of committing each level, every enemy and all the boss patterns to muscle memory, and knowing how to react in each situation. It was an arduous process, but when you finally mastered a level and beat the boss, you felt like you had accomplished something. I realized, upon completing Volgarr, that this is what I had been missing from most modern games, where victory is all but ensured.Volgarr is hard. Words like brutal and unforgiving don't really do it justice. Its smartly hard. I had quite a bit of trouble with the game, and actually gave it up for almost a year after I got stuck on stage 2. When I finally picked it back up this weekend, I approached it as a puzzle game; each encounter, every enemy's placement and movement, was done with care - all I had to do was find the pattern and ""solve"" the puzzle with Volgarr's moveset. This made every advancement feel like a real victory, and this game is one of the first in a long time to elicit actual cheers of joy when I completed a stage for the first time.Volgarr never felt cheap, exploitative, or unfair. I died hundreds of times, repeating stages over and over, but it never made me angry or frustrated, only determined. Determined because every playthrough got me a little bit further: into the next room, understanding a new monster's attack pattern, or solving a new section of platforming. Every death had an ""aha!"" moment attached to it. If I died at a section I had played through before, it was 100% my fault. Overall randomness is low, so it is extremely rare that a strategy you succeeded with once will fail the next time.I could wax poetic telling you about how good the controls feel, or the quality of graphics and music, but there are lots of other reviews for that. I simply wish to convey how satisfying this game is to play, and how accomplished I felt (and hopefully, you will too) when I beat each and every stage. I experienced a range of emotions, from trepidation, anger, fear and elation, something that few modern games can achieve, even with their grandiose storytelling and advanced visual presentation.I'm not going to assign a number value to my review, because I think that trying to quantify any gaming experience is fairly pointless. Games aren't commodities with certain valuable characteristics, like a vacuum cleaner or toaster oven. Ultimately, what each person gets out of a game really depends on what they expect, what they like from an interactive experience, and how the game meets those needs. Games, in this regard, are like art, and you can't rate art, you can only relate how it makes you feel.Volgarr challenged me, it made me feel young again, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment.I dig it.

												This game reminds me of Ghosts n Goblins. It is very challenging. It isn't a bad game by any means. In fact, it is very well designed action platformer;  it is just very challenging. I only recommend this game, if you want a very challenging but good game. If you are looking for a game you can breeze through, stay far, far away from this game.To give you an idea of how hard this game is,  I can't believe I've been playing this game for over an hour, and I still haven't beaten the first level. I have never played a game, aside from the original Ghosts n Goblins, where I haven't beaten the first level within an hour. And I bet you it will take several more hours before I finally get good enough to beat the first level.This game is very challenging for the following reasons. First of all, it only takes two hits to get killed in this game. You can increase your hit points to three hits with an armor upgrade (so you can get hit no more than two times), but that's about it. By default, you better not get more than once, or you are dead. The levels are long, and full of hazards and enemies that can kill you. The checkpoints are few and far between, so you have to last for a very long time without getting hit. Lastly, many of the enemies and hazard are VERY cheap, and there is no way you can avoid them  on your first encounter. Sometimes enemies and hazard can appear out of no where and kill you before you can even react. This can be especially frustrating when you made considerable progress, and then you are sent back to a checkpoint, losing five or more minutes of progress in the process. The only way you can avoid these hazards is to first get killed , know in advance that the hazard is coming, and then avoid it. Also, you have to beat an entire world/level before you can save, and the worlds in this game are very large. If only you can save your progress and start from each sub-section of each world. That would be nice. But no, this game requires you to beat a very long and difficult level in just one-sitting, so you better have good endurance. Basically, the only way you can make ANY progress in this game is to play the levels over and over again until you can reach the end in one sitting.  You need perfect precision to avoid getting hit in this game. In other words, you need VERY GOOD hand-eye coordination, and LOTS of trial and error before you can beat this game. You need to memorize the entire level, where each hazard and enemy is, and play almost perfectly (get hit no more than once) to reach each few-and-far-between checkpoint and beat each level. Luckily, this game gives you unlimited continues. You can continue from the same checkpoint as many times as you want. Thank god that's the case, because you will die many times until you reach the next few and far between checkpoint. If you had limited continues, this game would go from very challenging to downright frustrating and near impossible. Control-wise, this game is very responsive and accurate. The only downside is that, like in Ghosts n Goblins, your character cannot change his direction in mid jump, so you need to be very precise in the timing and positioning of your jumping; otherwise, you will get hit and DIE.Overall, this is a well-designed, albeit very challenging, action platformer. It remains me alot of Ghosts n Goblins, because of its stiff jumping mechanics, challenging level design, two-hit deaths, and medieval/fantasy setting in the format of an action platformer.			"

												I've finally beaten it. And what a game it's been. A testament to classic, hardcore, do-or-die Arcade platformers, Volgarr the Viking never disappointed me. Each level was cooler than the one before and I've only even played the ""normal"" levels. That's right, the game has ""hardcore"" levels which you unlock by basically playing the game flawlessly. It's hard and the ""checkpoints"" aren't generous, if at all present. Each level is divided in 2 parts, with a boss at the end of the second. If you stop playing, you can skip levels, but you'll always start at the first part. I had to replay each level from the start a few times and didn't really have a problem with it. It's that good.I've read a few negative comments on its brutal ""save""-system which isn't really present at all. But don't let that hinder you. It's fantastic, stylish and I love it. It's metal. If there ever was a present-day word to describe this game, then it's metal. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ metal. Vikings are cool characters to begin with, but this guy... Just, ♥♥♥♥.			"

												This game is so good that I wrote a poem about it in the style of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf, in a bid to entice one of my friends to give it a chance.Men of courage! Listen to my challenge!My name is known in the northern lands and beyond, And my deeds are famed far and wide.Volgarr I am, the most valiant of shield-bearers,The adventurer and slayer of ancient gods.Let this hall's strong pillars and hearty ale protect usFrom the rain's cold water, and the howling wind,As I stand proud and alone to tell my story. Sea monsters I have slain, and giant serpents;Winged beasts; howling barrow-men; bloodthirsty lizards.My mighty muscles and quick mind protected me,As they shall serve any of you who now support my cause.Have courage, and use all your cunning,and overcome the fear which first strikes all of us.Those who doubt my deeds will feel my dagger -Yet, those following my guide will know great glory.It's also one of very few games to score higher than 10 on my personal rating scale, which is based on how many days it distracted me from Street Fighter 4. It's a good game!			"

												Overview: Retro Style 2D action PlatformerThe Good:+ The developers intentions were to create a retro 2D action game and in many regards succeeded wonderfully. This game is easy to learn but hard to master.  + Great controls+ The game is hard only because it requires memorization of the level and enemy patterns to succeed at the game.  With only 6 levels each only taking around 10 minutes to complete...IF you know what you're doing. If you are playing for your first time then expect each level to take roughly over an hour to complete.  + Only one checkpoint per level. (This is an old school 2d action game after all!) + The game has a normal path and a hard path to complete. You can only unlock the hard path by successfully collecting treasure chests throughout the level without getting hit. +Three different endings depending on which path you took. + Great sound and musicThe Bad:- Warning! may cause stress, frustration, and other bad feelings. ConclusionA game like this is difficult to review in modern times because the developers intention was to create a game a few decades earlier.  This game borrows heavily from Ghosts n' Goblins.  It was ""refreshing"" to play an old school game, it makes you realize just how much easier games have come.  "

												Volgarr the Viking by Crazy Viking StudiosSimply put, Volgarr is just old-school classic fun!INTRODUCTION:Volgarr is a classic (but brand-new) side-scrolling platforming/adventure game flirting with the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis and the likes.The game's look and feel is spot-on, with Castlevania-esque jumping (no turning back midair) and Super Mario's (I know it's not the real influence but whatever) health by upgrades.The single most important thing about Volgarr the Viking is DIFFICULTY, it's hard...seriously!Sidenote: If you want a video review I recommend ProJared's review which can be viewed here: 


YouTube™ Video: Volgarr The Viking Review 

			Views: 469,306		

			Volgarr the Viking Review - http://store.steampowered.com/app/247240/ UPDATE - The camera zoom has just been patched to allow a toggle option.		

   (Note that ProJared's complaint about the Zoomed-Out View has been fixed as it now can be set to Toggle in the Options menu)STORY: You are a badass, crazy Viking called Völgarr and you are summoned by Odin to take out a bad guy called Fafnir who is obtaining power (of course!) The game's plot is pretty simple and that's basically all you will absorb and without giving you any spoilers!CONTROLS:You can:- Jump. Amazing, right?- Attack with your sword, jumping, crouching or not.- Throw spears, both standing upright and while jumping. When you get the iron shield (Thor's Shield), you can hold the spear and let loose SUPERCHARGED spears which usually skewers all enemies it passes through instead of just killing the first thing it hits.- Dodge roll, which lets you pass through most enemies to get a better angle for attack, or for just simply getting through small enterances.Important to note (and this is one of the games best mechanics) is that thrown spears will get stuck in walls it hit, making it a platform to jump up to. This gives you tons of possibilites and great potential to work around certain difficult places by using the room to your advantage.When in the air you can also press down to make Völgarr point his sword downwards, making the impact you make, rather messy (if you catch my drift)You can also double-jump which makes you pull out your sword and perform a somersault which is a good way to challenge enemies midair or secure landing on a platform. Of course it also helps your platforming as you can change direction in your otherwise fixed jump arcs.Note that there are many ways to use these techniques in conjunction or in different ways to make for some very interesting solutions! (Example: Try jumping, point your sword down and successfully touch an enemy and immediately use your second jump!)GAMEPLAY:You start with a simple sword and later you can find chests with upgrades like a wooden shield, an iron shield, a helmet and lastly a great sword of fire!When you are hit you lose the last gear you obtained and you have to find another chest to restore it, if you get down to only a sword left and get hit, you die.Speaking of dying, you have in the regular levels only 2 respawn points per world and it's in the beginning of the level and one half-way through (I just call it stage/phase/part 2), so if you die you have to often play through larger parts of the level. It sort of becomes a longer, adventurous version of Super Meat Boy, you get a level with fixed enemy positions (most of the time) and you get to learn by trying. When you finally beat the level you will most likely have remembered every single enemy position and how you best handle them.If you manage to play the levels without getting hit you will start finding treasure instead of gear as you hit your upgrade cap. The gold acts as a hi-score along with your completion time but what matters more is if you find Warrior's Spirits which lets you play the special levels if you complete the level without dying (you lose one spirit per death).The game have regular levels and special levels, the difference between them is that you have unlimited retries for regular levels but in the special levels you have as much extra lives as you have found Warrior's Spirits the levels before.If you manage to complete the special words and find all the Runes you get the best ending, if you just complete the special worlds without runes you get the second best ending and if you don't beat the game through the special levels you get the ""worst"" ending. So it's really challenging to get the best ending but just completing the game for the worst ending will be a challenge enough for your first playthrough and will feel rewarding enough (believe me on this one!). Later you can try and go for death-less runs, damage-less runs, speedruns or try and collect achievements and get all endings.FINAL WORDS: Volgarr the Viking is an absolutely stunning game which will test your limits. Whether or not you have never bought a game in the ""retro"" section or you are tired of ""another Pixel Art Indie game"". I definetly think you should look past that and give this game a try.One of the few gripes is that the game can be rather short if you turn out to be a fast learner, Whatever you decide to do you will get a lot of hours of fun, charming and passionately crafted gaming in world that wants nothing more than to break you!I strongly recommend this game if you want some classic fun, a good challenge or to just make blood and bones fly all over the screen.

												I had a good childhood.  My parents were pretty lenient, I was allowed pretty free reign on what I did growing up.  It was pretty sweet.   The reason I decided to bore you with this little anecdote mind you...is because one of the few times I remember getting banned from my Super Nintendo for a week was due to Super Ghouls and Ghosts.   That game was hard as hell and instigated fits of anger on a regular basis.  Controllers were broken, swears were shouted loudly, and about the time the controller bounced off the screen of the TV as I screamed ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"", it was all over. Despite all that?  I still loved it. Enter Volgarr the Viking.  That little love song to Ghouls & Ghosts was written, because Volgarr is a love song written to Ghouls & Ghosts.  The game feels straight out of the Super Nintendo long box.  The challenges are unrelenting and difficult from the very beginning.  Yet, there's a lot of nostalgia and enjoyment packed in here that leads you to keep hitting retry and going back over the same deaths time and time again.  Veterans of Volgarr the Viking will say that the game is easy and comes down to memorization.  Sure, it does come down to memorization.  That memorization comes from a drive to perfect the game and push through to the end that leads to you eventually become a master of the game.  Just like its predecessor, Super Ghouls and Ghosts.  (Important note:  No, I haven't mastered yet.  By god, I will though, just to spite this game!)And yes, the loud swearing still happens with Volgarr.  Not the controller breaking though.   I mean, I'm an old man now; I'm above throwing and breaking controllers.  Not from any kind of evolved self-control mind you, simply because I know what it costs to replace those things!  That and the dirty looks I get from my wife when I start teaching our kid colorful ways to insult my PC.			"

												Similar Games:Ghosts & Goblins, Golden Axe, and to a lesser degree Castlevania gamesThe Good:Brutally unforgiving difficulty!A nostalgic romp through a very 80s arcade action gameWhile the game is very, very, very, very difficult, it also is quite fair.  Most deaths are caused by the player being to eager to progress without any planning or forethoughtControls are basic and conciseThe graphics and gameplay are a fun throwback to those games you grew up playing! (note: if you are 30+ years old) An intense satisfaction can be had when beating a level, which does not come easily (Have I mentioned the game is hard?)Checkpoints help make progression easier, as they are setup at the starting and midpoint of every level.  When you perish you return to the last checkpoint (though these can be quite a ways back)The Bad:Brutally unforgiving difficulty!I had originally posted here about a lack of save feature, but was made aware by the developer (almost immediately) that you can return to the start of an unlocked level by walking to the left from the startCan you play it while the children are awake?:I did, but mostly because the gory violence is heavily pixelated.Did I make time to complete it?:I have yet to beat it, but have spent a good 9 hours trying to.  I plan on completing the game.Recommended Purchase Price:$11.99or100% of full retail value of $11.99Reviewer:MisterS42http://www.gamersglance.com "

												Volgarr is a pretty cool action platformer with a slower, more methodical pace than most. You can't change direction mid jump (except by double jumping), your melee attack is very short range, and your projectile locks you in place for a second unless you do it in mid-air, so you really have to commit to your attacks in this game.It's pretty much a thinking man's action game. It rewards precise timing and execution, but it's very difficult to get out of bad situations unscathed once you get put in them. The emphasis here is more on carefully figuring out how to safely go about things and avoid getting trapped, and the game is excellently designed in this regard: there's tons of different ways to get past obstacles, the level design is really clever with a lot of attention to detail, and the game generally feels pretty fair even when it's hard (though some of the bosses do jump off the deep end into pure trial and error).So if you want a thinking man's hack and slash platformer that doesn't leave you feeling ""oh, I should have reacted to that faster"" when you die, but rather ""oh, I should have thought that through better"", than consider Volgarr since it does a fantastic job of accomplishing that.

												This is probably the nicest review I will ever write for a game I hate. That's because regardless of how I feel about it, Volgarr exists to do one thing, and that is imitate the old hard-as-balls 16-bit platformers of yore. And it does it really, really, really well.You play Volgarr the Viking, unsurprisingly, risen from his grave by some totally metal deity to kill a whole bunch of everything. He controls like a slightly less-sticky Castlevania protagonist, with no air control unless you double-jump, certain attacks locking him in place, and being launched backwards (usually into pits) every time he gets hit. He does have a bevy of moves like a downward strike, a roll, and some very useful spears to throw that can also form platforms. It feels just like playing a classic SNES side-scroller, and that extends to the graphics and sounds as well. Pixel blood and bones fly as you hack and slash through the game's many varied levels.IF you can get to them. The make-or-break issue with Volgarr is how much patience you have for punishingly hard platforming. The game uses a very Ghosts 'n' Goblins system where you find bits of armor to bolt on to yourself that then get knocked off a couple pieces at a time by enemies. Your shield is one of those pieces, and if you lose it, certain traps are going to be all but impassable. This is to say nothing of the many bottomless pits and trap enemies waiting just off screen to knock you into them. All of this would be fine, except that the levels are made up of two quite lengthy sections with only a single checkpoint between them. This means any mistakes you make are punished with redoing the last couple minutes of exacting platforming again. And with no checkpoint before bosses, just learning their patterns or performing less than perfectly can force you to replay 5+ minutes of level you've already had to suffer through.This to me is just straight-up bad design, evidenced by how few games make use of similarly punishing systems now. It is forgiven only because it was the standard for NES classics such as Castlevania and Mega Man, except that even those games had multiple checkpoints per level. It becomes a question of how much of your time a game is allowed to waste when you make a mistake, because doing the same level opening ten times because you can't quite get a boss's pattern down immediately is very much a waste of time. Modern games like Dark Souls have found elegant solutions to this problem, such as allowing you to accumulate resources across attempts. Volgarr makes no provision for that, forcing the same actions over and over until it (hopefully) becomes muscle memory.I really did hate Volgarr when I started playing it, but after a little more time with it I came to at least appreciate what it represents. When I was a kid, I had the patience to beat my head against Ninja Gaiden II for weeks and weeks until I could finally finish it. I don't have the time or the inclination for that kind of dedicated memorization anymore, but I can see where there might still be space for it. Volgarr is very much not for everyone and smacks of the kind of game that gets recommended by everyone and played by no one, but if you really, truly are looking for that brick wall NES difficulty curve, look no further.

												This game is great. Very challenging but rewarding, precise controls, and varied enemies. It isn't very forgiving because you're supposed to complete it in one sitting, but it is a lot of fun if you put in the effort. There are plenty of secrets hidden in the levels, and you'll learn new things about the game every time you play it. Definitely a very good game, but it might take you a while to realize it.

												Add Volgarr The Viking to the list of hardcore platformers. Even though a level can be completed in roughly 10 minutes it should take you at least 10x longer. Volgarr is a pretty looking retro game with plenty of detail and all kinds of weird looking enemies.So, you basically have one life and you start off with nothing but a sword and shield, but once you find a treasure chest you'll be able to (automatically) upgrade your shield to a stronger one. FInd another one and you'll get a helmet. Another one and you get a flaming sword. However, get hit and you lose a piece of equipment.There is one checkpoint in the entire level and it's usually about halfway in. Also, all of the levels end with a bossfight so if you die during the battle you have to start over from the checkpoint.It's challenging but fair. Like a 2D Dark Souls. So if that sounds good to you go and give Volgarr a try.[Rating: 85/100]			"

												Some people complain about the fixed jumping.  Don't listen to them.  The implementation of the ""Double Jump"" makes the mechanic very flexible and versatile.  You can initiate a double jump at any point in the arc, and in any direction, giving the player ample control.  It all feels very natural and intuitive.Although some weak enemies respawn at a few set locations in each level, the majority of the enemies are completely predictable, appearing in the same locations and behaving the same way every time.  This makes the game feel more like a puzzle-platformer to me.  ""Solving"" levels requires figuring out what sequence of jumps, spears, and sword attacks to use, and remembering the enemy placement and patterns.  Some reflexes and good timing are required, but learning the levels is the most important thing.  If you get stuck, keep persevering and experimenting with different approaches.  Eventually you'll discover a viable strategy!  I recommend NOT watching a walkthrough or guide before solving the levels for yourself, since that's where most of the satisfaction comes from.  After you've beaten a level, then you can watch other people's solutions to help streamline your play.			"

												You start playing this game and it's seemingly the hardest 2d action platformer you've ever played.You keep dying and dying and dying...You grit your teeth and keep playing, because despite how hard it is, it's actually fun.You do a little better every time.But after 2 hours, you're still stuck at the first level and you haven't even seen the first boss yet.You start thinking silly things like ""I'll never beat this game... it's too ♥♥♥♥ing hard""Then, a sudden realization: it's not the game that is hard... it's YOU.YOU... are not good enough. YOU... SUCK... AT THIS GAME.You start the game one more time and you hear the now familiar voice of Odin: ""RISE, WARRIOR""Like in a trance, you blaze through the first level and get to the boss almost unscathed. The boss is tough, and is big and scary and ominous... but nothing will stand in your way now. You quickly understand how to beat him, and he falls under your blade.Yes, you understand now.The secret.You must not control Volgarr.You must BECOME Volgarr.You are Volgarr, the Viking.			"

												Unforgiving, but completely fair - when you've died, it's your fault, and you missed a pattern or were off with your timing, but when you succeed, it's also your doing and feels extremely rewarding. Volgarr is an excellent example of a throwback to the Ghosts N' Goblins age without resorting to cheap deaths for artificial difficulty. Each level's design and enemy placement is very purposefully done; you'll have to study your surroundings carefully and react quickly. Gorgeous sprites and nice audio compliment the gameplay without feeling like its retro style is forced.If you enjoy fast, precise action-platformers where the only real ""upgrades"" you get are your own skills with controlling Volgarr and learning his enemies' attacks and environments' tricks, this game won't disappoint.Get ready to step into a vibrant new world, get beaten to a pulp, and work your way back to where you fell, each time faster and smarter than you were before... until you're finally ready to emerge victorious.

												I enjoy difficult platformers, but having such sparse checkpoints makes the game almost unplayable to me. I don't want to go through the entire level again because I died in two seconds to the boss at the end. Like, I've memorized the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level, it's not fun anymore.You can make games with a heavy retro feel while still incorporating modern advancements in game design. There's still a lot to love about this game, but I found it to be ""old school"" in both the fun ways and the stupid ways			"

												This game made me feel like a BADASS! ... After fifty or so attempts to beat the first level that is.The game is unforgiving, extremely hard and a down right pain in the ***  when you're redoing the same level for the hundredth time. However! It's as, if not more, rewarding as it is hard. Punching your sword through a giant skeletal monster has never felt more satisfying and savage in any other game.If you like a bit of challenge and want to be the ultimate badass try this. It won't disappoint!			"

												Do you remember those games you used to play 20 years ago, that were ridiculously hard and you couldn't get pass the 2nd stage ? Well, Volgarr the Viking is their grandson. [TL;DR at the bottom as usual]1) INTRODUCTIONThis is a game that, for those who were born in the 80's like me, rings many bells (Ghosts 'n Goblins, anyone?). Volgarr is an old style 2D arcade platform that shares many aspects with games like the one I just mentioned, first of all: the difficulty. You WILL die in this game, so many times that you will reach new levels of frustration that you didn't even know they existed (unless you already experimented them by playing videogames during the 80's and early 90's ... I did). However, even as I died every 10 steps, I couldn't stop playing. The game purpose is to make you learn by your mistakes; did you try to kill that enemy by throing a spear at him but he killed you ? That must be the wrong approach then, keep that in mind and try again. Learning each level by heart is the key to achieve victory: one step too much, one hit of your sword that is not timed correctly, a double-jump too high and you're one step closer to your doom. Oh, I almost forgot, did you see that hole in the wall that shoots arrows ? No? Ow, sorry you're dead. 2)TECHINICAL ASPECTS***GAMEPLAY 9/102D sidescroll platform, there isn't much you can do. 4 movements : Left, Right, Jump, Crouch and 4 actions: roll, sword hit, throw javelin, die. Ok, that was a joke... you can even block with your shield by standing still, so I guess there are 5 actions you can perform. Also, your javelins can be thrown at walls to create platforms (usually secrets are hidden high up in the levels). There is also a zoom key that will allow you to see further than usual and you can toggle it, it is useful for obvious reasons and you basically play with that always on, I don't see why you shouldn't. Good thing about the game is that you can play with a keyboard or a joypad, and you can bind any key as you see fit. Speaking of actions and buttons, I wish there was another action you could perform, which I believe it's kinda coomon in games like this one. I'm referring to the action that allows you to jump down a platform by passing through it. Usually you can do that by pressing down+jump, but hitting those keys will make you roll instead. I guess this is a choice made by the devs rather than a flaw in the game, I admit that kind of action would have made my life easier in some occasions.As I said before, you are challenged by the difficulty of the game, if you die you start from the beginning, no savegames, and no checkpoints until you reach the end of the level and kill the boss. Then you can start the game from the latest level reached (but with basic equipment). Yes, you have some equipment and it represents your total hit points. You start with a sword, a wooden shield and unlimited javelins. You get hit once, you lose your shield (you can block attack with the shield but only 2 or 3, then it breaks); you get hit twice, you die. If you manage to find equipment, without getting hit, you gain more equipment and hitpoints: a better shield that can withstand unlimited hits, a helmet that will boost your attack speed and a flaming sword that does double damage. There is also a special item hidden in every level: Thor's Mjolnir. This is basically an♥♥♥♥♥saver in case you get hit; the power granted by the hammer will wipe almost everything on screen and you will lose its power but not your equipment.***STORY ???/10You are a viking raised from the dead by Odin, you go chop chop and that's all. No storytelling at all, this game is minimalistic [<---overstatement] on this aspect. That's the way it was in the 80's, the limited memory space available didn't allow for cutscenes or much text on screen and the game strengths were its gameplay and graphics. However, even though this game doesn't need a story to be played, I would heve been happy to hear something more than ""Rise Warrior!"" spoken by Odin. ""Yeah I have risen, now what Odin? You want foot massage? Coffe? Ow, killing! Sure! Sorry, I should have guessed. Killing, ok, but what ? Everythig ? Well, allright, no problem, cheers mate, see ya later!"" Anyways, I don't think I can judge something that isn't there, but only the fact that is missing. The game seems to function perfectly even without a story, so it's not much of a bad thing, but still I feel it would have added some epicness to the game.***GRAPHICS 9/10Pure 80's 2D style, I like that. Sprites and animations make you go back in time (if you have been). If you didn't grow up whit games like Contra, Gosts 'n Goblins or any other similar titles you might not feel the same as I did while playing Volgarr. Animations are simple, both yours and those of your enemies, maybe a bit too much, but there is nothing wrong with that if you think about what Volgarr the Viking wants to be: an homage to the classical era of videogames.***SOUND 9/10I had goosebumps when I first heard Odin's words: ""Rise warrior!"". It reminded me of a game I used to play on the SEGA Mega Drive: ""Altered Beast"". In that game you were, like Volgarr, resurrected from your grave by some sorcerer who spoke almost the same words ""Rise from your grave!"". Maybe I'm too nostalgic, but I'm almost sure that's been done purposely as an homage to that game, which is much alike Volgarr.For what concerns the rest of the sounds in the game, I can say that ""Volgarr the Viking"" is coherent with the 80's style even under this aspect.   3) TL;DRIf you have played hard platform games during the 80's and loved them, this is the game for you.Volgarr will keep you playing for hours challenging your memory, your refelxes and, most of all, your patience. Overall score 8/10			"

												Before anything: Please make sure to turn on the ""toggle camera"" option before playing.Honestly, anyone that reviews this game negatively didn't understand what it is about. Really, this is executed with perfection on what it proposes which is to have a game that punishes every mistake harshly but provides controls that are perfectly responsive in a way that once you understand your character and your enemies fully, everytime you die you can blame no one but yourself.Some people are just gonna play half an hour and say it is crap because they didn't have time to understand the controls. The jumping mechanics are pretty weird at first because you don't have full control of your character once you're in the air, it's only possible to change the direction you're moving if you use the second jump, therefore you must plan carefuly where you want to go before inputing the jump command.For me the difficulty is comparable to the ""Souls"" series. You must proceed every stage slowly, paying attention to everything that's happening. Trying to learn how each enemy works. It's really really rare for you to get attacked or fall into a trap without an opportunity to react, therefore the luck factor is kept to a minimum, After a while you'll be able to complete each stage in a blink and it'll feel so good!I've just finished it and the difficulty was just on point the whole game aside from maybe the 2nd boss that was just annoying because it required memorising its complicated pattern.It's worth pointing out that the exploration is pretty enjoyable! It has a mechanic of fixing a spear into the walls in order to access different places, I've never seen anything like that in other games and it is really well implemented but it's not the focus.Truly one of the best games I've ever played on steam.

												I have just completed the game twice and currently I'm going for the A ending. This game is incredible. It might be a bit discouraging because the difficulty tends to ramp up quickly. Especially the first and second world are good examples of this. But as challenging the game is, it is even more rewarding.I love the feeling of flawlessly beating a boss which at first I couldn't even reach without dying 50 times. That's the beauty of the game. It rewards you by showing how you slowly got better. There's little to no randomness or luck to the game. Every single time you get hit it's your own fault, and if you manage to overcome a situation without getting hit, it's all thanks to you: the player. As you progress farther and farther in the game the areas you already cleared before become a breeze and you can easily jump, roll and slash through hordes of enemies that you used to have trouble with. I never felt a situation or enemy was particularly unfair. Got hit by an arrow? Duck faster next time! Fell into a pit? Time your jumps better! Like I explained before, the hazards in every world won't change, your skill will. Greatly.If anyone who reads this is having a hard time completing the game, or heck, even the first world. I'll tell them: Keep going! it is definitely worth it.			"

												This game makes Dark Souls (Not really an apt comparison but in terms of difficulty), Super Meat boy look like casual games. Only comparable game I can think of in terms of difficulty is Wings of Vi. I am usually pretty good at platformers but MAN this game is unforgiving to the maximum. Only buy this game if you are looking for a real challenge, This game is definitely not for casuals. Pros- Great and Simple controls- Easy to learn and hard to master gameplay- Excellent retro music and feel to the game- No checkpoint before the boss (Just like oldschool games)- 3 different endings according to the path you choose.- This game+metal = match made in heavenCons- Game causes mental anguish sometimes.Fun Fact Only 25% of the people who own this game have beaten the first level.VerdictGet it if you are a typical masochistic Dark Souls fan and like retro games.

												********THIS GAME IS VERY HARD, BUT VERY BEATABLE*********CASUALS AND RAGERS LOOK ELSEWHERE***************This game gave me the most massive nostalgia boner that I've ever had while playing a retro style game.  If you grew up playing games like Rastan and Ghosts N Goblins, then this is the perfect game for you.  Volgarr can be brutally difficult at times, but when you develop a routine for a level, you feel like a MEGA BADASS!  Some features worth noting are :  -you are a BAMF Viking that chucks spears into walls that are used as platforms-NO SAVE POINTS after turning off the game-3 different endings based on performance-if you play like a boss you get to use a FRIGGIN FLAME SWORD-an achievement that uses a He-Man reference! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT WATCH OTHERS COMPLETE MISSIONS BEFORE YOU HAVE!!!!!  Part of what makes this game so great is the satisfaction you feel after you have developed your own routine for a boss run or playthrough.  Speedrunners have got this game down to under 20 mins, but most people that like to learn on their own will take hours trying to figure out what works best for them.  10/10 will play again......			"

												This game is basically Super Ghouls & Ghosts. The controls are tight and precise, and it gives you just the right tools to succeed. The greatest feature of this game is the perfect fundamentals--jumping, attacking, avoiding getting hit. No superfluous features, no complications, no fluff. Nothing is wasted in Volgarr. There is no experience system, no inventory, or any other tedious or handholding element standing between you and the game. Just brutal, flawless fundamentals. Asskickings await.			"

												Manly game for men. Challenging old school action platformer. Don't expect a cakewalk.Features two different playthroughs with Path of the Crystal and Path of the Valkyrie. Game has 6 worlds and each world except the first one has 2 different versions. Path of the Crystal versions are normal/casual (by no means does this imply that those levels are easy) where you have unlimited lives, while Path of the Valkyrie ones are not necessarily harder in their design, just that the full playthrough on those is more hardcore as your lives are limited.Old school controls. Doesn't require a controller imo, only 2 buttons + arrows keys are involved and you can't really control the jump once commited.			"

												A decent platformer letdown by a ridiculous saving system. Yeah I understand the game is meant to be hard, but I expect it to save my progress at the end of each stage, instead, it starts you at the beginning of the game if you don't finish the world that you are in. By all means take us back to the age of 8-bit & 16-bit consoles, but give us the ability to save at the end of a level. This does not make the game less difficult, but more convenient for those that like to play their games in short bursts.			"

												The first thing that catches your attention is the old-school feel.  The player controls a Viking that must fight his way through an army of monsters.  By the way that the game looks and plays, it has a style similar to Taito’s Rastan, a classic from 1987.  One thing that makes traveling through the levels more interesting is that your weapons are for more than just combat.  For ranged combat, you have a spear to attack from a safe distance.  However, it is also useful for navigation.  If there is a wall that is too tall to jump over, throwing a powered-up spear will cause it to stick to the wall acting as a ledge.  By making the weapons multifaceted, it makes for some well-designed platforming.Of course, the combat is the real draw of the game.  With the simple and tight controls, fighting is as easy as it was back in the 8-bit days.  As for the fighting, the action is as varied as the environments.  In one stages, you are dodging spears while sliding down slopes.  In another, you are fending off mermen while riding on a raft.  With the action constantly changing, it makes you want to continue progressing throughout the game.One problem about this progressing is that it is too generous with progressing.  If your character dies, you lose half your treasure and return to the latest checkpoint.  Otherwise, the game does not hurt you.  With unlimited lives and saved progress, it makes finishing too easy.  Having either is good, but having both takes away from the old-school feeling that the game was going for.  In order to make the game play like it should, the player should stick to a lives cap.  Otherwise, it is possible to finish in a single day.Even though the combat is good, the enemies, while interesting, are not as deep as the combat.  The stages have its own enemies to make each location visually interesting.  The problem with this is that there are only a few enemy types in each stage.  In most cases, it is only a palette swap to turn the same enemy into a new one.  Once you see the first enemy, expect to see it repeat constantly until reaching the boss.  This might have been acceptable in the 80s and 90s, but nowadays, more variety is expected.			"

If you ever played Castlevania on Nes, its pretty much the same. So you cant just rush and mash buttons to complete the levels			"

												A peculiar game that is a perfect illustration of how one poor design decision can ruin everything. Kudos must be given to the developpers for creating a game that is very impressive in many respects. I have no criticism to offer when it comes to the presentation, ergonomy, core gameplay or level design. This is 2D action platforming at its finest. A great homage to Rastan, Ghouls & Ghosts, and many more.However the devs have made the conscious decision to include almost zero checkpoints. There is one checkpoint mid level, and that is that. No checkpoint before bosses either. Since this is very much a try & die game, with long & challenging levels, the result is that you will be replaying the same sections, over and over, and over and over, until you are sick to death of them. One mistake can & will set you back 5 minutes or more. This will happen many, many times. This is basically balanced for NG+ from the get-go / for people who already know the levels by heart. The joy of discovery & the fun of the challenge offered are completely ruined by the sheer numbness of repetition.This is a common complaint & one that the developpers have chosen to ignore - instead writing a impossibly long faq, listing reasons/excuses why they would not. These range from ""the game can be completed in 20 minutes"" ( sure, in a speedrun world record ) to ""git gud"". The kind of arrogant attitude one expects to see from young players, not professionals. It is worth noting mosts requests are most not about making the game easier. The difficulty is part of the experience, and is much appreciated. The only common request is to have a decent number of checkpoints. Not excessive, simply decent. One or two more per level is all it would have taken - at least for the first playthrough.If you value your leisure time, I regret to say, the right move is to avoid this one.			"

												One of my favorite games on the NES is Zelda II.  It had all the feelings of being a 2d fantasy sword-and-board platformer, where you can get into cool sword fights with skeletons, use magic, and do all kinds of cool moves.  Unfortunately, besides Battle of Olympus (eh...), there's not really any game that feels like Zelda II.  No game, that is, until Volgarr comes along, and shoves everything I love about Zelda II into one place, like being able to use your shield to block enemies, and using the down strike move.  I saw the trailers and some playthroughs of the first level, and I instantly fell in love.  Volgarr the Viking is the Zelda II I've been looking for.It's not just those things that make Volgarr such a great game.  All you have is a sword for close range attacks, and a spear for long-ranged attacks, and using it against a wall will give you many platforming possibilities.  Throughout the game are treasure chests, and hitting them twice will give you an item that will power-up Volgarr with a piece of armor or weapon.  More stuff out of these chests means more hit defense on your character (up to 3 hits), and getting a flame sword means doing more damage to enemies, so the game rewards you for doing well.And trust me, you'll need every piece of armor you can get.  It may not look like it from all of the trailers and gameplay videos, but this game is hard.  Regardless of your gaming experience, you will die.  A lot.  This isn't Candyland the game.  This isn't Seseme Street: Count with the Count.  This isn't Diablo III.  You will die.  Not only that, but each stage has a checkpoint only half-way though the game.  That means if you die on a boss, you go all the way back to the half-way point and have to do the rest of the stage plus the boss.  Is it frustrating?  Yes.  Is it teeth-grindingly difficult?  Yes.  Is it rewarding?  YOU BET YOUR SECOND-BORN SON IT IS.  You get exploding treasure when you beat a boss!  If that's not rewarding enough for you, than you need to see an optometrist.The way I see it, the game is not NES hard.  NES hard would be falling off a cliff because the game won't let you get a hit off of that supid bird.  NES hard would be getting knocked back and forth all over the place because the game thought it would be best to have 2 enemies side by side.  This is more SNES/Genesis hard, where it's tough as steel, but fair as a ref.  I see people play this game, and they get frustrated.  What's to be frustrated at?  It's not the game's fault you fell into those spikes: YOU jumped into them.  It's not the game's fault that you ran into those arrows: YOU didn't roll in time.  The game's fair but difficult challange gives me more of an incentive to complete it, because I feel like I'm not cheated when I play it.  I played the whole game.  I died a lot.  I never felt angry or frustrated the whole way through, becuase I knew the reason I keep dieing is because I didn't learn.In video games, what kills you makes you stronger.To conclude, I absolutely love this game.  It's the game I've been looking for for a long time.  I'm surprised people who are usually into hardcore games didn't this game a try.  This game has every bit of hardcore and more.  So, if you're into fun, fair, challenging platformers, give this a go.  The demo is a free download with barely any space holding it up, so what have you got to lose?This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ but not if you kick it first.			"

												""The Sega Genesis."" It's often the answer that I give when asked what my favorite game console is.  It was a great console with a lot of hidden gems and an appealing art style.  But the Genesis somehow never released a game called Volgarr the Viking.  Wait, this just in-- Volgarr is a brand new game from Crazy Viking Studios and Adult Swim Games, but it looks and feels as if it would have been right at home on the Sega Genesis. Hell, it even has a Genesis-inspired manual.TransientVolgarr the Viking is exactly what it should be: an assault to the senses of those willing to take the plunge into this ultra-violent romp through a minion-drenched hell. To many that have gotten their hands on it, Volgarr has chewed them up and spit them out. The difficulty seems to be too much. The hardest thing about Volgarr is understanding one main rule that was shared with me: there is nothing unfair about Volgarr.  So, now comes the hardest part-- putting what Volgarr is into words.  Volgarr is an old-school 16-bit side-scrolling beat-'em-up in the vein of Castlevania and Golden Axe. But what sets this game apart is the extreme difficulty when it comes to figuring out what every enemy's attack pattern is. Every enemy attacks in a certain manner, and Volgarr (while only using two buttons other than the movement keys) always has a way to dispatch them. The other beautiful thing that this game adds is how Volgarr traverses the world that he is a part of. Volgarr is a viking, not an all-powerful god. He still has to climb ropes to get to higher places, and in some cases he has to throw his spears into walls to make new platforms. This becomes one of the most satisfying things about this game, especially when those spears double up as a weapon or a way to block projectiles from above.  To add to this already epic adventure, Volgarr the Viking has a decent soundtrack. It fits the action, and the Clash of the Titans-esque world. While it isn't the best music ever heard in a game, it totally matches the action and look of the game. Just don't go in thinking that there will be epic viking chants.  TransientSo, if Volgarr the Viking sounds this great there must be something horrendously wrong with it deep down, right? No. There are some things that some gamers will have difficulty with. Problems like the extremely brutal checkpoint system. Currently, if  players die, they will find themselves all the way back at the beginning of the area of the screen they are on. This can mean losing 5-10 minutes of progress. Thankfully, players will learn something new along the way every time. This system seems crazy in a world of extreme simplicity, frequent 2-minute checkpoints, and hand-holding tutorials that never fully release players from its grasp, but players willing to stick with Volgarr will feel some of the greatest satisfaction in recent memory. Volgarr has so much to offer for players that want to feel a deep satisfaction when completing an area, or personal task. The difficulty only adds to the dark style of the game, and everything fits perfectly into the presentation of this game. Volgarr the Viking is the type of experience that has been missing from the gaming world. Do yourself a favor and pick up the best offering from Adult Swim Games yet. Finishing move:I love Volgarr the Viking. Like, really love it. It brings back so many memories from my childhood gaming career. I wasn't handed anything in games. Instead, I had to bust my♥♥♥♥♥to progress all of the time, and it was a great feeling to tell all of my friends on the playground about the strategy I had used. Now I find myself talking to friends that I handed my USB NES controller to on my couch. Learning the patterns was satisfying in a way that words can't truly explain. Quick doodles were made to explain how we handle the upcoming area, and we quickly found that Volgarr, while being a single-player game, was a great game for two people to pass a controller back and forth to. This game has lovingly stuck a spear through my heart, and is easily in top contention for game of the year.  "

												Full Review: http://bossdungeon.com/review-volgarr-the-viking/You should heed all the promotional materials on Volgarr The Viking's store page. This game is brutal and is in no way short on ways to punish every little mistake you make. If you want a game that's very true to Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins/Ghouls 'n Ghosts series, look no further than Volgarr The Viking. It's a very intricate and meticulous platformer in almost every way. Stage designs and enemy layouts are all constructed and placed for the very specific purpose of you dying over and over again. There's a heavy-handed focus on memorization, and only nigh-perfect execution will see you through the many obstacles in Volgarr's path. This game doesn't play nice, and no victory in Volgarr is ever handed out. You'll have to think your way through each enemy or boss encounter and then execute that plan with nothing short of perfection. It can be intensely satisfying to crack open the game's stages and enemy encounters.That said, frustration is very likely to set in at times due to the game's heavy reliance on memorization and perfect execution.  The only way out of any situation is usually the one the developers set up for you to figure out. While Volgarr himself has a lot of great tools at his disposal, it never feels like you're really free to use those tools in any way you want, which is a real shame. Additionally, attempting the ""Path of the Valkyrie"" route through the game is almost a task too herculean in nature for most to have the patience to ever see, which is a shame since it's the only way to access the alternate stages. Volgarr The Viking is a game made for someone wanting a very specific type of experience. Newcomers to this style of game may still find enjoyment through the frustration, but it's tuned much more for arcade junkies who don't mind a bit of repetition and tedium in their experience.			"

												It's a shame to see so many negitive reviews for the simple fact that it's hard. This game rewards persistence; the more you play and die, the more you learn about how to tackle certain obstacles. Learn from your mistakes! It's extreamly satisfying when you complete a level, something that many modern day games lack. You cannot button mash your way though this game, you need to think about each situation and work your way though it slowly (a little bit like Spelunky). Death is punishing as their is only 1 checkpoint per level, so take it slow and be cautious. The level design is great as are the monsters and the graphics will satisfy every pixel art fan. I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates a good platforming challenge. I cannot recommend this game to people who are new to platformers, or with bad timing/hand eye coordination.			"

 Positive + Well-made pixel graphics+ Successfully captures the essence of a retro game (difficult yet gratifying gameplay, memorisation of enemy patterns required in order to succeed, very simple controls etc.)+ Wide variety of challenging enemies. Negative - Inconsistent difficulty curve: the first two levels feel like the most difficult ones, then the game gets considerably easier afterwards, the boss fights are also relatively easy compared to the levels- The purposely designed controls (such as fixed jumping) leads to the occasional cheap death. [Note: This point is more of a nit-pick than a criticism of the game, the game is intentionally designed to emulate such occurrences.] Verdict “I’m not a big fan of retro games generally; with the lack of checkpoints/quick-saving, limited controls and very short gameplay. But this game managed to make these points a non-issue, and the game was more enjoyable because of it. A very solid retro platformer. You either get good, or get rekt.” 7.5/10 TJBs  "

												Are you less than a man? Do you feel that you are enfeebled by other more manly men than you? Stop your crying, grab what little testicles you have left and play Volgarr the Viking! This game isn't going to hold your hand, it isnt going to spit before the thrust. You are getting all of the Viking all at once, without any of that fairy crap of making you feel you accomplished some great feat everytime you jump when they tell you. You are thrown into a world where Lizardmen hate you, Frogmen want to stab you, and zombies want to eat you. Why? Because you're a damned Viking slashing his way to the end. Are you looking for an engrossing and well told story to make you feel like it is your job to save the world? Then go back to your little JRPG's and come back when you're done fapping to your hentai. This game does not forgive you, it does not give you motivation, and most of all it doesn't make you feel validated. Make a mistake, and you're dead. Good luck.			"

												This game was made as a love-letter to a very specific sort of gamer and game experience. I come to this title though more as an outsider, someone who played some 90s games but never really went to arcades or spent dozens of hours perfecting the way I finished one specific game level. I came to this game mostly based on a few friend recommendations and some gameplay clips, as a fan of pixel-art and platforming.The Good: I really admire this game's design focus. After just a few minutes of play it was obvious that the developers had a specific vision for this game and they pursued that vision with dogged determination. Everything that did not directly support their vision was stripped out, leaving a pure experience behind. Read the developer's description of the game and you will find it closely matches what gameplay is actually like (the description is not full of hype but cold hard facts). For me it felt so much like a 90s platformer that when Steam notifications popped up during gameplay it was almost jarring. The Bad: Because this game is so focused on giving the player a specific experience if you find you don't like that experience the game quickly loses all charm. You progress through levels by memorizing every step of the level, learning when to throw spears off screen to kill enemies you haven't even seen yet and where exactly to stand to avoid attacks that haven't even started yet. There is no room for different play-styles, personal touches, or emergent storytelling of any kind. There is almost no randomness or exploration of any kind, with this game rewarding players who have the memory and finger-precision to do the same thing over and over. As a result the game is as brutish as the titular Viking, and as exacting as his well-sharpened sword. And that's okay because that is what this game is supposed to be. Just make sure that what you want from this game matches what this game is designed to give you, otherwise it will just be a waste of your time and money.The Verdict: I recommended this game because it does what it is supposed to do, and it does it very well. If what you have read about this game so far is really resonating with you this game will likely be a good buy. But I personally did not enjoy my time with it, mostly because it doesn't match my own gaming tastes. There are a few friends I know though who still love their old platformers, and I might just let them know that this game exists.			"

												Super great, super hard arcade platformer. Think Rastan but without the ridiculous enemy spam, or Ghosts n Goblins with melee combat. You have unlimited lives, but that's not going to help you when the checkpoints are spaced so far apart. It's your skill and your skill alone that will determine how far you get. There's also an alternate, even harder path if you can manage to collect certain items while avoiding getting hit at all.			"

												You are Volgarr the Viking in a 2D sword swinging platformer set in a gorgeous old school fantasy world and this world is designed to murder and brutalize you. Almost every step is a challenge with death waiting around every corner. The game lives and thrives off of an old school feel and an incredible challenge that only the hardcore will be able to tackle. If you want a challenge, this game is for you. It looks and plays like a new school Rastan.The graphics are amazing and there is an old school vibe to them. The world is detailed and looks fantastic. There aren't that many secrets in this world and you'll mostly be moving left to right with a few times that you'll go up or down. Vulgarr will also climb chains and vines, jump over arrows far quicker than you, ride boats, slide down slopes and jump over spikes. The enemies are big, detailed and deadly. There is a lot of enemy variety and you'll face off against waves of lizard men, giant snakes, spore spitting plants, giant spiders that wait for you to come to them before they spring into action, zombies that split in half if you attack their lower half causing the top half to tumble forward, shielded skeletons that will jump and downthrust at you and so much more. These enemies are probably the best designed enemies I've seen in years. Almost all of the enemies and areas are a homage to games like Rastan, Castlevania and Zelda 2.The controls are simple and could have been done with an original Nintendo controller, but there is some depth, left and right to move, down to duck, attack with a sword, and jump (double jump that works as a screw attack). You can roll under things by holding down and the jump button. You can duck attack, jump and down thrust to break through floor tiles and enemies. You can also throw a spear by pressing up. The spear is not only a long range weapon, but a way to create platforms. You can also hold up to charge the spear and throw it across the screen to impale several enemies at once.As Vulgarr you are slow and deliberate like the original Castlevania. You need to time attacks, and know where to stand in certain situations. You will need to kill or be killed rather than dodge enemies. Most enemies can be dispatched with a single swing of your viking sword, but Vulgarr is just as fragile as most of the enemies. One hit will result in death. You can break open treasure chests to find upgrades, first the wooden shield, then the helmet & iron shield, then the flame sword. All of these upgrades that allow you to take an extra hit that will lose a piece of armor. So if you have a flame sword and get hit, you will not only lose the flame sword but your helmet. When you have the shield, you can block attacks by not attacking. Then it becomes a case of knowing when not to attack. However, wooden shields break after taking so much damage. There are other secret power ups that you will find by breaking through walls and floors ala Castlevania.The game is painfully difficult with long challenges between check points. At least the game offers unlimited lives. There are tricky jumps that rely on knowing where to throw your spears. Finding where to stand might result in playing the same level over and over countless times. Doing the exact same thing over and over with no real deviation to what you just did your previous life. Eventually, you will remember what to do, where to stand for specific enemies and you'll get better like all murderous old school games.This game has a lot going for it, but because this is a painfully challenging game, I can't recommend it to players. But judging from the downvotes. I'm wrong and people love difficult games.			"

												Genre: Retro 2D 16-bit PlatformerSub-genre: Hardcore PlatformerPresentation: 10/10 - Each pixel is beautifully rendered and lovingly placed to burn a hole directly through your skull with enduring love.Gameplay: 10/10 - With simplistic yet unforgiving controls, this game will have you high fiving your best friend one minute, and smashing your face into your desk for sweet release the next. *Keyboard and mouse compatible, as well as Gamepad compatible.Sound: 10/10- With a soundtrack that feels like it was ripped right out of the 90's, it fits right in sync with the mind-numbing sound effects that will have your ears bleeding from extreme brutality.Replay Value 10/10: What exactly is ""Replay Value""? If it's in the sense of playing the game over again, then I can tell you I am almost 100% positive once you complete this game fully you will never want to play it again, unless to show someone else or submit yourself to more torture. That being said, you are going to put so many hours into this game that it justifies the $12 price tag ten times over. You are going to die so many times that technically you can consider that your ""replay value"". If you beat the game and feel like it's not hard enough for you, then you can go back through the first level and not die. At all. Do not die, get to the end of the level, and defeat the boss. In one sweep. You will then exit off of the stage and be taken to a seperate set of levels that are called the ""Path of the Valkyrie"". These levels are much more challenging and give you all of the migraines you crave. Enjoy!Review Summary:Never have I played a game for four hours straight to still be on the first level.I am on the fourth level now and I have put 23 hours into this game.It teaches you how to play by spanking you like a little school girl.You will yell. You will cry. You will never laugh. You will step by step memorize enemy locations, level traps and upgrades to the point of madness...and then you'll continue to the next level and do it all over again.There is one checkpoint in between each level, splitting them into two for each world. There are six worlds in total, making it twelve levels total. If you do not make it to the checkpoint then you will start at the very beginning upon death.There is a boss fight at the end of each world.You have two weapons the entire game: a sword and a spear. Use these to navigate and decimate your way through each uniquely designed world. There are upgrades. If you can manage not to take any damage, each upgrade you get builds on top of the last one. It starts with a wooden shield, next upgrade is a metal shield and you can charge your spear throw. After that comes a viking helmet, then a flame sword. Only once you have claimed all of these upgrades can you truly claim you are still only mediocre at this game. There is also a bonus item you can find called Mjolnir, that gives you temporary invulnerability.BEWARE: This game instills hope just as fast as it takes it from you.If that's not your cup of tea, then you are a sissy.

												Hard as balls in winter.  This game has the unforgiving nature of games that came out for the NES or the SEGA.  What i mean is that u progress little by little having to learn enemy partners and enemy layouts on the level before u can final complete the level kind of like when u first play a level in megaman.   You have 1 life as u progress thro the level u can pick up armor that increases ur health by 1.  Everything in this game wants u dead and it will more then likely take u multiple attempts and deaths to beat the first level and every level after that.  The rage this game invokes is up there on the super meat boy levels.  I only recommend this game to people who are dedicated players otherwise u will play get frustrated and prolly rage quit.  That being said its not a bad game its a very good game but a very difficult game.			"

												I'll preface by saying that I grew up in the 80s. I grew up in the glory of the arcade days where Altered Beast, Rastan, Gauntlet, TMNT, and all the other classic where there to eat your quarters and etch their fun times in many O' memory forever. This game, Volgarr the Viking is a true successor to those old arcade classics in design, difficulty, and most importantly, overall fun. I'm having a blast with this game and I can already tell its one I'll go back to over and over as I do with the Metal Slug Series. The design, art, and look of this game takes old school to the next level. The game oozes the effort the developers put in. You can tell this was a labor of love and no one was punching a time clock when they created this gem. The color pallet, the level design, the music, sound effects, and of course, the unforgiving difficulty are all there and on point. You'll have a great time going through the levels, honing your skill, tightening your patterns and mastering the controls with Volgarr.BUY THIS GAME, strap on your time machine, step back into the 80s arcade scene and get ready to have some new, old school fun with this fantastic game.

												I totally recommend this game!This 2D side scroller is reminiscent of old NES and arcade style games.  The graphics are kind of pixelated.  The controls are kind of clunky at first.  The difficulty is pretty extreme until you get the hang of it.  This totally takes me back to the arcade at the pizza place or the bowling alley.  This is one that you can play turn on and play if you only have 10 or 15 minutes, or you can spend all afternoon/evening trying to get that perfect run.  I enjoyed it so much, this is one of the few games for which I got all the achievements and badges!			"

Völgarr the VikingReviewed by someone who thought was a calm personOpening CaseI bought Völgarr 2 years ago and played for a while, 3 or 4 hours to be exact, never got past the second stage, so I raged quitted pretty hard, the thing is, I didn't hate the game, I hated myself for always making the same mistakes and getting caught in easy to avoid traps, I had just finished playing hotline Miami so I wanted to do everything really fast and reacting at everything as the came, something you should not do when playing Völgarr and here's why:GameplayVölgarr is pretty straight forward, when you start the game there's nothing on the screen but Odin pointing right, and as you walk though a no more than 2 minutes of tutorial to teach you the whole game there's not much challenge when your commands consist of jumping, dodging, attacking and throwing a spear, seems easy right? and to tell you the truth it is, as long as you master these 4 actions you'll finish the game without problem.And it may sound easy at this point but I assure you I've never played anything harder than this game, maybe because I'm impatient, but it's so easy to mess up, and It's never really something's fault besides your own, enemies can be dispatched easily with one to two hits usually, and if they take more than that I assure you they're really slow and have really easy to read attacks.The main of the game is the platforming, it is your worse enemy for it cannot be killed, it has to be dealt with, once you jump your arch is set, you do have a second one where you can change the way you're going, but I'd say it's only on the game to make it easier, I don't thing you really need it to go through any platforming.SoundtrackBuy it.GraphicsI want to say background are a little bit lackluster but the truth is they had to be, otherwise I wouldn't fit the arcade feel, also it would make paying attention to enemies and traps harder with too much on the backgrounds, although I can't say about simplicity on the enemies, they're all really well made, they might look simple on the quick to judge eye but the amount of color shading going into every enemie and boss is awesome!

												This is like Rastan, the 1987 arcade game. It's not a remake, but it's very similar. It's fun, but it's very hard. The controls are a little stiff, and the checkpoints are few and far between. Good luck.			"

												Volgarr the Viking is a fantastic action platformer that harkens back to the 16-bit games of the Sega Genesis era. It’s a colorful game with tight controls and well-designed levels, most of which are broken into two areas with a challenging boss waiting at the end of each. Unlike many modern games that allow progression with minimal commitment from players, it has an unabashed difficulty that demands the player master enemy patterns, learn ambush locations, and find secret power-ups. People looking for a challenge akin to what you may find in a Souls game will find a lot to like about Volgarr the Viking. It’s highly recommended that you use a controller for this game.			"

												Be the viking... Or die trying, a lot! Having actually finished this game I feel qualified to recommend it to anyone who likes extremely difficult platformers. Volgarr is something of an anomaly, a game that could have been made back in 1990, but works so very well today. It is not the same kind of fast paced action featured in games like Super Meat Boy, though. It is slower, more deliberate, and much more violent. Every movement must be deliberate and you will die a lot just figuring out when to jump, what the boss pattern is, etc... However, you do get unlimited lives and the most you have to backtrack is maybe 5-7 minutes after dying to a boss, if that. If this doesn't sound like fun to you, it might not be, but it feels great once you've mastered the levels and bosses, eventually being able to clear them without even getting hit once. Oh, and you do get armor pickups that enhance your abilities and you can take 2-3 hits before dying depending on your items, and can block most ranged attacks. The game is very fair, just very hard.There is a lot more to the game than most people will ever see, as well. By completing levels perfectly (or near perfectly) you gain ""lives"" you can use in extra-challenging alternate levels. There are 4 or 5 of these, and when you run out of lives in them you get dropped back into the main game levels, at which point you can try to win them without getting hurt again and get back into the alternates. There are 3 different endings based on how many of these you complete.I'll wrap up with a quick tip for anyone who buys the game and wants to actually finish it... Press left on the title screen to warp to the next level. You can keep doing  this all the way to the end game tower assuming you actually beat the boss of the level you're skipping over.			"

												""Rise, Warrior!"" They don't make many games like this anymore, and that's a shame. Volgarr the Viking is a masterful throwback to hardcore arcade-style design philosophy. Volgarr's presentation lovingly harkens back to the machismo and high fantasy of 1980s popular culture icons like Conan the Barbarian and He-Man. But its throwback design is not merely skin-deep. The creators of this game have taken the best design elements from classic action games like Rastan and Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, added their own elements, and infused them with a modern touch. The result is a fluid, deep game that is extremely challenging and, in turn, consistently rewarding. Volgarr has a few simple attack and movement mechanics that are easy to understand but take careful skill and situational awareness to implement effectively. The enviroments in this game are not random and they are not cheap. They are intricately designed set-pieces created to challenge you, to teach you how to adapt to changing environments and various enemies. Your skills with Volgarr's simple but powerful moveset will be tested, but each obstacle you face is molding you into becoming the ultimate viking warrior. Going from being at the mercy of common lizardmen to dispatching with hordes of enemies and giant monsters with style and ease is an incredibly satisfying process.If you are fan of classic arcade-style action games or if you are interested in a true hardcore challenge, buy this game as soon as you can.

The length is about right with six stages in two parts each, plus a boss, which keeps up the difficulty without becoming too tedious or repetitive. Volgarr the Viking sets a high bar for action sidescrollers with a genuinely challenging experience. Recommended only for gamers with grit. "

												I'm a very casual player, and usually pick easy mode if I'm given an option for games. Yet I enjoyed this game very much. It's very challenging but fair. I died over and over and over yet I never found myself getting frustrated. Each death was just another opportunity to try again, to overcome the challenge and get further. The controls are near perfect for this style of game.. very similar to ghouls and ghosts. The levels and enemies are expertly designed, and the controls work very well for the type of game it is. After a while I could feel myself getting better. I knew the enemy patterns better, and learned how to get past the obstacles more confidently. The feeling of finally beating the first stage was exilirating, and I still wanted to go back and try to beat the level again, just because it was so fun.If you're like me and are put off by the difficulty, you still might really enjoy this game! I suggest you give it a try if you're in any way a fan of oldschool platformers.			"

												Insanely unfair game, none of the challenge stems from well timed attacks, but from 100% memorizing the each level's layout. The visuals are nice and the controls are extremely responsive, but you will almost never feel like any of your deaths were your own fault. There are some gameplay elements that are just in the game simply to introduce unneeded challenge, rather than add depth to the gameplay. I can definitely see why someone would enjoy this game, as after memorizing the level's layout, running through the entire thing without getting hit once is extremely satisfying, but I for one did not really get my money's worth out of it.

												Tip: Take it slow. This is not a game you rush into. Be observant about what's coming up next.You'll swear that you remember this game from ""back in the day"" even though it wasn't around when you were a kid. This game is tough, but fair. You will have to memorize where the enemies are, their patterns, and how to defeat them, but not in a way that seems boring, unfair, or cheap. There is a genuine feeling of accomplishment when you figure out how to get through an area. Your deaths (there will be a lot of them) always feel like your fault, and not the fault of the programming. You would have lived if you would have pressed a button just a split second faster, timed a jump a bit better, or remembered to roll at just the right time. The controls are tight and responsive. If you remember the golden age of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis rivalry, you'll feel right at home here. It's tough, but rewarding. You might rage quit after failing to get through a section over and over, but you'll eventually come back to try again. I highly recommend trying Volgarr the Viking.A highlight is that there is no long, drawn out story. You start playing immediately. When you die there is no game over screen, you just start again at the last checkpoint. The ability to get into the gameplay so quickly makes this game perfect for picking up and playing when you have a free moment. There is no fluff between you and the action.NOTE: You CANNOT steer while jumping. Once you commit to a jump, you have to wait for it to play out. This was not a problem for me, I barely even noticed it, but many people can't adjust to this play style. You have been warned.			"

												This is an excellently crafted, classic-style platformer action game. Volgarr takes the best parts of classics like Altered Beast and Ghosts n' Goblins/Super Ghouls n' Ghosts and turns them into something unique, impressive, and refreshing in a sea of sub-par retro games. The art style is also great. Even the death animation is badass... which is good because you're going to see it a lot.Volgarr is FairEach level has 1 checkpoint and a boss. Throughout each stage you'll find a series of chests (many are hidden) that give you a power up (sturdy shield, helmet, flame sword, etc.). Getting hit means you lose 1 or more powerups, so if you want to beat the boss you're going to have to get through the level with your 'A-game'. You don't have lives in this game, and you can keep playing until you give up or beat it, but there are no save-points. However, when you beat a boss, you can choose to skip that level when you start a new game. So if you've made it all the way to level 3 you can skip level 1 then 2 on your next session. Volgarr is for Non-Casuls OnlyThe platforming and combat in this game are excellent. I've seen complaints that jumping is difficult and movement is sluggish, but I say the controls are strict and predictable. You can double-jump, for example, and you can change your movement mid-air - so you need to be smart about when you press buttons. The enemies are varied throughout the game, and their attacks are also telegraphed and predictable - but don't let that fool you into thinking that makes them any easier to get past.Volgarr is... a Viking!I've had this game for quite awhile now and it's one of the few that I frequently come back to for 15-30min sessions. There are a couple levels I play more than others, but all the levels always present me with a challenge. I've only recently learned that if you righteously kick a levels♥♥♥♥♥you'll get a rare opportunity to play an alternate, hard-mode version of the following stage (So, at my game just got twice as big and I haven't even beaten the final boss yet).

												whatever you do, dont decide to make a drinking game with ur friend the first time you ever play this game...otherwise...  this game is the best drinking game ever... take a shot/sip whenever you die... and whenever you die you gotta pass the controller on lol.... fun times...in all seriousness, this game is a blast from the past and a reminder of how hard games used to be... if your bored playing the same old on the rails ez pz stuff you see nowadays, give volgarr a spin!you finally get past the first level thinking your a boss... only to realize lvl 2 is 2 times harder... once u get to level 3... well then i guess you realize the game has just begun lol			"

												It took me 3 hours to get to the second part of the first stage. Either I really suck at this game or it's pretty tough. Hell, it may be both, I'm not sure. What I can say is that this is a lot of fun. Old-school fun.It's like if Castlevania had a one-night stand with Ghosts 'n Goblins and that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child was severly tortured growing up; seeking escape and life-lessons through Conan the Barbarian.In the three hours it took me to inch my way forward, I learned what the riddle of steel was. I ask those who would seek this challenge and solve the riddle, ""what is good in life?""			"

												Great game, but incredibly difficult and reminiscent of older games like Ghost 'n Goblins. If you love those old games, you'll love this. This is a game that is almost entirely skill-based. If you want a game that will hold your hand you aren't going to get it here. Every enemy you encounter has a specific way of being defeated that will often require you to have a solid grasp of the fighting and platforming mechanics.There's a limited save system that allows you to resume roughtly where you left off, but you'll need to collect lives in-game--and likely play the game in one-sitting--to beat the optional later levels and get the best ending. That might seem a bit too harsh, but once you get the core gameplay down you'll be able to get to the final boss in about an hour. In short: Difficult, but extremely fun, and with good core gameplay that's difficult without feeling cheap. "

												This game is HEAVILY inspired to the old coin-op arcade Rastan and you can sense that from the very beginning, looking at the first monsters you encounter and the level layout.Is this a bad thing? HELL NO! This game is truly amazing, takes many good things of old classic arcade games and adapt them to new styles of gameplay.The mechanics of the game are really similar to Ghost'n'Goblins. While you progress you find chests with items inside, if you get hit you'll loose 1 or 2 items. You can get the items only in a specific order: -Shield  (you start with it but you can lose it, it can parry a few hits) ;-HammerShield  (can parry every hit, unlocks the power to charge super spears);-Helmet  (i havent found any specific ability for this, it just grand another layer of defence);-Flame Sword  (deals increased damage).Overall the difficulty could feel a bit frustrating at the beginning, especially if you're used to save your game every few steps.It's gonna be brutal, you'll die a lot, but each time you'll learn a bit more about the level and slowly you'll progress and be able to finish a level without dying.It is really hard, like the old Rastan and Ghost'n'Goblins were, it took me roughly 1 hour to complete the first world, which is divided in 2 levels + boss.Overall i love it, it brings me back to when i was a kid and couldn't wait to go to the Arcade and spend tons of coins to play these beautiful games. This game is just all that...a sweet jump to 20 years ago...with style!			"

												Let me start off by saying this game is not for the faint hearted! You will die and you will die a lot!!! Unlike Tiny Barbarian this game will test your skills at every corner, it has a steep learning curve that will punish you at every turn.  How you proceed in Volgarr is to die and learn from your mistakes.  Your health is made up by items that you collect along the way, for example your shield and helemt each add an additional Health Point to your armour, each time you get Hit you lose an item until you finally die. Controls are a bit limited and there are no checkpoints along the way.Being such a hard game makes every level you complete feel like such a mammoth victory, having mastered all the enemys, traps and string them together to safley get you through a level actually gives you a sense of accomplishment.  It has the feel of a Money hungry arcade game forcing you to enter more coins and learn the game so that you can progress.  But in saying that the difficulty is just about right to keep you keen enough to complete each level and battle on.			"

Völlgar the VIking is Rock Hard, but for the most part, its not Unfair. Its like having Sergeant Hartman as a Drill Instruktor. This game plays in the same league as Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls.

												A throwback to the age of brutally hard and unforgiving platformers, with additional features such as a game timer. A game that lends itself perfectly to the experience of speed runs. Controls are not as responsive as I would like. In order to do a jump that moves either left or right, you have to press the movement buttons either before or at the time of jumping. There is no movement possible in the air either left or right.That bone picked however, the game does well to challenge your sense of timing and reaction speeds. Judgement is everything with checkpoints few and far between. Hardcore 2D platforme gamers looking for a challenge will love this game.Personally, I'm still stuck on the first level.			"

												I can apppreciate the work that went to this game, it accomplishes its intend.However the game is quite a bit too much about memorizing and mapping enemies in each stage, and dying over and over again until you master a strategy (which, is very NES like).For what is worth I enjoyed playing it and suffering for a couple of levels, but unfortunately for me it started to take too much time to advance (which mean, took me too long to gid gud and advance to the next level) and ended up not being as fun and decided to drop it.I would recommend to people that enjoy hard 2D games and speed running, but be advised, it will take time, skill and sometimes a bit of luck.

												Genre: Action, Adventure, Indie, PlatformerDeveloper: Crazy Viking StudiosPublisher: Adult Swim GamesRelease Date: September 13, 2013The Gods struck lightning upon the land and from the bolts came Volgarr The Viking. This one from Crazy Viking Studios reminds me of the NES version of Dragons Lair, not so much the gameplay but the almost impossibility of completing the first level. Very unforgiving Volgarr The Viking has one difficulty setting, and thats Ralph Wiggum HARD. This is one of those games where what you see is what you get, and reminds me a lot of a SEGA arcade machine that would cost you 25 cents every run. So trust me, if that were the case with this game, you would lose your entire paycheck trying to beat the first level. BUT, that isn’t exactly a bad thing, and I’ll explain why.When I initially started this game, the powerful music combined with the 16 bit SEGA graphics kind of takes you back a bit. I like games with unique introductions like this one, where the start screen is the beginning of the game as well. Volgarr the Viking takes elements from games like Castlevania and Contra, and brings them into the new age while making sure not to jeopardize the retro feel. Not only is this game more brutally violent than a relationship with Chris Brown, but brutally hard. My first time playing after 30 minutes and multiple deaths I still hadn’t made it to the first checkpoint. One of my main concerns reading the early reviews of this game revolved around what many called “clunky, unresponsive controls.” Thankfully after buying Volgarr I found this not to be the case. The dynamics and mechanics are perfectly balanced for this game, and are what I would like to describe as “solid.” Meaning each move must follow through before making the next, so if in the time you are swinging the sword you are hit, you won’t be able to react fast enough and will suffer the consequences.The Game itself doesn’t have much of a story line. When you first start, the Gods declare “Rise Warrior!” as a bolt of lightning strikes the ground Volgarr appears. From there on you start the game immediately and begin the adventure. Starting off you are given a shield, which will act as your main form of defense against the lizardish bird monsters that you are put up against. When you aren’t attacking you are able to block the simple attack so each of the monsters, but the moment you attack you are leaving yourself vulnerable. The shield acts as a hit point. If you get hit, you lose the shield and you are now exposed to everything making your next hit fatal. You can pick up different forms of armor throughout the game by finding and breaking open chests. After getting the shield and helmet you can upgrade your weapon to a flaming sword which is considerably more powerful than the one you begin with. Each different item you are wearing acts as single hit point, each time you are hit you lose an item.As for replay factor, that seems to be all that you will be doing when it comes to Volgarr The Viking, or at least that was my experience. I can say that I have played the game for a good 5 hours in preparation for this review, and within that time I’ve learned to love and hate the game all at the same time. It certainly is hard, and seems impossible, but I guess thats what gives it mystery. The way I look at it, Volgarr The Viking is yet another classic from Adult Swim Studios, and no matter what you love or hate about it, thats what makes it so awesome.Volgarr The Viking stays true to the 16 bit retro feel all the way through. Everything from the controls, graphics, music and mood all remind me of after school gaming sessions with friends, trying to prove who could get further and beat the level. Taking everything into account Volgarr The Viking is a good game, fun to play, and bleeds nostalgia. If you think you have what it takes, go for it, you won’t be disappointed.Graphics: 7/10Playability: 6/10Story: 1/10Challenge: 10/10Replay Value: 6/10			"

												Short:It's a really nice game and in the end i still can recommend it (especially on sales) to everyone who can forgive imperfection in detail.You can double jump, dodge, charge your spear to increase damage and range, have a flaming sword (with increased damage compared to the standard sword) and, the most amazing thing: you are a viking.On the other hand:- you have to press a movement-direction-button (left or right) with your second jump, because you jump straight upward without a direction-button.- you can't move while crouching, so you have to dodge instead.- after beating a stage and restarting the game, you have to visit all previous stages and move to the left in order to come to the next stage. There is no way to just choose the stage.- you have to beat a stage in his normal version again in order to come to the harder versions of the stages.

												The game starts off quite difficult, and is certainly not easy to master either, but it is 100% fair. It took me a few weeks to beat the game making tiny tiny progress each time, refining my approach to each situation as well as mechanical mastery with the controls.  I was delighted to find that after i had beaten the hardest game of my life, there are completely fresh hard mode versions of the levels. even more punishing; you have to EARN single attempts at the hard mode levels and these are earned by playing FLAWLESSLY.

			Volgarr the Viking is a tough as nails platformer similar to Super Ghouls N Ghosts, Castlevania, and other retro games. It's gameplay is difficult and unforgiving, but that makes each accomplishment...

												Short answer:  Yes, buy this game now!Volgarr is one of those games that reminds me why I love video games.  The controls are smooth, and it's easy to shift from attacks to evasive dodges and jumps and back again in fluid motion.  The gameplay is awesome, with a mix of platforming and slashemup action.  The difficulty is about right; not so easy I pass everything on my first try, but not so hard that I can't advance after several attempts (it took me 7 hours to get to the ending, and then another 10 for the best ending, played in 1-2 hour chunks).  And with plenty of secrets and bonus levels to unlock, there's a lot more here than appears at first.  Excellent game!			"

												When a game like Dark Souls is praised as being one of the most difficult games ever made, people of a certain age will remember games such as Contra, Battletoads and Ghosts N' Goblins and then wonder what all the fuss is about.  Volgarr isn't as difficult as these, but it certainly owes its existence to Ghosts N' Goblins and fans of that title and fans of punishing old school games should love homage to the ""Golden Age"" of arcade gaming.  Volgarr features hand-made pixel animation, epic soundtrack, simple controls and of course...challenging level design.  It isn't a looker, but it doesn't need to be.  Each level never changes, so when you die you will know what is coming and must try and improve for your next attempt.  This meticulous design offers a highly rewarding feeling of accomplishment when you finally overcome a level that has been making you tear your hair out for the last 40 attempts.  This is what the game is all about.  If you hate dying, hate a challenge, need a story and dislike repetition then you must steer clear of this title.  Otherwise, you will be able to flex your gaming muscles and really challenge yourself.  There isn't a lot else to say.  It is a well designed homage to an older generation of games and will instantly appeal to fans of the NES platformer era.  The game is never unfair, so if you are apprehensive about picking this up, at least look for it on sale and give it a chance. "

												This game does ""old school"" difficulty to a tee. If you don't like starting the game right from the beginning every time you play, and you don't like few and far between checkpoints, this is not for you.If, however, you enjoy the feeling of accomplishment you get from playing a level over and over, getting a little better at it every time, and eventually beating it without the help of fancy quicksaves or checkpoints, then certainly give it a shot.The play style and mentality needed for this game is very much like what you needed for the original battletoads on the NES. If you liked that, you will probably like this.			"

												This basic side-scrolling action game set to a retro style is a perfect recreated of classic titles revived in this new era of video games. Vulgar the Viking takes on the attributes of old as a hardcore you only live once action sidescroller, with interesting and complex level designs and a diverse set of vicious monsters to slay plus a simple but engaging combat system that makes clearing endless waves of monsters a bucket of fun. This hardcore retro action game feels rewarding with every checkpoint you make and truly feels like a classic adventure in the arcade. Although this game is not for the faint of heart I feel this simplistic hardcore classic will be loved by many.			"

The game provides a consistant challenge all the way through, with solid movement and combat mechanics.Doing well rewards Volgarr with powers to do even more well (yes, that's a thing, ask anyone). Do badly however, and the game strips Volgarr of said power.Recommended to any looking for a challenge.			"

												Volgarr is a throwback to certain challenging 16-bit platformers, namely Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts and Rastan. The graphics are a little odd- they look kind of like a SNES game with the ""filtering"" turned on to make the pixels look smoothed, but I actually do like them. More importantly, the mechanics are top notch. With these kind of games, controls and mechanics absolutely make or break the game. Volgarr has Rastan style swordplay (attack while moving, block with shield, etc) and Ghouls 'N Ghosts style platforming (a nice, crisp-feeling double jump) and powerups (chests upgrade your shield/armor/weapon depending on what you've got currently, allowing you to use new moves and take more hits). Volgarr has a sword and a spear, and that's it. The game really makes it work, giving you a range of options. You can fight while moving, play defensive and trade blows with your shield, dodge roll, jump attack, downstab, throw spears, charge spear attack, throw spears in midair, throw spears into walls to make new platforms, and so on. All of this is highly intuitive and you'll find yourself doing some really cool maneuvers very naturally. I kind of amazed myself just now when I jumped into an area, threw a spear in midair to kill a wasp, downstabbed to kill a lizardman, dodge rolled past an arrow trap, and then jumped onto a spear I threw earlier to climb out of the pit before another arrow could fire. It's important to know that Volgarr is very oldschool. That means no saving. Every time you launch the game, there isn't even a start menu, Volgarr is borne out of blood and bone and you start killing lizardmen immediately. You begin from level 1 every time you launch the game. You do have infinite lives, but checkpoints aren't highly frequent, and you'll need to beat the game in one sitting. I believe that beating a level without dying takes you down an alternate path for the next level, and beating the entire game without dying gives you a secret ending. My only complaint is that I wish that the game had better music. It deserves more metal music!			"

												Volgarr the Viking is a platformer/action title that calls back to the 16-bit era of gaming, with the added challenge of unforgivable gameplay elements. The graphics are revamped pixel art with fluid movement and a soundtrack that reverberates the same classic feel. The characters and environments are also in line with the mantra the title promotes, with the added enjoyment of gratuitous gore and violence. All wrapped in a canister that seems to explode fuzzy snakes of frustration that only expose how soft gamers have become.Full Review: http://videogamewriters.com/review-volgarr-viking-65126 "

												I'll probably never beat Volgar, but that's part of its appeal. It has great controls, everything feels tight and precise. The enemy types are clearly identified, green Nose-Beaks takes one hit, blue two, red three, and so on. The spear's simple/easy to use, and is necessary for traversal. The games core is its difficulty. It is very hard to get from checkpoint to checkpoint, but when you do progress the sense of achievement is genuine. It never feels like the obstacles are impossible or cheap. Once you know where the deathtraps are it's up to your skill to get past them. The game is hard but not unfair and I keep coming back for more. I definitely recommend.			"

												If you like Super Ghouls n Ghosts, you probably already like this game.First off, the saving in this game is done once you beat the boss at the end of each world. When you first start a stage, move immediately to the left to skip that world.The platforming mechanics are solid, which is what you want in a platformer. You can –with timed double jumps– be precise with your movement once you learn how. The enemies are ok, including bosses none of them have random elements from what I can tell, so you can plan everything before you jump into a fight once you've learned the patterns. This is a good thing for speed running, but it makes the game feel sanitary sometimes. The game usually shows you a new enemy or trap relatively safely before including it in the rest of the level too, which is nice. The graphics are pretty much what you'd see on a SNES or Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, which better suits this style of game in my opinion.Overall I'd give it an 8/10, not the best platformer ever, but it's the best one I've played in a long time. There is also a hard version for all (but the first?) worlds, which is explained to you in the credits if you hadn't figured it out already. If you want checkpoints every 2 minutes, this isn't the game for you.			"

												I get this game is made for the prupose of being a challenging but rewarding game. And if you love that stuff you may like this game. It has a lot going for it but has two big problems:- Jump control is too uncompromising - The amount of tedious work you have to do over again when you die - i.e. lack of checkpoints.I've played games with infrequent checkpoints and its normally more enjoyable because you don't feel like you are trudging through the same stuff you have already perfected just to get to the harder stuff. There is some sense of variety that keeps it interesting every time you die (Dark Souls or Hitman games if you are trying to stay stealthy).The jumping to me seems like it is designed to screw you over more often than help you. I'd prefer good control of my character with harder obstacles rather than feel like I can't make use of this guy because the controls are so rigid.Despite all that though it's honestly worth a couple bucks to try because if the jumping doesn't bother you and you are a masochist, you'll probably find a lot of value in the game.

But what most people don't realize is that most of their complains are part of the design. Which means it won't appeal to a lot of people.Volgarr has some game design decisions that I feel is unappreciated. This video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThvRVYuDo34) explains a good example of their design, specifically, how to introduce enemies which the player sees for the first time.Here are some common complaints about the game:*Checkpoints*: Yes, the checkpoints are real far apart. But the designers are trying to push for an arcade experience where you get better the more you play the game. If you have less frequent checkpoints, the levels will more memorable since you'll be playing it more. Also, the design of the power-up system means that the checkpoint cannot be near the boss. Here is the dev's statement on check points: http://steamcommunity.com/app/247240/discussions/0/846965056727179788 . *Jump arc*: People say the jumping is stiff. But the entire game is built around that. Think of the original Castlevania games. The character has an uncontrollable jump arc but you can still reach the platforms. The same can be said about Volgarr. If you see a pit, you can simply jump over it. No need to double jump.*It feels that you have to play perfectly*: Not true at all. When I started playing, I felt this way but as I progress, I noticed small tricks that I can use. For example, the shield can be used to block a lot of attacks including those intimidating ones used by tougher enemies]. Once I figured that out, I was able to progress through the stages way faster by just using that item since most enemies have a delay after attacking. The game didn't teach me that but it was something that I noticed later. And when I decided to experiment, I felt the game rewarded me for my lateral thinking.This game rewards patience and methodological play. Which is why most gamers don't this game a second chance. It takes many playthroughs to see the brilliance of the game. The people who stick with it to the end will have the most rewarding feeling of accomplishment. They will feel that they've earned it.Sadly, this game isn't for everyone. If you're the kind of person who gets frustrated at repeating a level over and over again until completion, this isn't for you. The game's core design is that this is an arcade game meant to be played over and over again so you'll gain the skill needed to complete the game. Tl;dr: give the game a chance. You'll get frustrated, but that's part of the design. Because nothing beats the feeling of you overcoming the game's obstacle is throwing at you.			"

												This game constantly reminds me that I'm inadequate and generally unskilled. I usually stop playing after a while because it has a tendency to reduce my self-esteem to nothing, and I'm left contemplating whether or not I'm capable of improving at anything, ever. I'm only able to play in short bursts because otherwise I feel like I might actually start breaking things on my desk. I have only put 2 hours into it so far, and I'm still not even sure that I've completed the first level. That is to say, I can't confirm whether or not I've seen the end of a level or if I've just gotten to the third checkpoint a couple times. I hate this game and I hate myself and I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												I highly recommend this game which is a true ode to the old arcade games. Völgarr is a bloody plateformer with stunning animations and more importantly, extremely accurate controls. Of course, this is a very difficult game, with almost no checkpoints, and you will die a lot before successfully finish a level, and even more to see the real end which requires fulfillment in a single run. For the more competitive gamers, Völgarr also offers speedrun with a built-in stopwatch. Gentlemen, your records!-----------------------------------------Je recommande fortement ce jeu qui est une véritable ôde aux vieux jeux d'arcade. Völgarr est un plateformer sanglant doté de superbes animations et, plus important, de contrôles extrêmement précis. Bien sûr, c'est un jeu difficile, avec presque aucun checkpoints, et vous mourrez beaucoup avant de finir un niveau, et plus encore pour voir la vraie fin qui demande de finir le jeu d'une traite. Pour les plus acharnés, Völgarr propose aussi du speedrun avec un chronomètre intégré. Messieurs, à vos records !			"

												Volgarr is a throwback to certain challenging 16-bit platformers, namely Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts and Rastan. The graphics are a little odd- they look kind of like a SNES game with the ""filtering"" turned on to make the pixels look smoothed, but I actually do like them. More importantly, the mechanics are top notch. With these kind of games, controls and mechanics absolutely make or break the game. Volgarr has Rastan style swordplay (attack while moving, block with shield, etc) and Ghouls 'N Ghosts style platforming (a nice, crisp-feeling double jump) and powerups (chests upgrade your shield/armor/weapon depending on what you've got currently, allowing you to use new moves and take more hits). Volgarr has a sword and a spear, and that's it. The game really makes it work, giving you a range of options. You can fight while moving, play defensive and trade blows with your shield, dodge roll, jump attack, downstab, throw spears, charge spear attack, throw spears in midair, throw spears into walls to make new platforms, and so on. All of this is highly intuitive and you'll find yourself doing some really cool maneuvers very naturally. I kind of amazed myself just now when I jumped into an area, threw a spear in midair to kill a wasp, downstabbed to kill a lizardman, dodge rolled past an arrow trap, and then jumped onto a spear I threw earlier to climb out of the pit before another arrow could fire. It's important to know that Volgarr is very oldschool. That means no saving. Every time you launch the game, there isn't even a start menu, Volgarr is borne out of blood and bone and you start killing lizardmen immediately. You begin from level 1 every time you launch the game. You do have infinite lives, but checkpoints aren't highly frequent, and you'll need to beat the game in one sitting. I believe that beating a level without dying takes you down an alternate path for the next level, and beating the entire game without dying gives you a secret ending. My only complaint is that I wish that the game had better music. It deserves more metal music!			"

If you liked that, you will probably like this.			"

												I'll probably never beat Volgar, but that's part of its appeal. It has great controls, everything feels tight and precise. The enemy types are clearly identified, green Nose-Beaks takes one hit, blue two, red three, and so on. The spear's simple/easy to use, and is necessary for traversal. The games core is its difficulty. It is very hard to get from checkpoint to checkpoint, but when you do progress the sense of achievement is genuine. It never feels like the obstacles are impossible or cheap. Once you know where the deathtraps are it's up to your skill to get past them. The game is hard but not unfair and I keep coming back for more. I definitely recommend.			"

												A very unforgiving, but also very rewarding old-school platformer.By the old school, I dont mean the wellmade retro graphics, but the gameplay and difficulty level of the game.It doesnt work like the standard SuperMeatBoy-wannabe-games with retro graphics, Volgarr is very different to them.You die, die, die again, and when you die, you better pay attention to why did you die and how you can avoid it next time, to survive and get through this game. You dont need fast reflexes or hyper controlling skills to pass this game. All you really need is patience, ability to pay attention to your surroundings, and being able to learn from your mistakes.After that, the game is almost like a puzzle-platformer. As long as you know how enemies and traps handle and know the limitations of your character, and take a lot of patience, you can get through the game without dying a single time. If you fail at those but try to push through the levels with brute force and trust in your skills, you will never complete even the first level.These days, games designed this way are very very rare, and for one willing to try one, give it a try. The challenges of Volgarr are not for everyone though.			"

												This game is like a love letter to the hardest arcade games of the past.  It's like they combined the best elements of Ghouls & Ghosts with Rastan & made a super tough arcade action platform experience.Just know that this game is hard.  Really really hard.  After 5 hours I haven't beaten the 2nd level HARD.~PROS-Solid Action/Platform Mechanics-Classic Arcade Style Elements-Easy to Learn/Hard to Master-Level Select Feature-Two Different Adventures~CONS-VERY HIGH DifficultyJust know before you play this game that you will die a lot & you will need to play it a lot in order to get good enough to beat even the first level, then even more for the following levels.  If you've got the time to put in & aquire the neccessary skill to beat the game then you should pick it up.  Even if you don't, you'll still get a kick out of it if you enjoy classic arcade style games.The game has a lot going for it & a lot of hidden goodies like the level select.  After you beat a level, you can skip it simply by moving left at the beginning of the stage.  Of course, if you want to do the Valkyrie levels you will need to play through the entire game on one life & earn Valkyrie Souls by opening all the chests.  If you're able to get through a level without getting hit & opening all the chests you gain credits that enable you to choose the Valkyrie levels after you beat a stage.  Just know that the Valkyrie stages are much harder than the Viking ones & the Viking ones are already pretty darn hard.When you go through the game you should take in your surroundings & treat everything like a puzzle because it's pretty much set up to be done a certain way.  If you manage to figure it out you can progress through it with near perfection & not getting hit a single time.Overall, if you like classic arcade style action platform games then you should get this one.  It's worth every penny & if you can get it on a sale then that's even better.  All the frustration is worth it if you can somehow play through this game to the end.  Heck, I still haven't been able to do it but I'm gonna keep trying.			"

												UPDATE: recently I had a comment stating that there is somewhat of a save mechanism. I was pointed towards the FAQ: https://steamcommunity.com/app/247240/discussions/0/846966336363408466/which describes it. I will be going back to this game because I found it fun while I played it and now that I don't have to start over from the beginning each session, I will give it another go. With this information, I would recommend this game.I really like this game but the fact that you have to start from the beginning each playthrough bums me out and makes me not want to play it anymore. There is a reason Shovel Knight is so popular: it tickles the nostalgia bone while playing like a modern game. This game, while having some truly enjoyable moments, plays like an old NES cart where you have to start over each playthrough. I would recommend this game only if it was <$0.50, otherwise you would be best spending your money on a game that you will want to come back to.			"

												Every time you start this game it´s the ultimate viking vibe.You are the chosen warrior and every aspect of the game just feels hardcore. It´s perfect.Then you get to the first level and get beaten up like the little noob you are. You instantly know that it´s going to be tough and that you have to learn to get better. But since you are the most badass guy known to mankind, you will learn with every death. And every time you do, you will feel stronger and more powerful.Sidenote: If you get frustrated with the game, try to take a break. I usually play it for about 15 minutes and then switch to something else. I always like to start and end my gaming sessions with Völgarr, because then I have some time to think about it and get room to try out new things. The game wants you to learn and learning somtimes takes a little while.Edit: I can finally count myself amonst those who have beaten it. I enjoyed the Hell out of it and there is still more to go since Ending B and A don´t do themselves.			"

												Pros:- Difficult and challenging game (with very tight controls);- Addictive;- Good game design;- Good soundtrack;- Approximately 25 hrs of gameplay if you want to complete and beat all the achievements of the game;- Norse mythology references.Cons:- A LOT of patience because you will die MANY times before learning how to beat each world (but in the end, your efforts will be rewarded. You will be a badass viking!). :pRecommended for warriors who love a good challenge in a 2D universe! MAY ODIN BE WITH YOU!			"

												The obvious: Volgarr is challenging.The less obvious: it is so challenging that it will undoubtedly frustrate you repeatedly (no matter how good you think you are).Volgarr is a difficult game that feels very rewarding when you achieve progress. Defeating the first sector feels incredible, finishing off the first boss feels great, and even when the next levels seem daunting, slow but sure progress gets you to the end. Most people will give it up before the end, but even if you don't finish the game it is worth a shot.			"

Posted: June 11, 2014
												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: Man, Adult Swim Games sure have been publishing some pretty great titles. I think this one is top of the pile, though. The fact that this game doesn't have a Wikipedia page as of the time of writing is a great injustice to just how good this game is. In fact, a friend of mine named this game his Game of the Year for 2013. After playing through the game myself, I can certainly see why he'd say this. One phrase he used to describe this game is ""a 2D Dark Souls."" While the best phrase to describe this game is a ""newer Ghouls 'n' Ghosts game;"" in fact the studio's vision for this game, that can conjure up negative ideas about the game's design and how it handles difficulty. For now, just think of it as a 2D Dark Souls.After some retrospection, I found that my first playthrough of this game was auspiciously similar to my first playthrough of Dark Souls. In both games, I was never too sure of the control scheme at first, but once I got used to it (and in this case, stopped using the analog stick in favor of the D-Pad (no seriously, the D-Pad on any controller beats the analog stick for this game)), I found that the control scheme worked perfectly for the game. Combat, much like Dark Souls, is very accurate and weighty. Likewise, this game has some excellent hitboxes; in fact, sometimes a bit too excellent. That's not a criticism, though; just know that you can get beaned in the head with an arrow even if your shield is extended, since your shield doesn't cover your head.Another comparison to Dark Souls is the fact that this game does the most vital thing in a difficult video game (in my opinion), and that's signaling. You can do whatever you want to enhance the challenge of a level, as long as there's proper signaling. Again, the comparison between this and Dark Souls arises; both games were excellent at signaling, meaning that there were never any cheap deaths. Stages are surmountable without any memorization necessary, although if you're kinda dumb like me when it comes to video games, some memorization may be necessary. Plus, this game does that magical thing where you just get better at stages. That's a true sign of a well designed challenge level; where you can come back later on and find it easier without needing memorization. Overall, this game is a masterpiece in challenge level and level design.In fact, my only real gripe is how this game handles bosses. Each stage is broken up into two halves - much like Ghouls 'n' Ghosts - with a boss at the end of the second half. This is a thing that I've thought about for a while now, and I think it may just be an unfortunate necessity due to how the game handles health (you get bits of armor and weapon upgrades from chests throughout the level and lose them if you're hit; again, pretty much exactly like Ghouls 'n' Ghosts). Either that, or it may be a bit more rigid conformity to the Ghouls 'n' Ghosts design ethos. The bosses themselves are fairly easy and incredibly patternated, so once you get the pattern down, you should have no problems with the bosses. This may just be me injecting my personal design sensibilties, but I feel like the bosses could've been a lot better if there was a checkpoint beforehand (along with making the bosses harder overall, of course).Again, though; this isn't too big of an issue, but it is one that I thought could've been handled in a bit different (and in my opinion better, but you've figured that out already) manner. Nevertheless, I can definitely see why this was my friend's Game of the Year for 2013. While I can't necessarily make a statement about 2013 with regards to games, since I just started PC gaming in October 2013, if it had came out this year, it would most certainly be Game of the Year for 2014 for me. Yes, that means beating out Dark Souls II. 10/10.Story: Literally the only story you get is a credits scroll at the end. Not even gonna rate.Graphics: Man, there's some pretty great looking art in this game. The graphics feel like an ""HD Genesis/Mega Drive game,"" which once again fits perfectly with the Ghouls 'n' Ghosts inspiration. All of the enemy designs are great, there's detail practically oozing out of every pixel laid down, and it still looks great at 1080p. My only gripe with enemy designs are the bosses of level 2 and level 5. They're literally reskins of enemies in the area. All the other bosses are unique designs, but boss 2 and 5 are somewhat disappointing. That's not too big of a deal, though; the core enemy design is great anyways. Of course the game runs well, so there's no worry about not being able to run it. Even though it windows at a relatively low resolution, it fullscreens to match your resolution of choice without a hassle. 5/5.Sound: I've found that I like a lot of brass and percussion in my orchestration. This game... delivers a LOT of brass and percussion. This makes sense, of course; we're a viking, after all. We don't want a panflute chronicling our journey; no, we want big, bombastic horns, tubas, timpanis... the whole nine yards. Suffice to say, the music in this game is good. Really good. So good that I grabbed the OST literal minutes after I completed the game. There's no voiceacting in this game, so I don't really need to worry about that. I think it's pretty obvious that a 5/5 is in order for this game's sound department.Overall scores are 10/0/5/5; cumulative score of 10/10. Yeah, this is Game of the Year material. You should probably buy this game before a viking busts down your door and impales you with a flaming spear of awesomeness.			"

												Amazing game.  There isn't really much I can say about the gameplay mechanics, graphics, and sound design that hasn't already been said over and over, so I won't touch on those things.  I played this one through on both Steam, and on the Dreamcast.  The game is smoother on PC, but the DC port is totally playable.  If you do decide to play it on the Dreamcast, please buy it for one of the other platforms.  It's a really amazing game and the devs and publisher deserve to get paid for it.A common complaint I see is with this game's difficulty.  Personally, I think the difficulty of the gameplay is fair, but I wish there were a few more checkpoints.  Each stage is divided into two section, and each section has a checkpoint at the beginning.  You die, you restart at the beginning of the section.  And to make it worse, the boss for each stage is at the end of the second section.  If you die at the boss, you restart the whole section.   Maybe a checkpoint before a boss would be enough?  That would create a new issue though, since the player then wouldn't be able to fully upgrade their gear through the level after dying to a boss.  It'd have to be an optional checkpoint.  Whatever the case, I'm sure the devs are capable enough to figure out how to make that work.That is literally my only gripe with the Volgarr the Viking.  I've played it probably 12 hours on the Dreamcast on top of the time I have invested in the game on Steam.  I think it's a solid and fun game, and I love a challenge.  I'm currently working on completing the Valkyrie path, which is essentially a different version of each level with limited lives.  It's basically the hard mode for an already really hard game.  After that, I intend to speedrun it.  I totally got my $10 worth.			"

												If Ghouls and Ghosts and Actraiser had a baby, and they had a twisted uncle called Donkey Kong Country, then that's where Volgarr came from. A new game done in the style of old, it really is quite a gem. Simplistic as can be in terms of gameplay, though that is not to say that learning how to control Volgarr is not an obstacle with a nice skill ceiling. Some may consider his controls rather rigid, but if you learn how to use him, he's fluid and most importantly, much like Ghouls and Ghosts, very fair. Remember guys, sometimes you have to jump back a bit before you jump forward to get to where you want to go -- little ghouls and ghosts tip for those not used to this jumping system.From a level design perspective, I personally quite enjoy both paths of the game. However, I think overall the Valkyrie path has superior level design. The crystal path suffers a bit from too many enemies and not enough platforming, but, that may be your thing. Enemies are in and of themselves obstacles, but the game is at it's best when you have to manage both at the same time. So learn to Volgarr well and experience the bliss of the Valkyrie path.The soundtrack is pretty good, but not good enough to warrant listening to it beyond your 50th hour of playing -- though I think most won't play it that much, so you're fine!From a replayability perspective, the game doesn't offer much variety once you complete both paths. There are no alternative ways to play, so, once you've beat it, you can either stop there, or grit your teeth and become the best Volgarr player you can be. As a speedgame, Volgarr is simple, but very skillful and both a joy to play and to watch. It may not look particularly ""fast"", but, trust me, there's always time to save. So if speedrunning is your thing, by all means pick it up and grace the leaderboard -- please, I seriously wish more people ran this game.RISE WARRIOR!-- From a guy who has too many hours in this game, with only many more to come. (And, I should note, I have the GoG version of this game as well, so... there's more time devoted to this than just what steam wants to tell you.)			"

												Volgarr the Viking has its fun aspects but is at best a mediocre game that should still be classified as beta. While it tries to have a retro feel, it really doesn't. As one who played the old school games since Digger was the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I would say that I can recognise a old school feel of platform gaming. And let me just say, I LOVE platform games. But this doesn't feel at all like one of the classics. In general it feels like a lazy unthought through failed attempt.There are several major problems with the game. The first being the clumsy movements. Especially the jump movements are very badly made. It's quite easy to get into a position where you will need to jump to move on, but jumping in any direction will have a very high dead likeliness. There is simply a lack of fine manoeuvring witch make ""precision"" (and really, it didn't really have to be that precise) impossible. This has lead to many stupid deaths which didn't really reflect how hard the game is as much as it reflects a badly made game.But perhaps the most annoying thing is how often you have to start from the beginning. The game has very accurately been described as a ""trial and error"" game and it is highly unlikely that you will finish the game in the first few attempts. This would be okay if it didn't mean that you had to restart the game from the very beginning almost every time. Meaning that you waste enormous amounts of time replaying parts that are no longer fun and that you have cleared to perfection dozen of times, just to get to the part you haven't played before. This is even to the point that when you close the game, you have to restart from the beginning again. In the old school platform games there was actually save options, something that isn't here. And in the games where there weren't save options, there was often the option of putting in a code that would bring you to a certain point in the game (a code you got for completing a level).A game is supposed to be fun and I do think that parts of this game is fun. BUT it is in no way fun having to replay the same part for the million time! That is just stupid, a waste of time and a waste of money. So please, if you want a nice old school platform game, what about actually playing one of the old school games? Like Duke Nukem 1 and 2, Mario, Jazz Jackrabbit, Sonic, Realm of Terror, Pandemonium, Lost Vikings 1 and 2, Hocus Pocus or any of the other old classics. And have you already played al of these? Then there are many more, please comment if you want more suggestions :)But please, don't reward laziness, false marketing and bad gameplay with you money. That will just push them to make more of this crap instead of actually getting their act together and making that good game they probably could if they worker a bit more serious.PS: By the way, there was always a story in the old games. This is also lacking here and another sign of the laziness behind the game.PPS: The setting is stupid. Seriously? Vikings in the steaming jungle filled with lizardmen? You do know that Vikings lived in northern Europe, right? Where it's cold or tempered, not steaming jungle? Ice warriors, something along the coast or anything like that, see that would be using the Viking name properly, not insulting it to sell a bad game.PPS: As one who actually grew up with the old school games, I have to say that none of them ever had this bad graphics... Almost every single game here on steam that tries to recreate the looks of the old 80s and 90s games, actually ends up making their games look a lot worse and more clumsy.			"

												I enjoy challenging games, especially when they look as pretty as Volgarr. The only problem I have with challenging games in this instance is the very nature of the challenge: trial and error. This is by no means old school platforming, merely a modern take on platforming where fun is replaced with frustration and called a challenge. For an old school game, I have played it about as much as I need to in order to assess what I love and and hate about it.I love the graphics and the sound, which are top notch, old school throwbacks. The graphics are detailed and thoroughly eye-opening, especially when you're swinging around the fire sword. The sounds that compliment it are simple, catchy tunes with very little in the way of complexity, again allowing you into the world of Volgarr easily and without much trying. What I hate about this game is the absurd view the developers have of what makes a game challenging. Forcing a player back to the beginning of the level, then making them get back to where they died, travel an extra few feet and die to something else they couldn't possibly anticipate, is frankly insulting. I lost my cool with the first level because the enemies that spawned did so differently from death to death, making my learning of the level impossible. When I finally did get through a difficult wave of enemies and pratfalls, I was faced with an arrow trap that just shot me in the face without me even having time to move out of the way. I dislike games that do away with fun and Volgarr certainly did for me.For those of you who have the tolerance to sit through death after death, this is a game for you (especially for dark souls players), but if you enjoy a really good platformer, buy some of the mega drive classics and fusion games like risk of rain to get the best out of your money. Volgarr would have been superb if it was anything like the classics it was trying so hard to emulate. Ghouls and ghosts for the new generation? Absolutely no doubt...			"

												After only 3 hours of gameplay (and counting- I'm not throwing in the towel just yet), I've beaten Level 1 a few times, and I've quit two different ways:  clicking the X, and selecting the Quit Game option. Neither one saved my progress, so next time I'd go to play, I'd have to start at Level 1. What am I doing wrong here? I understand Volgarr is supposed to be difficult (which it is), but shouldn't I be able to see just HOW difficult it is by being able to get past the first 2 levels? I mean, how about some mid-level checkpoints? And how about a world map where I can pick and choose levels that I've already beaten (should that ever happen), and not some bland, ""follow the yellow brick road"" system.And what all cool upgrades for Volgarr lie beyond Level 2? I looked it up. Additional weapons? Nope. More armor? Nope. Wielding the Fire Sword for more than 5 seconds before getting hit and losing it? Hopefully. Furthermore, why does getting hit while wielding said Fire Sword also cause me to also lose my helmet? That's TWO pieces of equipment lost from ONE hit! The upgrade/armor/health system reflects that of Super Mario Bros., but Volgarr's first two levels aren't nearly supplied with as many treasure chests (where upgrades are found) as Mario's first two levels were with question mark blocks, and some of Mario's blocks had stars.Also, when you slaughter enemies they will sometimes drop treasure, which is used for leaderboards. That's cool, but I find it hard to focus on killing every single Lizardman, hoping they drop treasure, just to top the leaderboards when I'm trying to survive until the next treasure chest. Perhaps with all this treasure to collect, a Sonic-type health system would've made sense.However, the controls are simple, the graphics are nice and accurately reflect the retro aethestic of its SNES counterparts, and the triumphant battle themes remind me of the good old days of splurging quarters on Gauntlet Legends.I REALLY wanted to like this game, and [adult swim] is an entertainment brand I trust. The trailers make Volgarr look like a fun challenge, not a frustrating chore. Until some issues are addressed, I cannot fully recommend this game.TL;DR:  Gee, I can't wait to get to Level 3.			"

												The gameplay and mechanics seem fine, but the problem comes from the level design. The game becomes difficult not due to actual challenge, but due to level flow. Enemies are as close to a ""bullet hell"" game as a ""mostly"" ground-pounder game can be, but when you have to stop the flow of action to line up a jump properly due to poor level design it's very immersion breaking. Overlooking that, it strives for ""Nintendo Hard"" but is more a systematic issue with the stilted nature of the control scheme that provides the real challenge. Whereas the enemies themselves are reasonably predictable, and it's usually the inability to respond that kills you and not the challenge presented by the enemies. With an improvement in the controls and a smoother level design, it could be great, but having recently played many other platfomers, the sluggish combat animations and stuttering jumping sequences really stick out in an otherwise ""nostalgic"" platformer.

												This game defines artificial difficulty.It's undoubtedly gorgeous and makes the player feel bad@$$ when they pull off the right moves, but it's absolutely infuriating at the same time. You keep dying at the same places making the same mistakes, which makes you want to snap your monitor in half. You'd have to play this game to feel it, really; you can find upgrades to make Volgarr take more hits before he dies, but it ends at 3 or 4, and you're just as fragile as your enemies.Yes, I know it's supposed to be difficult, but it fails at that. It's simply cheap. You have to know exactly where to stand in particular situations, where to throw your spears to make platforms for Volgarr, from where you need to start a jump so as not to overshoot it... The challenge is far ahead of fun in this case, I'd say.Yes, I did play my share of properly tough games, too.The only game more unfair than this I can think of is Magicka.			"

												This is indeed a beautiful game. Graphics are great, animations too. The music and ambience are both good too.Then, why I do not recommend this game?Because of it's gameplay. And not because it's difficult, that's not the point. The problem here is the ""fake"" difficulty. The ONLY reason to play this game for more than 30 mins it's not the story (there is none), it's not the graphics or the music: it's the gameplay. But it lacks any depth, it's about memorizing patterns, dying and repeating over and over until you get things right. It's not difficult because the game has good AI, or because enemies are unpredictable. It's difficult because we're not used to this kind of games, and after dying 20 times and reaching the second checkpoint full geared you realize that it's not challenging, it's boring, plain and simple.If you like to memorize patterns and play for hours without really any kind of motivation except to complete a game so you can tell your friends ""hey, u know what? I finished volgarr the viking, i'm such a pro player"", then this game is for you.If you're looking for a game with a story, with good IA, or with a real challenge that goes beyond dying and repeating the same thing over and over, then this is not for you.

												If you are on your way to Valhalla... be sure you have earned your place there.Volgarr the Viking is a game that seems to have done everything wrong. The checkpoint system - or its near absence - makes you go back to the beggining of the stage each time you die. The challenge lies mostly in fixed patterns, so running the same section over and over to master it is necessary. Air control seems lacking, making even the easiest jumps a potential death trap.  Moreover, the game is short - only 7 levels, if you count in the one awarded to a player beating the hardmode. So many flaws in one game. You know what? It creates a perfect sidescrolling action game.Volgarr gives you a challenge to beat the game, and does not care if it's too hard for you. Every time you die near the end of a section knowing that you have to spend next 10 minutes redoing the stage, the game gives you a choice of just quitting it. And you don't, because it has just made it personal. Every time you die to a boss you feel like you should give up - but Volgarr motivates you to just try harder and do better next time. And when you finally beat the stage - I've never played a game that gave me so much satisfaction after that. The game is never unfair. You have a level to complete, that's all. All you can do is to master the controls of the viking and learn the weaknesses of you enemies.The graphics are great. Volgarr looks like a real badass viking, equipping more and more awesome armor and weapons at every step. The effects of his flame sword attacks are just glorious. The audio is stunning, providing you with top-class effects during combat and amazing sounds congratulating you on completing the challenges. Also, this is the only title with credit screen so good that I don't even think about skipping it at the end of the game. I won't spoil the fun, experience it for yourself.If you seek for a nice, fair challenge, get Volgarr. If you are an old-time gamer of NES era and want to relive some of the spirit of Castlevania and Ninja Gaiten, get Volgarr. If you are tired of games that hold your hand at every second, get Volgarr. If you want to play a great game, get Volgarr.And good luck.			"

												If you are on your way to Valhalla... be sure you have earned your place there.Volgarr the Viking is a game that seems to have done everything wrong. The checkpoint system - or its near absence - makes you go back to the beggining of the stage each time you die. The challenge lies mostly in fixed patterns, so running the same section over and over to master it is necessary. Air control seems lacking, making even the easiest jumps a potential death trap.  Moreover, the game is short - only 7 levels, if you count in the one awarded to a player beating the hardmode. So many flaws in one game. You know what? It creates a perfect sidescrolling action game.Volgarr gives you a challenge to beat the game, and does not care if it's too hard for you. Every time you die near the end of a section knowing that you have to spend next 10 minutes redoing the stage, the game gives you a choice of just quitting it. And you don't, because it has just made it personal. Every time you die to a boss you feel like you should give up - but Volgarr motivates you to just try harder and do better next time. And when you finally beat the stage - I've never played a game that gave me so much satisfaction after that. The game is never unfair. You have a level to complete, that's all. All you can do is to master the controls of the viking and learn the weaknesses of you enemies.The graphics are great. Volgarr looks like a real badass viking, equipping more and more awesome armor and weapons at every step. The effects of his flame sword attacks are just glorious. The audio is stunning, providing you with top-class effects during combat and amazing sounds congratulating you on completing the challenges. Also, this is the only title with credit screen so good that I don't even think about skipping it at the end of the game. I won't spoil the fun, experience it for yourself.If you seek for a nice, fair challenge, get Volgarr. If you are an old-time gamer of NES era and want to relive some of the spirit of Castlevania and Ninja Gaiten, get Volgarr. If you are tired of games that hold your hand at every second, get Volgarr. If you want to play a great game, get Volgarr.And good luck.			"

												Before reading the below review proper. If you would like a short and blunt summary of what this game is see the following video I did in my series for the final boss. This is the essence of the game once you strip away the fake difficulty, purposefully reimplemented arcade bugs and checkpoint starvation.


YouTube™ Video: Volgarr the Viking #4 | OH MAN THIS FINAL BOSS WAS A DOOZY 

			Views: 51		

			This wasn't a challenging game (as demonstrated by that boss fight). It was tedious. Taking the worst growing pain attributes from arcades along with the quarter poaching techniques and bugs isn't...		

If you really want more than that here is the playlist for the series. Now without further ado here is the original review. My final impressions have not changed after completing the game.You know. I had almost forgotten why I never really had any nostalgic feelings towards arcade games that inspired this one. What with their stiff controls, sparse checkpoints/continues for more efficient padding and quarter poaching, edge of screen spawning of enemies and other such fake difficulty. It's always nice to have a game come along and remind me. Funny thing is, the edge of screen spawning was actually technically justified at the time due to memory/sprite constraints and the state keeping issues that entailed. Now? Not so much.If you want a real game that takes the pleasing challenge of arcades but doesn't rely on ""but teh retro"" as an excuse for its shortcomings check out something like They Bleed Pixels. That said though, be sure you look at the manual for this. They did a really great job on it making it look like how manuals used to look back when they were interesting and filled with lore (Zelda's manual being the most famous for example).Oh and to answer the question a lot of people may have about this. No. There is no pre-boss checkpoints. You die and you have to do the whole level again. This isn't challenging, it's padding. Bad padding at that.Anyway, I noticed that the mouthbreather brigade was telling people that they didn't like it because it was challenging and they couldn't win (as well as calling people ""kid"" when their argument is called out, proving yet again that they're mostly kids themselves that don't have the slightest clue what these games were about and yet put on a facade of nostalgia), I decided to finish the first world (update: make that the entire game). I'm kind of glad too because it gave me more ammo in the form of this nonsense.I remember those games too. But you're  deluded if you think that you have the same ability to give these ultimatums that lazy companies who didn't want to do battery backups did in the 80s and 90s. Once again, this isn't challenging or a homage. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between features and technical workarounds.			"

												A very polished platformer that feels somewhat like a cross between Ghosts 'n' Goblins and Castlevania. This game legitimately possesses that 16-bit feel, and is a lot more oldschool than most modern ""retro""-style games I've played. Extremely challenging, but fun and highly recommended to platforming fans.			"

												Really good looking game and the classic feel and harsh death is something not used enough in games today.Unfortunately the jumping is buggy. Whenever you get near the ""top"" of a level and try to jump, occasionly it will or will not work - causing you to die and you get the harsh penalty for a bug. It's made it impossible for me to progress as I often die at this same, otherwise very easy, part of the level.Ruins the whole experience for me.			"

												This game needs an extra difficulty option that adds in more checkpoints. My problem is not that it is hard but that most of the time I spent playing it I am redoing parts of the game I have already figured out. The repetition kills this game. If they even doubled the number of checkpoints I would play through it. This game does not need as many checkpoints as Shovel Knight, but it does need to cut down on the repetition. This is left over game design from the old hardcore side scrollers and it made the games take longer to finish. Challenge was what made those games good, bad check points do not add anything.Fun game but I can't recomend it.			"

												Hard does not even begin to do this game justice.  Volgarr could give ghosts and goblins a run for its money...yet, for all that, it is still enjoyable.  It's a frustrating, difficult action platformer, with sometimes annoying deaths that could have been avoided with a little foresight, but overall, quite enjoyable.  It does have different endings and a different final level if players are good enough to earn them and is really quite fun in an arcadey way.

												Volgarr is two different games in one.Played normally, Volgarr feels like a clunky frustration platformer harking back to the old days of Ghouls n Ghosts. Volgarr himself plods along at a decent speed, but is flatly underequipped for most of what the game throws at him. The challenges are simple but Volgarr is simpler. You plod along, hopping about, dying a lot, learning the levels, and generally barely avoiding boredom because nothing in this game is done especially well.Until...You find the second game. As you repeat the levels over and over, you start to get a feel for what needs to be done. You'll brush up against that second game a few times before you finally realize what's going on. The levels are actually meticulously designed. If you move quickly, throw spears at the right times, and generally play the game as if you're speedrunning, the levels will come together. Every single stupid thing in the game becomes easily surmountable when you deal with it the second it comes on the screen. Enemies will line up perfectly to be killed with one spear, platforming will go by as quick as Volgarr's lumbering gait takes him...This is the true Volgarr the Viking. It's not a platformer in the classic since, it's a trial and error speedrunner without the speed. Almost like a rhythm game at times only you can really only find out what the notes are and when by blindly stumbling over them and restarting anew. Since the game's final level can really only be unlocked by beating each level without getting hit and with finding the secret macguffin in each level, this really is what they intended for the game.It's meticulously designed to foster perfect play while doing next to nothing to teach perfect play. Hell, the game barely teaches you the core mechanics except in one of those passive tutorials that people who watched that one MMX1 video are so fond of.The problem is... it still doesn't make the game all that good. Any imperfect run just falls back into that first, really boring game (Only now with the knowledge that you are screwed out of anything satisfying knowing what you missed.), and high-end Volgarr play just does not satisfy enough to be worth the trial and error grinding to perfect each level.

												I wish the ""recommend this game"" wasn't as simple as a yes or no. Because I'm on the maybe fence. I suppose if I keep it simple. Is it a good game? Yeah I enjoy it. It's fun to play.However there is a huge, huge flaw in this game which is probably why I will stop playing it. It's too f@cking hard. Don't get me wrong, I love a challenge. But this game basically starts to suck the fun out of gaming.Diffiulty levels? Nope. Just 1... Okay I can live with that. But the two unforgivable features with this game is how every time you die, you have to go all the way back to the bigging of the level. I have since learned that while it might not appear this way, there are actually checkpoints. You just have to beat the boss for each level to essentially save your spot the next time you play.I don't want this review to seem overly negative because I do like the game. I just think it could have been even better. For the price? yeah give it a go. Just be prepaired.			"

												Volgarr the Viking is a 2D old school side scroller - you're in for a chalenge and you'll love it. The graphics are old school but nevertheless good for what the game is, gameplay is old school awesome - you atack and you jump and double jump, and less but not least you have a throwing spear atack. You gain equipment as you progress but tread carefuly, if you're hit you will lose one piece of it until you die. If you fall into lava or a bottomless pit your old school insta killed. Music is very good at times and fits well into the world.Achievments and diferent endings provide replayability.You're in for an adventure.			"

												Jump controls: garbageEverything else: excellentI have zero tolerance for the jump controls in this game, so I'm sending it to the graveyard, but I could potentially recommend it for its good points to anyone else who can handle the terrible jumping.--If you don't press a direction at the same time you press the jump button, you will only jump vertically instead of in the direction you are trying to go. This is made worse by the fact that, once your feet leave the ground, you have no control over your character in the air and just have to wait for them to fall wherever the trajectory takes them. This double strike gets very annoying, as the game demands quick reflexes and precision in both platforming and combat.Basically they are going for an old school Ghouls n' Ghosts type thing, but even as a person who grew up on those systems, I can't claim to have much nostalgia for the bad aspects of those games. I mean, I enjoyed Ghouls n' Ghosts and still do, but that game doesn't demand precision out of you right away, does not require you to rote memorize the layout of the level, and has waaaaay more checkpoints.I don't want to give it a thumbs down, because I realize the controls are kind of an homage, and everything else about the game is quite good, but damn. I just hate the platforming.			"

												I was really disappointed by this game. At first, I really liked the graphical pixel design as well as the soundtrack, mainly because it's very minimalistic but does not feel like some 8 Bit peeptone concert. Plus it is a game about a Viking, which I personally really enjoy hence there are not many Viking-themed games out there.BUT! The game is not just horrendously hard, it's unfair. Where games like Dark Souls give you enough time to explore and try some moves etc. here you have almost constantly enemies spawning from everywhere and you cannot see them because you range of view is quite small, therefore you often cannot react fast enough. Addicionally the feeling of the jumping mechanic is really outdated for a 2D sidescroller, meaning once you jumped you cannot change your direction exept you do a double jump. But even jumping onto a little block in your way will be pretty difficult because you jump to far. It's supposed to be like this because it used to be this way in the classical 2D sidescrolling era. But it doesn't make it automaticly a good thing. For me it just feels clunky, difficult to control and overall outdated. The problem with the difficulty is that you simply have to memorize where and when enemys spawn and when to jump. When I want to play a game, difficult or not, I do NOT want to memorize everything! I just want the opporturnity to play through with my skill, not because I know that I have to jump in 3,4 seconds. Too bad this game equals difficult with unfairness, at least in my opinion. I get it, there are many gamers who want an expierience like in the classic 80's NES-era platformers, but in my opinion this just doesn't fit today as it did back in the day. Retro gaming in general can be very good and a lot of fun but memorizing whole levels is just a sign for bad leveldesign. It always has at least to be possible to play the game through all by your skill. Due to the design choices overall the game feels kinda dated.Hence this game really doesn't cost much I still recommend to try it out for yourself and probably you will like it better than me.			"

												TLDR: Only play if you like dying and repeating the same rooms for hours.I have tried several set ups, keyboard and controllers (steam and xbox) but to no avail. This game is just batshit insane hard and I can't get past the second crystal in nearly 2 hours. I am all for old school fun and challenge but this went too far. I am sure some folks have a lot of fun with it, but I am not this much of a glutten for punishment.I grew up playing mario and duckhunt, so hard isn't outside of my scope. This is just ridiculous and isn't so much a game of skill as it is just enemy position memory and level layout. The character is clunky too, megaman is smooth as silk, volgarr moves like a 2d resident evil character.Apparently the community dislikes my opinion of this game. Maybe people take my review personally, I don''t know. I simply feel the game isn't fun because it really is hard for the sake of being hard.			"

												Game is cool. But the only reason its really difficult is because the controls are not tight. Jumping is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in some ereas cause you cant control your jumps.  Enemies come out in swarms. They dont stop. If you stand still the enemies will just continue to come at you. Literally you could stand there for hours and 1000's would march towards you.  Thats another thing that makes it difficult is the endless spawns. You cant really clear an erea so you can do proper jumps. So you basically end up dyiing at some point. Most of the times it was bad mechanics that got me killed. Im used to these kind of games. I grew up in 16bit mode. Make the controls and jumping a tad more fluid and it woulkd be great.			"

												Here's the thing with the golden age of arcade gaming... you could put a coin in to continue in games like Double Dragon, Golen Axe, Conbatribes, Ninja Combat, Bad Dudes, Contra, Final Fight, and Sengoku...  The only platform combat title I remember being so unforgiving as to send players back to the beginning was Shinobi, and nobody played that game in the arcade when they could just play it at home on their new sega system.  This should have a free-play or coin-op mode if it wants to style itself as an arcade game.  Everything in the game seemed to be an exercise in rote learning, which is the sort of thing that I only really enjoy when practicing a musical instrument.   I got my trading cards, and now I'm unstalling.			"

												If you want a good challenge them I would recommend this game. Otherwise you're probably going to play for about an hour and then give up on it. I just feel like a game should be more rewarding than this. At least Ghosts N Goblins had cool spells you could unleash when you manage to grab a full set of powerups. Volgarr only manages to give you a triple damage spear with the first power up, and the final power up? A double damage sword. Not sure why the sword would end up being weaker than a powered up spear, but alright. Another mechanic that's frustrating is the inclusion of all these nice golden items, gems, etc.. But, Sonic the Hedgehog fashion, you lose about 75% of your treasure when you die. I have no idea if you can use your gold to urchase upgrades between levels, but I very much doubt it. It just seems like a pointless and not-very-rewarding mechanic to me. Another point of confusion is the checkpoints. On the first level you're given one after a very easy area. Then you're given one halfway through the level. You want one before the boss? Nah. Forget about it. There is, of course, a door that closes before you reach the boss. This seems like a mechanic borrowed from the Mega Man series, but makes no sense to have it here without a boss checkpoint. It would have made more sense if extra lives were involved, but instead you have unlimited continues and VERY few checkpoints. I would have preferred an Extra Lives system, having to restart an entire level when you run out of them, and more checkpoints. It's not all bad though. The combat mechanics and the art style (aside from a few out-of-place goofy looking enemies, like the smiley 'Joker' snakes in Level 1)  are both mostly very cool. It's too bad most players won't get to see all the art the game has to offer.			"

												Yes, this game is in fact difficult and I am sitting here admitting I quit. I wimped out and quit. But, I am one of those that feels it is ""cheaply"" or ""artificially"" difficult rather than a fun challenge of any sort. What ever helps me sleep at night I suppose! I am a glutton for punishment and enjoy a challenge but this wasn't a game that I felt compelled to put in the 100th attempt of a level unlike other games. This game is pure memorization with no forgiveness whatsoever. Perfection or bust. Each hit you take has a devastating affect on your chances of completing a level to the point you may as well reset rather than push on. And with fairly clunky and stiffffff controls this is a recipe for a nightmare. In particular I will whine about the jump mechanics. Sure its subjective but I, personally, found the jump control atrocious. I suppose I should say LACK of jump control. You jump straight up and down or a predetermined distance. Timing the double jump adds a hint of control but not enough, for me. This is just one small factor in the overall issue; it's a grinding unforgiving challenge. Which isolated, is fine. But it just plain isn't a fun game during your punishment. I can enjoy a game that endlessly punishes you and makes you try something over and over. But I can't enjoy that beating if it isn't smooth and fun in the meantime. Put a little sugar on my beating.I forced myself to put in an effort for over an hour because of ego or some other stupid personality defect. But honestly the writing was on the wall five minutes in. I knew this game just wasn't for me and still knew that another punishing hour later. Looks and sounds neat at least. So that's something? I polished off my experience with the game by watching a speedrun and feeling shame about my gaming abilities. With a gruff ""I'm too old for this shh"" I uninstalled it forever. I'd suggest considering spending money elsewhere.A full congratulations to those who enjoy this game and the very very few that actually conquered it.			"

												An alright ""retro styled"" platformer; but a very poor imitation of an arcade classic.I'll put it this way: RASTAN, a coin guzzling monster of an arcade machine made in 1987, a game which this one desperately wants to copy, is far more forgiving, fair and balanced than Volgarr. The absurdity of that staggers me. I cannot think of a worse example of nonsensically exaggerated ""Nintendo Hard"" difficulty - a recent idea which is purely the product of people's dim memory of the past and laziness.You can't blame this game's poor design choices on anything but the creators' inability to recognize and recreate the good aspects of something they sought to imitate. It's not ""oldschool"" to have ridiculously long stretches between checkpoints or rely on poor placement of annoying enemies to challenge the player, it's just plain bad. Try harder next time, guys.On the positive side, the graphics and animation are fairly pleasing (if inconsistent) and combat is generally satisfying. I honestly want to praise this game just for aspiring to be like Rastan (which was long overdue for a proper tribute); but the more I play it, the more it infuriates me. Just get one of the many excellent Taito arcade collections instead.			"

												Volgarr the Viking aims to be an old-school tough-as-nails platformer. Volgarr is a fellow that looks more like a norse barbarian than a viking to me, his jumps are stiff and you're so badass that enemies take 1-3 hits (bosses not included) to kill. These said monsters keep coming up all the time so you better move since they won't run dry. The gameplay reminds a bit of old NES game Trojan in a not so positive way (oh the slow walking, oh the stifness of my actions).You can hit, jump, point your sword downwards while jumping, do a sort of a double-jump by slashing in mid-air and throw a javelin that also works as a platform for you. You can't change direction or control the jumping much so better not spam it too much.Then the straight-up bs part: Volgarr attempts to  be hard. Real hard. IT sure is difficult but the difficulty comes from mistakes you make over and over again while playing the same part until you get it right and move to next nasty room. This TOO is usual, nothing too bad. BUT. Everytime I died I felt that ""was that something I should've guessed?"" or ""if the controls were any better this could be easily done"". Both of these could be dismissed as a bad player ranting but I've done my share of hard platformers like Ninja Gaiden, Battletoads, 100% completed Meat Boy and went through Spelunky without serious problems to name a few.Worst part is that the gameplay feels so clunky that I don't want to get accustomed to it. Good parts: -Window closes quite fast when quitting the game.			"

												OK well this game was not that hard, I am used to playing hard games, and this was not hard at all... I love retro games and I love a chalenge i.e I love Ghouls 'n' Ghosts... Ghouls 'n' Ghosts this is not. Volgarr opens and its so freaking epic, then you try and jump and realise the controles are broken and stiff You cannot steer yourself in the air as you can in a mario or metroidvania games for instance, the game is not hard just unfair with cheap deaths, crappy controle and slow as a snail movement.However everything ellse is excelent, animations are awesome, music is cool, and the art style is rich with detail. I hate to give negative reviews, but I will not blow smoke up this games cheap broken♥♥♥♥♥  I could have lived with no continues or save feature or password screen, that is 100% cool... even the cheap deaths also cool, but when your freaking hero cannot jump properly and the reason I died 97 times in a row is because of the jumping mechanic is broken, well that calls for a thumbs down. No excuses for this, the only reason this game is hard is because of that stupid freaking jump, and I refuse to re-learn how to jump in a game because the devs thought it was funny. This could have been such an awesome game, it's a shame a real shame... However if you are looking for something to make you pull out your nose hairs then this might be for you.			"

												This game captures the amazing nostaligic feeling of feeling absolutely crushed. If you are a very masochistic person who enjoys being repeatedly violated over and over again, I could not recommend this game enough. Volgar the Viking will make you question your life decisions. The control is tight, the level design is compact and intuitive, the enemy design and placement is creative, and Volgar's abilites are interesing and unique. However, a specific mechanic in this game can be either very fun for you or make you want to just uninstall this game and never look back. The fact that you will have to die so many times to learn patterns of enemies, where the pitfals are, how to defeat a certain part. It is an exercise in trial and error. That maybe what you want. But if you are looking at this game as a 'small little challange' then be forwarned, ""abandon all hope ye who enter here"".			"

												This game really seemed like it was designed by a person who wanted to enjoy it only himself. -Very difficult from the very beggining. Unforgiving and unrewarding. Really poor in both story and game design. -With a badass viking as the main character, the ambience could have been better, so the enemies and the combat effects.-No possibility to save your progress, and most of the time in order to know how to go thru an area, you have to know it previously, that means you have to die first, do all the level again up to that point and then continue.-You feel like you are struggling against the game, not the enemies, the enemies are quite simple in mechanics.I will never bother to finish this. I actually uninstalled it quite a while ago but im not as mad because it cost me almost nothing. But, anything you pay for this game is actually a rip-off.DONT BUY.			"

Pixel art is decent, but not memorable. Animations feels low key despite being  generous in frames shown. The Viking controls are aimed to make him feel 'heavy', not agile: a respectable but extremely risky design choice - resulting movements are far too clunky ad frustrating to be enjoyable. All in all, a low-to-average game which has in difficulty its only notable point.			"

												Have you played a game recently and thought to yourself ""I don't know why this game has checkpoints or allows you to even save at all!!! I think you should have to start from the beginning everytime you play! This game is for BABIES!!"" If you have then Volgarr is the game for you. It's a good game that's very hard and is fun (sort of for a sitting or two). The controls are a little on the stiff side. You cant steer yourself in the air as you can in a mario game for instance. This game seems to be trying very hard to make itself the new Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts. It succeeds on that front for better or worse.See the game has checkpoints technically speaking. They cut the level in half into about 10 minute sections. That's not much of a checkpoint. What you do in effect is play the earlier parts of the game to absolute perfect in order to get another chance at something you might be struggling with. Is that hard? Yes it's absolutely hard to spend 10 mins doing things you are flawless at to have another go at the boss. Is it good game design? Uh... well....No (real) checkpoints, No saves, not even an old time password system for nostalgia. Brutal difficulty that requires and insists upon repetition, perfection, and memorization. Old school hard that makes a man out of ya or antiquated game design that is not a part of most modern games for a reason? You decide. I already have.One last thing. If you like this game and it's your jam then that's cool and good. It's good at what it does. You should check out Rastan. It's very very similar and I think it might be better so check it out if you like this game.			"

												Controls are similar to Super Ghouls And Ghosts but more responsive. It has a good feeling of nostalgia from the old games and a good soundtrack.The bad thing is that its too much trial and error based, since there are traps / sequences that you won't be able to react for the first time (yes, no matter how good you are). That alone could still be ok, but the game has no checkpoints in the middle of each stage, so if you die at the boss cuz you haven't seen all of his patterns / sequences yet, you have to start from the beggining of the stage all over again and gets a bit boring to do that just to learn a few more patterns and repeat.If the game is on sale and you have some time to spare, give it a try. Otherwise, i dont think its worth it.			"

												Similar to Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition. Game is hard but never not fair. You just play and learn patterns, enemies movements and they attacks.This game reminded me old school Sega Genesis games: 2D, side scroller, moving from left ot right, some secrets, no saves and checkpoint only and each map start. So if you die at boss you'll have to start over the whole level.Almost forgot... You have infinite lives on ""normal mode"" (although if you die you loose some gold which is just a score in this game). However if you try to go for hard mode (before entering a new level go to it through Valkyrie statue) you have limited lives which you can collect when u have full gear (shield, helmet, flame sword) from the chests. Loose all your lives and you get teleported to ""normal mode"". If you die on last 7th level (Yggdrasil) with your last live then it's game over... Not game over but Ending B.. Which for me is still game over...			"

												I wanted to begin this by setting the stage- you will die. You will die a lot. You will die so much, that this stage I'm setting is actually made of the corpses of the many failed attempts you will have playing this game.Volgarr is the only Viking I know that dies to a bee stinging him simply because he doesn't have a shield. On that same note, he's also the only Viking I know but that's irrelivent...The game is made to be hard. You get gear through the game that act as ""hit points"" for you, where if you get hit you'll lose your shield or your helm. If you lose it all Volgarr will explore into meat giblets if a stiff breeze kicks up. HOWEVER. There is a great deal of satisfaction to actually beating the game and beleive me when I say I memorized the entire first level before I was able to get the boss in one sitting...Keep in mind, this game has checkpoints but they don't save.

And let's not forget one of the most epic soundtracks I have ever heard. Perfect for fans of Conan The Barbarian, and that old fasioned hard core difficulty of the 90s.This game will put hair on your chest! The level design might look bland from a distance, but when you're in the thick of it, it's perfectly designed around all of Vulgarr's moveset. It'll test your metal with obstacles that require perfect timing of double jumping, quick thinking to get out and around traps, and sword play against enemies that are all completely unique from one another.And, depending on your level of skill, there are 3 different endings to find. If you can't handle playing the game in one sitting, you can skip ahead to levels you played, before you actually take on the final boss to get ending C. For ending B, once you've had some practice, take on the game for real and play all the way to the end. For ending A, you're going to have to pump up and get some hidden collectables that'll act like lives to play through a completely alternate path. So there is a lot of replayability with this amazing game, that you should definitly start playing right now!			"

												I really wanted to like Volgarr.  It has amazing graphics and sound, and even has some tight gameplay.  However, respawning enemies unnecessarily pad the difficulty, and make it un-fun.Some may like respawning enemies, hearkening back to old Arcade and NES games, but for me, this has always been lazy programming.  A tired trope that wasn't fun back in the day and is even less fun now.			"

												I played quite a bit of this, so I feel I should leave a review. I believe that there is a very fine line between challenge and tedium. Personally, this game leans a bit too far into the tedium arena. Checkpoints are few and far between, and the enemies and bosses are unforgiving. Your survival depends on your ability to spam the level until you learn what obstacles lie ahead and know how to overcome them. It's all about prediction.Basically, if you like doing the same levels over and over and over and over and over and over and over until you learn them inside-and-out, this game is for you. If you do not, you will find this game to be the definition of tedium and you will simply not like this game. It was built with the hardcore challenge audience in mind. If you do not consider yourself a member of this audience, do not buy this game because it caters perfectly to them.Other than that, I feel there are a few areas that just felt cheap. "

												It's a pretty good game, but it's darn hard and the controls are not smooth enough for me. It was made to replicate some of the bone breakingly difficult NES games and I must say, it definitely is. It's so hard in fact that I refunded it because I just don't have the patience for it. I just laugh at people who thinks dark souls is the hardest game of all time. It's because they haven't played NES and NES styled games before.

CASUAL GAMERS NEED NOT APPLYIf you like being kicked in the balls playing a really difficult game (and we're talking Super Ghouls & Ghosts difficult), then this is the game for you!No health bar, cumbersome control, lots of cheap hits, and enemies that can move faster than your character are the name of the game here. It is brutally difficult, and I have to say that it isn't to the game's credit. Retro gamers will be reminded of the game Rastan, in that in both games you control a barbarian-type character who attacks with a sword while (mostly) walking to the right. But whereas Rastan is a game that you can learn from, Volgarr the Viking isn't. This is mostly due to the fact that when you die, you go back to the last checkpoint, and checkpoints in this game are few and far between. Your character starts with a sword for his main attack, a spear for distance attacks and for climbing up walls, and a shield for defense, which can deflect some projectiles and that you lose after taking a single hit. If you're lucky, you can find a treasure chest that will first upgrade your shield (I have no idea what this does because you lose the upgraded shield after one hit -- it doesn't go back to the normal shield, mind you, it just goes away like the regular shield), then upgrade you to a helmet (that will take an additional hit, bringing your hit points up to two, after which you die), and a flaming sword that I presume increases your attacks (I don't know because I lost the flaming sword every single time after I got it on single-hit enemies).The graphics are pleasant to look at in a 90s arcade sort of way, and the sound is certainly up to par with titles in that vein, but that's about all I can say in its favor.Now, I'm occasionally up for a side-scrolling platforming challenge: I've beaten Super The Empire Strikes Back on the SNES, every version of Bionic Commando on every system it was ever made for, Strider on the Sega Genesis and quite a few of the NES Mega Man games. Maybe it's my old age setting in, or maybe I'm just tired of developer B.S., but I'm really starting the hate the kind of cheap, artificial challenge some of these modern platformers are offering by making the game so unforgiving. I've played the game for about two hours, and I've only ever gotten to the second checkpoint (not even the end of the first stage, if there are more stages). Oh yeah, and you have to start the game from the beginning every single time you quit the game and restart, so you'd better get good at those first few areas. I was really looking forward to this game and now I'm just angry that I've purchased it.If masochism and self-mutilation are your thing, then by all means: Go for it! Anyone who just wants to play a fun, challenging platform game can spend their money on Spelunky, Shovel Knight, Axiom Verge, or any of the dozens of other titles on Steam that are more rewarding, more forgiving, and certainly more fun.

The same strategy will win everytime, it's just a battle to learn and memorize all those steps.The music was ho hum...The art was pretty good...The controls are what they should be...No you can't pet me...Uhm, what else?It has secrets... it has levels... it has weapons... it has combat... it is a game... please buy game...Unless you hate ghost n goblin games, or hard games in generall... then you need to steer VEEEEEEEEERY FAR from this title.

												7/10 rating by me. The game is good but its kinda repetitive because saves only apply to RAM . This means you have to play the game from the beginning every time you close this game. Whether it saves to the hardrive when you beat a world I have no Idea because I never have enough time to beat the first world because you constantly have to replay the level because of its difficulty. I can see myself giving up on this game because I'm guessing once I beat the first level the difficulty gets harder.			"

												I found nothing fun in the scarce checkpoint system and the horde of ever-spwaning enemies that rush at you from all sides as you're supposed to progress. It took the joy out of the combat and the platforming entirely. What I'll give the game credit for is the soundtrack and the visual style, which both nail it.It seems I'm in the minority with my opinion, so perhaps ""Volgarr the Viking"" isn't such a bad game, but it's simply not for me.

												Good looking game with fiting music and theme.  I can forgive the difficulty (it is very very hard,) but I can't help but feel the difficulty is partially due to the 'authentic' I.E bad controlls.  Most frustrating is the jumping.  Standing next to a wall and being unable to jump over it makes many situations unfairly frustrating.I enjoy the game, but only in 5-10 min sittings before the awful jumping pisses me off and I have to quit.

												If you're looking for oldschool gaming this title will not let you down. Solid controls, solid mechanics and gameplay, no BS and a great atmosphere will scratch that itch for a good challenge-reward experience. I can think of very little to say in detriment to this title, the best of which maybe a lack of checkpoints and a fairly unintuitive savepoint system (you go left, as indicated by a hint but go figure, it took a while to get how this feature worked properly). Overall this is not a timesink game. I certainly could be if you're into speedruns as it offers the necessary mechanics but aside from that it's a game that you gradually learn and progress through pretty much all based on player skill. Highly reccommended!			"

												Pretty damn goodControls are very tight. The game is pretty hard too.There is a very specific amount of things that you can do in this game as far as control and movement goes, but despite that, you have all the tools you need. What I'm trying to say is that it plays like a good NES game.It actually felt like it was my fault when I died and the gameplay was Satisfying. I reccomend this if you have some money left and it's on sale. "

												If you're looking for oldschool gaming this title will not let you down. Solid controls, solid mechanics and gameplay, no BS and a great atmosphere will scratch that itch for a good challenge-reward experience. I can think of very little to say in detriment to this title, the best of which maybe a lack of checkpoints and a fairly unintuitive savepoint system (you go left, as indicated by a hint but go figure, it took a while to get how this feature worked properly). Overall this is not a timesink game. I certainly could be if you're into speedruns as it offers the necessary mechanics but aside from that it's a game that you gradually learn and progress through pretty much all based on player skill. Highly reccommended!			"

Like old ghosts n goblin games, you CAN learn to master it. The same strategy will win everytime, it's just a battle to learn and memorize all those steps.The music was ho hum...The art was pretty good...The controls are what they should be...No you can't pet me...Uhm, what else?It has secrets... it has levels... it has weapons... it has combat... it is a game... please buy game...Unless you hate ghost n goblin games, or hard games in generall... then you need to steer VEEEEEEEEERY FAR from this title. It is simply just NOT FOR YOU!oh gosh, not again!I HATE THIS GAME!!!!!!  Recommended.			"

												7/10 rating by me. The game is good but its kinda repetitive because saves only apply to RAM . This means you have to play the game from the beginning every time you close this game. Whether it saves to the hardrive when you beat a world I have no Idea because I never have enough time to beat the first world because you constantly have to replay the level because of its difficulty. I can see myself giving up on this game because I'm guessing once I beat the first level the difficulty gets harder.			"

												Nice looking, plays nice, BUT!!! it is in my view it's just to hard and very frustrating. The game as far as I have played (not past the starting point), had no check points, so I always restart from the start of the level. Also the jump and moving forward does not work so well. The monsters just keep on coming too, you could stand still and they just keep coming at you and you have to kill them. So looks good, play ok, nice retro look, but it is frustrating to try play.

												Horrible design choice ruins this gem of a game for me. It highly relies on learning from your own mistakes but not in a fair way. You will die at every new trap and will have to restart your whole tedious run again. As i remember, Ghosts'n Goblins had more frequent checkpoints and better lives system, which made it more friendly for practice and highly adaptable, depending on your skill in genre. In Volgar there's more ""puzzling"" approach to every obstacle, which you have to memorize after. Its pretty nice but done wrong, intentionally killing you no matter how good you are.mechanics is what made this game great for me, interesting spear platforming system, rolling, shield blocking, a bit clunky but adaptable jumping and etc. Really easy to get into but hard to master. I wouldn't mind level editor for this, as i see really huge potential for custom levels here.So, intentionally unpolished doesn't mean it's still not unpolished. I would like if they added easier mode, so players could adapt to game faster, and only then try their best on 1-life run. I think this is the only fair way, as i got bored pretty quickly from getting to the first boss on my first try without any hits and constantly dying from him, only to start from the beginning. I can take the challenge, but not when it has this tedious feel to it. Dev responded somewhere on the forum, saying that this would ruin the whole ""get armor-get better"" idea and blah blah blah, I don't mind grinding 1 boss with only my weakest shield instead of full armor set, i think it's better than playing the whole level you already mastered because of some little mistake you can't get.

												Fails spectacularly at the most important thing a game should be: fun.Starting over and over again after the latest cheap shot killing you gets super-boring really fast. I went from playing Dark Souls NG+++, having a great time there, to playing this for just one hour, and I'm never coming back. It's horribly bad and reminiscent of the most $h1tty games on the old NES, like Ghosts n' Goblins. Play Double Dragon Neon or something instead, play Monopoly or whatever; just anything but this.

So, I just decided to unistall the game and I would definitely suggest NOT to buy it..Really sad, cause I would really like to finish it.			"

												Volgarr the Viking is a sidescroller reminiscent of old NES games like Ghosts N' Goblins, and also brings back memories of good old games, like Zelda II and Hudson's Adventure Island.My hats to the developers for that.Still, this game wasn't for me. Some people will love it, but the game is just plain tough, and every time you die, you go back to the beginning. That was fine back in the 8-bit days, but times have changed, and I think this style of game has been redone better by games like Rogue Legacy and Binding of Isaac. With Volgarr, I'm frustrated because I'm dying because the controls didn't behave the way I wanted them to, or because you can't duck and throw a spear at the same time. You might love it, but not me.			"

												The platforming is unresponsive and un-engaging. This would be forgivable in a much easier game where the required system mastery was far easier to achieve, but the combination of stiff platforming and high difficulty means I cannot recommend this game.The thing where you get various sequential powerups then effectively lose them 2 at a time to being hit doesn't make you feel glorious that you maintained a high power state, it makes you feel frustrated that it was all taken away so quickly for one small mistake. Not to mention the screen repeatedly trying to shrink back when the only way such a platformer should ever be played is with as much of the level in view as humanly possible IWBTG-style.			"

												I really like hardcores platformers, but I dont think this one is hard because of real difficulty, i think it's hard because it's impossible to correctly play with the very awkward controls.You will find youself dying all the time just because down+attack = sword slash and not throw javelin, which is up+attack. It gets even more confusing because the game assign these double actions on another keys, so it's really hard to do it all without thinking before.There are better, more fluid platformers out there in my opinion...

												Before I dive into this, let's establish something first. Odds are you probably haven't owned a car your whole life, right? I can assume you've had to walk to a store, or work, or the brothel, or your probation officer, or any place where you would much prefer some form of transportation that doesn't need to be tied to your feet first, right? You've also probably ridden in a car at some point in your life and I doubt you've ever found yourself thinking, ""Gee, I sure do miss walking along the highway, dodging beer bottles being thrown by lucky but evil ♥♥♥♥♥"", right? I would guess not. So let's get something straight. Going back to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ era will most likely end with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ results. Can we all agree on that?With that in mind, here's yet another game that totally would have shined through the vast sea of♥♥♥♥♥♥known as late 80's/early 90's video games, had it indeed been released on the Sega Genesis like it wishes. Which is an alright ambition, but when rubbing elbows with modern games, it only reminds us why the Sega Genesis was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and why the mistakes of that era must never ever be repeated.Sure, there are plenty of games that do the whole 'retro thing', mostly because the people that can truly appreciate it are also old enough to have jobs, and wives, and children, and mid-life crisises, and most importantly; disposable income. But those are all just 'retro games', not 'games that take it too far by recreating all the♥♥♥♥♥♥everybody has been collectively trying to fix and forget about for the last 20 years because it's so ♥♥♥♥ing depressing to think that was the best form of entertainment we had for the first quarter of our lives'.In other words, games like Shovel Knight, are modern games with retro graphics. Voltardo the Viking, on the other hand, is not modern. How can I tell? Well, the controls for one. You better be damn sure you know which direction you want to jump prior to jumping or♥♥♥♥♥♥just isn't going to work out for you. Why? Because you can't change direction in mid-air and, when you die, you start back at the beginning and have to slowly waddle your way through the whole level all over again. In fact, let me start a new paragraph for that one because I know there are mindless, drooling ♥♥♥♥♥ that can't be asked to pay attention through a whole 3 sentences.You can't change direction in mid-air. Even if it's some sort of last ditch effort to avoid something that just spawned on the edge of the screen. And every time something does, it's too close and too late for you to react mid-jump. It's the exact same problem Vectorman had; the difficulty of the game is centered around the fact that you can't see anything farther away than♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥distance. But it's worse with ♥♥♥♥♥rr the Virginling because you're nearly defenseless while you're jumping and the only thing you can do is hit the attack button and hope for the best.To clarify, when you jump, you only jump straight up and down, OR angled in a predetermined, unchangable arc. Never a mixture of the two. Once you jump, you relinquish all control over to the wrinkly,♥♥♥♥♥♥stained hand of fate and hope it's nice enough to let you land where you wanted. That's right folks, it's a platformer with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping controls. And I don't mean accidentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥, like you might find in some very low level indie games. No, this kind of douchbaggery took skill. They have clearly spent a lot of time playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ late 80's/early 90's platformers and successfully recreated the very same controls everybody was rushing to debug. I don't know how to follow that one up. I'm flabbergasted, really. Somebody intentionally recreated the '♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumping controls' genre and expects to be taken seriously. This is exactly the kind of grade A, choice cut ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t we've been struggling to overcome for the last 20-30 years. And they recreated it. I almost respect it in that anarchist sort of way.What's even more baffling are the people who gave it enough positive reviews to earn it a total score of ""very positive"". Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? Were games like Half-Life 2, the Borderlands series and pretty much all games that show any semblance of progress since Meatloaf stopped being popular getting too boring for you? Yeah, who the hell would want to play a game that's fun and entertaining when we can play games that herald back to a time when every ♥♥♥♥ing game on the market, EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING GAME ON THE MARKET, would rub♥♥♥♥♥♥in our eyes then yell at us for 90 minutes straight because our eyeballs smelled like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hell, why stop there? Why not build yourself an outhouse and start wiping your♥♥♥♥♥with corncobs while you're at it? Don't buy your butter from the grocery store anymore, churn it yourself. Want a salad? Start growing yourself one. Hell, here's a challenge if you want one so damn bad, try chasing your food down, pelting it with rocks and sticks for 3 days straight before finally eating it raw. Then when you're thirsty, try walking 8 or 9 miles to the closest stream and take a big gulp of bug, parasite and deer♥♥♥♥♥♥infested water.I will never understand this generation of entitled ♥♥♥♥tards who think ""too easy"" is a bad thing. Do you know how many people throughout time have wished for that kind of problem? Gonad the Ballbarian is the kind of fappery that isn't worth the time and money it takes to play or make, even if it is for the sake of all the people who feel bad about having♥♥♥♥♥♥too easy. If they want to suffer, let them buy an NES, a handful of random NES games and watch as they rage themselves into a coma. They'll all find out on their own why ""too easy"" is a problem you WANT to have.			"

												Avoiding repitition is something I was taught very early in game design. The human brain gets tired of the same stimulus over and over, so especially in this medium, you want to make sure you're constantly presenting the player with new concepts and ideas as time progresses. It's a matter of respecting the player's time, you see. Games like The Binding of Isaac always make you feel like you're getting something for your trouble, and the only reason Super Meat Boy gets away with being Super Meat Boy is because you respawn almost instantly, and the levels are so small to begin with. If you die, they don't make you start the whole world over. The brain trust behind this game didn't understand this.Volgarr the Viking is the worst, and not for the reasons its creators think it is. I'm bored out of my frigging skull playing this game, because my fault or not, I'm sick of doing the exact same thing over and over. Even games like Devil May Cry manage to be tolerable because the gameplay is so deep that mastering it is the reward in itself, but Volgarr can't even manage that. It feels like nothing worthwhile is waiting for me no matter how far I get, aside from having to put up with more intentionally awful knockback and jump mechanics that make the game far less enjoyable than it should be. Surprise: design concepts abandoned by the rest of the industry over a decade ago aren't relevant in the current landscape anymore. This game was outdated before it was even released, and contrary to popular belief, that's not a good thing.			"

												I looked at the user reviews and saw ""Very Positive"". I guess it's sad that there are so many trolls who would endorse a game because it's ""challenging"". Looked through a good amount of the positive reviews, I found maybe 2 people who had actually beat the game. One person had nearly 40 hours invested and still hadn't beat the game...This game is challenging, yes. But for the one reason a game shouldn't ever be challenging...the controls.They are the clunkiest controls I have played with in the longest time. Pure garbage. That ♥♥♥♥ing lag delay after landing a small♥♥♥♥♥jump from the ground. Like how heavy are Volgarr's thighs. Lose some weight.TLDR; If you want to spend a good 30 hours on a game that should be 4-5 hours max, learning which attacks you can block with your shield and which you can't in a repetitive and monotonous process of trial and error...then go ahead...do it...buy the game...waste your money. (Luckily I only lost $2 on this trash)(Also I realize this is a Ghouls n' Ghosts clone but that game is over-glorified trash with the worst of the artificial difficulties)EDIT 05/03/2017: Still a garbage ♥♥♥♥ing game lol.

												I would normally love an old style 2D action platformer, but without a save system it makes casual play very difficult.If you have the time to play this all in one sitting like oldschool NES games, then go for it. Otherwise I recommend you skip this game.			"

												Don't be fooled by anyone saying this is a ""love letter to NES platformers."" I mean it is, but it's marred by questionable design choices that makes it fall far short of what it is trying to imitate.While the character controls great, a mix between NES and SNES platformer agility and attack-capabilities, it is a bit tedious having to execute the spin-attack + a down-slash in midair on almost every enemy; I really wish I could just hit dudes normally, as when I get to, it's very satisfying.But the major, crippling, FATAL FLAW of this game is the health system. You die in two hits. Not even legendarily hard games like Castlevania for the NES were that unfair; in that game, the final third of the levels you take four hits to die, and even that is brutal. But in this game, you take two hits from the very first level, and you're dead. The reason I say this game is a bad ""love letter"" is because I can't think of any NES game that was this unfair with the exception of some incredibly awful ones like Silver Surfer.You *can* get power-ups which will eat some damage and give you effectively a larger health pool but... these powerups go away when you get hit, which is SO unfun. I hate getting weaker the lower on health I am; it feels like throwing salt in the wound. You know that satisfying instinctual feeling you get when you get power-ups? Now negate it and double it, and that's what getting hit feels like.Also, you can only save between levels; if you shut the game off, any checkpoints you got go away. And it can take an hour or more just to get one checkpoint, so forget making any progress in this game unless you have hours to beat the entire level. Honestly, this might be an even bigger flaw than the amount of health you get; if I could save the game at mid-level checkpoints when I stop playing, then maybe I'd be able to make progress, but as it stands, unless you can beat an entire level in one sitting, be prepared to replay a LOT of BRUTALLY hard levels.If this game gave you more health, like six hits, this game would immediately become insanely fun, but as it was designed, it's unplayable. It demands ABSOLUTE PERFECTION 99% of the time. You think I'm exaggerating, but every enemy is deviously placed such that you have to beat them perfectly, because taking a hit from them is not an option with only two health.			"

												Volgarr the Viking is one of the very best action/platformers ever made so go buy it now.Still reading instead of adding it to your cart? okay perhaps a bit more convincing is needed for some reason. I agree with those who say it's a bit reductive to compare games to fusions of other well known titles, but here it's perfectly applicable as Volgarr is what you'd get by combining Ghosts & Goblins with FromSoftware's Souls series. The Ghosts & Goblins influence is felt immediately not just by the slower, more deliberate pacing, but also by the nonrefundable jump arc, once you jump you're committed to it with only a double jump to save you from a poorly timed one. At the same time Volgarr conjures the spirirt of the souls series by teaching gamers through death and punishing failure as it's primary tool and while countless games have done the same thing years before any souls game existed Volgarr mirrors the souls games emphasis on combat and environment awareness. Learning each enemy's attack and movement pattern while avoiding stage hazards is the core of the game so if you rush your way through it without being as patient and methodical as the game wants you to be then ""you're gonna have a bad time"". That being said if you accept the fact that you will die a lot and manage to not throw your controller or keyboard through your monitor, then eventually some of Volgarr's badassery will transfer to you with that percentage growing as you master the mechanics and start feeling the flow of the game. Each chest adds an extra piece of armor to your arsenal depending on what you already have equipped while getting hit knocks off a piece so don't get hit if you want to keep your gear. No one is scared of a naked viking...my apologies to the naked viking communities of the world , but c'mon you know a flaming sword and metal shield can't ever hurt...well at least not you!If you're sick of the AAA, casual friendly, hand holding of modern games that think you're incapable of coloring inside the lines then pick up Volgarr the Viking and be reminded that some games still respect your reflexes and intelligence as a gamer.

			Views: 437,276		

			http://www.longplays.net Played By: MontyMole The weapons are completely random, which is why i enver got a knife. But i was quite lucky with the magical weapon, without it the game is not beatable.		

Edit: June 13, 2015. After spending many hours playing through World 2, I'm changing my review to ""recommended"" ( because I really enjoyed the Ocean World ). I did not realise that World 1 was a copy of the original ""Rastan"" video game level ( it looked super ghetto to me ).This game is only for hardcore gamers or someone looking for 1980's style difficulty. It can take several hours just to get halfway through one world. The difficulty is punishing, since you need almost pixel-perfect skills.In Options / Settings select ""Look Ahead"". That way the game will be permanently zoomed out, so that you can see hidden chests. I think it's dumb that the game is permanently zoomed in on your face by default.			"

												Basically put, most players won't make it to the 3rd checkpoint. This game is so hard, it isn't even fun. Don't spend your money on this. Less then 75% of players complete the first mission on this game. Let's look at some statistics. Only 24.6% of players have even unlocked the achievement for completing the Lizard King Boss Fight. And only 54% of players have earned the achievement ""The power of gray-skill"" which is where you earn the flaming sword. That is the most commonly earned achievement, and only 50% of players have it. That means 50% of people won't even unlock a single achievement on this game, yet alone complete a single level. Achievements are the best example you can use, because they start being tracked once you actually play the game. If you purchase a game and just let it sit in your library, your achievement stats won't be tracked. So that means, once again, that less then 75% of active players will even beat a single level.

												Precision action platforming with janky but predictable controls. This is probably something I would have played and gotten into when I was 7 years old, paid for a rental, and didn't have any other choices for games, but at this point the platforming isn't really that rewarding or fun for the number of times you'll die. Every time you lose you think you have to train yourself to be a better robot, pushing the buttons more precisely at the right times without error. With no additional gameplay mechanics or bells or whistles or draws to the game I can call this a pretty pure example of the ""realtime precision button pressing"" genre. That should be a steam game tag so I know to avoid it in future purchases.As someone else stated, you will either waste a lot of time on this game trying to prove you are hardcore or be done with it in 15 minutes. I can't help but think all the wannabe badasses who love this game are under 21, bored, and competing in their own version of an arm wrestling contest with Internet strangers OR are maybe prone to crying out at night ""I'm too weak! I'm too weak!"" while engaging in self flagellation to toughen themselves (i.e. their fingers) up. I also give this game one finger up.			"

												Not impressed. I get it that everyone goes crazy any time anyone tries to make a NES-style 90's action game. I also get it that anytime I game specifically labels itself ""hard"" and uses archaic design or poor level/mechanic design to have you die all the time and constantly repeat the same parts over and over so you waste your life, just to beat one part to feel good about yourself, people go crazy as well and love it. Although old games were fun, there were reasons some mechanics were advanced, people they sucked but they didn't have the ability at the time to improve them due to specification limitations and technology. This game nails the early 90's look. The character feels super clunky and can only jump 1 inch. He can't aim and only knows how to look and shoot forward, and for some inexplicable reason once he's crouched he loses the ability to throw spears. All this makes him frustrating to play with. Also the jump attack is worthless. If someone jumps over at you and you try and jump to hit them, since they are way higher than you and you can't aim, you automatically get hit and can't do anything about it. Also if you attack a guy and he has more than 1 hitpoint, he can hit you while he is taking damage, which makes no sense, because if someone was slashing you with a sword you probably would have to react to that first before attacking. There are other things like how you throwing a spear actually moves you forward in the game. If you quit you have to restart the level/world over again. There was one part in the first level where there is this small jump with spikes below it, but because you can barely jump you aren't able to make it and have to just keep retrying it, dying, and starting everything over again. Poor design. Also you have can take one hit, no health or lives. you can pick up armor to mitigate damage, so you may take 1-3 hits or so, but because of the design thats super easy, and its not fun starting over again. I never felt a death was my fault or because I didn't do something. It was always because I ""couldn't"" do something due to limitations and poor design. Now I know that tons of the ""hardcore"" people that wasted countless hours of their lives retrying levels may be butthurt I pointed a lot of this out, but that's just my opinion. I like being given the tools to succeed, not poor design forcing me to die countless times until I finally beat a part to fill up my self-esteem. But hey if that's for you then this game is just what you're looking for. 4/10.			"

Volgarr is a disgrace to the old games it's drawing inspiration from. Awful controls, terrible enemy and level design, and just pathetic power-up progression. Lose two power ups for every hit?

												Just adding my own 10 cents here. Normally i don't take time to review a game, but i love this one so much that i had to give it a positive vote.     The rumors are true, this is a difficult game, but it's not difficult in a cheap way.  The challenges are steep but fair.  There are no cheap tricks here like getting stuck on stairs (Castlvania).  And it never gets so difficult that getting through a certain area relies on luck as much as skill.  You will get better with time and the places that gave you fits will (in time) become your ♥♥♥♥♥ as your skill increases.      As much as i love this game, it's still just a notch or two shy of what i would call the perfect hack n slash platformer.  One, it would have been nice to have a standing upward attack as well as being able to raise my shield against attacks from above.  That aside, if your a hack n slash 2D platformer fan, this game is a must have for your library.			"

												First impression of a bit of the first level - review to be taken with a grain of salt.I'm not saying no to this because 'oh it's too hard!' I'm saying no to tihs game because the controls on the first level are lacking. The 3 hit system? Totally fine with it. What I'm not fine with is my character being swarmed by unlimited spawning enemies. That isn't good game design, so I don't get where the praise is coming from. On top of this, you cannot nudge your character when they double jump. There is a section with spikes where you have to push it just right, or have a previous thing to absorb the spike damage. I got it right once, but honestly not liking how the controls feel.Good call back to the old platformer days, but fails to meet modern standards in terms of combat. Might be up the alleyway of those who enjoyed it though. I just feel the game is making it unecessarily janky on purpose.			"

												It is obvious when playing that a lot of thought and effort when in to designing Volgarr exactly as is; easily seen in the first 30 seconds.I appreciate modern 'old school' games and they should be lauded; however, an older style completly ignoring the progression of the genre is not fulfilling its potential. It is here where Volgarr fails and often goes from enjoyable nostalgia to annoying or tedious.There is a fantastic experience to be enjoyed in Volgarr, however, it is lost in the desire to perfectly recreate an experience irrespective of whether the mechanic or design decision was required.

												Very challenging. Maybe too challenging. No save points before bosses, so you have to play the entire level each time. I like a good challenge but after several hours, it get tedious. Recommeding if on sale. I paid 3.50 and thought that was fair enough. It's really too bad there isn't more places to save, and that you have to start from the very beginning each time, otherwise I would even recommend this game at full price.			"

												This game has tight mechanics and a very old school challenge. I played for a few hours with a controller, and the game seemed to be moderatly challenging. After playing for 45 minutes and reaching the half-level checkpoint I wanted to take a break. But the game does not save your progress at checkpoint, so you have to do more repetive♥♥♥♥♥♥if you suck at the game. If you enjoy retro platformers buy Shovel Knight, stay away from Volgar.			"

												The game looks fun but playing it is frustrating. The viking character which you play feels rigid, jumping and dodging enemy attacks feels horrible. I've haven't even completed the first level, because it feels like every move you make has to be precise and without the flexibility it becomes annoying to play.I might come back to this game, when theres some patch to fix this but as of right now I'm going to play other games.

												Soo, first off: the game is quite nice on the eyes.  I like the fact that it's a throwback to the old school games like Rastan & such. But, seriously: eventhough Rastan could be kinda hard in places, it's pretty much doable.  This game is a trial on your patience.  It's NOT fun & you will die QUITE often.  I REALLY think that there should be a halfway point save or something.  To mess up almost 3/4 of the way at the end to have to restart the level is not challeging at all.  I call that bad game design. (One of the games I ALMOST recommend a trainer for!!!)  Not Good...  :O(			"

This game is too easy.It is marketed as a good, difficult retro platformer with tight controls, as well as having a healthy dose of viking violence.Of those promised qualities, it delivered only in regards to viking violence, since it is neither good, nor difficult and the controls are decent at best.While this game has a lot of minor issues, I want to focus on what I perceive to be the root of all evil when it comes to this game: It's approach to difficulty and leveldesign.Difficulty in VolgarrHaving played through the first three levels of Volgarr and beaten what most players seem to consider this game's hardest boss on the way,I can honestly say that no single combat encounter, jump or platforming puzzle was even remotely close to being hard to pull off or figure out. Why then have I not completed more of the game in the time that I played it?Because checkpoints are so rare that you need to get past just about a million of those obstacles in order to reach one checkpoint.This makes Volgarr feel and play like a game of low to medium difficulty,that has had about 50-80% of it's checkpoints removed. This is not how you challenge players. It's how you make them bored out of their mind.Having to run through the motions ploughing through mindnumbingly boring and repetitive combat encounters, just to fail and die at the boss,is neither challenging, nor is it fun. It is aggravating and a waste of time.I just had a glance at the kickstarter page and last time I checked, an ""insane"" boss in a game for the ""truly hardcore"" took more than a couple of tries to beat.While I have beaten some hard games before, I am by no means just that good at video games.This game almost exclusively tests your patience rather than your skill.If you are into that fair enough, but I'm not. Leveldesign in VolgarrFrom what I can tell, there are 3 ways of trivialising pretty much all enemies in the game:-Crouch and slash with your sword.-Kill them from a safe distance using spears.-Make them seperate from their pack and come to you by using spears.That approach to enemy-placement may or may not be retro, that is for others to decide.What I do know is that it is boring, unimaginative, and repetitive.Enemy design is equally bad: With few exceptions, there are basically enemies that will jump at youand enemies that slowly lumber towards you.Both can only damage you by touching you.Needless to say, neither of them are challenging, fun, or interesting. By now you should be able to guess what I think about the platforming and puzzles,so I won't go into detail but instead confirm your suspicion: I strongly dislike them.ConclusionToday I read an old forum post of one of the developers statingthat he wanted a game that played exactly like the games of old rather than like a retro game with modern influences. That at least makes some amount of sense and explains,why the developers apparently refused to learn from more modern,but actually challenging games like ""they bleed pixels"", which released before volgarr and is vastly superior in every aspect.Avoid Volgarr and get ""they bleed pixels"" and/or ""Wings of Vi"" instead.

My Terrible, Terrible Review of Volgin the Vikinghardcore 2/2 It's an old school platformer. It's a good one too.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Do you like Ghosts n Goblins/Ghouls n Ghosts?Do you like Golden Axe/Altered Beast?Do you like a good, challenging platformer/sidescrolling action game?If yes to at least 2 out of 3 of those questions, you should try this. If yes to one or none of those questions, you should try this anyways because it may change your answer.See, what makes this game the best is that it doesn't start in fullscreen, so if you're a man/woman/person/not-person who likes to multitask (aka look up strategy guides), this game's got you covered.I rate it a softcore 5/5.

												This game is not a fun game. Its a boring hard grind from start to finnish. The game tries its hardest to kill you in cheap ways, miss time a jump - dead, swing your weapon at the wrong time - dead, use the downward attack (doesnt work 25% of the time) - dead. Start from the beggining of the level and redo it all without any mistakes. If you get hit once on the way to the boss you may aswel restart. It tries to be hard for the sake of being hard which doesnt lead to an enjoyable experience. The game pads its length out by making you redo the levels everytime you die, this made sense back when we were all playing megadrive games and you couldnt save progress but this is 2014 and we have moved on from this artificial style of difficuilty. While the majority of games these days are far to easy and hold your hand through everything this game goes the exact opposite way and too far in that direction. Its hard because you have to remmember the location of every enemy and their attack pattern and the exact way to deal with that enemy in that location, the game is basically one long session of memorising trivial details and then carrying out those movements precisely each time. The game has a certain charm to its style and it can be satisfying when you finnaly defeat that boss you were stuck on. There is pretty much no story, your a viking, go forward and hit things, you pick up gear to take more hits and do more damage, get hit and you lose that gear. It tries to be somewhat of a 2d darksouls, but that game betters it in every concievable way, the game is hard to better portray its story not for the sake of being hard, the combat system far superior etc.Its a hark back to old style games which is fun for 30 minutes and then you remmember why you dont still play those games.

												I am sorry, I'm just not into this game. I think it is irritating that levels rarely have checkpoints and the only difficulty is aggressively high. Don't think, I'm a casual ♥♥♥♥♥ gamer. I like Demon's Souls and Dark souls and I am a huge fan of Super Meat Boy and Gothic. Volgarr however seems to remaster only the bad things from our NES era. Why do I have to go through half a level (that is already known to me and its walkthrough already goes automatic for me) only to encounter swift difficult moment that I am stuck in and die in few seconds? Why can't I pierce the wall of an enemy with my spear if they are out of the screen? There is a wall just on the next screen. Why is it so hard for a spear to find it? Controls are not as responsive as it is required for some ingame moments. You know, there is a reason why developers abandon these things. I want to be able to practice one difficult moment in the middle of the level only. I want to try different tactics, learn the patterns, but for every try I have to go through a long starting part of the level that I already know. Sine Mora has special mode that allows you to practice boss fights only.  Super Meat boy does not have checkpoints because each level is 30 seconds long (maximum). Volgarr is not that unique for me to be dragged through already experienced gameplay over and over untill some intense moment everytime I die. I am highly disappointed in this game.			"

												This is a fun little throw-back to 16 bit games that were hard-as-nails and required you to memorize enemy patterns to win.  Volgarr the Viking succeeds well at this and there are many speedruns on YouTube that are fun to watch. Unfortunatley this is not necessarily my kind of game though - there is little thought to winning. It is just pure memorization.It can be a bit frustrating at times. I hate choosing whether to recommend or not for this particular title, because it is up to your preferences, really. Just know that you are not getting anything fresh here. It is a good reimagining of old-school side scrolling action games.			"

												The game doesn't save. That alone is a good enough reason to condemn this to the deepest pits of hell.And I'm not talking about lack of checkpoints, the game only saves at the beginning of each world and each world has several levels. If you beat all the levels except the last one (There is a ""checkpoint"" at the beginning of each level but those don't count for♥♥♥♥♥♥when you quit the game) and you have to quit for whatever reason, you have to do the previous levels again. And of course, the levels are super hard or rather have extremely incosistent difficulty.

At this point, (world 1, checkpoint 2) I was almost giving up, since the ""boss"" was pretty tough and I wasn't inspired to fight against lizards and spiders anymore, then, I managed to defeat the ""boss""! It was AMAZING! Really, I've felt really accomplished! But in the second world..... guess what? ROBOTIC MINES! Really? Robotic mines? Are you serious?

												Apparently I have misunderstood the concept of tight controls mentioned often when this game has been discussed, but I don't feel  that having to stop frequently to do ranged attacks, not being able to change your direction mid-air (only when double jumping, how is that logical?) and constantly being knocked back by enemies is in any way a fluent way to control your character. I'd understand if you couldn't change your direction even when double jumping, but the current system does not bode well with my mindset of gaming canon. OFC I understand that knockback is herited from old platformers this game seems to be an homage to, but in my opinion, we could nowadays do well without that relic. Also I dislike the notion that you have to go back so much each time you die, but on the other hand many people might enjoy this challenge and in a way I did expect the game to have such a feature beforehand.

												I know that Völgarr the Viking is supposed to emulate old-school hardcore platformers like Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts and the like, but there are several things about it that I just don't like, and pretty much all of them are caused by that very blind emulation of by-now obsolete game designs.A big fat one that's definitely a dealbreaker AND right off the bat costs the game a recommendation, is the fact that it doesn't have a save function. And I'm not talkin' about a quick-save/quick-load function for those extra gruelling boss-fights. No, I'm talking about playing the game one day and making 3 hours worth of progress, and then being COMPLETELY unable to save said progress in order to start from THAT point at a later time.Seriously, Crazy Viking Studios. Do you honestly think that SGnG lacked a save function because they wanted to make the game atrociously frustrating to play? Or did it ever occur to you that maybe, just MAYBE, games back then simply didn't have save functions because they COULDN'T, due to extreme hardware AND software limitations?Another massive gripe I've got with VtV is the fact that you can't tweak the difficulty level to any degree, so you extra hard-to-the-core motherfûckers out there can't get an extra challenge by, say, spawning more enemies or make said enemies attack with greater precision, or anything like that. And you slightly more ""casual"" folks who really just wanna enjoy the game without restarting 20 times per minute will find it frustratingly unforgiving with a lot of really rather bullshïtty pixel-perfect-over-instant-death-gaps jumps.I will say though that the combat is good. Really good, frankly. It's easy to learn the controls, and all of the attacks and maneuvres you have are in some way useful, and throwing a fully powered up spear into a lizardman and then watching said spear continue to plow through 3 other reptilians fûcktards only to splatter them brutally against a wall is EXACTLY what being a badass viking warrior in a land of myths and legend is all about!I can't really say much for the entirety of the game, since the unforgiving nature of it always leaves me too fûcking frustrated to keep playing for very long, and thus I've never gotten very far into the game. If the game DID have some sort of an autosave function, so that you could continue from the last checkpoint you visited, I'd probably be inclined to give VtV a 9+ score. But as it stands, I really can't give it more than around half that, at best. So yeah. Sorry, Crazy Viking guys. You did your best, and I wanted to like your game, but it's just not as good as it NEEDS to be for that to happen. 4.6/10			"

												What makes a game great? Difficulty? No. Progression and a sense of overcoming ever increasing challenges? Yes. Perhaps the developer wasn't trying to make a great game, perhaps he was, but bottom line, it's a BAD game.It's not hard to make a bad game. Consider this; let's take Diablo II, a game heralded as best of its genre even after all these years, could I screw that up? Easily, by tweaking something as simple as drop rates, or damage etc. Just look at Diablo III for proof. Thankfully, the PC game is a forgiving medium, look at what Aarkalash did, they made their easy mode easy. Volgarr has no different modes, and thus is such a niche game as to be inaccessible to the market. Folks that grew up playing games like Rastan (and still do) would find this offering a waste of time. Rastan is better. Why would I play Volgaar?Maybe buy this game for 50 cents. Maybe.			"

												I don't claim to be good at video games, but I can handle Dark Souls, which this game strangely gets compared to. The thing about Dark Souls is that it's hard, but good. This game is hard, but not very good. Whereas in Castlevania the controls feel deliberate, they just feel sluggish and cumbersome in this game. Maybe I'll revisit this later, but I wasn't too impressed. It's a shame because I really like the art, it's a game I want to spend time in, but I guess I'm not good enough or patient enough to stick with it.I loathe writing negative reviews, I can tell a lot of hard work went into making this, but I just can't recommend this one.

												Game is garbage.  Developers need to stop designing games that test your patience and memory more than reflexes.  I don't want to restart the second level thirty times because I haven't figured out all of the patterns in it yet.  it's basically a dancing game like DDR, just learn the dumb patterns of the ruthless and annoying enemies.  But you know what, I guess I'm just not hardcore enough for the game because I don't like restarting the same level until I have lost interest in playing the game and going through the same segments until they become dull obstacles that have lost all of their intenisty and challenge.

												Stay away! This game looks awesome based on the trailer, but it's cynically playing all the ""so hot right now"" cards that it can find (retro graphics, callbacks to 1980s and 1990s classic games, over the top machismo, etc) without ever deivering the quality to back it up. Volgar the viking s designed to be very, very hard, but the controls don't support that kind of gameplay. They feel sticky, they are laid out unintuitively (feeling very console-portish), and they are very poorl tutorialized. The game is also full of silly design flaws (if you crouch down, none of the lizard men on the first level can hit you - their clubs pass harmlessly overhead!). Add deliberately ridiculous difficulty to very poor controls and the game quickly becomes frustrating instead of fun. And I say this as someone who enjoyed both Dark Souls and Teleglitch! AVOID AT ALL COSTS.			"

												Very enjoyable, challenging old-school game. retro 16 (or 32) bit graphics. tight controls (though not perfect) and an addicting level of difficulty. My one qualm is that with the game's design, and thats THAT YOU CAN'T SAVE. Spend an hour getting past just the first level? Quit after spending a half hour on level 2? Well, bad news, because you'll have to start straight from the beginning with no saves or continues if you choose to quit the game (which any normal human will do, at some point or another). That's right, its just like an arcade game-- which is clearly the style this game succeeds at emulating-- no saves or continues once you stop playing. You get checkpoints, 1 per level, whilst you play, but once you quit that's it. I love the game, I really do, and I was lucky enough to get it on sale for less than $5.00, but I can't help but feel a little ripped off due to this single element of the game. That being said, some will thrive from the old-school challenge, experiencing deja' vu from the 80's-90's arcade era-- knowing that it's all or nothing. Once you stop playing or run out of quarters, you'll have to try again next time right from the start. For its challenge, controls, retro appeal, and sheer enjoyability, this game deserves an 8/10. The no-saves feature holds this challenging Castlevania-style game back from being a fully-fledged game. Again, some will really love that, but in these days where time is a constraint for most, its a nuissance.			"

												A lot of people say this game makes you memorize the level before you can beat it.  These comments are completely wrong.  The game and level design is great to the point of teaching the player all the dangers of a level before they will resonably die to them.  The rules are laid out plaining for anyone who is willing to pay attention.  Although, this game is truely difficult and you will memorize the levels from replaying the same parts over and over again but in the end it is rewarding and fun.  While the first three levels you will play multiple times, the final levels you will find yourself completing in only a few runs as the previous stages taught you the skills needed to be a real viking (digital realm only).This game, unlike a lot of indie titles on steam, is worth it's full amount.

It doesn't suffer from the ""Trial & Error"" that so many games trying to be hard do. You'll die. A LOT. But you'll know exactly why you died. It isn't unfair. You can't really blame the game for failing. There is only you to blame. And that is beauty in itself. I'm joyful to say that Volgarr The Viking is worth your time. You're going to feel rage in your veins, but you are gonna feel equally as good about yourself. I hope you decide to grow a pair and join me in Valhalla, friends.

												When you finish your first session of Volgarr, one thing becomes abundantly clear : Either you're in love or you've simply wasted your money.This game is extremely hard but manages to strike that balance between frustration and that wonderful feeling of accomplishment that only comes from punitive, hardcore games. If the level design and enemy behaviors weren't expertly handled I would've stopped playing a long time ago. Fortunately, this game is very precisely and masterfully crafted and I just can't put it down.There is no way around it, you will have to memorize enemy patterns, attacks and level layouts in order to progress.Getting hit means losing a power-up, just like in Super Mario Bros. While it is possible to keep trudging forward without these power-ups, it makes the game a whole lot trickierIf you manage to get through a level without getting hit, you get more Gold and a chance to play a bonus level. In this way, Volgarr forces you into Speedrunning. If you don't like old-school games where repetition and pattern mastery is obligatory, you will hate Volgarr.Super Meat boy is the most recent example of this kind of experience; It's a game which is hard but its pacing and level length / instant respawn was crafted to make sure that you'd give it just one more try before heading to bed. Once you cleared a level, it felt abolutely amazing. The same applies to Volgarr.At first, Volgarr evokes classics Altered Beast and Rastan; in fact, it could be argued that the first level is largely a re-telling of Rastan's first level. As the game progresses, you'll see some Mega Man, elements from Chakan : The forever man and even bits of QuackShot!This game is obviously targeted at old-school hardcore gamers; if you fit the description, I really don't see how you can not enjoy Volgarr. It is truly a modern classic masterpiece.			"

												Volgarr was friggin' tough. It's one of those games you need to butt your head against until you just get good at it; no other way to put it. It takes the best of its inspirations, like NES Castlevania and Rastan Saga, and bundles it into a tight, challenging game. Also, there is appreciable thoughtfulness in enemy placement/levels are designed around enemy mechanics; which is always great to see. Awesome game, great job Adult Swim.			"

												To skip levels, you have to walk left not only at the title screen, but also at the beginning of each level you want to skip.  Also, if you hold the button down to throw a spear, you charge it up and it'll do up to 3x damage (only if you have the hammer shield power-up).  These are things the in-game tutorial didn't tell me, but would've been good to know going in.  Now you know.  The game is an obvious homage to Rygar, but is much better than it.  It is very difficult, but not in a stupid, cheap kill kinda way.  If you liked Rygar or Ghosts n' Goblins, you'll like this game.			"

												Like your childhood but more hardcore. Great art style. Victory is costly but god it is rewarding. You will struggle, you will crawl, and probably leave in anger. You'll be back though. Back to the lizard men that'll shred you and the stupid fish people that will break your shield and your spirit. Finally you'll do great and clear away all enemies in your path. The gods will bless you and your sword will flame. Then just when victory seems possible you take a wall dart to the back and fall and fall and fall. 5 or 25 or 50 attempts later you finally beat the first boss and bask in victory. It is wonderful. It's like Odin himself let you bang his daughter. But wait you're not done. There is plenty left to pillage and plunder before you go to Vahalla and meet that hot viking goddess. Good luck and enjoy, may Thor's might give you strength. 9/10			"

												Yet another retro work that tries to emulate NES difficulty games. Does it succeed? For the most part, yes.The six worlds are split into two parts with only one checkpoint at the beginning of each part. You have infinite continues, but if you die at any moment in the middle of each part (including boss fights) you'll have to start over from the beginning of that part. Völgarr can slash with his sword, hurl spears at the enemies or on walls to climb them, roll and double jump with the second jump making him do a rolling sword attack a little like in SNES Star Wars games; the only tricky part is the jumping since he can only jump straight up or in diagonals and you cannot change the trajectory once you've jumped, but for the rest it's pretty easy to control.The game is entirely deterministic (except those damn blobs), which means that you can elaborate a safe pattern to reproduce each time you play the level. This definitely helps since the levels are pretty hard and you'll probably need to restart each section many times before you understand how to get past each enemy. It will take you 5 to 8 hours to beat it once depending on your skill.Hardcore players that manage to get to the end of the level almost unharmed will also be rewarded with five alternate paths (basically 5 harder levels with max 3 lives to finish them) and if they finish each one of them you'll get an extra level at the end.Recommended to those who seek for a small, challenging but manageable game.

It's so satisfying to learn each world to the point where you get point-perfect movement and the flow needed to reach the boss. You aren't God, ya know? You mess up and you're done for.Game's got a good feel. It teaches you elements of each level at the start of that level. Really good game design. It's really gratifying to destroy the boss of each level, considering how hard it was to get there, keeping the gear you acquired, no less. The game makes maaaaany, subtle references to older games from the 90s, and does so quite well, even.Great music, great art, really immersive.The one lost point is for the level before the end boss. Never a fan of fighting every enemy in the game one last time.I highly recommend this game. It's a great game.			"

												A lot of people say this game makes you memorize the level before you can beat it.  These comments are completely wrong.  The game and level design is great to the point of teaching the player all the dangers of a level before they will resonably die to them.  The rules are laid out plaining for anyone who is willing to pay attention.  Although, this game is truely difficult and you will memorize the levels from replaying the same parts over and over again but in the end it is rewarding and fun.  While the first three levels you will play multiple times, the final levels you will find yourself completing in only a few runs as the previous stages taught you the skills needed to be a real viking (digital realm only).This game, unlike a lot of indie titles on steam, is worth it's full amount.

												Just one hint: making a game laborious doesn't make it hard. Forcing the player to waste his time replaying the entire level doesn't increase the difficulty of the game, it just makes the whole process even more pointless. Pixellating your graphics doesn't make the game ""8-bit"" or ""retro"". Also, intimidating the players and making them avoid criticising the game for fear of looking like incompetent players isn't a very honest way of making games. Okay, those were four hints, but who's counting?			"

												Take the enemy spawns of Castlevania, the platforming of the original Prince of Persia and the Gear-Based hit system of Ghosts and Goblins, throw a pinch of Viking awesomeness in that mix and you have Volgarr (though I'm pretty sure Ghosts and Goblins is still harder, I'm sure at least SOMEONE made sure more than 5 people could beat Volgarr.)This is a game that belongs to an age where you would get 1-3 video games a year as a kid and your option was love that game and get good at it, no matter how sucky or hard it was, or just go back to playing your old games. This is not a game you play casually to kill a few moments or to sit back and relax with. This is the kind of game that from screen one slaps you in the face and says, ""I dare you..."" This is the kind of game you brag about beating, put on your resume and call home and tell your mother about.The only thing that sets this game apart from an actual nintendo game is infinite continues and the forgiveness of not sending you back to the start of the game with every other death.This is not a game for the casuals. This is a game for champions. This is the game that if you beat, the Valkyries will descend from the heavens en masse and carry you off to Valhalla where you will be afforded seats of honor, the finest of meads and only the most worthiest of champions to do daily battle with!

												I like the game and most of the gameplay mechanics it involves.However, everything that I like is shadowed by a huge problem : the jump is bad as hell. I don't know what you guys did with it but it's pretty horrible... The jump works like this : you can jump one time then jump another time when you're in air - so that's a basic double jump. However, it doesn't work like a regular double jump... No no, it's like this : say you're going to the right and press jump once, your character will jump to the right. Now if you jump with a direction input while you're in air, your character will keep the same direction, which means that you cannot land precisely where you want... Yes I know, you can jump once in a direction then jump while in air with no direction input to land below... But to me, that's totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it feels like jumping with a retard - I thought - and it really seemed - that Volgarr was badass like Ragnar, the ♥♥♥♥ is this♥♥♥♥♥♥seriously ? :sTLDR : I hate the jump mechanics, feels like Robocop trying to jump... and for this I cannot recommend this game although I like most of it, god I hate you guys !

												Summary: A well designed and polished 2D trick platformer for oldschool sensibilities.This game is difficulty, but its difficulty revolves mostly around learning the mechanics: movement, attack, level hazards and enemy behavior.The controls are reminiscent of NES Castlevania: in addition to a fixed-arc jump, there's also double spears, rolling and rope climbing. (Thankfully, no stairs!)Your offensive options consist of a sword and an infinite supply of spears, which can also be used as platforms.During a first playthrough, you ought to be careful and approach situations slowly, but as you start mastering the game, you'll be able to flow at a satisfying pace through the levels.Bosses are a matter of memorizing their patterns and finding the safe spots and the opportune times to strike.There are three ending to get, each requiring more of the player, but not unfairly so.The two additional endings raise the ante by requiring you to go through alternative stages on a limited supply of ""lives,"" which you must earn by traversing the stages near flawlessly.Recommended controls: gamepad with a good D-pad and at least two buttons (ideally four, for pause and view toggle)(I played with a sideways Wiimote.)Pros:Easy to learn and difficult to masterTight controlsWell polishedGood replayability, with alternate levels, three endings, and a leaderboardMost achievements attained naturally while completing all endingsWell optimized. Runs well on humble hardware.Cons:No mid-session save feature. (Prevents save-scumming; inconvenient nonetheless.)Must-do:Go in the options and set the option ""use look ahead as a toggle,"" otherwise you'll be hitting the look ahead button way too frequently.

												Classic coin-fed fantasy platforming here.  Any Rastan fans out there (most of you are probably too young, lol).  At any rate, if you played Rastan or Black Tiger in arcades, this throwback by [AS] Games will have you dripping in nostalgia in no time.  The training level is almost literally ripped from level 1 of Rastan (third time is the charm, wiki it if you haven't already).  Pick up this difficult, spritey goodness today!			"

												This game while great in every way is still tedious at heart, you WILL die a lot in this game, but that's not the problem. It's just the fact that you have to go all the way back to beginning of the stage and do it all over again. Which is something I find to be the biggest and only flaw because it gets boring and repetitive too quickly.			"

The game is amazing - from the superficial point of how it looks (awesome retro style) to the unforgiving gameplay. You'll sweat like never before while playing this game from how ♥♥♥♥ing stressfull it is.11/10 would buy again.Made a gameplay vid if anyones interested

												Oh man... Did you game in the 80s? Classic NES such as Ninja Gaiden and Wizards & Warriors? Do you love a game that is unapologetically tough (but not unfair)? Do you remember sinking quarters into Stryder? If the answer is yes, this game is totally for you. No save points, just check points. You die, you start the level over. Get to the boss and die? You start the level over. Quit the game? Start the game from the start. Never unfair or cheap, this game pushes you (much in the same way as Dark Souls but this isn't near the sadist/masochist relationship of that).I can't recommend this game enough for us in our late 20s to late 30s. This is the stuff we grew up on. A fantastic homage. If you like metal, it's like the Skeletonwitch/Havok/Municpal Waste of video games.MAYBE some of the youngins will join the club of tough games for toughness sake. And maybe we'll let them in. ;)			"

												This is definitely a game made for a small audience, and I'm super grateful to the developers for making it. You only ever have two weapons: a sword and a throwing spear. The sword can be used in a few ways and upgraded to a fire version (if you're good enough), but the real star of the show is the spear. Not only can it be used to attack enemies from afar (infinitely), but it can also be used to make platforms to stand on by throwing them at walls. And that's not just a fun gimmick... there are numerous chests out of reach through normal means until you find clever ways to throw spears and make paths to them.That's also how much of the battles unfold. It's not really a good idea to charge ahead and hope for the best so much as learn how enemies attack and make deliberate movements in order to vanquish them. The bosses work the same way too. Believe me, you'll die plenty of times fighting them, but each death helps you learn their pattern and once you know it, you can bring them down without taking a hit. Thank goodness for unlimited lives, eh?Just in case it isn't hard enough, there's actually a harder alternate version of each stage (with limited lives) that you can only get to by playing the previous stage near-flawlessly. And the only way to get the best ending is to do that for every stage.If you miss the good ol' days of fair but unrelenting difficulty, pick this sucker up.			"

												You will die constantly. The problem for me is, the death doesn't feel like it means anything. The game is difficult because the controls are clunky and the levels are difficult to navigate, so each death was frustrating rather than rewarding. I have played tons of platformers, I have no problem with dying 500 times. My frustration has nothing to do with difficulty, it has to do with the deaths seeming unfair and pointless. I genuinely disliked this game.			"

												Incredibly fun. They've done a great job with this game. If I were to have one minor complaint, it's that I can't press up on the d-pad in order to have Volgarr block upwards (similar to how you could in ActRaiser 2). That aside, I'd have to say the game is perfect. If you enjoy skill-based 2D combat action platformers, this is absolutely the game for you. Just think of ActRaiser 2 on SNES, Legend of Zelda 2 on NES, or perhaps Gargoyles on the Genesis; you get the idea.			"

												Volgarr was friggin' tough. It's one of those games you need to butt your head against until you just get good at it; no other way to put it. It takes the best of its inspirations, like NES Castlevania and Rastan Saga, and bundles it into a tight, challenging game. Also, there is appreciable thoughtfulness in enemy placement/levels are designed around enemy mechanics; which is always great to see. Awesome game, great job Adult Swim.			"

												SpoilersI have done my best to keep this review from spoilers so that readers can enjoy it without regretting reading it. As with food though, there might be some traces of ""allergens"".My experience of older gamesI grew up playing the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, Super Nintendo (SNES), and Game Boy (first generation). I found it appropriate for me to write my first review on this particular game since it belongs to a genre that I hold very dear. The SNES console is my all time favourite game system.GraphicsVölgarr truly captures the feeling and aestethics of games of the past! People who have played a game called Rastan seem to recognise elements from that game and while I never played it, based on pictures on Google I see why. The enemies and levels are clearly inspired from that game.The graphics remind me, however, of another game which I think Völgarr resembles at least as much: ActRaiser II. This game was released on the SNES console and Völgarr's graphics are defenitely 16-bit. The character's poses, movement and moves and also the music and variance in level themes resemble in a way those in ActRaiser II.One thing that reveals Völgarr is a modern game is the background/the horizon which has been blurred to give a sence of depth. While the purpouse is obvious, I have never seen that in a 16-bit game and would have preferred graphics limited to the style of the time. Sence of depth was very well achieved in the old games too, but one pixel was one pixel and could never be blurred.GameplayThis game could easily have been published back in the early 90's. The character moves just like in a viking/swordsman/fantasy themed SNES-game: Relatively slowly, giving a sence of weight (muscles, armor, weapons and muscels). The attack moves are slightly delayed and need to be perfectly timed just like in the old games (if you remember games like Altered Beast you know timing is everything!)The controls are 2 buttons + arrows / 4 buttons + arrows depending on how you choose to play. if you want one button for each action, you go with 4. I chose to go with 2, which means e.g. that throwing a spear = UP + ACTION.Let's just lean back for a moment and enjoy the nostalgia...Right, let's continue!One of the main themes the developers advertise in the game trailer is dying. All of us who played NES, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Master System or Sega Mega Drive games know what it feels like to fail over and over and over again. It was so frustrating, yet addictive. You HAD to beat that level and you HAD to figure out what series of moves and attacks the boss had in order to beat him/her. Völgarr captures this beautifully! Just getting through the first level/world and beat the boss feels like conquering the world! (The developers of Völgarr have been kind though - back in the days you had often limited lives, limited ""Continues"", and sometimes no checkpoints at all!)After a while, when you decide to play the game all over again, you suddenly realise how good you've gotten at this game. You're wielding your sword and throwing spears as if you were born doing so. That moment made me smile - it really brings back memories...My thoughts (who am I kidding - you know what I'm gonna say!)I LOVE THIS GAME and anyone who grew up with or has ever happened to fall in love with 16-bit games in particular will too! I began this review feeling quite sophisticated but after writing this and realising how much I really like this game, I end up feeling like a kid on saturday morning - waiting for my best friend to come over for a sleepover with snacks and video games all night!I really have to try to fix my SNES console (showing black sreen of death)...

												This game was made for people who have alot of extra time on there hands and love replaying levels over and over. Why do I say this? Because its the hardest game I have ever played in my life! I am at eight hours of play time and have only made it to the second level! Why you may ask? Well because it has no save feature so every time you are forced to have a life, job or break. You start back at the begining of the game! It said I can walk to the left but it dosn't freaking work for me if I exit the game.

												This is a hard and unforgivable 2D platformer. You'll need to learn a set of rules as the behaviors of your ennemies, the topographie of the level and the effect of the different items you can find.You'll die a lot and restart at the last checkpoint, which doesn't last between game sessions (you'll have to restart from the start everytime you restart the game). In this game, you learn through experience and hard work. However, once you understand the game mechanics, you'll genuinely feel proud of yourself seeing your badass viking prolifically chop monsters away.			"

												It's okay, not as good as I was hoping.Volgarr the Viking is a very deliberately paced linear action-platformer. Think Castlevania 1 or 3.The distinguishing feature of this game is that it's pretty difficult due to some unusual, unforgiving design choices. For starters, you have no horizontal air control at all, like the old Castlevanias, though you have a double jump. There is also a surprising amount of recovery after landing a jump. In addition, you die after only 1-3 hits, and getting hit causes you to lose an entire tier of power-ups.The problem I have with the game is that it doesn't seem difficult in a particularly fun way. For example, at the very beginning you're going to die a ton just learning what you can block, enemy behavior, how to space jumps, and how to deal with enemies coming from above and below you. There's no real tutorial level to teach you the basics, which just means you're going to die a lot.On top of that, the health system is really brutal. The game basically rewards you hugely for playing perfectly by giving you a way better weapon and better defense, but as soon as you take any 1 hit you lose that advantage. It's a weird system, because the game essentially becomes harder the less good you are the game. If you're really good and can play levels perfectly, you'll coast along with a weapon that does double damage with extra range, better blocking, and which is faster, along with the buffer health. If you're imperfect, you have to make do with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons/blocking.On top of all that, it's a very slow game, that's very low on improvization or surprises. Everything is very predictable, and the game moves at such a deliberate pace that it's principally a memorization/timing challenge.There are some cool moments in the levels, and the graphics have a really nice aesthetic, but it's just not a very fun game to play. It's very much a game about perfectionism, and it's just not really very fun to learn. I'm actually a big fan of the old, hard platformer castlevanias, and 2d action-platformers in general, but this game is just not a particularly good example of the genre.			"

												The game is a simple sidescroller action title, wherein every time you go through a section without taking damage, you get a semi-permanent addition to your health and armor and weapons, assuming you don't lose them to damage being taken. It's a neat little concept, but not quite enough to carry the game. There's nothing wrong with the game, but don't expect it to stick out other than for its decent difficulty. I guess if I had to make a comparison, it would be like eating a regular piece of toast with a little butter on it. Not really bad enough to make me spit it out, but it's not delicious enough to make me want a second helping. It's just kinda there. Get it on sale if possible.			"

Sure. - but having to start from the very beginning, each time you start the game?No. That's just being a d**k.I already did this thing back in the 80s.			"

												I finally got it :).Yess, It took me nearly 5-6 hours to perfect my gameplay and I am looking forward to finishing it and rocking all the way.[I did not play the game Rastan but this game reminded me the times when I played original Robocop on NES.This was one of the toughest I played at that times.Good old nostalgia.]This game frustrated me in the beginning and I could not call it fun as it is supposed to be but then this game just opened its heart and I could see the soul.All in all, if you got mad at the start then take it slowly to learn the mechanism.

If the controls were flawless then I would recommend this game, but it's designed to be the hardest side scrolling game in history and with it's bad controls I agree with it.			"

												RAGNAROK!  Volgarr is hardcore!  If you don't know Astyanax or Legendary Axe or at least classic Castlevania (NES, kids), you don't know anything about this.  It's old-school, it's hard, it's 80's and it's cool.  One complaint:  in order to get ENDING A, you have to play the game a TON  because you have to beat all these superhard optional ""Valkyrie"" levels on one set of lives, straight from the beginning.  I've gotten ending C and will have B when I play the game again.  I'll admit a rage uninstall resulted from the Valkyrie levels, but I immediately reinstalled it.			"

It's crushingly hard, as you would expect from a viking, but it's chock full of action, secrets, and characters with really great abs. MY abs were even toned by playing this game. Also I sprouted a full beard and skinned a bear with my teeth to make myself a loin cloth. Don't play this around bears. For their sake.			"

												Volgarr the Viking is a great throwback to the times of yore when 8-bit platformers were in their golden day.  Smooth controls, lots of enemies flooding the screen, good soundtrack and a classic double-jumping mechanism add up to make Volgarr one of if not the greatest late-model 8-bit action platformer to be made as of late.  Ignore my run on sentences and purchase Volgarr now in time for a frustratingly fun weekend!			"

The controls are responsive and you really feel in control.In the name of Odin Allfather, play this game.			"

That aside, I'd have to say the game is perfect. If you enjoy skill-based 2D combat action platformers, this is absolutely the game for you. Just think of ActRaiser 2 on SNES, Legend of Zelda 2 on NES, or perhaps Gargoyles on the Genesis; you get the idea.			"

												I've finally beaten this f***er! VOLGARR THE VIKING was probably made to torture people. I mean I literally was close to crying once after the hundredth-retry. I'm not kidding! Volgarr is hard, extremely hard... but not unfair. Every mistake you make is your fault, not the fault of the game. If i had to describe the gameplay of VOLGARR THE VIKING I had to choose this: A combination of CASTELVANIA, GHOULS AND GOBLINS and THE LEGEND OF ZELDA2 THE ADVENTURE OF LINK. Those 3 games combined but ten-times harder. And trust me it's difficult to make a game that is harder than GHOULS AND GOBLINS. Playing Volgarr is kinda like playing memory... on acid. If you would hand me a piece of paper and a pen I could draw a map for all the levels I've beaten, without looking it up. I know every bit of this game by heart and if you play it through you will too! So is Volgarr a good game? YES it is! If you are looking for a challenge, there you have one!Oh and buy a 2nd controller. You'll break one during your play through I guarantee it! "

												I'm not sure how to put this so I'll just say OH MY GOD ITS SOO ADDICTIVE AND I WANNA THROW A CHAIR AT MY DAD. Other than that though the controls are tight its fun and well paced with each stage. My only problem is that its overly diffucult. Now in my case I like hard/rage games they fuel the never ending flame of rage inside me  I will kill them all. Soon...  but the only real reason why this game is hard i feel is to increase its play time. seriously I'm not even that good at this game (he says having deathlessed ending b) but when I had a perfect speed run i got a time of 31 minutes which is really just pathetic. fun too short and boring at times. also repetitve.

												If you enjoy 8-bit & 16-bit era action platform games, this is the amalgamation of four decades of improvement to the genre. It's tough (old-school) but fair.

												If this were releaased on the SNES it wouldn't get a second look, the fact that we don't have side scrolling platformers anymore makes this a specialty product but that doesn't mean there's anything particularly special about it.It's a sidescrolling platformer; you fight enemies, get powerups that improve your attacks and armor but explode when you're hit, and eventually fight a boss at the end of each level.The game isn't too hard, you have to memorize patterns of enemies over long lengthy areas; jump when you need to, throw your spear when you should, and attack at the correct moment. The REAL BUMMER ARE THE BLOODY """"""""""""CHECKPOINTS"""""""""". The Checkpoints are FLIPPIN' MADDENING! and it's why you won't want to keep playing this game.LISTEN, I've beaten hundreds of NES games, hundreds of SNES games and yatta yatta. I presume you have also, or at least beaten a couple. If I rented this game in 1993, I would have played it for about an hour and taken it back to Blockbuster. I don't find it enjoyable, and I don't think it's worth your time.			"

												You will die constantly. The problem for me is, the death doesn't feel like it means anything. The game is difficult because the controls are clunky and the levels are difficult to navigate, so each death was frustrating rather than rewarding. I have played tons of platformers, I have no problem with dying 500 times. My frustration has nothing to do with difficulty, it has to do with the deaths seeming unfair and pointless.

Practice practice practice is the key, it's easy to be competent, but if you're a perfectionist or a completionist, nothing short of mastery will serve.

												If this were releaased on the SNES it wouldn't get a second look, the fact that we don't have side scrolling platformers anymore makes this a specialty product but that doesn't mean there's anything particularly special about it.It's a sidescrolling platformer; you fight enemies, get powerups that improve your attacks and armor but explode when you're hit, and eventually fight a boss at the end of each level.The game isn't too hard, you have to memorize patterns of enemies over long lengthy areas; jump when you need to, throw your spear when you should, and attack at the correct moment. The REAL BUMMER ARE THE BLOODY """"""""""""CHECKPOINTS"""""""""". The Checkpoints are FLIPPIN' MADDENING! and it's why you won't want to keep playing this game.LISTEN, I've beaten hundreds of NES games, hundreds of SNES games and yatta yatta. I presume you have also, or at least beaten a couple. If I rented this game in 1993, I would have played it for about an hour and taken it back to Blockbuster. I don't find it enjoyable, and I don't think it's worth your time.			"

												Definitely my favourite platformer. It has tight controls, great enemy, boss and level design. Music gives a good atmosphere which gets you pumped and really puts you in the game. Controls are spot on, everything is responsive and just feels good. Jumping is quite tricky, no turning mid air except with the second jump, which creates difficulty in jumping if you are too hasty. It's not very hard to learn, atleast from my own experience, but satisfying to pull off well.Enemies are generally predictable from first sight, but still makes you work them into your muscle memory. They are all fair, and the tough ones are generally first put in a position where you will have an easier time fighting them, and after youve beaten them once they will re-appear later on but in a much trickier spot where it will make you really think more than just using what you learnt from fighting them the first time.Bosses can be tricky, but very manageable the first time around. They telegraph their attacks clearly and you can adapt to it if you have a good feel for these kinds of games.The level design is great because it always manages to make you use all of your tools, tricky doublejumps, spear throws and rolls. Not too many instant death pits, instead enemies will be the real threats. Enemy spawns are pretty much always the same, so memorizing them is great fun when youve gotten to the point of nearly speedrunning through levels, trying to get the best ending.Like mentioned theres also different endings, and by running through the game once the normal way a new player would, you fight your way through the basic maps and get the, well, bad ending. But if you beat a level while not getting hit too many times you will get Warrior spirits that take you to the same themed levels, but with a much harder design. This makes for a great second playthrough attempting to get the best ending by beating all the hard maps.			"

												When a store page uses words like ""old school hard"" or ""brutal difficulty"", I can see the appeal. Völgarr the Viking is hard in the same way that early entries in the Castlevania series are hard. Yes, it's not something that just anyone can pick up, play, and enjoy. No, this is not necessarily a good thing, but some players need that extra bit of a triumphant feeling in completing a level.   One thing that's clear from the very outset is that this is in no way one of those modern games that so many grognards accuse of excessive handholding. No, you're thrown right into the world from the beginning, with no direction but the innate instinct to go right. Be sure to check out the game's manual, too, as it explains a few helpful concepts that the game's (intentionally) meager tutorial might not make explicitly clear. Be sure to check it out, also, for the fact that it's a loving recreation of the kinds of manuals one finds packaged with (better) retro cartridge games, although black and white would have lent that extra sense of nostalgia.   The graphics are old-school only in the sense that there's a (relatively) limited color palette and movement occurs in only two dimensions, as you slash and spear your way through seemingly endless ranks of palette-swapped enemies of varying strength and ability. There's clearly a lot of love on display in the general and specific ""feel"" of it all.   Völgarr the Viking is absolutely not for everyone, and it never intends to be, but if you're of the kind who enjoys approaching combat as just as much of a puzzle in rhythm and positioning as the rest of the level, it might just be the game for you.

Volgarr the Viking is a platformer, beat-em-up game. It's the kind of game that brings back memories from the 8, 16, maybe even 32-bit era. It has many similarities to good old games such as Ninja Gaiden or Ghosts n' Goblins. Let me tell you one thing, if you like a challenge, this game is the game for you!Overall: I'd give it a 7.3/10. Its good, but I'm kind of put off by this game by multiple factors.Controls & Handling: 8/10. I used the Xbox 360 Controller for the game, and it was kind of awkward at first, using the joystick as movement. I prefer using the D-Pad and luckily, they added the option to! Some other controls are kind of weird like your double jumps acts as an attack move, so I keep on pushing my attack button in the air instead of my jump button, but that's my fault. Some tights spots that are downward are kind of iffy, but the Right Trigger also acts as a ""Pogo Attack"", so I'll leave it at that.Graphics: 6/10. The graphics are supposed to be two dimensional and blocky, reminiscent of the older times, but blood... blood everywhere. Sometimes unnecessarily large amounts of blood. In all honesty, it kind of puts me off.Storyline: To be honest, I couldn't get far enough to see if there was any storyline. It just made me so mad! It's really  challenging.Music: 8/10. It really fits the game, and it's viking theme. I don't know how to describe it... like... Nordic? Viking?			"

												From the outset I couldn't help but notice the similarities between this and the arcade classic 'Rastan'.  In places, the level design is pretty much a carbon copy.  Volgarr however is a significantly different beast.  The checkpoint restart system and unique moves set give this game an irresistible one more go replay value.  The difficulty level is set just right too.  You will die repeateatedly - very repeatedly - but you'll always know it's your own fault, and with a little practice everything is achievable. This is one of the main things that makes Volgarr so enjoyable.It's nothing special graphically, but this appears to be the intention.  The game's obviously going for a retro approach to the graphics, and to be honest it benefits from it.  It just wouldn't feel the same with slick, HD visuals.If you're still not sure, go check it out on YouTube.  If it looks like it appeals to you, you'll love it.			"

												Volgarr the viking teaches you how much of a little ♥♥♥♥♥ you are, and in a rough way.It shows how used to modern game tropes, easy victories you are. But the great part, in a masochistic irony, is that it makes you want more. Unlike games like the AVGN game, claiming to do that, it feels harsh, but fair. Enemies are placed and combat is designed to favor planning and strategy, akin to old Castlevania games, and it just feels good to slice opponents.I wish you could save between levels, sure when you die you get to restart, but I don't necessairly have time to beat it all in one shot. Oh, what is it game devs? I am wong? You can?!""Just FYI, for levels on the main path you can skip levels you have already completed. Details are in the FAQ pinned in the discussions section."" -- Zauron  [developer]Ooooh.If you want to test your skills, get it, then git gud.			"

I'd say this game plays a lot like Rastan with much better graphics. It would be nice to be able to adjust how fast Volgarr moves, but overall I'm happy with my purchase.The game is difficult and can be frustrating at times, however, I feel the same way about Rastan. If you like Rastan, and can over look its flaws, then you may like Volgarr just as much---and be able to overlook its flaws as well.			"

												This is definitely a game made for a small audience, and I'm super grateful to the developers for making it. You only ever have two weapons: a sword and a throwing spear. The sword can be used in a few ways and upgraded to a fire version (if you're good enough), but the real star of the show is the spear. Not only can it be used to attack enemies from afar (infinitely), but it can also be used to make platforms to stand on by throwing them at walls. And that's not just a fun gimmick... there are numerous chests out of reach through normal means until you find clever ways to throw spears and make paths to them.That's also how much of the battles unfold. It's not really a good idea to charge ahead and hope for the best so much as learn how enemies attack and make deliberate movements in order to vanquish them. The bosses work the same way too. Believe me, you'll die plenty of times fighting them, but each death helps you learn their pattern and once you know it, you can bring them down without taking a hit. Thank goodness for unlimited lives, eh?Just in case it isn't hard enough, there's actually a harder alternate version of each stage (with limited lives) that you can only get to by playing the previous stage near-flawlessly. And the only way to get the best ending is to do that for every stage.If you miss the good ol' days of fair but unrelenting difficulty, pick this sucker up.			"

												Fantastically difficult in a Super Meat Boy kind of way. Good time waster if you have the patience to keep playing after a really BS death. Possibly a good game to play while in queue on League of Legends or any downtime during another game. Other games that fit this genre of 'games to play while you play other games' would probably be: Super Meat Boy, Binding Of Isaac, Hotline Miami, Rogue Legacy.I haven't played much but if this were my type of game (as is the case with many friends of mine), I could see it being very fun to attempt to do the same thing but faster, smoother, or more carefully. Again, if you have the patience and like games that you are most likely going to have to keep playing doing the same thing over and over again to progress you will probably like this game.Recommend a Controller7-8/10			"

												If you like torture by pixels, pick up this game. I've been playing for about two and a half hours and I still can't get by the second level. Maddengingly frustrating, but an overall satisfying 16-bit experience. One of these days I will win... one of these days.			"

												This is the greatest video game ever made in a long time. I wish there was a dedicated arcade cabinet for this game, or at least a Sega Genesis cart. This game will rip you apart, every section in each level is a new learning experience, you make a little progress, then you get punished. I wish more games were made like this.			"

												This game is really awesome and is a throwback to 16-bit snes action games. But this game is HARD. I only recommend this game if you're into retro action games with no checkpoints. If you die, you start the entire level from the beginning. You die in one hit, unless you pick up a powerup then it adds one-hit to your life. But for the most part, you want to get through the levels without getting hit at all. This game is all about fast reaction time and memorizing the level.			"

												SpoilersI have done my best to keep this review from spoilers so that readers can enjoy it without regretting reading it. As with food though, there might be some traces of ""allergens"".My experience of older gamesI grew up playing the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, Super Nintendo (SNES), and Game Boy (first generation). I found it appropriate for me to write my first review on this particular game since it belongs to a genre that I hold very dear. The SNES console is my all time favourite game system.GraphicsVölgarr truly captures the feeling and aestethics of games of the past! People who have played a game called Rastan seem to recognise elements from that game and while I never played it, based on pictures on Google I see why. The enemies and levels are clearly inspired from that game.The graphics remind me, however, of another game which I think Völgarr resembles at least as much: ActRaiser II. This game was released on the SNES console and Völgarr's graphics are defenitely 16-bit. The character's poses, movement and moves and also the music and variance in level themes resemble in a way those in ActRaiser II.One thing that reveals Völgarr is a modern game is the background/the horizon which has been blurred to give a sence of depth. While the purpouse is obvious, I have never seen that in a 16-bit game and would have preferred graphics limited to the style of the time. Sence of depth was very well achieved in the old games too, but one pixel was one pixel and could never be blurred.GameplayThis game could easily have been published back in the early 90's. The character moves just like in a viking/swordsman/fantasy themed SNES-game: Relatively slowly, giving a sence of weight (muscles, armor, weapons and muscels). The attack moves are slightly delayed and need to be perfectly timed just like in the old games (if you remember games like Altered Beast you know timing is everything!)The controls are 2 buttons + arrows / 4 buttons + arrows depending on how you choose to play. if you want one button for each action, you go with 4. I chose to go with 2, which means e.g. that throwing a spear = UP + ACTION.Let's just lean back for a moment and enjoy the nostalgia...Right, let's continue!One of the main themes the developers advertise in the game trailer is dying. All of us who played NES, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Master System or Sega Mega Drive games know what it feels like to fail over and over and over again. It was so frustrating, yet addictive. You HAD to beat that level and you HAD to figure out what series of moves and attacks the boss had in order to beat him/her. Völgarr captures this beautifully! Just getting through the first level/world and beat the boss feels like conquering the world! (The developers of Völgarr have been kind though - back in the days you had often limited lives, limited ""Continues"", and sometimes no checkpoints at all!)After a while, when you decide to play the game all over again, you suddenly realise how good you've gotten at this game. You're wielding your sword and throwing spears as if you were born doing so. That moment made me smile - it really brings back memories...My thoughts (who am I kidding - you know what I'm gonna say!)I LOVE THIS GAME and anyone who grew up with or has ever happened to fall in love with 16-bit games in particular will too! I began this review feeling quite sophisticated but after writing this and realising how much I really like this game, I end up feeling like a kid on saturday morning - waiting for my best friend to come over for a sleepover with snacks and video games all night!I really have to try to fix my SNES console (showing black sreen of death)...

At any rate, if you played Rastan or Black Tiger in arcades, this throwback by [AS] Games will have you dripping in nostalgia in no time.  The training level is almost literally ripped from level 1 of Rastan (third time is the charm, wiki it if you haven't already).  Pick up this difficult, spritey goodness today!			"

												Really great game ,each level is totaly different experience.Well done monsters design and matching soundtrack. Some people may say that this game is hard only because bad controls ,but it's not true (just because you can't complete game by holding one button and pressing forward like in some modern games it doesn't mean that controls are bad.) you can learn them pretty quickly.And while inability to correct jump mid-air may seem huge drawback at first , after a while you can easly predict how far will you jump and where will you land.While only few levels , they will last for quite long 'cuz you'll need many tries (end after each besides first there is it's harder version to add even more challenge) and every chapter feels and plays really different so you won't get bored .Of course there could be more content and some additions but the only thing this game really lacks is some good intro (Moonstone: A Hard Days Knight comes to mind)			"

												9/10This has got to be the hardest game I've ever played... and I love it. It's so satisfying to learn each world to the point where you get point-perfect movement and the flow needed to reach the boss. You aren't God, ya know? You mess up and you're done for.Game's got a good feel. It teaches you elements of each level at the start of that level. Really good game design. It's really gratifying to destroy the boss of each level, considering how hard it was to get there, keeping the gear you acquired, no less. The game makes maaaaany, subtle references to older games from the 90s, and does so quite well, even.Great music, great art, really immersive.The one lost point is for the level before the end boss. Never a fan of fighting every enemy in the game one last time.I highly recommend this game. It's a great game.			"

It's old-school, it's hard, it's 80's and it's cool.  One complaint:  in order to get ENDING A, you have to play the game a TON  because you have to beat all these superhard optional ""Valkyrie"" levels on one set of lives, straight from the beginning.  I've gotten ending C and will have B when I play the game again.  I'll admit a rage uninstall resulted from the Valkyrie levels, but I immediately reinstalled it.			"

												This game is ridiculously fun. It's claim as a Nintendo Hard game is completely true; not thinking your way through the game will result in death. Not that death requires you to not think it through, you'll just die less from thinking. Knowing and personalizing the controls is the first step in beating this; being able to have every control down will help a lot, since this game requires you to be able to deftly dodge and strike when needed. The bosses can be very puzzle like, since you need to know when to dodge, strike, or otherwise act.Volgarr has two attacks: sword and spear. The sword will probably be used most often, but throwing the spear not only gives you a ranged attack, but can also MAKE A PLATFORM TO STAND AND JUMP FROM. That's incredible! And this isn't just a feature, you are required to use this ability to make it through the game. Alive. There are many secret areas that make you think ""I know what to do, but how"", as you need to figure out where to throw spears and where to jump onto those spears.Volgarr, being a viking, is a badass. Enemies, being dangerous, can rip Volgarr's armor off to kill him. You don't have a health bar, so much as armor. You start with your shield, a buckler. THEN you upgrade to a better metal shield. THEN you get a helmet! THEN A FLAMING SWORD! Each hit you endure will take a piece of armor off, until you have no shield and thus cannot block attacks. This makes being hit a punishment, not an inconvenience, which I absolutely love.Notes:You can try to avoid enemies altogether to stay alive.You can zoom out, making the graphics better and plan ahead easier.You can set the Zoom out to Toggle which will help a LOT.You can try to learn all the controls, I mean ALL, to look badass and flashy while also retaining armor.Bottom Line is; I love this game and absolutely recommend it's full price. It's hard but very rewarding, in a way that games like Rastan, Dark Souls, older Zelda games, and even Super Mario World portray. If you are easily angered, however, probably don't buy this. You will die a lot before you develop a strategy.			"

												This game tries to capture the true difficulty of classic arcade platformers. The problem is that the presentation really makes it too frustrating for all but hardcore platformer fans, as there is no real save system (you can reportedly sort of skip already beaten levels, but at a cost), no ability to control the difficulty, a tendency to put you back at the start of a level after you die, and half the levels apparently inaccessible unless you complete every level without really taking damage.Controls are fairly tight and the graphics and music are good, although in the first couple levels I only encountered the same 5 enemy sprites, 3 of which were basically recolors of the same sprite. I also have to give kudos for a Linux port that runs well, including XBox 360 controller support (even rumble works!).Still, this game is intentionally at the Ghosts 'n Goblins level of difficulty, with no concessions to casual players (e.g. old guys with rusty platforming skills who don't have lots of time to play). As a result, I can't recommend it to anyone who is not a huge fan of super-challenging platformers.			"

												If you like Super Ghouls n' Ghosts, go play that instead. This weak, though slightly humorously referential, game co-opts the parts of retro side scrollers that we like and then gives them terrible controls. The jumping and reaction time between button and action are like watching Dave disassemble HAL during the climactic scene in 2001. ""What are you doing Volgar? Would you like me to sing a song to you? I was created by Adult Swim to appeal to your retro gaming needs. The song is called 'Roundabout' by YES.""In any case, look at Adventures of Link and Mega Man or Golden Axe/Knights of the Round and then give them some love. Oh, wait! Shovelknight! Niiiiiiiice.

The controls are responsive and you really feel in control.In the name of Odin Allfather, play this game.			"

												I have a lot of respect for this game. It is certainly one of the most if not the most difficult action platformer I have ever played. Though it is tough to the max, it is equally as fun as it is tough for anyone who enjoys the classic gameplay heavily borrowed from the Rastan Saga and polished up. Not only is this game Rastan without the kinks, but it gives major nods to many classic games of the genre. The ""Rise Warrior"" at the beginning seems a lot like the ""Rise from your grave"" when you start a new game on Altered Beast; doesn't it? I've also noticed references to Castlevania, Ghouls n' Ghosts, and Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. All this has been gleaned as I'm only halfway through the second stage. I'm sure I'll catch more references as I progress, yet many probably continue to slip by right under my nose.If you have a bit of a masochistic streak and a love for all things old school platformer, GAME THIS PLAY!

												This is a breath of fresh air from the modern era of games where the first 2 hours of a game are a tutorial, every enemy has a neon flashing weakpoint, and you're fully capable of hiding everytime you scrape your knee to regain your health. No, none of that♥♥♥♥♥♥with Völgarr the Viking. This is a throwback to the glory days when games didn't hold your hand. Instead Odin hands you a sword, shield, and spear and sends you on you way with a simple ""Rise, Warrior. Don't ♥♥♥♥ this up."" It's another shining example of how being difficult without resorting to low-blows always results in an extremely rewarding experience. My one word of caution is that you'll have to play the game in a single playthrough like the old days since there's no save system. With that being said, you could easily pause and leave the game running in the background when you need to take a break. As a gauge of what you're in for, it took me 3 hours 26 minutes and 94 deaths to finish my first playthrough and I'd say I'm good at these kind of games.			"

												Among the few really bad games I've played in the last years. Hiding behind astonishingly beautiful pixel art is gameplay which, for very good reason, exists very rarely nowadays.

												When a store page uses words like ""old school hard"" or ""brutal difficulty"", I can see the appeal. Völgarr the Viking is hard in the same way that early entries in the Castlevania series are hard. Yes, it's not something that just anyone can pick up, play, and enjoy. No, this is not necessarily a good thing, but some players need that extra bit of a triumphant feeling in completing a level.   One thing that's clear from the very outset is that this is in no way one of those modern games that so many grognards accuse of excessive handholding. No, you're thrown right into the world from the beginning, with no direction but the innate instinct to go right. Be sure to check out the game's manual, too, as it explains a few helpful concepts that the game's (intentionally) meager tutorial might not make explicitly clear. Be sure to check it out, also, for the fact that it's a loving recreation of the kinds of manuals one finds packaged with (better) retro cartridge games, although black and white would have lent that extra sense of nostalgia.   The graphics are old-school only in the sense that there's a (relatively) limited color palette and movement occurs in only two dimensions, as you slash and spear your way through seemingly endless ranks of palette-swapped enemies of varying strength and ability. There's clearly a lot of love on display in the general and specific ""feel"" of it all.   Völgarr the Viking is absolutely not for everyone, and it never intends to be, but if you're of the kind who enjoys approaching combat as just as much of a puzzle in rhythm and positioning as the rest of the level, it might just be the game for you.

												Yet another retro work that tries to emulate NES difficulty games. Does it succeed? For the most part, yes.The six worlds are split into two parts with only one checkpoint at the beginning of each part. You have infinite continues, but if you die at any moment in the middle of each part (including boss fights) you'll have to start over from the beginning of that part. Völgarr can slash with his sword, hurl spears at the enemies or on walls to climb them, roll and double jump with the second jump making him do a rolling sword attack a little like in SNES Star Wars games; the only tricky part is the jumping since he can only jump straight up or in diagonals and you cannot change the trajectory once you've jumped, but for the rest it's pretty easy to control.The game is entirely deterministic (except those damn blobs), which means that you can elaborate a safe pattern to reproduce each time you play the level. This definitely helps since the levels are pretty hard and you'll probably need to restart each section many times before you understand how to get past each enemy. It will take you 5 to 8 hours to beat it once depending on your skill.Hardcore players that manage to get to the end of the level almost unharmed will also be rewarded with five alternate paths (basically 5 harder levels with max 3 lives to finish them) and if they finish each one of them you'll get an extra level at the end.Recommended to those who seek for a small, challenging but manageable game.

Back to the lizard men that'll shred you and the stupid fish people that will break your shield and your spirit. Finally you'll do great and clear away all enemies in your path. The gods will bless you and your sword will flame. Then just when victory seems possible you take a wall dart to the back and fall and fall and fall. 5 or 25 or 50 attempts later you finally beat the first boss and bask in victory. It is wonderful. It's like Odin himself let you bang his daughter. But wait you're not done. There is plenty left to pillage and plunder before you go to Vahalla and meet that hot viking goddess.

The levels are varied with many different enemy types with each having a custom boss to challenge you. In the game Your armor is your hitpoints while you attain more from the treasue chest put through out the levels increasing your strenth as well until you obtain your flaming sword.There are also other hidden  items as well as constent loot to attain. There is only 1 check point mid level other than that its a straight shot no holds bared fight for your life. There no save or password system but after a previous boss has been defeated you can travel to the left of the map to skip up to your current level.			"

												This is not a game for everyone. Period end of discussion.This game toes the line between challenging and unfair, and it does it beautifully. If you play it, you will die, a lot. You will die learning the best ways to combat different enemies, you will die learning to master the jumping for the admittedly simple platforming, you will die learning the level, you will die learning the attack patterns of the bosses.However, when you vanquish the boss for that first time. When you surpass in five minutes an admittedly short level that before took you forty-five. You will feel like a king.Its a must-buy if you, like me, love games that provide an incredible (One could almost say unfair) challenge. Otherwise do not bother, it will be a waste of your time.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, this game is tougher than a pot of boiled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!BUT IN A GOOD WAY, HONEST!It truly does live up to the claim of being hard like the games of the past. It's tons of pattern and level memorization, and always remembering what powers are at your disposal.The game is unforgiving, but does not ONCE treat the player like they're stupid. The game KNOWS you're smart and challenges you to prove it through tough enemy, trap, and obstacle placement. There's tons of trail and error, so be prepared to restart a board many a time until you know it like the back of your hand.That said though, the boards can be quite lengthy, which makes the fact that you have to clear them on one life a bit of a chore (given you have to restart from the beginning every death). That's one complaint: no mid-way checkpoints. But I suppose that's something modern games have spoiled us with. So not really a complaint, more like a ""UGHHH MODERN GAMING WHHHY"" point.Although I do have a legitimate complaint: The controls. I've been playing with a 360 pad which is a no brainer for me given this is a side scrolling platform which, in my books, demands the precision. Now, having said that, I find the controls while responsive and good, can also be pretty clunky. Does that make sense? No? Well lemme try and explain.You basically work on 3 inputs, A, X and your joystick (d-pad). A jumps, X attacks, and your joystick moves. Simple right? Well, holding up on the joystick draws your spear, and then pressing X throws said spear (and with later power ups, holding up for an extended period powers your throw). I'm not sure if it affects play or not, but sometimes while jumping, I'll hold up and draw my spear, which often gets me killed. I'm not sure if it adjusts the player's hit box while doing so, but I'm going to say it does for the sake of my argument, although it may turn out I'm just crap.Second point: You have 2 jumps. A standard leap, and pressing jump once again while in a jump will cause you to spin your sword and perform a double jump. Pretty standard fare, right?Well, if you just plain press jump, you'll jump straight up and be unable to move, but if you move and jump, you're committed to your jump arch (think original Castlevania style). So, ok, not so bad right?This is where things get UUGHGHHHH.If you are in mid jump arch and double jump without holding the intended direction you want to go in, your second jump CANCELS your jump arch.Now I know WHY they did it, for more precise platforming, but it can really mess you up if you don't anticipate the game. And one slip up means you can be toast and have to start all over again. It's a bit frustrating.GOOD POINTS THOUGH!The simplistic controls take getting used to, but they can be mastered easily since there isn't a whole lot of complexity to them (besides what I listed above). And while restarting a level is a pain, the pixel art is soooo gorgeous and the animations are so smooth and nice that it eases that pain a bit.As well, the game does a great job of building avatar strength through the power up system, and the best example of this is through the spears.Just plain Jane, you can throw a basic spear and more often than not, it'll kill an enemy in one hit and destroy itself. A second upgrade will give you a shield that can block up to two hits. Now this third upgrade gives you a slightly cooler looking shield AND powers up your spear. How does this affect your spear? Well now you can ♥♥♥♥ING PIN GUYS TO WALLS! It's so bad♥♥♥♥♥ let me tell you. If you can nail a line of enemies with a fully charged spear, nothing screams satisfaction like watching them all get sent flying by your man-missile. Upgrades beyond this add additional hit points to the player, and eventually a fire spraying sword.In short, if you're looking for a classic feeling game with a steep (but rewarding) challenge, pick it up!If you're looking for something a bit more relaxed, you may want to look else where.I give Volgarr an 8 out of 10!

												This game is almost as great as it is manly.  While I get pumped about anything involving Vikings or throwing axes, this game is definitely worth the hype.  Solid gameplay, great soundtrack, appropriately minimalist story, and I just can't get over how smooth everything feels.  The developers obviously spent a lot of time and effort fine-tuning the movement and combat mechanics.  You'll realize that as soon as you start playing.I highly recommend this game if you enjoy a challenge in the form of a brutal, NES-style beat 'em up.			"

												Fun game I regret not to have tried earlier.It's very much in the good old Gouls'n'Ghosts-like platformer, slightly less difficult thanks to better controls (even when playing using the keyboard), however remaining very challenging. I still have to go more through the game, but the first contact really reminded me of good platformers I used to play as a kid.Very nice die-and-retry game. Can be a little frustrating due to this, but that's precisely the purpose of this game, so, you know where you're going when playing it!			"

The environments were stunning, the characters were charming, and the fighting felt like a puzzle (in a good way). This isnt a long game but it makes up for that with quality. I picked this up in a bundle but looking back I beleive it is undboutedly worth the sticker price.You can beat it in about one weekend. Maybe one day if you no-life it. Still, I wish the awesome soudtrack from the games trailer would be included with the campaign. It only made an appearance in the credits.  "

Volgarr the Viking is a platformer, beat-em-up game. It's the kind of game that brings back memories from the 8, 16, maybe even 32-bit era. It has many similarities to good old games such as Ninja Gaiden or Ghosts n' Goblins. Let me tell you one thing, if you like a challenge, this game is the game for you!Overall: I'd give it a 7.3/10. Its good, but I'm kind of put off by this game by multiple factors.Controls & Handling: 8/10. I used the Xbox 360 Controller for the game, and it was kind of awkward at first, using the joystick as movement. I prefer using the D-Pad and luckily, they added the option to! Some other controls are kind of weird like your double jumps acts as an attack move, so I keep on pushing my attack button in the air instead of my jump button, but that's my fault. Some tights spots that are downward are kind of iffy, but the Right Trigger also acts as a ""Pogo Attack"", so I'll leave it at that.Graphics: 6/10. The graphics are supposed to be two dimensional and blocky, reminiscent of the older times, but blood... blood everywhere. Sometimes unnecessarily large amounts of blood. In all honesty, it kind of puts me off.Storyline: To be honest, I couldn't get far enough to see if there was any storyline. It just made me so mad! It's really  challenging.Music: 8/10. It really fits the game, and it's viking theme. I don't know how to describe it... like... Nordic? Viking?			"

												This game is a solid platformer and a heck of a good time. The whole game has very little random chance and when you do well it's because you improved your skill. It also lends itself to speedrunning by including in game timers that allow you to check if your beating your old record.Cons: is that the game is a bit on the short side, A speed runner could destroy it in around fifty minites. Also the only way to learn is to die, if you don't like games that use that as a teaching tool then stay away.			"

												Imagine Dark Souls as a retro-styled platformer. New players will have a hell of a time adjusting to the game's difficulty curve. Fortunately there are no lives in this game: every death sends you back to the start of the level, pondering on what went wrong in your last attempt. Every death is a learning experience, and if you persist, you'll find a solid, satisfying platformer in Volgarr the Viking.Also, flaming swords. What more could you want?			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Volgarr the Viking is a game developed by Crazy Viking Studios and published by Adult Swim Games. This game is very challengingI will only recommend this game, if you want a very challenging but a good well designed game. If you are looking for a game that you can simply breeze through, stay far, far away from this gameThis game is very responsive and accurate with its controls however it is strongly recommended to play with a controllerOverall, this is a well-designed, albeit very challenging, action platformer. It has stiff jumping mechanics, challenging level design, two-hit deaths, and a medieval/fantasy setting in the format of an action platformerI would only recommend it to people who really want a challenge, otherwise, steer clear away from Volgarr the Viking RECOMMENDED :)  Also, best to play with a controller  "

												This game is clearly a modern updated take on Rastan. That was a game I liked as a kid but never got much into because the game never seemed worth suffering its own difficulty. This game falls into the same category for me. It's got so much good stuff, but the start-over-from-way-back-when-you-die mechanic really died out for me with the Super Nintendo. The notion that fun is replaying a large section over and over again where one hit equates to failure isn't my cup of tea anymore. It also features that other classic mechanic: knock-back-on-hit (if you're lucky, not straight into a pit). So despite the moderately udpated retro graphics, a decent soundtrack, and controls that feature some depth, the game fails to be something I'd recommend in general. If you're looking for an old school feel in a modern package, this may be one of the best offerings in that regards. But for someone who has played hundreds of those games, and is no longer looking for that kind of time wasting or frustration potential, I have to pass. 6/10 "

												If remembering the term 'Arcade difficulty' brings fond feelings, and you love 16-bit style action platformers, then this is definitely the game for you. While I'm sad to say that Volgarr the Viking is unabashedly and brutally difficult, to the point that you have to beat the game in one sitting; it is a hella enjoyable experience that, seemingly as it should, encourages you to master every aspect of it from the simple and fun controls to the intricately designed levels and enemy placement. In fact, you can 100% completely own any and all mistakes you will make while playing it - I've never said or believed that to have happened in any game I've played before it.But once you do... Let's just say that Asgard hath no fury like a rampaging Viking. To boot, I've heard this game was heavily pirated and massively undersold. FIX THAT!! IT'S A GREAT GAME!!			"

												Oh man... Did you game in the 80s? Classic NES such as Ninja Gaiden and Wizards & Warriors? Do you love a game that is unapologetically tough (but not unfair)? Do you remember sinking quarters into Stryder? If the answer is yes, this game is totally for you. No save points, just check points. You die, you start the level over. Get to the boss and die? You start the level over. Quit the game? Start the game from the start. Never unfair or cheap, this game pushes you (much in the same way as Dark Souls but this isn't near the sadist/masochist relationship of that).I can't recommend this game enough for us in our late 20s to late 30s. This is the stuff we grew up on. A fantastic homage. If you like metal, it's like the Skeletonwitch/Havok/Municpal Waste of video games.MAYBE some of the youngins will join the club of tough games for toughness sake. And maybe we'll let them in. ;)			"

												If you like Super Ghouls n' Ghosts, go play that instead. This weak, though slightly humorously referential, game co-opts the parts of retro side scrollers that we like and then gives them terrible controls. The jumping and reaction time between button and action are like watching Dave disassemble HAL during the climactic scene in 2001. ""What are you doing Volgar? Would you like me to sing a song to you? I was created by Adult Swim to appeal to your retro gaming needs. The song is called 'Roundabout' by YES.""In any case, look at Adventures of Link and Mega Man or Golden Axe/Knights of the Round and then give them some love. Oh, wait! Shovelknight! Niiiiiiiice.

												A tough-but-fair platformer with heavy 16/32-bit influences. The levels are full of hazzards and enemies that will destroy you if you aren't careful, so this is not a game to blaze through; instead, you must take your time and plan your actions. You will die a lot, but there is no life system (unless you attempt the hard endings) so you can take what you've learned and get right back into it. I greatly enjoyed the gameplay, and the music is fantastic.Piece of advice: open the options menu, go into settings, and activate the ""look ahead as toggle"" option. This allows you to zoom out the screen and keep it that way until you press the zoom button again (space by default). This lets you see further ahead and have more warning from enemies.			"

												I've played this game for many hours. I beat it with one hand. I have traveled the lands as Volgarr and can say that this is one of my favorite games out there. It's so much fun trying to lower your time on each level and it has me coming back again and again. 11/10 would speed run over and over!			"

												What can I say? Volgarr takes me back in time to the golden era of gaming, when games gave you a proper sense of accomplishment, didn't treat you like a retard and were designed as brain- and finger-teasers.I don't even really mind sparse checkpoints, because when you finally get to one, you fly like a pro through the level, slaughtering everything in your way without giving it a chance and laughing in face of traps you found a clever way to work around. 10/10, we need more games like this!

												Just one hint: making a game laborious doesn't make it hard. Forcing the player to waste his time replaying the entire level doesn't increase the difficulty of the game, it just makes the whole process even more pointless. Pixellating your graphics doesn't make the game ""8-bit"" or ""retro"". Also, intimidating the players and making them avoid criticising the game for fear of looking like incompetent players isn't a very honest way of making games. Okay, those were four hints, but who's counting?			"

												Good but infuriating controls that always make you die... check.Monsters who abuse cheap tricks simply to make you yell at them... check.Level design that will make you question your inteligence even more than your ability to play this game... check.Retro looking graphics that will take you back to the past to a time where controllers where flying low... check.Music with a good beat to appease the blood rushing through your veins as you slowly become a viking of olde... check.Gentlemen... this is a lost classic of the most glorious era of gaming and should have been released in the 90's.I have spoken!

												Solid, heavy, and brutal.The controls support the notion that you are a heavy, strong viking. The game is quite difficult and requires mastering the controls in order to succeed. Solid plaforming and combat come together to make this a challenging adventure.Controls are stiff, but rather than taking away from the player's experience it adds more of a ""heavy"" and ""strong"" feeling behind actions, fitting in with the theme of the character and setting. Enemies and levels are designed around these controls so deaths, while frequent and frustrating, are ""fair"" and lend themselves to helping the player become better through experience.Enemy movements are subtly varied but tailored around the player's controls, forcing the player to adapt tactics while perfecting his handle on the controls.I recommend this to fans of hard-core platformers.

												Rise, Warrior! ROAR!Volgarr the Viking is an awesome game. It has great graphics, excellent gameplay and a great soundtrack. There will be minor spoilers for the story:You play Volgarr, a viking with a mighty sword and an unlimited supply of spears that he can use to attack enemies or use as platforms. Your task is to travel through five worlds (each consisting of two sections) and defeat the bosses to open Fafnir's tower. Should you be good enough, you can obtain warrior spirits that serve as lives to play the more difficult parts of worlds 2-6. Depending on what you do, you can earn one out of three endings.Mark my words though: This game is not for everybody. It has a high difficulty spike. Playing Volgarr for the first time can be extremely frustrating. I spent 3 hours of my first playthrough in the first two worlds before I got good enough alone. However the more I learned how to control Volgarr and the neat tricks he can do, the easier it got. Now I got all achievements and just completed the game a second time on the Valkyrie path.I would say that Volgarr is basically Dark Souls the Jump n' Run. Once you have learned the game's tricks, it becomes extremely enjoyable and rewarding. Try to answer these questions:Do you like to get challenged by a game?Do you like to try, try, try again until you finally beat a world?Do you like to eventually master a hard game and feel like a beast when you played through it a second, third or even fourth and so forth time?If you can answer all these questions with yes, then you should check out Volgarr. If you don't like to get constantly killed until you finally mastered a difficult section, then better turn around now and look for something else to play.			"
