												Thirty Flights of Loving is an indie art game which I found short, obtuse and largely uninteresting.Speaking as someone who loved Dear Esther, and even Thirty Flights' developer's previous game ('Gravity Bone', which is included here as a free extra), I found myself thoroughly bewildered by Thirty Flights of Loving.I was bewildered by the sloppy non-linear storytelling. The game hops, skips, and leaps, with all the grace of a big rig in a tutu. I've played through the whole game and read several summaries to make sure I wasn't missing anything, but even once I made sense of the story being told (a by-the-books tale of a criminal caper gone wrong), it didn't connect with me at all.I was bewildered by the lack of flow within the gameplay. For such a short game, I was astonished to find myself stuck on at least two occasions. Normally I'd be the last person to call for such handholding tactics as blatant signposting or railroading of the player, but in this case the current state is completely at odds with the intended purpose. The developer obviously wants to tell a story, but I found it a trial just to get to the next part. This is not to mention the pointless interactions in the game which sometimes seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.I was bewildered by the end. It came out of nowhere, and left me with the strongest feeling of 'is that it?' I think I've ever encountered with a game. I spent more time in the options menu than I did with the game itself. I wouldn't mind if it was some kind of masterpiece of storytelling, but it just wasn't.Most of all, I was and am bewildered by the praise this game has garnered. 88% (at the time of writing) on Metacritic. Critical acclaim. Fans on the forums defending it to the hilt. I saw similar reactions to Dear Esther (which, as I said earlier, I felt deserved every bit of its praise), but I genuinely cannot understand it in this case.Maybe I'm missing something huge here, but Thirty Flights of Loving was not an enjoyable, enlightening, or otherwise entertaining experience for me. I respect any developer who attempts to tell stories through games, but this feels like one of the more unfinished, unfocused efforts that I have played. Not recommended.			"

												I'm sorry, but I don't get this game nor do I understand why so many people rave about it. Although the art direction is certainly unique, it's meant to be more of a fast-paced walking simulator than anything else. Supposedly there is something meta or symbolic about the game and its method of storytelling, but I'll be damned if I can figure out what it is. And the story is so intentionally vague that it's difficult to get anything out of it.I really did try to get something out of it. I love games that try to do something different and try to approach story-telling from different perspectives. Games like ""Dear Esther"", ""Journey"", ""Going Home"" and so forth were some of the most amazing experiences I've played because of their unique way of getting the story across. But I got nothing out of this game. Nothing.			"

												5 euro, are you ♥♥♥♥ing high? So glad I got this in the humble bundle and not actually on steam, I would never have felt so cheated on steam than if I had actually payed five euro for this. I could buy four burgers at mcdonalds for a euro less and get a longer lasting and more enjoyable experience. Get out with your ""It's art man you don't get it"" bull sh*t. This is lazy and boring. Unless you are into pretending you're high and mighty for liking some obscure ""modern  video game art"" then I'd avoid this. It can literally be finished in less than ten minutes. Definitely not worth the money. I would only recommend playing this if you wished to see what's up with the mixed reviews and if you literally have total free time with nothing better to do, and I mean nothing. Even stabbing myself in the finger would have been a more enjoyable experience, at least that would have envoked some sort of emotional response other than utter boredom.			"

												This is the shortest 'game' I have ever played on Steam. I took about 20 minutes, and I did it all again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Seriously, when it ended, I simply couldn't believe it. It's shorter than most flash games.However, even if you ingore its ridiculous length, you still have the fact that it's barely interactive enough to even be called a 'game' in the first place. You just run from one area to another and things happen around you, to an extent, but nothing much happens to you. In short, you are not even involved in this tiny title's escapades. merely a biwildered bystander.Luckily, I got this in some bundle or other so it didn't cost me very much. For the poor shmucks who actually payed good money for it (15 dollars for 15 minutes  (or so) 'fun' .... I feel genuinely sorry for them.			"

Short, Sweet, Bloody, Like!Rating : GreatShort game that is told in scenes in a asynchronous way. Blendo games is known for releasing games that take radical different approach to story telling and does this again in this game. It's like you watch the most important pieces of a movie shuffled around. The game has some activity where you have to walk and solve some easy puzzles (?) to advance, but other than that it is just enjoying the scenery, trying to understand and connect the story.The game was build in a modified Doom engine using a typical style which totally fits the game mechanics. Audio and soundtrack are great and fit the game perfectly.You can speed run this game in 5 minutes I think, but normally when you relax and enjoy the game it should take about 30 minutes. Because the story is so jumpy, it invites you to play it again just to look at the parts again. In the end the game reminds you that a game doesn't have to be long to be good and that a story can also be told by leaving out all the unnecessary parts.			"

												Unlike many ""cinematic"" games that are obsessed with copying film, I think Thirty Flights pulls off a movie-like pace and editing style better than any other game I've seen. And I think that's what this game was: an experiment in using the schizophrenic yet calculated timeline and editing of a Tarantino film (for example) and making it work within a video game boundary. It sounds pretentious, but at the end of the day, it's an interesting look at how we can tell stories in video games and that's most definitely a positive (and sorely needed) effort in our medium.

												While the game IS fun, and the art style is one that I enjoyed, for the price it is not worth it. It costs about half the price of a movie ticket, and you can beat it in less that 20 minutes. I in-depth played it (Stopping to read all the cards, payed extra attention to the environments, and tried to explore best I could, etc.) AND played through a second time on commentary mode, only to find myself clocked in at a little less than an hour. I wish  the game were a lot longer and offered a lot more. It's a great story, but for 5 dollars you should just watch it on youtube.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving: 3/10Perhaps it was because I had gone into the game with high expectations (friends saying it was great, Extra Credits recommending it, and it having an overall 88/100 Metacritic score), but I expected a great game. A good game. At least a decent game… when I beat the game, I had a sour taste in my mouth, exclaiming “what the ♥♥♥♥? That’s it?!? …”. It’s difficult to say that I feel “burned” in my purchase due to the fact that I paid about $1.50 and the fact that I didn’t do any research other than “other people generally like it” (something I would chastise someone else doing)…but I feel incredibly disappointed in the game. The first thing that I simply must state is the fact that it is short. I was “warned” of this beforehand, and I was cool with it. I’m fine with short games, so long as they “last” a bit (my view is one hour, thirty minutes and on is acceptable in most circumstances)…but this game lasted exactly 12 minutes. Yeah…12 minutes, from when I started it, to when I was done with the entire game. The ♥♥♥♥? I confused about the plot and game in general (I’ll discuss that shortly), so immediately after the game was over, I decided I was going to play it again to see what I was missing. Surely I missed something in regards to the plot or something. Thankfully, I thought, there’s a developer commentary, and so I selected that. Now, normally, this does a lot for me; as someone who’s obtained a degree in the field I find these things fascinating… but I was immensely disappointed in the commentary. Most of it was describing things that frankly wasn’t interesting (“Normally, ninety-degree angled hallways aren’t great, but after adding a bevel…”, “…I don’t approve of littering.”, etc.) and even after stopping to listen to the commentary, not only did it not shed any more light on the plot, but it lasted 15 minutes (with me taking my time and exploring, too). That adds up to 27 minutes. For beating the game twice. That’s not acceptable.I was interested in reading some of the critic’s comments on why they enjoyed the game, and a reoccurring theme was that they enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the story, and the frequent use jump-cuts. I didn’t. Let me explain what happens in the story (spoilers, obviously): you start in a hallway, letting you learn the controls of the game (WASD for movement, mouse for camera, tough stuff). You then enter a bar, unable to interact with any of the characters, who oddly stare into your soul. All you can do is consume alcohol (which does nothing, I add, other than disappearing and making a sound), and interact with a fake painting (which is among numerous paintings), opening up a secret passage, leading to the introduction of two characters (which is, admittedly, my favorite part of the game, although that’s not saying much). After this, you board a plane, and, after you leave, you’re immediately thrown into an unknown situation: your romantic interest is pointing a gun at you, in a strange location, and bloody. This is just a short summary of what you’ll encounter. And, sadly, this is about a third of the game. There’s so many random cuts to different parts of the story that you never really learn enough about the characters to care about them (and, I’m not sure if I’ve emphasized this already, but the game is short). Perhaps, in a strange way, peeling oranges with your loved one might be an intimate moment between two characters and the player, but when you’ve known the character for about two minutes, it didn’t mean anything to me. Also, I simply have to pose the question: why the hell were there three rooms dedicated to “Bernolli’s Principle” (something to do about high and low air pressure)?  So…yeah…I tried to be objective about this game and find redeeming qualities, but I just don’t see any. I mean, it’s a functional game, I guess…?TL;DR:[/b] Literally twelve minutes long, extremely brief and ambiguous plot, commentary about 90 degree hallways. Don’t waste your time with this game, no matter the price. Had I known what I know now, I wouldn’t have played the game even if it was free. "

												This is quite possibly the worst excuse for a game I have ever encountered. The game consists of about 10 different rooms, each taking about a minute to get through and suddenly out of nowhere you're hit with a The End sign and a bunch of walkthrough credits with comments about the great decisions they made and how they decided on them. These great decisions are along the lines of weird random jump cuts  that change the entire scenario for no reason. There's also a room with displays of a bunch the game models and animated GIF video timelapses of screenshots of their creation. How impressive is that?Also, there's a scene at a wedding where the characters randomly start rising up towards the ceiling. The developer notes say this was a bug, that they left in because it was so much better. Um, excuse me. This just proves how little effort they put into the game. Find a bug? Fix it? Nah. Let's just say it makes the game better. The game is practically on rails. I played it twice and nothing I did changed anything in the game beyond the room I was in.I recommend buying it if you want to see possibly the worst game ever. It cost £4 and for some reason has a very high metascore of 88. I have also heard real game reviewers saying it's a brilliant game. I'm not really sure what's going there, but it's clearly something shifty that needs to be looked at. I know I will only be relying on user reviews in future.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is a game that is'nt probably for anyone but I found this game very fascinating. Its linear storytelling is what made it absolutely beautiful. I won't really call it a game because of its longetivity, I finished the main story for approximately 10 minutes. Just imagine you bought a not-so-cheap cheeseburger and it took 10 minutes for you to eat the whole thing.( I picked up this is for $1.24 when it was on sale so if your interested on playing it, I highly recommend waiting for a sale since I think $4.99 for a 10 minutes gameplay is absurd )			"

												I get it, concise and well-written stories can be better than drawn-out ones. This does not mean, however, that because this game was simple, used an old engine, did not have any elements of gameplay, voice acting, or interactivity; that it was any good. It is not a ""game"" there is nothing different you would experience from that of watching a video of a playthrough of it, so at best it could be considered a short viewer-driven films. Even then, the ""story"" depicted was bland, generic, cliche', any of the words you can think of to infer that it added nothing new to discuss beyond its almost complete lack of content and quality. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, bad games are common, but when the ""professional"" reviews gush over how amazing it is; 9.5/10 and whatnot, you can't help but wonder if perhaps they are trying too hard to make ""art"" out of a joke.

												TFoL is... hmm... well, it's... umm... no, that's not quite right... gimme a second to think, here... uhhhhhhhhh... ok, so................. yeah. This game is kind of hard to explain. And actually, explaining it kind of defeats the purpose, anyways. So I guess what I will say is that this is... sort of like a Quentin Tarantino film that's been super-condensed to a length of just 15 minutes and turned into an art experiment. There's no ""gameplay"" to speak of - it's a first person interactive story-slash-art-piece, nothing more. The graphics are as simple as can be, but it has some cool ideas and is worth checking out if you are open to these sorts of artsy game experiments. I wasn't kidding before, though - the experience is over in literally 15 minutes or so. So just keep that in mind as far as your personal ""price vs. playtime"" factor goes. One other note: this game also includes its prequel, ""Gravity Bone"", for free. I recommend playing this first. To access it, click ""career"" in the main menu and select Gravity Bone.			"

												I don't understand this game.     I don't understand why all the people have blocks for heads; I don't understand why they all go ""murmer, murmer, murmer""  as if they're underwater when they talk; I don't understand whether you are actually just teleporting all over the place or if that's meant to represent a passage of time or even if it's just the fact of it being a ""broken game""; I don't understand why it's so short and so pixel-y and still five dollars RRP in the Steam Store even though it's been out since 2012; I don't understand why it has the rather heavy rep that it has.     Maybe this is because I am, strictly speaking, more a member of the ""Simpsons"" generation, rather than the ""Family Guy"" generation; which is to say, post-modernism before it got out of control.  Maybe I is just a stoopid.      I don't understand it, which isn't to say that I didn't like it.  I just didn't 100% ""get it"".  And I think I liked ""Gravity Bone"", the bonus game included with it, more than the main game itself.  Which I still don't understand.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I really, honestly DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT.   But I still kinda liked it.   Quentin Tarantino, you're a very talented man, but you have soooooo much to answer for.   Recommended, but only to the curious, and probably only when on sale.Verdict:  7.5/10.			"

												Let me start off by saying this is much less a game than it is an art piece.Thirty Flights of Loving takes you on a short and wonderfully confusing journey through dramatic and intense sequences. It took me about 10 minutes to beat, but the developer commentary gave me insight into the process of developing the game. It feels very personal, and when it ends it leaves you wanting more, but having more would potentially spoil the experience.If you're looking for a short artsy game with a story that you have to work for, then consider checking this out. If you have it in your Steam library and haven't played it yet, give it the 10 minutes of your time it asks for.			"

												The Metascore for this game is very misleading. It isn't even an appropriate score if you try to call this ""game"" artwork--it's poorly made no matter how you look at it.You can literally beat this in 20 minutes and there is no replayability. There are two ""games"" inside here, in reality both are more like mini-games. Gameplay is entirely linear, there are no secrets to find, no character development, plus unoriginal and boring gameplay elements. There is no redeeming factor to this game; it's not even priced fairly.I am genuinely sad that I bought this for more than 50¢. This developer and publisher have yet to release a quality title on Steam and they offer no further support or updates after release. The game will stay in this bad condition, with no new content or updates. Thirty Flights of Loving uses a modified and extremely dated Quake2 engine. If you try to quit or load/save at the wrong spot, press esc at the wrong time, or don't do precisely the right thing at the right time, you will easily trigger the ""Quake2Engine has crashed"" message--fittingly, they didn't even bother to insert the game name in place of the engine name! Don't worry too much because the entire ""game"" will be over in less than 20 minutes.			"

This misrepresented excuse for a game is a huge waste of money. It's a linear borderline non-interactive story that's over in 13 minutes or less. Most of the praise is from mental midgets who play it over and over to find the ""hidden meaning"", or verbose indie developers who find it refreshingly non-conformist (i.e. hipsters). Oh Come ON! The developer admitted he ran out of ideas and had no clue what he was doing. This is just an artistic experiment that should've been offered for public consumption for free.

												This game always crashed for me. One day, I decided to try to launch it again and it worked.15 minutes later, I'm done.I don't remember when and why I got this game, probably as part of a bundle? I probably wouldn't have if I knew what it was.Honestly, I liked the way the game just throws you in without saying anything. A story unfolds as you move forward, skips through time. I'm still not sure I understood what was going on and I don't feel quite motivated enough to even think about it.The concept was cool, it felt cool to go through and then it was over and none of my questions were answered. I have never played ""Gravity Bones"" but I don't feel like it would have helped.If you get this game for free, play it, you'll be done in a few minutes. Otherwise, please don't buy it, there are so many cool games that can offer more than 15 minutes of entertainment for less than 5$.			"

												Why someone might do it, I have no idea. Thirty Flights of Loving is a videogame immitation of French New Wave cinema. Along with Gravity Bone (which is included) the experience takes about half an hour—far less time than an artsy movie. Emotionally, it carries a similar impact perhaps because you are an actor in the piece. While there is no danger of making a wrong choice, there is a sense of peril. Even though it is impossible to explore the characters, there's an impression of romance and friendship. A simple plot is complicated by a trick of chronological confusion, but I still feel it has added meaning somehow.On the whole, this is a game you play in order to think, talk and write about later. It probably deserves a replay after you've had time to contemplate. (I haven't done that yet.) In addition, I'm looking forward to the commentary option. If you are into that sort of thing, there are far worse things to spend your money on.			"

												Frankly, it's not worth the price, despite the amount of love and dedication that the developers may have invested into it. I certainly liked the game, but it's not really something I'd recommend due to its short playtime, lack of replayability, and dated appearance. The fact that Gravity Bone is included for free makes me a bit less inclined to give this a negative review, but I'm not going to overlook all of its flaws merely because of that. There isn't much gameplay other than walking and interacting with a couple of objects and people, and it doesn't feel incredibly meaningful in my opinion.If you want to walk through a dystopian setting with some interesting details for half an hour, you should give it a try. The developer commentary, I might add, is quite insightful. It's not a terrible piece of media by any means, but it doesn't quite feel like a game.			"

AUDIONeatVISUALArtsyDIFFICULTYWalking SimVIBEFilm NoirCRAVINGSilent StoryON SALESometimesPROS: The world looks nice, it's curiosity-piquing. I found the characters to be somewhat memorable, if only in role rather than name. The story is interesting once it's broken down for you or played through multiple times. It's the Momento style of story-telling, not just a random series of events that some are making it out to be. There is a fleshed out tale here that is admittedly poignant, and in a very interesting setting.CONS: My overall time played was accrued through more than one playthrough. It is VERY short. For having such an interesting story, it's poorly told. The artsy factor actually detracts from the experience in this aspect. It would have been much better if the story to have been expanded upon, but I feel that's not what they were going for, for the sake of brevity. Unfortunately, a lack of any consequence makes it little more than a walking simulator that blows right by over the course of ten minutes or so.WORTH: It's very short and can be beaten quickly. If you're not the type to enjoy walking sims, you'll probably find you've dropped cash on something condescending and vapid. OVERALL: This game is not worth five USD, simple as that. Is it a travesty upon gaming? A sin that cannot be redeemed? Is it the worst thing that has ever stolen the money of players everywhere? No. It's just an overpriced art game, so calm down and stop giving it so much hate for the sake of cheap comedy. This loss of five dollars is not worth stabbing your grandmother and threatening the developer over but exercise caution in buying it.

												***Got it from a humble bundle - not sure i'd be happy if i'd bought it - definitely wouldnt get it at full price.***It was an interesting, fairly enjoyable 15-20 minutes with some nice areas and small set pieces although im a big walking sim fan so i was always going to like it. As always, Chris Reno's music is fantastic and the game was definitely interesting - i even learned a little about aerodynamics and the physics of flight.Theres almost no gameplay and a lot of story threads dont really get an ending or even make much sense off the bat.  I'll tentatively recommend this but only if you're a fan of walking simulators and experimental games, even then not at full price, however i did enjoy it  "

												Thirty Flights of Loving is Blendo Games short, similar, follow-up to their prior release of ""Gravity Bone"".Thirty Flights follows the same style and make-up of the first game, with the same kinds of punches and surprises, but stylised in a nicer manner, with more focus on ""the story"" (what little of it there is) than ""the game"" (such as Gravity Bone).The game is incredibly short. 15-20 minutes long, but succeeds in delivering you a firm understanding of an interesting story in that time, using dynamic scene changes and blends.It's okay. I enjoyed it. For the price of £3.99? Not worth it. £0.99? Definitely worth the play. The game also has a ""Developer commentary"" mode, similar to the Portal 1 developer mode, where you can activate text-points throughout the game for more info on the scene, but whenever I ran this mode the game crashed within 1 minute of activating the dialogue boxes, so I was unable to complete it at all in this mode, sadly.A decent injection from Blendo, but I expected more, from their clearly very talented team.Nilesy			"

												It's not like it was poorly made or anything.  The artistic styling is some what charming and it's easy to appreciate how it's able to convey it's story without any spoken dialogue, at least none you can understand anyway.  Regardless, despite how I dislike how commonly this criticism might be used in general this game just isn't worth any price.  You can complete it in like ten minutes.  Sure, there's a text based commentary but your milage from that really depends on how much you actually care about the base product.  I didn't finish the commentary because I didn't really care, nothing in the story had me infatuated so much that I'd care to learn about the development process.  Nothing about this was really impressive.There's nothing truly wrong about this game that I could criticize it past having a price tag but that's really because there's just hardly anything here so to speak.  Another artsy walking sim, and there's really nothing inherently wrong with that.  Some truly great ones have been made like the Stanley Parable, but asking for money for this is a bit much.  Otherwise I'd at least be more willing to praise it's merits.			"

												I really enjoyed the experience of playing Thirty Flights of Loving, but know what you are getting in to. It's a really interesting narrative, but I almost think it would have been better suited as a short film than an interactive experience as it's completely linear and you aren't really adding anything by being in control of the character because there are very few things to interact with.But that being said, the presentation is great. The art direction is compelling, Chris Remo provides another great soundtrack, and the scene right after the open credits got to me more than any AAA game I can think of. I wish it was a little bit longer (about 15 minutes) and include a bit more interaction, but it's still an absolutely worthwhile experience. Although if I'm being honest, when I wanted to play it again a few months later, I ended up just watching a YouTube playthrough because it's almost the exact same thing and I didn't have to fire up Steam.

												I'm the type of guy that will wholeheartedly recommend a short game if it has a good story. Even if the price tag is sometimes a little over.Year Walk, To the Moon, Brothers: A tale of two sons, Limbo, Deadlight, Thomas was alone, Spec Ops: The Line. The list goes on. All short games. All have great stories. All I would recommend.I would not recommend this game.I don't want to sound like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it feels like this game was made by some hipster who wanted to make an art piece out of a game. It didn't work.I really feel that all the positive comments about this game are from people who are trying to make it clear that they support innovation and creativity in video games. That's great, but this ""game"" really isn't.As I said before, length isn't usually an issue for me. However, I've played 20 minutes of this game and I've completed it three times. That's ridiculous. It could have the best story ever told ever by anyone ever and it would still be ridiculous that I can complete it three times in just over 20 minutes.And that's what's worse. You watch the trailer and it says at the end""Tells a better story in 13 minutes than most games do in 13 hours."" - PC GamerNow, I like PC Gamer, but that is such a stupid statement that it's practically a lie. Its actually a really cheesy, sub-par romantic story. I won't spoil it, just in case you refuse to listen to me. I'm not that much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥And above everything else, it is BORING. You'd be surprised at how bored you can get in a game that takes less than 10 minutes to complete. The story is boring and the gameplay is boring. At least in Dear Esther and Gone Home, the story was good and it lasted longer than 10 minutes.Walk around for 10 minutes. Engage in a plot that will leave you bored and with no attachment whatsoever to the characters. You've completed the game! Wasn't that great?! That'll be £4 please.			"

												Thirty Fights of Loving is an abstract, explorative adventure game in which you take on the role of a member of a group of criminals living in a prohibition and police state. You simply wander through a series of environments, occasionally interacting with things, and finding yourself whisked away to another time point. It's not linear and it's not long - which is probably my main issue with it. It's not long enough for those hooks to matter - 5-10 minutes after asking those questions it's over. But that brings me to the part I liked about it - I liked that it left you to interpret/fill in the story, which admittedly won't be everyone's cup of tea.As for actual recommendations - some people will love it and think it's a brilliant little piece of art, others will hate it and find it pretentious. I, personally, didn't mind it.. but I'm not sure I'd be happy if I paid for it outright (got it in a bundle). Which is why I'm not recommending it. :/ If you're not sure whether or not it's for you, I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale or in a bundle, otherwise you *may* feel cheated.			"

												I thought this was pretty good. A lot of people don’t, but I like unique “arty farty” kinds of 'games' like this. ‘Game’ because it seems there’s been quite a few debates as to whether or not this is a game. I’ve heard a lot of people say it isn’t and say it made no sense, but I personally thought it was fun.In fairness, at the time I had no idea what I was doing or playing or what the hell was was going on at any point of time, I finished it and to be honest was a little impressed. But more so confused.I like the way it was done, it had a very fast paced kind of 'movie action scene' feel going on, and I even went and played through it again with the developer commentary. It explained some elements of it, and I actually found some of the things that he took into account quite clever. He even mentioned that the ""WTF is going on"" kind of ""amnesia"" feel, was one he found hard to pull off. But I think that this game (and the developer even wrote it in one of the commentary segments) is very much for a certain kind of audience. I get where people are coming from when they say they seen the trailer and expected something completely different, it wasn’t anything like I tried to imagine either. But in my own way, I kind of preferred what I found instead. I think it’s a great short (very short) game, with a lot of thought behind it. I’m glad I got this on sale when it was 75% off. Although I enjoyed it, I doubt I would pay full price for something this short. If it was longer... then yeh, sure.All in all, I think it’s a nice, little, short, interactive story, which relies more on environment rather than dialogue. Which you don’t really see all that often.			"

												NOT A RECOMMENDATION!Whilst this game has an entertaining and novel approach to it's (brief) story, it is impossible to recommend due to how short this game is and how little interaction there is. A playthrough will take no longer than 15 mins and a replay with developer commentary the same again. There is no replay value to the game as I see it.Given that there are free flash games which take longer to play it is hard to justify paying cash for this.

												The rating via metacritics was probably based on the opinion of the developer's mother and spouse for f*ck sake. It's just a load of kiss ♥♥♥ crap.It's shorter than a midget's as$hole.If you blow it through it's less than 10 minutes.I had to play this twice just to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong or avoiding anything crucial.And then I played once more with additional commentary - it made me even more of a unsatisfied towards the entire game from how carelessly thrown together it seems to be based on how the comments were written. I literally kept thinking in my head 'This has to be a f*cking joke' once I saw ""The End"" and game related credits in the muesem full of generated people in bundles of three that only consist of three different character models spammed throughout the entire location and some things regarding airplanes. Because yeah- gotta add some flying related thing for the sake of adding depth to the title ""Thirty Flights of Loving"" other than you having a romance for some b*tch that almost killed your best man.Basically the game is literally contsructed based on mistake after mistake, yes sometimes imperfections add charm, but in this case it just seems like they were simply too lazy to bother fixing the issue and they decided to cover it up thoughtlessly. It was just like ""Oh ..sh!t the crowd generator is causing peope to float in the wedding scene!?! That's alright! Let's just add some blurry effects while the player drink off the bottles while everyone else is dancing- and make the player assume they're so drunk that they can no longer correlate reality from alcoholic delusions!Why?Because it's ARTSY and adds a NARRATIVE touch in the game!!!""The gameplay itself feels like you're on a grid, you get tossed from one scene to the next.Its also rather disorientating and disrupts the entire flow of the 'story' it is trying to convey. I really don't see how it's artistic.I see it as lazy,choppy,painfully short,and dull. It's not even very aesthetically pleasing for the simplicity of the graphics.It would be able to get away with it IF (and I emphasize if) it was a deep and enriched story telling game. But sadly- it fails miserably on that aspect.So yeah, not only it's FUGLY- but it's stupid.The game also includes its prequel called ""Gravity Bones"" and I found it to be a bit more interesting, and innovative than it's sequel.Its even to my surprise a tad longer..But it still doesn't help the game as its own indvidual piece. It just felt like I ate a stale and bland cupcake with just a bit more sprinkles and frosting than the last one.TL:DR It ain't worth it at all.I'm surprised they even had the guts to call itself a 'game' the only thing you really do is walk around , sometimes press 'e' and get slammed with ♥♥♥♥ty sequences the second you step on a area that triggers it.It's sloppy, it's short. It's dull and it takes the the pride in being vague which in their language means artistic when in reality it's meaningless rubbish.I've never seen a game that costs five dollars but it's just as valuable as a crummy indie flash game you can find online for free. And even if it's on discount- I would say skip it...There are more interesting things to do in 15-20 minutes than to play this.			"

												An interesting experiment, but not worth $4.99.  I understand on some level why it got such high reviews, but from the standpoint of someone coming into it expecting to play a game, I was disappointed.  As the player, I did not have any real sense of agency as the game hurried me through series of strange, loosely connected events toward the all too fast approaching end.  At least in the prequel, Gravity Bone, there was some exposition and I had items I was able to use to interact with the environment.  It was sparse, but there were game mechanics there.  This is less of a game to be played, and more of a very short expressionist film to be watched.  If you come expecting an interactive story, you will be disappointed.  Thirty Flights of Loving is more akin to the experience of visiting a particularly short house of illusions at a carnival.  You can only go one linear direction, it's confusing, disorienting, and by the time you get out you feel slightly cheated for having spent as much money as you did on such a mediocre experience.			"

												TFOL has value as an experiment in storytelling, but as a game for which I paid cash, I am seriously underwhelmed.A lot of the praise for TFOL has to do with how it doesn't bombard you with narrative and hold your hand with mindless cutscenes. They say it lets you figure out the story for yourself. Well, to that I say good luck. If you can find a coherent story in TFOL somewhere then I laud your truly magnificent gift of insight. I challenge anyone sitting on their pretentious thrones of higher criticism to tell me what the plot and story in this game are. My guess is no one really knows.The world is kind of cute. And things like rushing through mobs of fast-moving people in an airport with a wounded team member slung over your shoulder to a soundtrack reminiscent of James Bond and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (a la Quentin Tarantino) are novel and a little exciting. But your actions affect nothing. It's basically a slide show. There was no purpose for several the key bindings (not kidding) and none of the objects you can pick up have any function whatsoever.This should have been freeware for all the value it offers. I hate being tough on independent developers but I will need to be extra skeptical of Blendo Games' work in the future after this experience.			"

And even more - i`ve specially downloaded it again and run it for 5 mins to be able to write here because of steam`s min.played time restriction (i`ve played it one beautiful night offline when my internet had gone and i was just in the right mood to play some good oneplayer interesting story game and played it through several times whith comments, searched every corner and all.. so do not pay attention to gamestatistics time). Don`t get me wrong, i don`t hate it - I only wanted to warn you, good people! it`s just a square peg in a round hole. Come to your senses. This is not a game.it`s more like some middleclasses schoolboy`s gamedesigning homework (if there`s been a gamedev school).if you liked it, then maybe you are his classmate, senior, or junior. or maybe a teacher. but not a free man who lives normal life and likes to play some good or bad but Games. at this 'homework' level - it`s ok, it has some interesting findings and gives a good perspective to developer to work in indie or real studios or progress on his own.But this is not a finished product for sale at all (peolple say that even if it were free they wouldnt download it.. so thats kinda correct, its totally incomplete)that`s all, make your own conclusion, it`s all up to you, conscious people. p.s. one complete thing in this stuff is music, but it`s absolutely another type of work of course.p.p.s. peace, Brandon Chung, you have not mere talent but don`t bury it whith chase of money. and Tarantino? man, be modest..

												I honestly can't figure out how this (interactive story) game has received such praise, because it's the worst thing I've ever played. How people can believe that a 15-20 minutes disjointed story can provide an ""emotional impact"" is beyond me. You can't become attached to characters within that time frame because you don't really get to know them. I'm obviously a minority here, but despite what everyone is saying, this particular game is not a good form a storytelling. It's not worth $5, and I'm glad I bought it while on sale because even then I regret it.			"

												Before going on to explain why I actually didn't like Thirty Flights of Loving, bear in mind that I enjoyed Dear Esther (an interactive story with no real gameplay).Thirty Flights of Loving takes approximately 15 minutes to get through and by the end of it, you're left thinking what you just played. I won't call it a game because like Dear Esther, it is an interactive story. The story in Thirty Flights is non-linear, meaning you're told the story in the incorrect order and you're essentially left to piece it all together. While this is a plus, as it helps you take the story as you're required to pay attention and really think about it, the story is nowhere near long enough to be worth the amount you pay.Typically, I would say that for every £1 (or $1) you spend, a game should give you one hour of gameplay. Now this game is £4, so following that system, you should get 4 hours of gameplay, but even with Gravity Bone included, you don't get that much gameplay, since there is very little replay value. I would say this is the kind of game you would find on a free games website, not something you would pay for. It's just not worth it.Just to clarify why I liked Dear Esther and not Thirty Flights, Dear Esther actually has some level of replay value, since each time you play, the script changes. So in order to fully understand the story within Dear Esther, you would need to play it multiple times to get all the dialogue.			"

												Honestly, I did not enjoy this game one bit. The storyline (if any) was just confusing, and I didn't feel any connection to the characters when it ended. The other game included, Gravity Bone, didn't provide any answers towards what the plot is either. I can see that an attempt to envoke a connection to the characters was made with flashbacks, but it just didn't do it for me. Not to mention when I managed to die (attempting to make a shortcut to the exit in the first part of Gravity Bone) the game kept crashing when I tried to load my save, which forced me to restart. Had this been later in the game, I would have been very upset.I suppose the only good from this game is that it at least controls well.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is a bad game, if it can be called that.  It's horribly linear with very little interaction.  Play time totaled 15 minutes, and that's going through it twice.  The story is actually pretty good but it's not a ""game"".  On the other hand, the free bonus of Gravity Bone made my it worth my money.  Although again short it is a game (about 15 minutes for 1 time through), it has interaction, it's entertaining, and I liked the whole feel of it.  My thoughts are they should have sold Gravity Bone with Thirty Flights of Loving as a bonus.  For $4.99 I would say not worth it, get it when it's on sale if you get it at all.			"

Surely the storytelling style in this game couldn't be applied to a fully featured game, though it would be interesting to see someone try.  If you want to be a guinea pig and think that the screenshots look sorta cool, buy this game when it goes on sale for $1.25 or less.  If you don't like the style of the game in the screenshots don't even bother.  This is probably the biggest style over substance game on Steam.			"

												I want to like it, but I just can't recommend it.  This is a regression from Gravity Bone in almost every way.  30FL's nonlinear bells and whistles aren't enough to dress up this barebones hesit story--gone is narrative confidence of GB, dropping the player into and out of an ongoing plot and explaining nothing.  Worse, there's no game to this game--even the minimal puzzle and platforming elements of GB have been boiled away.  30FL can basically be completed by holding ""w"" and tapping ""e."" Staking out your own place on the ludology/narratology map is one thing, but it is genuinely difficult to determine what the developer thinks has been added by making this game instead of, say, a cartoon or comic--the unfortunate side-effect of which is to make the player feel (with some justification) that he or she has fallen victim to some sort of dodge or hustle in paying money for this ""game.""

												The game itself contains a lot of interesting ideas which have clearly had a lot of thought put into them, however I'm unsure all of that time was well spent. It is ridiculously short and while it might be praised for fitting a lot into a short time period, I don't think it was necessary for the game to be so condensed, there was just something missing. I recommend downloading Gravity Bone (the previous game in the series, which is free) and trying that out to see if you enjoy it (if you can get it working on the correct resolution that is, the game is an♥♥♥♥♥♥, then consider whether or not you'd pay for it because TFOL is the same length, essentially. Also, the game crashes no less than Gravity Bone for your money, the only upside of the duration of the game being that when it (inevitably) crashes, you don't have far to go to get back to where you were, though you will have to change all your settings again. One neat feature is that you'll never have to go to all the effort of pressing 'Esc' and exiting the game through the menu, as it will definitely crash before you do, buttonless game closing.. the future!Ultimately I'd like to see some of these ideas put into a game of more worth and substance, whether in the Citizen Abel series or otherwise. My favourite part of the game was probably the developer commentary, which should never be the case in any form of entertainment, though nice to have it nonetheless. This game should be free, to garner interest in a much more substantial game based on it, unfortunately that was done with Gravity Bone and this is what we got. Perhaps there is hope for the future, kickstarter? Something real please and I'll pay money!			"

												It's not a conventional game. If that's a red flag for you then don't ignore it; you will not enjoy 30 Flights of Loving. The gameplay actually lies in trying to piece a perfect understanding of the story in your head, which is easier said than done. There's all sorts of little clues and details that enable all sorts of crazy and dynamic theories in this 10 minute title (it is actually that short) and due to the quick flow of the story and stylish presentation; I've managed to log 4 hours in while being quite entertained.Unfortunately you have to find joy in that kind of thing. There seems to be a tiny niche for it and I think this game is really good at what it does. It's a simplistic game to look at but it's also quite a creative one that I felt was worth grabbing on sale.			"

												This game... I don't know if I could even say game... This piece of wonderful art is about 5 minutes long when ran through, but 15 minutes if you take your time to absorb the world. This was brilliant. With its numerous film, and video game homages, and it's Spy-esque story, we're thrown into a world without dialogue but powerful narrative. It's a game that runs like a film with flashbacks and jarred sequences. This world is unique and the mysterious yet entrancing plot is one that'll stick to you for days to come. I HIGHLY recommend for Indie Lovers. It's a perfect game -- a perfect Art.			"

												The game itself contains a lot of interesting ideas which have clearly had a lot of thought put into them, however I'm unsure all of that time was well spent. It is ridiculously short and while it might be praised for fitting a lot into a short time period, I don't think it was necessary for the game to be so condensed, there was just something missing. I recommend downloading Gravity Bone (the previous game in the series, which is free) and trying that out to see if you enjoy it (if you can get it working on the correct resolution that is, the game is an♥♥♥♥♥♥, then consider whether or not you'd pay for it because TFOL is the same length, essentially. Also, the game crashes no less than Gravity Bone for your money, the only upside of the duration of the game being that when it (inevitably) crashes, you don't have far to go to get back to where you were, though you will have to change all your settings again. One neat feature is that you'll never have to go to all the effort of pressing 'Esc' and exiting the game through the menu, as it will definitely crash before you do, buttonless game closing.. the future!Ultimately I'd like to see some of these ideas put into a game of more worth and substance, whether in the Citizen Abel series or otherwise. My favourite part of the game was probably the developer commentary, which should never be the case in any form of entertainment, though nice to have it nonetheless. This game should be free, to garner interest in a much more substantial game based on it, unfortunately that was done with Gravity Bone and this is what we got. Perhaps there is hope for the future, kickstarter? Something real please and I'll pay money!			"

												Mechanically there isn't much to 30 Flights of Loving or Gravity Bone, just WASD movement and an action button. But like The Stanley Parable or Thomas Was Alone, this is the kind of thing you pick up not for the gameplay but for a game where the developer is trying something weird and different and beautiful. It might not work 100%, but it will certainly stand out from almost everything else you have in your game library.30 Flights of Loving starts off as a spy story and to say anything else will spoil the story. The rest of the game may be short, but also strange, bittersweet and I thoroughly enjoyed it. "

												Not for everyone. If you plan on purchasing, wait for the sale and be sure you know what you are purchasing. Short game, not worth it unless you plan on speedrunning it (which I do) or if you want to play ""gravity bones"" (which is included). Took 5 mins to beat, and didn't understand the story till the second playthrough. Much more of an art project and visual novel than a full-fledged game.			"

The ""game"" is short, roughly 15-25 mins of complete playtime, the storytelling is sporadic and spasmic, the plot unsatisfying and insatiable, and ultimately, the game has little to no satisfaction. I wouldn't recommend it and for those that pay more than a buck will feel cheated and rightfully so. 2/5			"

												Disappointing. I was hoping to get something at least on par with Gravity Bone, which I found quite charming.It's obvious this is lovingly crafted, and the way the story is told is wonderful... there just doesn't really seem to be much story to hear.Also, it's incredibly unstable. It's a short game so replaying bits to get back to your spot, but in the hour I played this (going through the main game and developer commentary) I experienced 4 crashes.It's interesting if you enjoy game prototypes, but don't set your expectations very high.

												While I appreciate the ideas and art style, I can't help but think this extremely short endeavour (5 minutes? 10 tops?) should be called Thirty Flights of Pretentiousness instead.  The ""gameplay"" is the narrative, but the narrative is spotty, guesswork open to interpretation at best, pseudo-artsy film school project stuff. The contracts accessible after the titular game offer some (extremely) basic puzzling, but that's about it. This is NOT worth its current price.			"

												Brilliant, as long as you know what you're getting...First and foremost this is more a short interactive story than a game, there's not a lot of player input. The game mainly consists of moving from one scene to the next with story unfolding through jumpcuts. Now if ""short interactive story"" hasn't put you off already than buy this game, granted for 5 euro it may seem steep, you'll get through it in about 15 minutes the first time.As a story this is incredibly well put together, you'll play through it the first time and kind of know what's going on, and then you'll probably end up playing through it maybe 2 to 3 times more as you try to figure out the sequence of events. Plus the games wacky art style and music are more than worth the price of admission. I'm honestly a huge fan of this game.On a side it comes with the prequel ""Gravity Bone"" which is also awesome and features the same type of style, so there's two reasons to buy it. However you can download ""Gravity Bone"" from the net for free and ""test run"" how you feel about this type of game if you're nervous about spending the 5 euro. But honestly I'd recommend buying this.			"

												As indie as a video game could possibly get. The game is less than thirty minutes long, capitalizing on your own rationalizations and conclusions as to the way the story unfolds, rather than through mainstream concepts such as ""character development"" and ""first-day DLC"". In spite of its incredulous model, Thirty Flights of Loving finds a way to create a plot just as well as a 30-hour RPG.But seriously, this game was hilarious and fun. Make sure you play the prequel to this game called ""Gravity Bone"" (totally free; go to blendogames.com), just to get a taste of what to expect. "

												Thirty Flights of Loving is an experimental story-game which uses bizarre music, weird visuals, crazy level design, and a hyper-confindent lack of context or explanation to tell an entire criminal-caper-drama-film's worth of story in something under ten minutes.If you don't want to experience a weird ten-minute story told entirely in inarticulate mumbles, frantic jazz, and bloom effects, this game is not for you, and I'm sorry, but you're missing out.This game also includes Gravity Bone, which exists on the internet as a free download but is convenient to have here.

												A cool vignette by Blendo. The problems I had with it are:Seems a little too short. It's about the same length as Gravity Bone (which is free). You get teleported around a lot unexpectedly. It is a bit annoying, because this can happen while traversing an area. I expect this was an engine limitation, but it's still annoying.BUT, I still enjoyed it for what it is. I recommend it for Gravity Bone fans, and also when it's like 50% off.			"

												Thirty Flights is a short story in video game format. It purposely does away with cumbersome talk/text and relies solely on presenting visual clues. While the story isn't subtle, it could be easy to get confused if you're not paying attention. Play it twice, once normal, and then again with the director commentary and you should be able to piece it together. I can recommend this game for those who like experiences as much as games, although I would suggest waiting for a sale day as this short story is under thirty minutes long.			"

It certainly isn't a visual experience since the graphics and animation are absolute rubbish. And above alll, there is almost no gameplay. You walk around, mostly forward. and click something to proceed to another scene where you do the exact same thing again. and then the game just ends. Please avoid this at all cost.

I'd consider this as both a fully realized game and a test of the powerful ability video games have to convey emotion and art. Very rarely does a gamer get a chance like this... I'd recommend it.

												This is a good visually driven game which tells you the conclusion to a series of games this developer created many years ago.The presentation is excellent, the music is incredibly fitting, the pacing is good and it has quite some care on few small details.I enjoyed it a lot, Don't be fooled because the game is around 10 minutes long (with other 10 minutes for it's prequel), it's pretty enjoyable and unique, can't say much without spoiling the story other than how enjoyable it was.

												This. Game. Is. Short. Took me two playthroughs to beat it, and only 30 minutes to do both. I was surprised to find the credits at the end. This game makes you say ""That it?!"" by the time you get to the end of it. The storyline was kind of interesting, and I can really appreciate the way they laid it out, even though the whole thing put together didn't really make sense. Nonetheless, I just REALLLY wish you had more to look at.Sorry devs. Love your stuff, and I really want more, but this just wasn't long enough.			"

												So, I've been a fan of Blendo Game's stuff in the past.  I have put an absurd amount of hours into Atom Zombie Smash, and enjoyed my time in Flotilla.  I more recently discovered that another Blendo Game, Gravity Bone, was available on free from the studio's website, and after playing it, decided to throw down the $5 to play Thirty Flights of Loving.I'm not sure it was worth it.First thing's first: 30 Flights is really short.  I played through the game once normally and again with ""developer commentary"" on, and it took just a bit over a half hour combined.  I know it shouldn't be a factor, but as someone with a small amount of free money, I have to think about time value.  While I had fun with 30 Flights, I'm not sure I had $5 worth of fun.That said, 30 Flights is fun.  It isn't a game, really...more of a short story told from a first person view.  It's a pretty wild ride, shifting from quiet moments to in-your-face intense moments with jarring smash cuts that fit the tone of the game well.  If you are curious about the game, I'd recommend giving Gravity Bone a spin first, which is available free at the Blendo Games site.  If you like it, go ahead and play 30 Flights...but I'd recommend waiting for a sale.  Even if I enjoyed it, $5 for 15 minutes is a hard sale.			"

												""As a historian I find myself both pleased with the results and revolted we may never know the veracity of our efforts. Regardless of whatever headaches I have, may you enjoy the fruits of our labor.We may never know who Citizen Abel truly is, but we do have stories about him."" -- Brendon Chung,  Thirty Flights of Loving I'm not going to lie: This is a difficult game. It will anger you. It is meant to do so.But if you pretend it doesn't have a story that is desperately trying to make its way to you, you are deluding yourself. And you are falling for the trap that Chung has so meticulously designed for the average player.I don't mean that this is a difficult game insofar that it's hard to complete. It's level design is agonizingly linear, and excruciatingly short in length. It's difficult because the most important events in the story don't happen on the screen. It's difficult like a jigsaw puzzle without a picture on the box -- difficult because you don't know what you're putting together, let alone how.It's short because most of what it's trying to tell you, it tries to communicate by not telling you at all. Just leaving hints, out of order, tucked away in parts that don't seem important. That is not to say that Chung is lazy and expects you to make the story for him, simply that he respects the player enough to understand what's on the table and what that means is likely being dealt under it.This isn't really much of a game in the usual sense of a game. It is a linear short-story, told in a fragmented non-linear fashion. It is so short a story, in fact, that it is really closer to a poem in that vein: its decided brevity poses more questions than it answers, and that is its main storytelling technique -- in typical crime-mystery fashion.That is what I love about Thirty Flights of Loving, and what so many people hate: it gives you but a blink of an eye, from a view of limited scope, in a world promised to be much larger than it shows. A world that Chung has obviously given much thought, more thought than a passer-by might think he has given the game itself. And like a poem, agonizingly short, its parts are so few that they have been chosen with such care that they tell more than the pieces themselves ever could. Like in poetry, how sometimes the story resides as much in the silence between the words as the words themselves.Thirty Flights of Loving isn't really so much a game, as it is a question. A series of questions, posed to the player, answers known by the characters, if they could only speak. And it sparks a rare kind of intense and frustrated curiosity that I have experienced but few times in my entire life.It does so by being more than what it is: it is incredibly consciously constructed, made for consumption from the very beginning. And if you try to wolf it down and casually digest it like you would a hamburger and fries, it will tear through your gut like a box of nails. It is uncompromising, and it will make you angry. It is difficult like that, it was made to be. That is what makes it so uniquely wonderful to me. Chung dares to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and asks you what you're going to do about it. That part is up to you. That is the game.			"

												journey ain't got nothin' on thirty flights lovin'An awesome experiment in perspective, in story-through-environment, in developing characters without dialogue in the course of 13 minutes, in what's possible with video game storytelling and where it can take us.The only problem I found with the game's open-ended interpretation: Most of the theories that make sense--the best stuff--is shattered by a note in the developer's commentary, where a forced design decision (i.e., boxes to block a doorway) doesn't seem to follow character motivations.I hope Chung sticks with Citizen Abel stories in the future; Gravity Bone and 30 Flights are above and beyond the rest of his output, IMO, and despite its length, I found the game well worth supporting with a handful of dollar bills.The game comes with a copy of Gravity Bone (freeware) accessible from the menu, and, as mentioned, a developer's commentary that's definitely worth checking out. Both GB and 30FoL ask to be replayed at least once or twice. You'll notice a load of new things each time.			"

												I’m not exactly sure what just happened. But, for the most part, that’s positive. If you want “bang for your buck” and/or want to be *told* a story, you should probably skip ‘TFoL’. You can “finish” it in less than half an hour and there’s hardly any kind of dialogue.On the other hand, if you want your games to *make* you think, here’s the game for you. It’s less a game and more an interactive silent film. Call it an “art game” or “pretentious” if you must, but for what it’s worth your gaming entertainment can only be enriched by the likes of ‘TFoL’, more-or-less forcing you to think outside the box.As a bonus ‘TFoL’ contains developer commentary and another game that originated from the same prototype. And the game is set in the same universe as ‘Atom Zombie Smasher’. So, there’s that.			"

												This is tough. I've heard nothing but good things about this game. It's on PC Gamer's Top 100 list. I wanted to like it. I did like it...kinda. Let's be clear. The first part (or game if you will) was amazing. It was fun. It was unique. It was artsy without being pretentious. It brought a smile to my face and I liked it. It was so different. Such a great non-game game. But then there is a second mission (or prequel) hidden away. This is where it all went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now it tried to be a parkour style adventure and failed miserably. Why is there two locks on every door? Why is that damn flag pole so hard to land a jump on? Why do I have to keep starting over from the beginning because of your poor platforming mechanics? Honestly, I would have paid $9.99 for the first game even thought it was just 5 minutes long. But it was 5 minutes of bliss. The second (longer mission) makes me feel ripped of at 99 cents.			"

												I've had this game sitting on my pc for ages now, (since the Blendo Games Humble Weekly Sale) not having the time to really go through any of my backlog of games. I really enjoyed both Thirty Flights of Loving and Gravity Bone!  Most people rate games according to stringent rule sets, going through a bullet point list of expected content or features, which in my opinion is wrong! Games always have a focus - sometimes that focus is a balance between gameplay and story, sometimes between systems and level design. Thirty Flights and Gravity Bone lay their focus upon the narrative, its delivery and the world they are set in. Both games are very characterful in every way. The narrative, visuals and music of both games are extremely charming, and in some ways reminded me somewhat of Tarantino flicks. Both games are short (though longer than 5 minutes as some have stated), but this is as a result of the focus on narrative, and trying to put the player in the right mood, at the right time, and telling the story in a way that makes sense (with a bit of fun along the way). I went through both games, and the commentary version of Thirty Flights, and spent just under an hour.I was recommended this game by a friend, and will definitely do similarly!A breath of fresh air.

												Ok...I don't get it.I'm into indie games and art n stuff, but this was a little too weird and random for my taste (or I just didn't get it...maybe this has to be enjoyed on acid or somethin'). I do like the style and music, though. I wouldn't, however, really recommend buying this one as there's a big chance you'd be disappointed. If you're really into experimental storytelling, though, you might want to check it out. At least when it's on sale, or maybe it'll be in an indie bundle soon. 5€ is too much for 20 minutes, though.			"

												This review will be a double-feature, taking a look at both Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving, since Gravity Bone is included in the package. Keep in mind, however, that Gravity Bone was released as freeware, and while I do not recommend Thirty Flights of Loving at all, Gravity Bone is something that I recommend highly.Gravity Bone is neat for a number of reasons. Despite being low-tech, the art style is quite striking, and it is used to great effect in a couple of set-pieces within the game. In fact, it is one of the few things that is retained in its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving. Gravity Bone itself is quite short however, involving only a couple of missions with various objectives. All of this is done in the first-person perspective, but the game is not what you would call a first-person shooter. Now, I do wish that there was more to the game, as the missions themselves play out nicely, and they work as an excellent demonstration on how to engage the player without having them shoot at things constantly, which is often the case in the first-person games that it resembles. And the game comes together wonderfully at the end, with a fast-paced end sequence, and an ending that is on the good side of eccentric and confusing, which wraps up the tale very well. All taking place with full input of the player, save for the end sequence. But here this brief absence of control is justified perfectly within the contextual landscape the game has painted.So while Gravity Bone is a demonstration of where first-person games could take us, Thirty Flights of Loving instead presents us with a few brief minutes of scarcely interactive slideshow, composed of random elements devoid of context, all taking place along a non-linear timeline. It is a mess of a presentation, and one which is just plain confusing, and there ends up being nothing thought provoking at all in the experience. What it does have are some references to Gravity Bone, but those come off as disconnected and pointless, as well as other similarly ineffective references to other things which have no bearing to what you are doing. However, there are some hidden environmental details that are revealed if you pay attention, but they have no real bearing within Loving's framework, given how non-interactive the experience is.Now, I would not normally be so harsh on a sequel for being different. However in this case, not only is it different, those new features only detract from the experience. All that Thiry Flights of Loving manages to be, is a slideshow of variously surreal and not-so-surreal scenes cobbled together, and which do not actually require the player to be present in the slightest, and the entire game is over in under ten minutes. Where Gravity Bone was an engaging and impressive demonstration of how you could tell a story in the first-person, Thirty Flights of Loving is just an incomplete set of narrative fragments which are left to the played to  struggle to reconstruct. Even then, without any real input from the player, one must wonder what motivation the player is meant to have to attempt this, when the fragments are so far-flung, and the reward for collecting them so unsatisfying.As far as picking up this game goes, you could say that you picked it up in order to give some recognition to Gravity Bone. But by itself, there really is no reason whatsoever to play Thirty Flights of Loving.			"

												It's really more of a contest admission than a game. It really disappointed me, having read lot of positive reviews and opinions. I'm not even talking about shockingly short length (measured in minutes), which I was aware before buying. Maybe it's a fault of the hype around it, claiming that there's more to that game than there really is. The game does features some original ideas. The story is told achronologically, conveyed only through pictures and to put all the pieces together you will have to play through it couple times to notice things after seeing whole picture. If only story would be more absorbing and had less holes in it (it's derp, it's open ended!!!). Why would you play narrative game if not for the bloody story? In result there's not much incentive to put all the pieces together (you're not going to connect all the dots anyway, so why bother).The graphics is OK (for a Quake 2 modded engine that is) and the music is quite nice. What's most annoying is that it's a barely a game, your actions don't matter at all. Leave guns and ammo? Nobody cares. Take different direction, game teleports you! That's just lazy level design (or lack of it). Goes without saying that you have no effect on the ending. It does say something about the game if ""credit hall"" is the biggest level in game.In the end it's neither good game nor good story. I don't think it will make much difference in story-telling department as well. I'm glad not much developers charge for proof of concept projects. It's of course important to experiment and explore what games can be and become, but it shouldn't be an excuse. That's the hardest part, turning brave and new ideas into working and absorbing games, not just leaving them be and packaging it as a game. I enjoyed ""To the moon"", this not so much. Maybe it would worked more as a Interactive Fiction? Spare the money, watch it on youtube.			"

												Wasn't as interesting as GRAVITY BONE, which I suppose, might just be a consequence of having played Gravity Bone. By the way play Gravity Bone, too. This game comes with it, but it's been free to play for years.So, the idea the creators of this game wanted to achieve was to create a very memorable, impactful short story in under 30 minutes of gameplay for a very low price.I think I didn't like it as much as Gravity Bone because it was surprising and new, and I came to 30 Flights with expectations... That all being said, I'm happy to have supported their game!			"

												I’m not exactly sure what just happened. But, for the most part, that’s positive. If you want “bang for your buck” and/or want to be *told* a story, you should probably skip ‘TFoL’. You can “finish” it in less than half an hour and there’s hardly any kind of dialogue.On the other hand, if you want your games to *make* you think, here’s the game for you. It’s less a game and more an interactive silent film. Call it an “art game” or “pretentious” if you must, but for what it’s worth your gaming entertainment can only be enriched by the likes of ‘TFoL’, more-or-less forcing you to think outside the box.As a bonus ‘TFoL’ contains developer commentary and another game that originated from the same prototype. And the game is set in the same universe as ‘Atom Zombie Smasher’. So, there’s that.			"

There are free indie games that have way more substance.Thirty Flights of Loving plays out as of an interactive narative.  However you can't die or don't acctually effect the world around you (unlike games like indigo Prophecy or The Stanley Parable). Really you just control movement and the camera and follow along while the breif TWENTY MINUTE story plays you... for a fool.......  because you spent money on something that real indie developers have been giving out for free and with much more to them for a long time.P.S The story is kind of cool but passes way to quickly.

												I really wish I didn't buy this. It's about 8 minutes long from start to finish, and there is no dialogue or weapons or action. It's just a series of rooms you walk through. It claims to be a shooter, and the controls suggest that it is one (select item/weapon, crouch, jump, quick save/restore, and so on), but it's a trick -- there are no items, weapons, enemies, or objectives. The whole thing seems to be a wild scam to mischaracterize a game that took probably two months for one person to make, sell it for $5.00 each, and get rich. The story's not interesting either, despite what the reviewers said.Also, it crashed twice. Once in the main playthrough and once in the really pretentious developer commentary.Watch a playthrough of this game online instead. You won't miss a single thing.			"

												It had me interested at first. 10 minutes later I realized ""yes the game really did just actually end."" Feeling unsure if I was ripped off at 75% off. My own fault though. I should have researched the title before purchasing. While it is a unique experience I can't say I enjoyed it enough to play again. I won't say it's a bad title either, but if you are looking for some good gameplay, for the sake of  playing a good game, you're probebly not going to find it here. If you like abstract art, fps games that don't let you shoot, feeling confused, lost, like blocks and oddball stories that don't explain anything, this might just be for you. Cool for 10 minutes. ...but I will say it succeeded in making itself memorable.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving had a lot of hype surrounding it when it came out. It's non-linear, non-traditional, and very stylized -- what it does it does okay. It's interesting, but for me it was ultimately an unfulfilling experience. I didn't feel for the characters like the reviews said I was supposed to, and I didn't have any investment in the story or where it went. I appreciated the attempt to do something different, but I felt that it was all just too disjointed and unresolved. I played through a second time with the developer commentary enabled, and there was a lot of pretentious talk about the ambiguity of the storyline and characterization; I felt that it was all a failed attempt at justifying decisions that made little sense to me. There are weaknesses in the story, design and gameplay, and the developers are well aware of them. All told, however, I didn't hate it. What saved it for me was the inclusion of Gravity Bone in the copy I did purchase. It was longer, included puzzle elements, and offered the player more time as the character. I think this last point alone made me enjoy it more than Thirty Flights -- if only I had five more minutes to explore the heist and the relationship to the supporting characters, I might have enjoyed it more.

												""As a historian I find myself both pleased with the results and revolted we may never know the veracity of our efforts. Regardless of whatever headaches I have, may you enjoy the fruits of our labor.We may never know who Citizen Abel truly is, but we do have stories about him."" -- Brendon Chung,  Thirty Flights of Loving I'm not going to lie: This is a difficult game. It will anger you. It is meant to do so.But if you pretend it doesn't have a story that is desperately trying to make its way to you, you are deluding yourself. And you are falling for the trap that Chung has so meticulously designed for the average player.I don't mean that this is a difficult game insofar that it's hard to complete. It's level design is agonizingly linear, and excruciatingly short in length. It's difficult because the most important events in the story don't happen on the screen. It's difficult like a jigsaw puzzle without a picture on the box -- difficult because you don't know what you're putting together, let alone how.It's short because most of what it's trying to tell you, it tries to communicate by not telling you at all. Just leaving hints, out of order, tucked away in parts that don't seem important. That is not to say that Chung is lazy and expects you to make the story for him, simply that he respects the player enough to understand what's on the table and what that means is likely being dealt under it.This isn't really much of a game in the usual sense of a game. It is a linear short-story, told in a fragmented non-linear fashion. It is so short a story, in fact, that it is really closer to a poem in that vein: its decided brevity poses more questions than it answers, and that is its main storytelling technique -- in typical crime-mystery fashion.That is what I love about Thirty Flights of Loving, and what so many people hate: it gives you but a blink of an eye, from a view of limited scope, in a world promised to be much larger than it shows. A world that Chung has obviously given much thought, more thought than a passer-by might think he has given the game itself. And like a poem, agonizingly short, its parts are so few that they have been chosen with such care that they tell more than the pieces themselves ever could. Like in poetry, how sometimes the story resides as much in the silence between the words as the words themselves.Thirty Flights of Loving isn't really so much a game, as it is a question. A series of questions, posed to the player, answers known by the characters, if they could only speak. And it sparks a rare kind of intense and frustrated curiosity that I have experienced but few times in my entire life.It does so by being more than what it is: it is incredibly consciously constructed, made for consumption from the very beginning. And if you try to wolf it down and casually digest it like you would a hamburger and fries, it will tear through your gut like a box of nails. It is uncompromising, and it will make you angry. It is difficult like that, it was made to be. That is what makes it so uniquely wonderful to me. Chung dares to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and asks you what you're going to do about it. That part is up to you. That is the game.			"

												Thirty Flights Of Loving is short.Thirty Flights Of Loving will take you roughly 30 minutes to complete, front to back.Thirty Flights of Loving is cheap.Thirty Flights of Loving will cost you $5 maximum.Thirty Flights of Loving is an intense, first person spy thriller that utilizes environmental storytelling and fast jump cuts to tell you a story quicker and punchier than any medium or game before it.Thirty Flights of Loving is good, and worth it.

It's low-tech, and it's unpolished, and it's raw talent. Take the few bucks and the few minutes to enjoy this distraction.			"

												TFoL is a really cool game, though incredibly short - I'd say a single playthrough is about 20 minutes or so. It's still worth experiencing, though! You also get the previously released game Gravity Bone, which is also about as long, and a developer's commentary for TFoL which gives you an excuse to play through again.It's definitely worth the $5 and if a sale pops up I'd definitely recommend picking this up!

These flashes are frequent, give little to no information and dump you out of the game in ten minutes. There isn't any purpose, goal or even story really being told. The artistry is nothing to write home about and the soundtrack mediocre. Do not spend money on this at any price. Should you receive this for free, find a better use for those ten minutes of your life.			"

												A stylish little title about crime, love, sex, violence, weddings, a heist gone wrong, and the basic principles of aviation theory... I think? It's kinda difficult to pin down exactly what this is given the minimalist nature of practically everything about it. You don't really play it as such, more like you move around to progress a story told through sparse fragments of interspersed scenes which suggest much but which never really outright state anything. Instead, it's largely left to the player to give context and meaning to everything, and therein lies its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. Some will breeze through the very brief experience with little thought, others might enjoy reading the world as they play through. A great curiosity without a massive amount of substance, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it outright as a must see, as even with the included, equally short prequel, Gravity Bone, there still isn't much here you couldn't really live without. But I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from checking it out if the price was low enough to justify your intrigue.			"

												My first attempt at playing Thirty Flights of Loving ended in a crash just a few minutes in. I gave it another go, powered through Gravity Bone (the prequel, included) in about 20 minutes, and finished Thirty Flights proper in another 15. I went to bed and spent the next hour laying awake, thinking about it. If that sounds like a good time to you, by all means pick it up right now. If you're skeptical, read on.TFoL is a very short narrative game about three people engaged in some less than legal dealings. The story is presented from first-person in a heavily stylized world that evokes the colorful spy thrillers of the late 60s and early 70s. There's little to do besides walk and trigger events, and the non-linear presentation of the tale makes it hard to follow exactly where you are and what is going on. It's an intense and confusing journey that's going to take more than a little digging on your part to make any sense of.This is actually a pretty sharp contrast to Gravity Bone, which is a surreal vignette of the life of a spy. There's more interaction and actual gameplay there, with some exploration to do and simple inventory to use to accomplish your missions. A bizarre sense of humor that strays almost into Jazzpunk territory helps prop it up, and then it all ends quite suddenly, game and humor alike. I'm glad it's included with TFoL because it helps flesh out the strange world and its symbolism a bit, and finding the links between them is certainly interesting.What you're getting is a heavily-stylized walking sim with loads of meaning behind the short, staccato scenes. The overall feel of the game is unsettled and almost dreamlike, inviting you to read into every part of the presentation. This isn't something like a Tale of Tales game where it's congratulating itself on how clever and meaningful it is, mind you. Every part of Thirty Flights of Loving simply is, it just exists to be experienced, and waits for you to divine the meaning for yourself. There is seriously not much game here, and it's hard to really suggest a purchase, but I consider my time with it well-spent. I might even revisit it to puzzle out more meaning, or just experience the 30-minute fever dream again.And if nothing else, Thirty Flights of Loving presents one of the best explanations of the Bernoulli Principle I have ever seen. I don't think I've ever fully understood it until now, and I thank Blendo Games for that.			"

												For about the last decade or so, it has been very thoroughly debated whether or not video games are an art form. To me a type of media becomes an art form when there is a piece of that media that has its head up it's own♥♥♥♥♥ and is filled with the pretentious ""you just don't get"" attitude. After playing Thirty Flights of Loving... I have now come to the conclusion that video games are an art form.This game cannot physically last you longer than an hour. In 54 minutes I have accomplished to beat the game twice, beat the free game that has been included as an extra, tinker a bit in the options, and completed the game once more with developer commentary (and I listened to all of them). Now a short game in itself isn't a bad thing, but if you aren't going to deliver on length you have to deliver in memorability and quality, and Thirty Flights doesn't deliver in either.""But the story isn't linear"" cries the proffessional critic. Wow, what an amazing feature to have. Movies have been doing this for decades, and when someone sloppily puts together an uniteresting ""outlaws fighting the establishment"" plot that has been bathed in Tarantino-influence (you know, without all of that pesky charm or character that Tarantino is great at implementing), but with the twist that it is a video game, I don't really feel like celebrating. I feel angry. You know what other game had an unlinear story? Beyond: Two Souls. I am not saying that game is masterpiece (far from it), but it had more going for it than this. Beyond: Two Souls biggest fault in my opinion was to be too ambitious story-wise and not ambitious enough gameplay-wise. It tried to tackle more story than it could handle, and then cut off the gameplay to deal with it. Thirty Flights is like that, with the exception that it isn't amitious story-wise either. It is a very basic and bareboned plot, and no amount of jumping to and fro in time and place will conceal that. It's super simple. You don't even need a second playthrough to get the plot. Sure there might be small details, but that's it.This game is an experiment and I can understand that. The problem here is that someone apparently thought that this overly artsy, simple story with no real gameplay and a bland atmosphere was apparently worth money, and five bucks at that. There are games on Steam for half of that price that will give you more and be more memorable in the end.What makes this really annoying to me is that I don't hate walking simulators. I don't hate art games. I don't hate sacrificing gameplay to tell a good story or trying to innovate. You just need to realize what your work is worth. And by putting meaningless slop like this on the forefront as great art is doing that media a disservice. It's pioneering and innovate, but it's not well made. The manner of jumping around in this simple cliché story, makes me feel like I'm playing a ♥♥♥♥ing demo.			"

												No, just no.First and foremost, this is not a game; it's an on-rails interactive short story. I knew this prior to purchasing this title (which was on sale at the time), but I was intrigued when I heard how innovative it was with its narrative presentation. However, I discovered that the ""innovation"" was simply a non-linear story offering virtually no exposition. And here comes the counter argument: ""Oh-no! The developer didn't hand you an explanation on a silver platter because you were too lazy and stupid to actually explore what the story had to offer!"" Nope. I did a second playthrough with developer commentary enabled, played the prequel Gravity Bone, and was still none the wiser.Now I'm not saying that these types of narratives can't work, but here's the problem with a lot of these stories: when very little exposition is given about the characters and how they relate to the world around them, this strips away any humanity the characters would have had, which in turn makes it difficult for the audience to have any profound connection with them. Just because a story is intentionally confusing, does not make it good.			"

After playing it the first time, I was still completely confused by the entirety of the experience; all fifteen minutes of it. But going through what you've seen to piece everything together is part of the appeal. TFoL succeeds in creating a method of storytelling that uses gameplay as the primary vehicle of the narrative, and for that it should be commended. I recommend it. Just don’t be surprised if piecing the narrative together takes longer than the actual game itself.			"

												Brendon Chung became notable many years past for his odd-ball and unique contributions to Half-Life modding scene with projects such as 1986, The Bootleg Squaldron, Bug Stompers and The Puppy Years. 1986 being one of the first Half-Life mods I have installed and The Puppy Years being a personal favorite of mine.So learning he was behind Thirty Flights of Loving made me ecstatic to buy and play.30 minutes after installing I can safely say I finished it. I went back for more to play the commentary mode as well.For the price of a nice sandwhich, a game this short would leave me rather infuriated, I mean I bought Rogue Warrior for 5 dollars after it got marked down from 69.99 and I beat that in an hour and a half when I realized performing execution moves on enemies restored my health and left me invulnerable during the action. That game left me angered, Thirty Flights of Loving was completed in a drastically shorter term and yet I left feeling delighted, mesmerized and intrigued.And above all, absolutely confused.The game flips expectations, delivers exposition without a single spoken word, is vibrant and all over the place in terms of design, story and themes. And I loved every second of this bizarre, wild ride.It's short and given the current price, may be a little bit too expensive for some considering the amount of time it takes to beat it. However, those looking for a unique experience and wanting have a piece of fiction leave them asking ""What!?"" at every scene should look no Further with Thirty Flights of Loving. :) "

												""not a game"" ""don't buy"", yeah yeah i get these opinions.But you know what? I bloody enjoyed playing this game.+ : graphics, gameplay, story in achronological order, characters- : yes. People here are totally right. It is SHORT. Literally 10 minutes of gameplay. But the gameplay is intense. And it is expensive too and not worth the full priceI got it in a bundle so that is massive thumbs up. If it were free, i am sure it would have had Overwhelmingly positive rating. But it isn't. Still GG. It is a piece of an art.Therefore 5+4 (for the order of the story)/10, would learn the Bernoulli's principle again			"

												Ther is a big difference between writing a story, taken out parts of it and then arange the remaning parts in a manner that makes it seam like its incomplete and writing a ""story"" thats incomplete from the beginnig. leaving major plotpoints to the players imagination is not god writing, its just lazy.and hoever thinks that the developer had a bigger plan and i was just not able to understand it, should play the game with the developercommentary. it reveals not some sort of mastermind, it shows a young man who makes his game without plan and more by accedent.that would be nice and charming, if the game would be free. but its not, and you get about 20 min of playtime.0/10 would not buy!

												Awful, pretentious joke.  It lasts about 15 minutes, the longest part of the game being finding the first door.  It barely tells a story and there's hardly any interactivity.  Do NOT buy this game for $5, and even if you get it on sale for a dollar, prepare to STILL feel ripped off.I only have 30 minutes of playtime because I was baffled and assumed that I missed something on the first playthrough.

												Disappointed! After two playthroughs, the first of which i was wondering if my computer was skipping frames by the millions, I must conclude that this is a cross-cutting bit of a mess.  It's a shame if professional critics can't see through this here emperor's new clothes. Perhaps it's a result of reviewing all too many similar games that makes this seem like best thing since sliced bread for game journalists.  I suppose if you're into (slightly) interactive art installations with nice music and confusing jumps back and forth in time this could be worth a try. For anyone else it's a bit of a waist of time, sadly.			"

The music is incredible and helps to set the mood for each specific setting in a really nice way. The player has to piece together the story, making due with what one can of it in a non-linear fashion.  I could somewhat see why this game wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea but it has an alluring charm to it that I think they might be overlooking. It's definitely worth the 5 dollars, going to a deserving indie developer.			"

												This is the short, avant-garde version of Dear Esther seen through the eyes of a film student with a penchant for Tarantino, noir and the new wave. If you have any interest in game design or interactive fiction, this and the included Gravity Bone are both worth a look. The designer's commentary is also worthwhile, but even then you're looking at an hour tops. The real value is in the many more questions it raises than it ever has any intention in answering.

												In a day and age where the price tag should mark the amount of content and quality to the game, Thirty Flights of Loving comes up short of the former, but the latter is achieved through a unique take on storytelling where it does better in 15 minutes than what most games try to do in 15 hours.

												First of all, there is no inbetween with this game, you either hate it or love it. So before you spend that precious $1.24, let's evaluate if you will or will not love it:1. Do you like point and click games?2. Do you like heavily plot based games?3. Are you into cinematography, graphic arts, and/or innovative story telling?4. Do you value the EXPERIENCE of a game over what you can actually DO in a game?If you answered ""yes"" to all 4, this is definitely the game for you. This kind of game is so different and wonderfully pieced together. I cannot believe how many emotions this game made me feel in under 10 minutes. It was heart-pounding and heart-felt. DO realize though that it's more of a visual novel and therefore your actions are chosen for you, you just are simply there to enjoy the ride. Which is exactly what I did, I enjoyed the ride.AS A BONUS: you also get their first game Gravity Bone (can't find it? hit esc and click careers) which unlike this sequal allows the player to move and figure out what they have to do, which is much more interactive but still as fun as Thirty Flights of Loving.

												Like Gravity Bone (which it comes with) the game is a short story that will take a couple playthroughs and investigation of the environment through each playthrough to fully piece together what is actually happening.

												This is at its best an ~*artistic*~ walking simulator.This is at its worst a diminutive walking simulator.This was an effort by its designer (apparently) to engage in storytelling without typical narrative techniques, ie. Voiceovers, random data files, etc. Commendable, but borrowing from cinema isn't anything new. Games have borrowed from cinema repeatedly.What this game doesn't really spend much, if any, time doing is having the actual structure of the gameplay inform us of story. At one point, in his commentary, the designer explains that he used a characters acceptance of our taking an orange for ourselves to show that this was a space we belonged in. But in a game with such sparse interaction, we as players can't tell the difference between a character's acceptance of our actions, and lazy coding that failed to include consequences for our actions.

												What can i say about this game that the trailer doesn't say. this game is quite possibly the most action-packed game of this century, there are so many conflicts in this game so many loving characters, so much character developement within this game that is only 5 bucks! There are mininal amount of words that can describe the depth to what is game is carrying out do yourself a favor and buy it it's an emotional roller coaster that will leave you in tears and will also make you laugh at times , The only problem i have with this game is that there are not even close to thirty flights and the only loving in the game is when you ♥♥♥♥ the brains out of this chick. Although with the tragic ending there is i suppose it tells you that love is the only thing eternal and we only have a small amount of time before we die so live it up and never look back 5/5 must buy game of the century. This game will teach you what love truly is, what friendship truly is, and what courage truly is. out of the the 40 times i've played this game it has made me cry almost everytime i've played it is just such a good game i CANNOT stress this enough i need another one of these games.

												This game is great, but a lot of people don't like it. That's okay. You don't have to listen to them. If you get GravityBone as well, this is the same sort of game--but better. If you liked, GravityBone, you'll probably like TFoL. That said, it's really for specific audiences.			"

												I was told that this was the best 15 minutes of storytelling that someone had ever experienced. After playing it, I agree. Thirty Flights of Loving is a tale of prohibition era bankrobbers told in much the same way we remember and dream - in fragments, emotions, and scattered images. Beautiful.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is the sequel to the game Gravity Bone from 2008.It is the perfect game to play when you have a bunch of friends over. Its extreme strangeness and unique humor will leave you all utterly confused. It's not just weird and funny, though. Through its simplistic style, it is able to convey an intriguing and comprehensive story.If you aren't sure what to expect and don't want to spend $5 on something that may disappoint you, download Gravity Bone. You can download it for free from the developer's website.If you do buy it, be sure to play through a second time with the developer commentary on. It is fascinating to see how much thought went into the level design, and I have great respect for the developer, Brendon Chung.			"

												I did not enjoy this game. It's just a bunch of confusing rooms and poorly-animated character interactions. The environments and graphics were ugly, even if the art style is meant to be simplistic. The gameplay seems to be split into 2 stories: Thirty Flights of Loving and Gravity Bone. TFOL is just exploring various environments; there is almost no interaction by the player other than walking. Gravity Bone has more interactivity, with items to use and quests to complete, but it is still extremely linear and vague in terms of what is happening.I do give this game credit for attempting to tell a story without voice or dialogue, but it was executed terribly. Maybe I just suck at infering things, but I could not follow what sort of story this game was trying to tell.			"

												Recieved this game as part of the Humble Freedom Bundle.Gotta say, it's very short, with no instruction. I spent longer wandering around the first area drinking maple drink (or was I just picking it up? No one knows, least of all the player.)I'm all for visual novels, even those with limited interaction, but this one was painfully short, with so little story that even the title of the game didn't make sense.Go check out their first game, which you can play for free. Who knows, maybe someone other than me will understand and enjoy what they're trying to do here.(I must admit, peeling the orange was oddly satisfying.)			"

												I ended up enjoying it, but i can't recommend Thirty Flights of Loving, unless you carefully read about it and knows exactly what you'll get or experience. Then you can find it cool, just after you understand what it is.My first experience was disappointing.Being someone who usually enjoy art games or interactive experiences, i start it thinking about a cool, deep story-driven game, but i found me just watching disordered short scenes of a shallow and confusing story, instead of really playing something. It ended really fast, abruptly and letting me with a ""wtf?!"" in mind. The graphics, lights, colors and music are really cool, but it was not enough to make me enjoy.Then i try it again a few days later.Knowing what to expect, the experience was far better, and i used to enjoy it and understand it. Using the commentaries feature, i found it was a developer experience, something really personal using his experiences on gaming design and pieces he previously wanted to use in other ways.I don't read all the comments yet, and i still having to play better the Gravity Bone bonus, who seems to have more gameplay elements, but if you're ok with all that i said before, i can recommend this experience to you, it worth your time. But i'll not recommend to everybody, mostly without that explanation about what i feel in my first contact with it.			"

You can't really play it, you have to experience it. The music is brilliant though. It's the kind of music that could be used in movies. I enjoyed it THAT much. The 'game' itself... not so much though. It does a decent job of telling a story but I have no idea what it's all about. It seems you have to 'play' it several times to fully understand it.

This game does neither of both and instead, it stands as a pretentious attempt at somethingthat'll most likely leave you scratching your head and wishing for a refund.Pros: The art style is about the one thing that's been done right, the simplistic aesthetics are pleasing on the eyes.Cons: If you were expecting a game, with...you know, gameplay, you'll find little to nothing of that here. Not for everyone.			"

												The problem with this game is that it's actually good, but it's so short, that by the time you start to like it, it ends. After I played the free prequel (Gravity Bone) I bought this thinking ""that must be a full fledged game ambiented like Gravity Bone"", but I honestly felt cheated. In reality this game felt even shorter and less fun than the free prequel.Gravity Bone had some stuff resembling puzzles where you needed to think what to do, but this didn't improve or expand on that at all, and actually cutted back on that, to the point it almost felt like a short film instead of a game.The good points about this game are the ambience, the story and the music.Maybe if you group this together with Gravity Bone you have something close to better length.In conclussion I would play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a full game ambiented like these games, but this felt like a demo.Hopefully some day...

												I have spent 31 minutes playing this game, at least half were setting up my computer and trying to make it work. This game is... Well to put it bluntly,♥♥♥♥♥♥  A 10 minute game, where the entire ""gameplay"" is walk from point to point, and that's bad.  The game offers you a use item button, and a inventory system.  I found guns, I couldn't use, oranges that you can peel and eat (for no reason) and ... that's it. I can't express how low my opinion of the game, even when the game should be constricting you to a position (riding on a motorcycle, in a plane) you're able to free roam for no reason.  I'm riding on a bike and I can walk to the right or left, and yet still travel at the same speed as the bike, and then the game ends? The story is rough.  There's what feels like four scenes, but it doesn't really fit together in any interesting way.  The name of the game makes almost no sense.   And overall there's nothing good to recommend here. The only good news is if you buy this game, you can play it and get a refund in the time it takes watch a tv show with out commercials.   But honestly, there's NOTHING here. I can't believe people would recommend a 10 minute game to anyone. And btw no this isn't ""art"" I don't think you can hide behind that, there's games that are art, like Stanley's parable, Gone Home, and The Beginner's guide, and I can have different opinions on them.  This isn't even attempting to be art, it's a cash grab.			"

												What made me want to play this game is how critics say that it has great story telling. When you start playing, you find a hidden passage in the wall and a gun behind the counter. Once you go through the door, you collect more guns and ammo for them. However, they are never used since the ""game"" is entirely about the story. From this point on, it feels like the game is rushing through its story. Key word on the rushing. One moment, you are riding on a plane. The next, you are walking down a busy hallway. What makes this strange is that there are no transitions from one scene to another. This often makes it feel less like real story and more like a random collection of clips from several movies. Add to it that the whole thing ends in 15 minutes, and it feels more like a test program. They included another game called ""Gravity Bone"" that feels more like a real game, but it still does not feel like it is enough to worth buying. If you can play this on a friend's computer, do it that way. My family got it because it was part of a bundle. As a standalone product, I would not recommend buying this one.			"

												This is actually really cool, it's rare to see games do so much with so little. With cube heads, a simple linear path, essentially no words (okay, that's a lie, I guess I mean no dialogue), and about fifteen minutes, it manages to be something of a masterclass in game storytelling, communicating at a level of effectiveness that verbose, exposition-heavy ""AAA"" rollercoasters would kill for.For me, the use of sharp cuts ahead in a scene, or between scenes, was worth the price of admission alone. It's a technique I've of course experienced in many many films, but I don't think I've ever seen it used in games before, and it's a wonderful way of both creating (or perhaps emulating) a certain style, and putting you in the headspace needed to make the most of each scene.Yes, it's ""only"" fifteen minutes long, in the same way that, I don't know, Swift's seminal essay A Modest Proposal is only a few pages, or your favourite song only lasts three minutes thirty. If you're one of the people that (bizarrely, I maintain) measures experiences by dividing cost by length, this isn't for you. And I wasn't, you know, floored; blown away in amazement. But it is quietly amazing; a significant accomplishment content to sit and do its own thing while the world shows off noisily around it. I think people with an interest in the presentation of narrative in games - beyond mere text dumps - should really check this out.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  This isnt even a game...its about 10 minutes long, there is no challenge, barely a story, and its ugly to look at!  This game probably only cost $100 to make and was probably made in a day or less.  The only reason it got good reviews was because it was ""original"".  Its the same reason why modern art and paintings of smeared feces get good reviews....because some reviewers think it breaks the mold and brings something new.  Giving this a good review is dangerous for gaming....essentially anyone can spend half a day just throwing a bunch of polygons together, and as long as you can move around it will count as a game....dont support trash like this.  Literally the worst ""game"" I have ever played!I would consider buying if it is 50 cents or less just so you can see how bad this game is....cant believe this crap got like an 85% on metacritic.  Just buy it to see how delusional some game reviewers are now and days!-1/999999999			"

I literally regret all the 149 cents I've spent on ""this"". Not because of the small amount of money I've spent. I regret I've supported, even a little, a developer like that.Look, I LOVE arthouse. I love games without traditional gameplay (visual novels or whatever they are called). I love The Path, I love Dear Easther, I love The Stanley Parable, I love The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.BUT THIS. Critics claim it's brilliant, 'cause it doesn't present you linear nor transparent storyline, so you have to decide all the plot and intrigue for yourself.I don't have problems with the plot, my problem is that those claims are lies. This ""game""... Geez, I can't name it nor ""game"" nor ""visual novel"" in fact. Ok, this ""thing"" doesn't even trying to do something good. Like, literally, I can't see the developer trying to be good in any aspect of this... ""thing"".Graphics, animations, sound design etc. are not intentionally simplistic, they simply lack any art style or tech, programming is horrible. In the most horrible sense possible. That leaves you with a story... Except all those ""visual novel"" games I love tear their asses to present the story in most beautiful, unusual and most memorable way. And this ""thing"" not even trying. Supposedly intentionally, but in fact, because of untalented developer who couldn't make any idea.It's not Malevich's Black Square. It's simply a square. Not even sure it's black. It's pseudo art.In developer commentaries it was said, that the scene with floating objects was initially bug, but dev decided to make it a part of the ""game"". Well, the WHOLE damn ""game"" is like that, in fact. SOLID BUG.			"

												The game is literally a 10 minute long walking simulator telling a story in a nonlinear fashion with jump cuts. 10 minutes. I find it highly unethical to charge money for that.Edit: Gravity Bone (by the same developer) is about the same length, is free, has actual tasks for the gamer to accomplish and a great twist ending. Play that instead.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving feels like a pitch for a bigger game. Before things could get interesting, it's over.I'd like to point out right away that the game did not like my computer. The game crashed multiple times after trying to change settings, and I managed to somehow die during the first jump cut...and then crash. Setting the game's executable to Windows 98 compatibility mode and setting the resolution options as launch parameters seemed to fix it.I do quite like the art style, and the music and sound effects are excellent. It's just a shame that there's not too much of any of it.That's not to say what's there is bad. I like the general presentation of the story, for the most part. Due to the jump cuts, it can be unclear on the exact order of events that occur. You're missing parts of the story, and what's there is out of order, but piecing it together isn't ridiculously complicated. That said, I can understand why it might confuse some.As I said before, though, it feels like a pitch to raise money for a longer version of the game. I want more details on the story. What went wrong with the job they were on, and what was the job they were doing, anyway? You have to give a reason for people to care. A summary of a story never has the impact that the full story does.My feelings about Gravity Bone, the prequel to this (and which is included in this package), can be summed up in pretty much the same way, with one additional complaint: the gameplay. While Thirty Flights of Loving is mostly a walking simulator with very limited activity, Gravity Bone has a few items that you pick up and carry in your inventory. While having  interactivity is fine in a walking simulator, Gravity Bone makes the mistake of making what limited interactivity is in the game repetitive and unenjoyable, and honestly could have been done better with either reduced/smarter use of it, or near complete removal of it.If Blendo Games decides to come back to this universe, I'd really like a more fleshed out experience next time. I don't mind the linearity or the absurd-yet-serious tone, but there's just not enough here to justify your time or your money.			"

												Much like Dear Esther this game (and its included predecessor Gravity Bone) concentrates on the narrative, so it's more of a story to experience, than a game you could actually ""play"" (apart from moving around). Also it's short. I mean really short. As in ""20-minutes-short"". But still manages to tell a better story in this short time than most other games do in multiple hours. I found it to be quite captivating and once you finish it, there is still a lot to think about. I'd say this ""game"", just like Dear Esther, comes closer to being art than to being a game. So definitely not for everyone.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving does not feel like a game. But understand, right now: this is not a failing. What is it then?As near as I can tell, Thirty Flights is a non-linear interactive story played out across several charmingly presented and deeply odd instances involving smuggling and espionage. The tale has it all: romance, excitement, Jeff Goldblum, ducks, mutes, illegal substances, and comradeship. It also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. So, what does Thirty Flights of Loving does feel like?A bloody good time. You will play through it again and again - okay, at least twice - following the same path, but trying to figure out quite what just happened, and why, and how; and when exactly it ended.			"

												Ooh, a heist game that pays tribute to the films of Wong Kar-wai, tinted with the sensibilities of French New Wave, and is inspired by classic adventure games of yore! Sign me up!Thirty Flights of Loving doesn't even last the amount of time indicated in its title, but the experience is as powerful as a dozen bottles of downed prohibited hooch to the gut.Told through a series of jump cuts, you and your allies arrange a heist but -- as seen in the introduction -- it goes horribly wrong. Jump cuts send you back to an earlier time, then one less idyllic, then one utterly chaotic.Twists and turns develop -- was that a ********* person ******* in my ***? It is! And what about the **** at the end? Despite the game being on rails, the narrative is not. Wait, rails? That's right. The game, more of an interactive short film, is essentially you holding W to move from jump cut to jump cut, and occasionally pressing E to interact with an object. Do this often, I implore you!If you want to control a character that'll shootmens and look down at his 4K-textured hands and shout in desperate confusion, ""What have I become?!"" then this isn't the game for you. If you want to take a break from the usual games and follow along a neat little narrative, then strap yourself in for a ride.After all, it's just a quick heist -- in and out. What have you got to lose?			"

												Much like Dear Esther, this game is more about the joy of experiencing and piecing together a disparate narrative than the challenges you must overcome to reach that narrative.  It's a blast to play, and even more of a blast to figure out what it's about once you finish it (and probably replay it half a dozen times).  The game may be less than six minutes long, but every one of those minutes is more engaging and interesting than an hour you'd spend with any other typical game.  For that, I'd say you're getting pretty good bang for your buck.  Vive Nuevos Aires!  Vive Citizen Abel!			"

												Well this ""game"" is not really a game at all. It's a short story plain and simple. The gameplay consists of moving through a one way corridor with no branching paths to explore.

												A very interesting experiment in first person non-linear storytelling. If you are interested in storytelling, how tales are told and put together, independent or small team games (just one man), or things that are unique I recommend it wholeheartedly. The game is also very film-like and film inspired, growing out of its influences to create a new original experiences. If you are looking for a fully fleshed and feature first person action or gaming experience then this is not it and you will be disappointed, but that is not the point of this game. Thirty Flights subverts the tropes of first person games intentionally to create a game that is different for each player depending on the baggage, or lack thereof, they bring with them.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is an interactive art piece, pure and simple. It's similar to ""Dear Esther"" in that there is no actual game play, however, the story is fun and it's visually appealing. The style reminds me of Mine Craft using that popular cubism style. The story was fun, kind of like a 70s hiest movie. If you jump right into it you may be a bit confused but a second play through will bring clarity, since the time line in the story is non-linear. Which brings my next point, also like ""Dear Esther"", the game play is relatively short. I'de say there is about fifteen to thirty minutes of game time. Over all, it was an enjoyable experience though.However, i have the same issue that i had with ""Dear Ester"". These games are great but they last a very short time. Also, they have virtually zero re-play value. Given that, i don't think i would have paid full price for either of them had i known this. Let's give some perspective...Dear Esther is 10$ with around a hour and a half of game time...Thirty Flights of Loving is 5$ with around twenty-two minutes of game time...a movie ticket is around 10$ and normally about two hours.These artistic game experiences are great but i would only recommend buying them on sale. Thirty Flights of Loving was on sale for just over a dollar, Dear Esther was on sale for around four dollars i think. Wait for the sales, but definitely buy them.			"

												Talking about it would mean spoiling it. You have not bought it yet & ask yourself ""is it worth it?"" You are poor & have to count every penny? Then, no. If you are rich & enjoy a one-time cinematic experience that equals getting hit by a train, or robing a bank, racing your Lamborghini with your girl friend next to you, past the Casino de Monte Carlo, while she lights you a Gauloises - you definitely will enjoy this.

												Thirty Flights of Loving is an interactive art piece, pure and simple. It's similar to ""Dear Esther"" in that there is no actual game play, however, the story is fun and it's visually appealing. The style reminds me of Mine Craft using that popular cubism style. The story was fun, kind of like a 70s hiest movie. If you jump right into it you may be a bit confused but a second play through will bring clarity, since the time line in the story is non-linear. Which brings my next point, also like ""Dear Esther"", the game play is relatively short. I'de say there is about fifteen to thirty minutes of game time. Over all, it was an enjoyable experience though.However, i have the same issue that i had with ""Dear Ester"". These games are great but they last a very short time. Also, they have virtually zero re-play value. Given that, i don't think i would have paid full price for either of them had i known this. Let's give some perspective...Dear Esther is 10$ with around a hour and a half of game time...Thirty Flights of Loving is 5$ with around twenty-two minutes of game time...a movie ticket is around 10$ and normally about two hours.These artistic game experiences are great but i would only recommend buying them on sale. Thirty Flights of Loving was on sale for just over a dollar, Dear Esther was on sale for around four dollars i think. Wait for the sales, but definitely buy them.			"

A second or third playthrough is even more rewarding than the first. You begin ito pick up on things you had missed before. The developer commentary adds another level of depth to the game where he explains details about the development process. Sure, it's not for everybody, but it's perfect for the audience that will appreciate it.			"

												Very short, but it has lot of punch to it i enjoyed how short it is. I love the fact that this game's design chose to not have words but rather use the surroundings as well as visual shots to tell what is happening. The first time you play threw it its a WTF Just Happened and its interesting as well as strange, Over time the comentairy as well as playing the 2 games really tells you what is happening in the story and some part are were they are. Moreover, its short little tressure and good look at game design from the persepective of linairty with NO SPOKEN WORDS,  just a short shot from a gun. well over all i say take it for what it is cuase as far as i have seen is there is not to many fast pased games like this that were good way to understand game design from the experience. I liked it as well and wanted to know more about were it all came from. i am sure some peole will be like wtf i don't get it i just spent 5$ AND  du ♥♥♥♥ did i just pay for all i got to say is look at it with a open mind and you will find some cool stuff out of this little game. weather in game disgine, movies, or story writting there is some thing to learn from this game.

												This game is a very short exercise in creative and finely honed storytelling.  A lot of thought clearly went into its design.  In a short space of time, using very basic tools, Thirty Flights of Loving is able to make you think and feel more than much longer and more highly produced games.  The blocky LEGO-like characters while incredibly basic still manage to express emotion and lend the game its own unique style.  Due credit must be given for the finely honed way in which the game engages the player's imagination.  However, it's hard to shake the feeling that this is more of game programming student's project worthy of an 'A' grade than a fully realized game.  For $1.69, I found it worthy of my money and time if only for the fact that it got me thinking about game design and how to engage player imagination in a streamlined fashion.  I would not have appreciated this game as much if I had not played through a second time with the developer commentary.			"

												Things you probably already know about the game from other reviews:- It's 10 minutes long. Max. - It is confusing.- Whether the game even has a story (linear or otherwise) is up for debate- If you pay $5 for it, you will be angry.Now, why do critics like this? Because the game has an incredibly interesting style, and makes us of some wonderful effects I've never seen before (interactive jump-cuts, soft-bloom floating people, Guy Ritchie-style job descriptions in physical space, etc.) If I paid two bucks for this (which it is right now), I would be okay. If it were even 10 minutes longer, I'd be okay with $5. Hell, just add any sense of choice at all (multiple endings, non-objective-related interactivity) and sure, I'd still be alright with $5. As it stands, though, there's just not a lot here. This doesn't feel like a game. It feels like a demo.Oh, and if you want two things in the same vein that ARE worth it, Gravity Bone is free on the developer's website, and JazzPunk is a full game with a similar aesthetic.			"

												Spoiler free review:It's a challenge to describe this game without giving it away. It plays more like an interactive short film than anything. The story is told in anachronic order with sudden cutwaways and relies on the scenery and subtle (and not so subtle) cues to tell the player what's happening.It's short and sweet, and a great achievement in the medium.Do I recommend this? Yes and no. A very niche sector of gamers would like this. The player character does very little and the lack of action may rub some people the wrong way (well except maybe for Gravity Bone, the free to play prequel included in this release, which has some action).But if you enjoy a good piece of fiction and like to piece togheter the events of the game and you don't mind the experience being about ten minutes short, by all means buy this thing!On a personal note, I loved it and played it a few times with the developer commentary to gain a better insight of it.

												This is an experimental, highly linear game which sees you only walking through scripted events to move the disjointed narrative (which leaves a lot to the player's imagination to discover) forward. Think of it as an interactive, yet not-so-intruiging short Pulp Fiction kind of story. The entire experience takes about 10 minutes and there's a developer commentary option too which is text-based and is mostly about the game creator himself than the game but some of the facts are cool to read. The game itself has its moments and it gets pretty intense towards the end.As an added bonus, the developer's previous game, Gravity Bone is also included in the package and can be played from the main menu. The irony here is that the main gem of this package is indeed the older one. Gravity bone is more interactive and has a much less bizarre narrative than 30 Flights of Loving. I guess this is really for the niche audience who'd like to have this kind of experience. I personally enjoyed it but exhausted every single aspect of it in less than 2 hours. If you want gameplay, stay away.			"

												If you're the sort of person who doesn't like a movie when the ending is ambiguous, don't buy 30FoL.If you like games that let you increase arbitrary numbers so they are higher than other peoples' arbitrary numbers, don't buy 30FoL.If you like examining your preconceptions about what a ""game"" is and enjoy narratives that require the cooperation of the audience, then bring your lunch to work tomorrow and spend that money on 30FoL instead.

												Same as Dear Esther this should be labeled as interactive story, as you don’t really control what is happening. The narrative is very good, making flashbacks and forwards to make emphasis in certain aspects of the plot, which is not bad either. It is incredibly short, 45 minutes or less, but for the price is not bad. One thing I really liked is that the developers added the freeware prequel to the steam version, so you can have both in Steam. Most developers should follow this example.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is a game that, just like To the Moon and Kentucky Route Zero, proves how powerful the interactive medium of video games can be in telling a story. Played from a first-person view, there is virtually no traditional gameplay, aside from being able to interact with the environment and explore its nooks and crannies. The soundtrack and the sound design are great, as well as its graphical presentation. The blocky characters, the usage of color, and the varied environments all mesh together into a game that looks quite unlike any other.But yes, there is nothing the player really does in the game, at least, not in the traditional sense. The real reason to play this game is for its story and, more specifically, the way the game presents its story. By employing the mechanics of film editing and cutting freely between events and scenes without any sort of input from the player, Thirty Flights of Loving spins the classic yarn of a heist gone horribly wrong in a wholly unique way. Its non-linearity and hectic pace is a refreshing change from the banality of most video game narratives, and the player truly has to work in order to understand everything that's happening. While the game can be completed in fifteen minutes or so, the scope and depth of the story told is one that far exceeds its actual runtime. Multiple playthroughs are not only necessary but also inevitable.Thirty Flights of Loving is certainly not for everyone. Many players have expressed outrage or frustration at the fact that the ""game"" isn't really much of one at all. Brendon Chung, the creator of the game, has himself described it as ""an interactive short story"". Ultimately, it does not matter. Thirty Filghts of Loving is a very important game, because it makes a legitimate attempt to tap into the vast potential for video games as a narrative medium. If that sounds at all interesting to you, go play Thirty Flights of Loving. It's an experience that you won't soon forget.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is the best answer to the question ""How much narrative can you fit into a 15 minutes time frame?"".You'll spend those 15 minutes as an unnamed member of a team preparing an heist and excaping from it.Also included, once you complete the game, is the first game ""Gravity Bone"" where you play as a spy in two different missions.PROS:-charming graphics and art style-top notch soundtrack-extremely good story told in a condensed and non-linear way-quirky sense of humour-""Gravity Bone"" is just as good and gives you 15 more minutes of gameplayCONS:-very short and linear-while the soundtrack is very nice the sounds (guns, vehicles etc..) are unimpressive

The fact that, once it was over, I wished it'd have been longer, a full game, is a testament to the game's top notch narrative. But perhaps its power truly lies in how well it tells a story and engages you as a player in such a short time.The game is indeed very short, linear and with little replay value but it'd be experienced at least once as a token of great storytelling: I agree the full price is too much for what it offers but it's absolutely worth it when on sale.

												An intriguing romp through a very curious  world. Though it might seem a bit short of gameplay it does a great job of  piecing together an interesting story wihtout relying on heavy text or dialogue. It's a great example of how a game can convey ideas and context in the simplest of ways. Not a bad grab for the price if you're looking for an unusual gaming experience you're not soon to forget. I think Gravity Bone also comes with the package and I really ended up enjoying even more than TFOL itself.			"

												Brendon Chung (developer of the game) is a cool dude, but no one should pay more than $1 for this game becuase of its length. I paid $5 and the game can be beaten in 13 minutes as others have said. That's a terrible value, so much so that I continued to go back to play the game thinking I had missed a section, or could make things play out differently. If it's on sale for $1, maybe then you should consider picking it up.			"

												Ooh, a heist game that pays tribute to the films of Wong Kar-wai, tinted with the sensibilities of French New Wave, and is inspired by classic adventure games of yore! Sign me up!Thirty Flights of Loving doesn't even last the amount of time indicated in its title, but the experience is as powerful as a dozen bottles of downed prohibited hooch to the gut.Told through a series of jump cuts, you and your allies arrange a heist but -- as seen in the introduction -- it goes horribly wrong. Jump cuts send you back to an earlier time, then one less idyllic, then one utterly chaotic.Twists and turns develop -- was that a ********* person ******* in my ***? It is! And what about the **** at the end? Despite the game being on rails, the narrative is not. Wait, rails? That's right. The game, more of an interactive short film, is essentially you holding W to move from jump cut to jump cut, and occasionally pressing E to interact with an object. Do this often, I implore you!If you want to control a character that'll shootmens and look down at his 4K-textured hands and shout in desperate confusion, ""What have I become?!"" then this isn't the game for you. If you want to take a break from the usual games and follow along a neat little narrative, then strap yourself in for a ride.After all, it's just a quick heist -- in and out. What have you got to lose?			"

												I'm all for games being as long as they need to be. Not every game needs to be a a 10 hour epic or 50+ hour open world game. A 2 hour game can sometimes tell a great story just as well and lends itself to tight and focused gameplay.With this game I thought I was in some sort of extended flashback introduction the whole time. When I got to the end I thought that the intro had drug on a little too long and behaps spoiled its plot a little too much, but no, what I thought was a transition to the start of the proper game was the end of the game entirely. Even when I took my time turning around and poking into dark empty corners the whole 'experince' took me less than 30 minutes. I was left feeling like I had played a demo. There are short games and there are artistic experments that should fall under freeware. This, in my mind, falls into the latter.			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28 I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for having never done it, because this game gave me cancer anyways			"

The ""story"" is told free of dialogue and the visuals jump from beginning to end in a very Tarantino sort of way. It's simplistic and stylish but the whole thing only lasts for about 10 minutes, so at the full price of $5 it's a tough recommendation. If it goes on sale or you're just curious give it a try.

It's a genuinely brilliant demonstration of how you can use snappy editing in games to tell a story that is thrilling, violent, funny, romantic, tense, wistful and tragic - and somehow manage all of that in ten minutes. I've gone back to it (and Gravity Bone) several times, just marvelling at all the fabulous little touches.Worried about the price?

VERDICT Wait for sale (6.5/10)Completion Time: 10-20 minutesBottom Line: ""A virtual picturebook""PROS+Engaging and Unique+Storytelling like never beforeCONS-Very very shortREVIEWAfter having completed this game multiple times now, I am left speechless. This is an incredibly engaging and unique experience that is simply incomparable to anything else out there. There is no way for me to tell you anything about the game without spoiling it. I would even advise against watching the trailer. What I will say is that this game is purely about story, and not about gameplay. Consider it a virtual picture book of sorts. That being said, this game is only 10 minutes long. You heard correctly. Ten minutes. If you include the second campaign in the package (which was the first project by this studio) you have a total of around 20 minutes. So if you are going to buy the game, get it on sale for a couple dollars. In my humble opinion, the money is well worth it.			"

												There seems to be a growing trend among the gaming industry about making the big titles as flashy as a Hollywood blockbuster helmed by Michael Bay.  It's all about the pretty skyboxes and particle effects.  Story and character have been given the boot in lieu of a more visually appealing game.  Well this game, as short as it is, is the complete opposite of what the triple A gaming industry is doing as it proves that with only a few visual cues and some basic animation a story can form all on its own.That has always been the beauty of gaming, the capacity of story-telling within a medium and allowing the player to use his imagination to fill in the gaps.  A hearty recommendation for anyone.  Although I would say to wait for the price to drop during a sale, as the length of the game may put many people off.			"

												So, what is this game? It's basically 15 minutes of story time, in which the author(s) weaves together a quick series of flash shots together. The minimalistic method is interesting, and entertaining enough for a one-time playthrough.  It's not great by any stretch of the imagination, though. The story given does not provide much literary merit, and is not nearly long enough to provide substantial ""proof"" for its concept. All it appears to be is a vehicle to demonstrate the potential of a unique storytelling concept to the video game medium. It works, but I would have liked an expansion on this idea beyond a 15-minute demo reel. Your impact as a player is nonexistent. There are no choices to be made. Failure is impossible. Your sole purpose is to tag along for the ride and see what Thirty Flights of Loving has to show you. At this point, there is no reason why this shouldn't be a short film instead, which is a perfect medium to make itself right at home. Is it art? Yes. But is it a game? No.			"

												It does some interesting things in trying to tell a story in a non-linear way, using techniques you find in film like cutting backward and forward in time. Unfortunately, it ends up being a lot like a film, you have very little impact on anything, you just hold W  to move forward until the next scene is triggered. There's nothing in this game that you couldn't experience just as well by watching a Let's Play video.			"

												Bought this on special and finished it twice in 20 minutes. There's some clever stuff in it, but I felt vaguely disappointed as I'd hoped to find it more of a step up from its freeware precursor, Gravity Bone.Definitely download and try Gravity Bone before buying. This is around the same length or shorter, less interactive (no puzzles or skill involved) and with a couple more interesting presentation techniques.If you love Gravity Bone and think it'd be worth paying a few dollars for a similar experience, go ahead. It's a short experimental piece that's not for everyone. Could potentially give you some ideas related to first-person storytelling if you're a developer, though, and if so that's worth considerably more than the price of entry.			"

												While I won't technically call it a game, I hope Brendon of Blendo Games carries the lessons of first person story-telling and level geometry from Thirty into a more substantial next project.Built on what seems like a modified Quake II engine, he proves that games need not be restricted by technology. I'm not sure if it's the out of sequence cuts or music but Thirty oft gave me the feeling of a Tarantino flick, which can't be a bad thing!			"

												Much like Dear Esther this game (and its included predecessor Gravity Bone) concentrates on the narrative, so it's more of a story to experience, than a game you could actually ""play"" (apart from moving around). Also it's short. I mean really short. As in ""20-minutes-short"". But still manages to tell a better story in this short time than most other games do in multiple hours. I found it to be quite captivating and once you finish it, there is still a lot to think about. I'd say this ""game"", just like Dear Esther, comes closer to being art than to being a game. So definitely not for everyone.			"

												Do not buy this if you expect a game, this is primarily meant to be a very short movie (10 minutes or less to complete), with a unique art style. Honestly the best time I had in this game was the fact that at one point you can peel and eat an orange. That was fun, the rest.. well mostly a waste of time and I got a headache from playing it. You cannot do anything yourself, other than some small interactions that have absolutely no influence on the game. You can pick up guns and other items, all of which you will never see and cannot use. That said, I bought it knowing somewhat what it was, as I intended to use it for a study project. But nope, even then I cannot recommend it. Its way too expensive for what it is, and should to be priced right be free. You can get a similar experience and a lot more fun from both free and paid games of this type.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving does not feel like a game. But understand, right now: this is not a failing. What is it then?As near as I can tell, Thirty Flights is a non-linear interactive story played out across several charmingly presented and deeply odd instances involving smuggling and espionage. The tale has it all: romance, excitement, Jeff Goldblum, ducks, mutes, illegal substances, and comradeship. It also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. So, what does Thirty Flights of Loving does feel like?A bloody good time. You will play through it again and again - okay, at least twice - following the same path, but trying to figure out quite what just happened, and why, and how; and when exactly it ended.			"

SPOILER ALERT!!!I didn't really understand the game until I read the excellent explanation below from Reddit.""Says Jazzputin:Here's what I think went down.1. You are a thief. You meet with two other master thieves, Anita and Borges, who have planned a heist. You proceed to fly to a building at which the robbery takes place. [SHOWN]2. You spend a day in the hotel planning/waiting for the heist (this the part where you see Anita throwing orange peels off the building). [SHOWN]3. As part of the heist you must pose as party guests, so you attend a party on the roof and everyone gets drunk. [SHOWN]4. You hook up with Anita (this is where things start to go wrong in the story). [SHOWN]5. You and Anita wake up in a hungover stupor; Borges is missing. [NOT SHOWN]6. Because the whole gang got drunk and woke up hungover and not ready for the heist, the heist is not set up properly and goes terribly wrong. Borges and Anita are both seriously injured. [NOT SHOWN]7. You and Borges escape through a mall/airport sort of place. [SHOWN] Anita manages to escape on her own somehow, despite her injuries. [NOT SHOWN]8. You and Borges, still escaping, face a standoff with police. [NOT SHOWN]9. During the standoff, Anita arrives in a getaway car, you get in and a chase ensues. [NOT SHOWN]10. The chase becomes deadly once Borges starts shooting at the police. At this moment the seriousness of the situation hits you; you realize you will not make it out of this. At this moment you have a fantasy: you realize you are in love with Anita, and you fantasize how nice it would be if you, her and Borges could live a simpler life if you just got away (the motorcycle scene). [SHOWN]11. In real life your car approaches a head-on collision with a semi, you can hear/see the semi in your dream and you come back to reality, and your car collides head-on with the semi. [SHOWN]I think the very end is ambiguous on purpose; it's not clear whether you survived the crash or died. The lobby you find yourself at the end could be a metaphor for the afterlife, or an extended life-flashing-before-your-eyes time for your character where he views previous parts of his life like museum exhibits.""

												There seems to be a growing trend among the gaming industry about making the big titles as flashy as a Hollywood blockbuster helmed by Michael Bay.  It's all about the pretty skyboxes and particle effects.  Story and character have been given the boot in lieu of a more visually appealing game.  Well this game, as short as it is, is the complete opposite of what the triple A gaming industry is doing as it proves that with only a few visual cues and some basic animation a story can form all on its own.That has always been the beauty of gaming, the capacity of story-telling within a medium and allowing the player to use his imagination to fill in the gaps.  A hearty recommendation for anyone.  Although I would say to wait for the price to drop during a sale, as the length of the game may put many people off.			"

The way the story is set out it appears to be hiding something, some jucy story piece or message but it just isn't, peel back the outer layers and there's just nothing. Hollow set linear pieces that bearly constitute gameplay disguised as art and nothing more. Who can blame the guy? The proffessional reviewers ate it up like candy, not wanting to be the one to point out the fact that there was just nothing. A clear case of the emperors new clothes			"

												So, what is this game? It's basically 15 minutes of story time, in which the author(s) weaves together a quick series of flash shots together. The minimalistic method is interesting, and entertaining enough for a one-time playthrough.  It's not great by any stretch of the imagination, though. The story given does not provide much literary merit, and is not nearly long enough to provide substantial ""proof"" for its concept. All it appears to be is a vehicle to demonstrate the potential of a unique storytelling concept to the video game medium. It works, but I would have liked an expansion on this idea beyond a 15-minute demo reel. Your impact as a player is nonexistent. There are no choices to be made. Failure is impossible. Your sole purpose is to tag along for the ride and see what Thirty Flights of Loving has to show you. At this point, there is no reason why this shouldn't be a short film instead, which is a perfect medium to make itself right at home. Is it art? Yes. But is it a game? No.			"

												Thirty Flights of Game Design:I you are into more modern games that force-feed you story, you probably won't like this game. It takes a quite different approach by explaining the plot through small chunks of information, forcing the player to piece together the events that happen. The result of this is a confusing and interesting series of small levels that  continue the plot. This game is meant to be a ride more than a game I would say, though there are game elements involved through small objectives or the possibility of death.For five dollars, this game is an interesting experience. I wasn't sure what to think when I beat it, but I liked that feeling. All I can say is that if you are a fan of interesting game design, you must play this game. If not, meh, I enjoyed it a lot. I think it's worth it.			"

												Much like Dear Esther this game (and its included predecessor Gravity Bone) concentrates on the narrative, so it's more of a story to experience, than a game you could actually ""play"" (apart from moving around). Also it's short. I mean really short. As in ""20-minutes-short"". But still manages to tell a better story in this short time than most other games do in multiple hours. I found it to be quite captivating and once you finish it, there is still a lot to think about. I'd say this ""game"", just like Dear Esther, comes closer to being art than to being a game.

If you are interested in storytelling, how tales are told and put together, independent or small team games (just one man), or things that are unique I recommend it wholeheartedly. The game is also very film-like and film inspired, growing out of its influences to create a new original experiences. If you are looking for a fully fleshed and feature first person action or gaming experience then this is not it and you will be disappointed, but that is not the point of this game. Thirty Flights subverts the tropes of first person games intentionally to create a game that is different for each player depending on the baggage, or lack thereof, they bring with them.			"

												If you think this is gonna be a long run a gun indie game then stop reading and leave. This game is a really short story packed game. When you beat it you'll either be confused or mad; probably both. But there's the beauty behind this game, this game allows you to interpert what happened in the 10-25mins you played due to game set up and lack of dialoge. If Ernest Hemingway created a video game, I bet it would looks like this. Using the iceberg princible the story gives you bare minimun of details and setting, then you as the player must piece together what happened. And that's about the whole game, So if you love good story games and don't mind playing it over and over again to try and solve what happens, then this game is perfect for you and I highly recommend it.

												Originally an early prototype for Blendo Games’s Gravity Bone, TFOL is difficult to classify within traditional gaming genres. Is it an adventure game, an action game, an art game, or an elegiac love poem? Well, it’s all of these and none. 30 Flights is an indie gamer's indie game. It occupies the same experimental vein as Proteus, The Path, and Journey. I know that may scare some of you off, but it shouldn’t. TFOL is basically a slick crime caper gone awry. Like Reservoir Dogs? You’ll probably enjoy this.As one comes to expect from indie indies, TFOL features simple graphics, quirky humor, an innovative yet enigmatic narrative structure, and great music. Despite its age, the Quake 2 engine has never looked this good. The blocky retro-visual style is utterly charming: think Minecraft meets No One Lives Forever.Thirty Flights of Loving focuses its sharp satirical lens on the over-the-top cinematism rife in video games and their tendency to imitate big-budget Hollywood Action movies. But it is also a powerful and moving homage to the stylish, discontinuous narration of French New Wave films. The game has often been compared to the work of Tarantino, but both the plot and razor sharp editing owes more to the formal innovations of Jean-Luc Godard's seminal film, A bout de souffle. Much of the central game experience involves trying to piece together its intricately crafted story. Temporal and spatial leaps await the player at every turn. Brendon Chung has a knack for capturing the gritty underworld vernacular that our anti-heroes inhabit. Interspersed throughout the game are moments of transcendent beauty. In one, Anita sits peeling oranges overlooking her vast apartment courtyard. The sound is particularly used to great effect here, realistically capturing the nocturnal soundscape of a large urban metropolis. In the climactic gunfight, the action recalls the poetic rhythm of Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. Without relying on dialogue text, voiceover narration, or UI, Brendon Chung manages to convey an entire world and story through the environment.To what degree any of this makes sense depends on the player’s perception. What exactly went down at Cugat airfield? Who is Winston Borges (a.k.a. Mo Golden, Moco Rococo, The Big Pai-Goo)? Is Bernoulli’s Principle the key to unlocking this puzzle? These are just some of the many questions you’ll ask yourself in 30 Flights of Loving.			"

Not sure the game's quality makes up for the small quantity, even at the $2.50 I paid for it. Very similar to, if an improvement of, their free downloadable game ""Gravity Bone"", which is also worth checking out (just Google it).

I would suggest playing the free Gravity Bone game first, and then watching a Let's Play to see if there is desire to replay for the subtle details.  Else, there are other options if you want gameplay that is easy on the wallet. ;)			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Thirty Flights of Loving is a game developed by Blendo Games. The game forms part of the Citizen Abel series which also has a prequel known as Gravity Bone which is also include in the gameThe game is extremely short, I completed everything the game had to offer in under 30 minutes and that for me is kind of ridiculous. I am not going to mention anything of the story because if I did I would tell you not to buy this game. The game is surprisingly developed on the Quake II and it shows as the game is horribly optimsed for modern systems, expect crashes if you want to play the game at 1920x1080There are also some sound issues and graphical glitches which hinder the game. Honestly, this game should have been offered for free as what Blendo Games did for Gravity Bone. Honestly, the game is extremely short and I discovered what the game had to offer in a relatively short time. This includes finishing Thirty Flights of Loving, Gravity Bone and playing Thirty Flights of Loving with its developer commentaryHonestly, even for the price the game is offering now, I wouldn't recommend it at all. Wait until it's dirt cheap (which is what I had done) or (although I do not condone it) pirate it and just see what the game has to offerOtherwise don't bother... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Not really a game, an interactive narrative like the more popular Dear Esther. It's very short, only about 15 minutes, but it's a nice little experiment and a nice narrative.  Since it's so short you'll likely play it a few times. It also has a nice commentary mode which provides a little insight into some development decisions. It's hard to justify spending 5 bucks on this game considering how short the experience is. If you can get it on sale though go for it, I can imagine it being a nice gift game.TFOL also includes it's prequel which is available for free on the developer's website.			"

While the game lasts for only 15 min, it pretty much tells it without filler and allows you to fill in certain ""gaps"" without losing the story.

VERDICT Wait for sale (6.5/10)Completion Time: 10-20 minutesBottom Line: ""A virtual picturebook""PROS+Engaging and Unique+Storytelling like never beforeCONS-Very very shortREVIEWAfter having completed this game multiple times now, I am left speechless. This is an incredibly engaging and unique experience that is simply incomparable to anything else out there. There is no way for me to tell you anything about the game without spoiling it. I would even advise against watching the trailer. What I will say is that this game is purely about story, and not about gameplay. Consider it a virtual picture book of sorts. That being said, this game is only 10 minutes long. You heard correctly. Ten minutes. If you include the second campaign in the package (which was the first project by this studio) you have a total of around 20 minutes. So if you are going to buy the game, get it on sale for a couple dollars. In my humble opinion, the money is well worth it.			"

It's a genuinely brilliant demonstration of how you can use snappy editing in games to tell a story that is thrilling, violent, funny, romantic, tense, wistful and tragic - and somehow manage all of that in ten minutes. I've gone back to it (and Gravity Bone) several times, just marvelling at all the fabulous little touches.Worried about the price? Fine: wishlist it, wait till it's on sale, you'll pay the price of a cup of coffee for something far more memorable.			"

												I find Thirty Flights of Loving very difficult to recommend. On the one hand, it's a finely crafted story and well stylised experience. On the other hand, it's very short. Like - 5 minutes kinda sort. Where the idea falls down is that it sacrifices gameplay for artistic expression. However, it does come with Gravity Bone, which is more of a game. That too could have been expanded upon, with different objectives per mission. It's a boiling broth of potential that just leaves you with a taste of faceless brievity.

												Wouldn't say this game is meant to be fun or a ""game"" in the traditional sense.  There's no open world, no dialog trees, and no dialog - plain and and simple..  It's short story told with narrative concision.A lot of the TFoL's story is subtley told through the environment or ""mise en scene"".  Even the disjointed narrative can slowly be pieced back into a chronological order when you assess your surroundings.  There's a difference between a game that smash-cuts to the past with an accompanying ""3 days prior..."" intertitle and one that lets the viewer/interactee figure it out on their own.The director's commentary is also a great addition for anyone interested in the developers design choices.  Same goes for the additional ""prequel"" content for anyone who wants flesh-out the TFoL universe.If you're still on the fence, buy when in a bundle or sale and remember to utilize the steam refund policy.

												I'm all for games being as long as they need to be. Not every game needs to be a a 10 hour epic or 50+ hour open world game. A 2 hour game can sometimes tell a great story just as well and lends itself to tight and focused gameplay.With this game I thought I was in some sort of extended flashback introduction the whole time. When I got to the end I thought that the intro had drug on a little too long and behaps spoiled its plot a little too much, but no, what I thought was a transition to the start of the proper game was the end of the game entirely. Even when I took my time turning around and poking into dark empty corners the whole 'experince' took me less than 30 minutes. I was left feeling like I had played a demo. There are short games and there are artistic experments that should fall under freeware. This, in my mind, falls into the latter.			"

												Brief:Really hard to give this a review.. It's not really a game. Its prequel, Gravity Bone, was a game. This is more an interactive story that is very confusing..Pros:+I just don't know..+I guess I like the art styleCons:-i just don't know..-Maybe some gameplay would have been nice, or maybe I'm just common muck that needs gameplay..

												This is really great, it's funny, touching and original with a great art style,  but it only lasts around 15 minutes so be aware of that when you purchase it. I'd almost say it's worth paying full price for to support the developer in the hopes they'll make something more substantial, but that would be down to personal preference. The music is awesome too.			"

A disappointing follow-up.I was a really big fan of Gravity Bone, and so I bought this game even though I knew it would be short. However, while the length did not disappoint,the game did. Compared to Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights Of Loving focuses more on trying to tell a story and ends up jumping around a lot in time and space and features more interactions with non-player characters. Unlike Gravity Bone, which had at least a few jumping puzzles, there is really no challenge at all to the game. The story also feels much less player-driven: as I mentioned before, it jumps around a lot in time instead of allowing the player to explore and experience the game at their own pace.Not worth $5.If you haven't played Gravity Bone, the original game, I implore you to check it out. It's a really cool, mysterious game that does a lot in a short time. And it's free to download at the Blendo Games website.			"

												More of a short story than a game, Thirty Flights of Loving uses cinematic principles to create an engaging world into which the player is thrown. Fantastic use of jump cuts and a non-linear storyline give it an almost Tarantino-eque feel. Indie gaming at its finest.			"

												Hard Cut: The GameReal talk though, this is a very short game that kinda serves more as an exercise in narrative more than anything else. In most games, story moments are broken up by gameplay and bosses, maybe just a level with some scenery. There is none of that here; You prep for a mission and then the games skips to the end before you even realize it. It does flashbacks, stylized shots, and vague narrative the same way Tarantino does movies, minus dialogue of course. If you're a connesuir of games or enjoy experimental storytelling, this is right up your alley. Otherwise, it's something to kill 10-12 minutes.			"

												I'm all for games being as long as they need to be. Not every game needs to be a a 10 hour epic or 50+ hour open world game. A 2 hour game can sometimes tell a great story just as well and lends itself to tight and focused gameplay.With this game I thought I was in some sort of extended flashback introduction the whole time. When I got to the end I thought that the intro had drug on a little too long and behaps spoiled its plot a little too much, but no, what I thought was a transition to the start of the proper game was the end of the game entirely. Even when I took my time turning around and poking into dark empty corners the whole 'experince' took me less than 30 minutes. I was left feeling like I had played a demo. There are short games and there are artistic experments that should fall under freeware. This, in my mind, falls into the latter.			"

												My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him ""if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28 I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for having never done it, because this game gave me cancer anyways			"

												A 13-minute game that has crashed 13 times as I've tried to play it. It's a Walking Simulator that you head through to gather the stray elements of a silent Heist Plot. It wrings a lot of style out of its blocky art presentation, and the non-linear story of what happened during and after the liquor heist tingles the brain through jarringly rapid cuts. But it's so brief that even the $1.24 I paid for it on a sale feels too much.			"

To me, it's a proof of concept, not a finished product which people should be charged money for.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving, as well as the accompaying Gravity Bone, aren't so much what I'd call video games, strictly speaking. Rather, they are interactive narratives, focusing not so much on the common aspects of gameplay and agency, and instead on the tools of exploration only really available to the gaming medium in order to tell their stories. A lot is left to the player's imagination, but there's just enough context to present something cogent and engaging. Aesthetically, I love this, with both its references to old-school espionage films and reliance on simple modular design. I recommend this strictly to experience this type of storytelling.			"

Since it's so short you'll likely play it a few times. It also has a nice commentary mode which provides a little insight into some development decisions. It's hard to justify spending 5 bucks on this game considering how short the experience is. If you can get it on sale though go for it, I can imagine it being a nice gift game.TFOL also includes it's prequel which is available for free on the developer's website.			"

If you really wanna see this game, go watch it on youtube, because you should ABSOLUTELY not waste your money on this. This whole game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke from the developers, and they should be ashamed of themselves. I got more game time in ♥♥♥♥ing No Man's Sky than this game.

												I really liked the presentation and pacing of this game. The way the narrative is presented really worked for me. The soundtrack cues come in perfectly. The story is cute as well. I don't get the emotional impact some writers talk about, but thats more of a my problem than it is the game's problem. Stories resonate for each of us differently, and maybe if I were in different circumstances it might have knocked a feeling or two loose. Who knows. I did enjoy it's sense of whimsy and adventure.There are lots of great little details if you care to look for them. I did care, and played through two times, then another time with the commentary. One of the nice things about short, dense games is that the investment time is low and I can easily explore them again and see new things. In larger games I get choice paralysis sometimes, where my desire to experience every bit causes me to get distracted when something is actually happening but oh no there was that hallway back there I didnt look in what if I missed some sick loots...The previus game in the series, Gravity Bone is included. While it's free from Blendogames.com, having it within the same package but as the 3rd option under the ""Career"" menu invited me to play it last and in succession. I did and appreciated the design choices re: failure states in Thirty Flights even more. I found it interesting to compare and contrast the previous work so quickly after completing the successor. Sorta like binge watching a movie series.This game is lovely and I recommend it.			"

												Got it from the Humble Freedom Bundle and honestly this game is not worth 5 bucks. It's really uninteractive, the word game does barely apply since all you do is move around and you interact with objects for like 10 times before the game is over after about 10 minutes.  The artstyle is rather lazy in my opinion. The only redeeeming factor of 30 flights of loving is its non linear storytelling which keeps you somewhat interested in these 20 minutes as you try to figure out how the pieces of action you see fit in a timeline.

												I probably spent too much time on this game, but I wanted to look at every detail. I played it once through, then played it with the developer commentary, and then played Gravity Bone. I don't really understand why everyone is so upset with it being short. After the developer commentary, I understand it a great deal more and appreciate it. This game was originally scrapped because it wasn't working out, and the developer knew that and even points out a bunch of the flaws and explains why he did what he did. It was only a prototype and was brought back to life to help a kickstarter. Nothing wrong with that. No, it wasn't game of the year material. But it was fun for what it was. I also enjoyed Gravity Bone. Perception is largely based in expectation. I wouldn't pay too much for it, but if you're a fan of indie games and interested in how they're made, I'd recommend it.			"

												As someone who loved the wackiness of Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights was just a disappointment to me. It is still incredibly short, being maybe 15 minutes long... and the plot. Well I'm not even sure what the plot was, beyond being vaguely spy themed and involving a love interest. It just felt like it was missing a few extra key details that would take the plot from ""I don't know what happened"" to ""I'm not certain what happened, but I have a few strong theories and an overall idea"". It didn't seem to understand the difference between ""up for intepretation"" and just being vague and confusing. There's not a great deal of repay value beyond looking for plot details you may have missed.I thought I was in for a treat, but I got something with less charm than Gravity Bone, and despite being free no real extra length or production value.

												I probably spent too much time on this game, but I wanted to look at every detail. I played it once through, then played it with the developer commentary, and then played Gravity Bone. I don't really understand why everyone is so upset with it being short. After the developer commentary, I understand it a great deal more and appreciate it. This game was originally scrapped because it wasn't working out, and the developer knew that and even points out a bunch of the flaws and explains why he did what he did. It was only a prototype and was brought back to life to help a kickstarter. Nothing wrong with that. No, it wasn't game of the year material. But it was fun for what it was. I also enjoyed Gravity Bone. Perception is largely based in expectation. I wouldn't pay too much for it, but if you're a fan of indie games and interested in how they're made, I'd recommend it.			"

												Not because it's short, but because it's a technical mess.- defaults to 720p.- Once you turn it to 1080p, pausing or tabbing out crashes the gameAlso the game is £4 for 15 minutes. Would be great, but Gravity bone seemed to make out like the followup would be a game, not an interactive movie.			"

												It is worth the 15 minutes it takes to go through it with development commentary. It is not good to pay any amount of money for it.They can call it art but they could call it 'my first game project I shipped' and that would apply as well. I am kinda disappointed actually.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is a relatively short game but I would reccomend it to pretty much anyone wanting to try something new. Try the free game ""Gravity Bone"" by the same developer beforehand to see if you will enjoy this. Buy this on offer if the price tag bothers you.			"

												I'm gonna say right off the bat, although I enjoy and recommend this game, I got it in a humble bundle and I'd be REALLY hard-pressed to say it's worth the asking 5$.  That being said; this game is less a ""walking simulator"" and more of a short film in the form of a game.  This feels like a lucid dream, and absolute trip.  And that in and of itself is what makes it a worthwhile story.  Although it's very hard to say anything without spoiling it, I'd say the fun ""game"" aspect is really just trying to figure out what the hell it's about.  Have you ever watched a bizarre psychological thriller and wondered throughout the film ""wtf is this even supposed to be about?!?!"" This game essentially is like that, but is a bit less patient and doesn't really keep you guessing that long.  Overall I did highly enjoy it, even if my steam log literally says ""13 minutes played.""  It is, simply put, a quality story in a trippy environment.  The ending is abrupt however, and unless you got it on sale or in a bundle, I can't imagine not being disappointed if I spent 5$.			"

												I loved Gravity Bone, this didn't do the same for me.While I am usually all for a game being as long as it needs, this game is too short. I don't think it properly tells its story within the 5 mins it takes to complete (longer including replaying it due to crashes) and would benefit from being longer. All it manages to tell is a shell of a story, the elevator pitch of a story, but not a story itself.As for the crashing, how in the world can a game based upon the quake engine which is generally stable crash so often? The game is 5 mins long and has no gameplay outside of walking, no choices to be made outside of small insignificant enviornoment interactions, I can understand that bugs occasionally happen, but I am not the only one reporting issues. Its not like this game will have tens of thausands of lines of code on top of what the game engine provides, how is it not stable, after being on the market for this long?Funnily enough when I got to the end I thought it was doing a fake ending, little did I know that was literally it.I got this game with the Humble Freedom Bundle.

20 minutesThat's all it takes to beat this game. There are two ""stories"" you can play where both are you running around doing nothing. The game is a little like telltale games except the fact that you don't do anything of signifigance in this game but running around. It shows that the developer has put love into this game and spend his time with it but it is really nothing great. The music is half tom and jerry and half ruining my ears. The artstyle is clunky which is fine but i wouldn't compliment it. and the gameplay is just running around pressing E once in a while and that's it. There really isn't alot to this game and you're probably better off watching some show for 20 minutes. I did find the game a little fun playing but with such a high price and so little and boring gameplay is it not worth it at all. If there were added some more story and maybe improved the gameplay could it be closer to worth it but even then would it probably not be near worth the 5 bucks.			"

												TFOL is a brilliant little game that challenges the current principles of narration. It's a bold and interesting experiment and the result is an endearing story centered around three outlaws who battle against an unfair government.Yes it is short but I found the game thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the time and price. Special mention to the soundtrack which really makes the game imo. They even included a second game that is as long as TFOL (15 minutes) and just as good.			"

												-Part of the Humble Freedom Bundle-Do not buy this game. 10 minutes of no dialogue, confusing ""gameplay"" and not real answer to what the story is or what is going on. Judging by the developer's commentary, The game was going to be so much more but due to his lack of direction he just wanted to cash out on the content he had made. Very poor.			"

												Despite the short gameplay, it was quite an interesting one, especially with the Development Commentary. The commentary itself showed the short experience in a new light, allowing me better appreciate the work and effort that went into it, not to mention how certain elements came to be.I was really hoping for a longer narritive, but its good for what it is. In any sense, with what the game provides in the time given, it really did get me interested in the story itself.Side note: Also, I'm curious to how this game got involved with the Humble Freedom Bundle. Either way, I appreciate the fact that Blendo Games was involved with the effort through this specific game being provided in the bundle.			"

												Thirty Flights of Loving is a really quirky, but in my opinion, very enjoyable game. The art style is unique, and even without any actual dialogue, the game tells an entire story. The game is pretty short, but it also comes with another game called Gravity Bone.

												Ah, this game is a bit too much for me. It keeps taking you back and forth and it feels too rushed (but that might also be the sort of feel they're going for) and you really have very little control over what you're doing. Some other people seem to enjoy it though so that's just my personal opinion.			"

												I think this game was designed whilst the creators were high on all sorts, with the target audience of fellow folks who are on a similar cocktail of drugs. I honestly don't know what just happened, although it had this strange pull towards it, as I thought it would get better. It didn't. My God.			"

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 39% YES / 61% NOGOODVisual style is clean and inviting.Soundtrack is stellar and adds to the campy spy vibe they're going for.NEUTRALThe story is unfortunately spastic and uninteresting, which really untangles this experience. I can see what they're going for, but too often does it jump around haphazardly and, if you look at the story overall, it's not very inventive. It's incredibly run-of-the mill, snack-sized spy tales.BADControls feel bad which, won't be a problem for most of the game since you barely have agency, but WILL matter if you attempt Gravity Bone where first person platforming is required. If you're wondering what it feels like to have a 9 minute game grind to a sudden halt, you'll find it at the flag poles.Quite frankly there just isn't much for you to do. In fact there's barely a need for the player to be there. Beyond buying this to support the developer, I honestly don't think any player will have any meaningful experience outside of just watching someone play this through a video site.SUMMARYMore art than an actual game, I just can't recommend people pay for this if they're wanting to PLAY a game. Absolutely buy this if you're wanting to support the dev and you liked the story after watching a video, but I doubt you'd have any different experiences playing this yourself.			"
