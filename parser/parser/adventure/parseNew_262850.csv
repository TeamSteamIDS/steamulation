												The Journey Down is a modern take on the old school point-and-click adventure game, which draws inspiration from the golden era of adventure games (Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Leisure Suit Larry etc.). The characters are inspired by those creepy traditional African masks (Sort of like how Grim Fandango was inspired by Mexican Día de Muertos masks) and combines it with a noir setting and Rasta accents.This game heavily relies on the environment, which, in my opinion, is a make it or break it for an adventure game. What the game lacks in story (pretty generic corrupt government tries to cover up a secret-story), the environment and atmosphere makes up for it. The hand drawn backgrounds are gorgeous, the music perfectly complements the drawn art and really adds another dimension to the noir tone of the game. The dialogue is for the most part fun and clever, while sometimes it can get a little too goofy. The voice actors are doing a perfect job with the material they are given. The puzzles are one of the biggest improvements over the first game. I found the puzzles more creative and challenging in this chapter (dial a number, type in on a computer-type of puzzles). I was stuck a couple of times, but it never got to the point where I got so frustrated that I wanted to quit the game. The puzzles are always logical, unlike some of the older adventure games where you had to combine completely random items and go pixel hunting). If you are an experienced adventure game player they are still on the easier side, but it's certainly a huge improvement over the first chapter. The chapter is pretty short, but for a 9 euro game it’s not too bad. You should be able to complete it in one sitting. 3-5 hours.The ending is pretty anticlimactic. You finally arrive to the destination you have been working towards, and the game ends. Pretty annoying, but it makes me look forward to Chapter 3.While it’s not as good as the games it draws inspiration from (Notably Grim Fandango), it’s still a great game with a lot of memorable moments. I recommend picking this up for nostalgia value (If you like me grew up with The Curse of Monkey Island and Grim Fandango), if you just enjoy Lucasarts-type adventure games, or if you more recently picked up Broken Age and enjoyed it.Loved it,8,5/10			"

Go around collecting items you need to let you progress throught the level, meet more people to give you objectives and learn about your possibilities.  Pros & Cons ++  Pros + Charming graphics/models+ Story rich+ Enough things to do / keep busy+ Puzzles are not to hard+ More environment/adventure than the first game-- Cons - Audio is off with the video in cut scenes- Some times hard to find out what your supposed to be doing Personal Opinion This game is addictive! I am stuck on his game and was so excited to play it! This is a nice easy chilled out game where you can sit back and enjoy the game and all of its features and surroundings. You have great character personalities, charming cartoony graphics, adventure, goofy jokes, and a story that will keep you going. Take your time and appreciating the art really gets you into the mind set! This game is just as good as the first one, and i reccomend the frist one as well! I reccomend playing it before you play this one so you FULLY understand whats going on! :) Final recommendation: I highly recommend this game to the gamers that need to relax and enjoy a good story without any rush. I would rate this game 7.5/10 due to minor defects that kind of break the mind set. Other than those I will continue playing these games if there are going to be any sequels or prequels.

												As far as I'm concerned this is NO downside to this game. It's completely satisfying, as is.* Still plays like an spiritual sequel to Grim Fandango but with Afro-Caribbean and Pan-African design sensibilites rather than indigenous Mexican aesthetics. Absolutely gorgeous level design and character modelling. * The puzzles are slightly more challenging than in Chapter One, with a healthy mix of lateral thinking, minigames, and inventory management. * Even better storytelling than Chapter One. If this started out with heavy Indiana Jones vibes, then Chapter Two brings it firmly into D!ck Tracy territory, with dirty cops, intimidating mobsters, corrupt powers-that-be, and a bleaker urban noir vibe.* Builds on the setting established in Chapter One. Fascinating, in-depth world-building, from the mistfarer trade and piracy on the ""high soup"" to the looming threat of the influential San Armando Power Company.* Quality soundtrack -- a lively mix of laid-back Caribbean island grooves and freewheeling jazz.Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												9.1/10 – A Massively Overlooked Point and Click Series!I loved the first episode; but this one really pumped me up and got me hooked on the series! I enjoyed this so much that I will definitely buy the third episode and likely anything else from this developer moving forward. The game itself is beautiful, a blend of steampunk and detective/noir elements! The overall story, content and atmosphere really take the series to the next level!This game picks up where Bwana and Kito left off; journeying to the magic underworld in search of their long lost father! Once again, the puzzles, graphics and voice acting are all top notch and exceed my growing expectations. I feel like the price is right at $11; the game really brings together all elements perfectly. It took me just shy of (4) hours to complete. My only complaint is that these games aren't being cranked out fast enough! It's about a year in-between each game which is understandable... but I want more.Worth the $11; Grab on sale for less than $7 if you can! Story really takes off in this one.

												This is a gem of an adventure game. I played the first chapter and enjoyed it enough to rebuy it here on steam along with fully supporting the release of chapter two. If you enjoy the genre in the slightest then get this. These devs deserve the support. Can't wait for the third chapter!Atmosphere - Monkey Island meets Grim Fandango in a dark, wet and jazzy neon lit world. Sound -  The voice acting is decent, but entertaining and the soundtrack is a moody masterpiece.Gameplay -  Familiar point and click mechanics with simple, but logical puzzles.Story -  Light, but original with enjoyable characters on par with those that inhabited the early Lucasarts adventures.

I'm glad to be a Linux gamer, because if I wasn't, I might accidentally ignore hidden gems like this one!The artwork, music, and voice acting are all top-notch. The puzzles are very logical and fun. No pixel hunting or weird poo poo you'll never be able to figure out without using a guide! What a great game!			"

												The Journey Down: Chapter 2 is a *huge leap* from Chapter 1.  If you have played the first and are nostalgic of classic games such as Monkey Island, I would recommend this for you.  I smiled, giggled, and quite enjoyed it a lot!  :)The soundtrack is relaxing and amazing. The characters are just as charismatic as in Chapter 1 and the dialogue / story-line have an even greater sense of humour.  Additionally, this game's VOICE actors are talented - which makes the game much more immersive.  They did an incredible job for you to relate to the characters even though they are quite simplistic visually; in a sense that their faces are all based on ""African"" or ""Caribbean"" wooden face masks but which were carefully chosen by design to portray their basic personality traits.Needless to say, graphically, it's well-done. A mix of simple and complex imagery. The cut-scenes are breathtaking.  The feel of the art-style is quite fitting with the entire story / mood.The puzzles increase in difficulty as the game progresses... I got stuck maybe 2-3 times for a while but it was never frustrating -  I persevered until I figured it out.  Very much satisfying! :)In summary:  Underrated humorous point & click adventure.  I recommend that you play Chapter 1 if interested, as there is a progression to the story (**even though I noticed that they made sure via the dialogues that you would not feel lost if you hadn't played Chapter 1, so maybe not necessary?**).  The length of the game was satisfying as well, considering it took me so long to figure out the last puzzle.  Ya' mon! :)I'm looking forward to Chapter 3!			"

												Ok, so... The Journey Down Chapter 2. Just like the first chapter this game is funny, well written, interesting to explore. Funny dialogues, a very peculiar visual style, The Jouney Down surely deserves a chance. Maybe a little too easy (I just got stuck on one puzzle, the last one) but it kinda helps the story to flow. A nice little game that will keep you interested for 3-4 hours, it's original, the voiceover is great, TJD2 is definitely worth a shot. Thumbs up.			"

Short version: 86%The second part of this Rastafari-themed adventure game miniseries is somewhat shorter than the first one, but makes up for it with a more engaging story, interesting locations, and complex puzzles.Long version:The Journey Down: Chapter Two took almost two years to reach the players, but it was worth it. The overall tone got a significant revamp, giving it an actual feel of adventure and thrills instead of being a puzzle game with a funny cast.Even though the characters still act the same way (which is a good point, since they made the first chapter so memorable), the plot is a lot thicker around them. You have to explore a new city where everything seems to be crooked and corrupted, and where the mystery of Kanandodo and his discovery run deeper than ever, making the story progress in territories you may have not even suspected……when said story actually progresses. Because the game’s difficulty has increased, despite being made for tablet players. There is less crazy adventure game logic involved, but you have to backtrack often, and a lot. And the last puzzle… even point ‘n’ click veterans may hit a brick wall there.Still, the game is quite short, shorter than the first chapter, with around 2-5 hours of play time. But the content is so strong that this drawback is barely recognisable.			"

												The second chapter happened to be as awesome as the first one.Not much to say about the gameplay. I guess, I'm just happy that the puzzles are pretty straightforward and there's no need to pull some unobvious shenanigans; just focus on the story and enjoy the game. What I really love about TJD2 is the setting. The evening, the rain, the bright lights of the city, – the whole noir atmosphere in addition to the smooth jazz soundtracks; it's just brilliant. It's all worth just pausing the gameplay and leaning back for a while, staring at the art and listening to the music, so good it is. Highly recommend for playing, but be careful, you may occasionally fing yourself willing to pour a glass of whiskey and smoke a cigar, even though you don't smoke or drink.			"

												The moment I saw this game appear on Steam front page, I grabbed The Journey Down Chapter 2. I was a big fan of the first chapter. Overall, I really liked the game and if you have played the first chapter and liked it, you should like this one too. If you haven't played the first chapter but like or are interested in old-school point and click games, I recommend buying Chapter 1.However I was rather disappointed with the production quality because it felt worse compared to the first chapter. If the developers happen to be reading this, please take this as constructive criticism: Few of the environments felt like they were taken straight out of the concept artist, meaning they felt like they were missing finishing touch. I found that 3D objects often didn't blend didn't blend well with the 3D objects.The resolution of the assets appeared pretty low, then again I am using 2560x1440 monitor but that doesn't excuse them from creating the high quality assets to begin with.Sound quality varied and some were straight out bad (not the voice acting quality but the equipment used were bad). Voice volumes with from one sentence to another sometimes varied which kind of ruins the atmosphere. The music however was good, pretty much what I expected considering Chapter 1.Puzzles were most of the time pretty easy, the only puzzle that gave me a headache was where you had to guess the right code for a certain door. I still don't understand completely how the green, yellow and red lights were supposed to work.Otherwise it was a great game and I'll be definitely buying Chapter 3 on day one.Also R.I.P. Simon D'souza. :(			"

												I can't say enough positive things about this game. It's even better than Chapter One, which, while solid, felt almost like a demo or introduction to the game world, without revealing too much of its history and lore. This chapter gets into the real meat of the story. As in the first chapter, the art design, music, characters, and puzzles are all excellent. The main character, Bwana, is hilarious, yet doesn't follow the long tradition of point-and-click (and parser-based) adventure games going back to goofballs like Roger Wilco and Larry Laffer of being an inept loser. Instead, he's more of a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to be enjoying himself no matter what he's doing.One of the really cool things about this game is that your character, in the course of solving puzzles to progress the game, actually does a lot of good and helps quite a few people improve their lots. It makes the game even more satisfying. I did get slightly stuck here and there on puzzles, but never to the point where I needed to look online for hints. Everything was quite intuitive, and I almost always felt inspired with an idea for how to solve problems. There are lots of clever ideas in the puzzles, and a few relatively straightforward but well designed logic puzzles as well. And you do get a ton of backstory and exposition about what the heck is going on. The game ends on a big cliffhanger, and I absolutely cannot wait for the next chapter. At the rate they're going, it should be amazing.TL;DR if you've ever enjoyed pont-and-clicks, buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

												I couldn't bring myself to enjoy the second installment. Music is well produced, and the presentation is alright. Graphics are alright, though animation is quite poor (the lower budget coming through).All of that is forgiveable, but, unfortunately, I never found myself caring much for the story itself. There were not really any attempts at humor either. So all that's left are the puzzle, which you will finish in 2-3 hours, without much challenge. Most puzzles seem to be locked behind an arbitrary event, forcing you to figure out the order of puzzles by trial and error.			"

												After escaping gangsters in Chapter One, Bwana, Kito and Lina arrived at their destination of Port Artue. Still searching for the Underland, Bwana and Kito are arrested and thrown in jail while Lina is taken as hostage by the police. What will happen to our heroes?I enjoyed that point-&-click adventure because of the atmosphere. There is clearly influenced by Afro-Caribbean (as the characters are inspired from African masks but the way they're talking and the music is more from the Caribbean). Bwana still retains his cool personnality while being perhaps in another world. And that, dear gamers, that what I ask also from an adventure game: characters with a grey personnality as they're reflecting what we are: imperfect. Bwana isn't stupid. Some of his remarks show someone aware of his surrounding, feeling down because of his father's disappearance. Kito, his ""street"" brother, is a genius when it comes to engineering, despite his cool attitude. Lyna, well-mannered, stays polite and provides information on what may happen in the background. She's never pressuring the boys, apart when they foiled her plan. Besides, the fact that the ambiance is also leading to a comedy game is also doing that.Here, the graphics are more ""modern"" as Port Artue seems to be more a city. The ambiance is now more jazzy, which isn't bad in itself. It's changing from the first game.Anyway, the whole game seemed to be set in a film noir though here, the police is clearly corrupt.The game is longer than the first chapter, which is a good point, though you need imagination to find sometimes a solution. Besides, the ending is quite different: after the foggy sad town, you're on a tropical island with sun everywhere.Anyway, I'm very impatient for Chapter Three and to discover what happened really, as some twists were present in this game (not about Lina, though, despite what Bwana may think).Don't hesitate anyway: The Journey Down is really a good series.

												A really good point-and-click game. The story is interesting, the artwork is amazing, with a unique African (""Afro-noir,"" according to the devs) vibe, and the music is absolutely beautiful. It's part two of three, with three upcoming probably next year. This one picks up right after the cliffhanger ending of the first part and ends with another one, but the story in between does a good job of filling in more backstory and plot without hitting you over the head with a ton of exposition and setting up a couple of twists that lead to the next part. The only real con I noticed were consistently inaccurate or misspelled captions. I expect at least one typo for any text-heavy game, but there are more in this one than I've seen in a number of amateur games. Some of the voice recordings are of a noticeably lower quality than the rest, but I only noticed that a few times. Overall, very much worth playing if you like this style of adventure game, even with the episodic nature of it.In this particular case, I would be absolutely okay with paying full price for the soundtrack as a separate purchase, because it is that good. Also, their original composer passed away last year and apparently there's an album of his music up for purchase., from which all the proceeds go to charity. I think it was a nice touch that they featured that as a very muted 'hey, if you like his music, you can get this, too' ad at the end of the behind-the-scenes extra that's unlocked once you finish the game.

												The Journey Down is a wonderfully afro-infused adventure, with Chapter Two giving it a great noir detective vibe reminiscent of the second chapter of Grim Fandango. The jazzy soundtrack of the late Simon D'Souza has been amazingly carried on by Jamie Salisbury and has been recorded with a full orchestra. The original voice cast is as colourful as before and is joined by newcomers dripping with character. The puzzles offer entertainment and light challenge while the story gives a simple yet endearing motivation throughout.			"

												A very satisfying game, delivering on the promises of the first chapter. Beautiful scenery, logical, not too convoluted puzzles, delightful characters, and even better music than the first game. Sky Goblin have even remedied one of my complaints about the first chapter, and made it so a double click on an exit will get you to the next screen immediately.This chapter is much longer than the first chapter, but I still played through it in one sitting (four hours). The game being so new, there are no walkthroughs on the net yet, but even though I was a wondering what to do at one point (I hadn't noticed that a new exit had opened up in an old location), I never got really stuck. Some professional reviewers on the net have called these games spiritual successors to  Grim Fandango, and the old Lucas Arts adventure games, some have even called them virtual copies. I can go along with the first, but never the second: The Journey Down has too much style and personality for that. It is a unique, charming, and fun game, well worth the price of admission.My only complaint is that now I have to wait God knows how long for the third chapter.			"

												The Journey Down is a really great adventure game - a classic point and click updated for 2016 with great graphics and music! This indie gem will be entertaining to anyone, but people who grew up playing games like Monkey Island will be in for an extra nostalgic treat, as you can clearly see the influence. They added a rastafarian twist to the classic point and click forumula that really pumped it up for me and made the characters very engaging. All in all I'd buy this game. For $10 it was a steal, and for anything less i'd feel guilty about robbing the devs. So if you see it and like the point and click genre, BUY IT.			"

												...So how long do we have to wait for chapter 3?I love the original character design in these games. The voice acting is stellar as always, the music and sound are great, and the puzzles are difficult enough to keep your interest without getting frustrating. The story really develops in this chapter and I got sucked in a lot more than I did with chapter 1. The dialogue does go on for a long time sometimes, but it's well written, so relax and enjoy it rather than trying to rush through.Overall, I recommend the game, though I definitely suggest you play chapter 1 first.

												I thoroughly enjoyed part 2 and imo it's even better than the first. The puzzles are improved (my biggest gripe with the first) the story is short, sharp and fantastic and overall I got a solid 3.5 to 4 hours out of it by doing everything and talking to everyone. Worth the asking price. One bugbear is that on my headset the audio was quiet on the left channel all game when the characters were talking, and there's one puzzle near the end that was a little pixel perfect and even though I had the thing where I needed it, it still wouldn't register. Overall though a great game.			"

												The second chapter from The Journey Down is a rather coherent and well designed title that brings Bwana, Kito and Lina ahead in the search for the Underland. Visually, the game might not be first class triple A title worthy, but it does still offer very likeable sights, and above all, it improves over the first chapter of the series. The overall amount of scenes and puzzles do not increase, and the game remains very linear, but all of this contributes to a laid back and relaxed atmosphere that is emphatized by the soundtrack used, which - once again - is one step above the one used in the first chapter (and truth to be said, that one was good already!). The characters are very well thought of, and despite being maybe a bit too close to the classic ""good"" or ""bad"" guys, they're very, very, precisely designed in every aspect, from their appeareance, to their voice acting, to the dialogues (the way they behave). More importantly, the 3 characters which appeared in the first chapter retain the same voice actor, and they benefit so much of it! Bwana still feels so funky, and you can't help but feel for him :) , same as for Kito, his friend. Other than Lina, all of the other characters are new but the voice over is very well executed with quite some personality (i've seen several triple A titles using far lower quality voice over job than the one you'll have the chance to listen in this game).Gameplay wise, it's still more or less the same from the previous chapter except for more depth: you happen to came across a tool not working or someone needing some object(s), and you'll have to end up finding or crafting it. It's very basic, it might require a bit more thinking at times, but not that much either. Everything is well laid out, well within your sight. and even the inventory doesn't ever get too full of items you don't need.Now, a big, important role is played by the music: i happened, more than once, to literally stop playing only to listen to the beatiful, relaxing, chilling music this game offers! It really is one of the few titles i can think of which has such a fitting and well done soundtrack which is contributing so much to the atmosphere. Well done! What else? The game only lasts a few hours, but i dare to say it lasts the right amount of time. Every aspect is well thought of, you might happen to need to backtrack sometimes but it won't be a issue, time-wise (Port Artue is a very small town, it seems).I don't usually complete a review with a vote, but if i had to i would rate this 8,7 out of 10 at the very least.

												This game has a nice, unique graphical style with likable characters and a good soundtrack.However there are a few key components of a point-and-click game where the game unfortunately falls short:1. Storyline:The story-line is very linear. A P&C game has to be linear to some degree by necessity, and I have no problem with this, but this is taken to the extreme here. Commonly you have some degree of choice in which order you want to accomplish certain tasks, e.g. some tasks that require completions of several puzzles could be done in your order of choice. In this game the path is set and it is pretty clear what is required as the next step at every moment decreasing the illusion of having an influence on the storyline...Also, it feels like there is a lot of the story that was lost on the way, like the release was somewhat rushed before the game was finished. E.g. there is a map that you find early in the game indicating many places that are not available in the game. The game design with the taxi makes me think there were bigger plans from start...2. Difficulty/challenge:I guess this is the most difficult aspect to get right with a P&C game. If puzzles are too hard you get stuck all the time, feel stupid, and the gameplay is not very enjoyable. If too easy, the game feels less meaningful and you do not get the nice feeling of accomplishment. This game was on the ""too easy"" part of the scale. Puzzles were very easy and combined with the linerar storyline, there was no point in the game where I had to stop and think. On the plus-side, although not very challenging, puzzles were generally logical and did not rely on pixel hunting...3. Length:Perhaps as a product of the two points above, the game felt very short. Being decently affordable and presented as an episode of a game rather tha a full game, perhaps this is to be expected. I guess that the unfinished feeling of lost intrigue/parts of the game, emphasize this feeling even more though...Verdict:Despite its shortcomings, the game has a certain charm to it and it was generally enjoyable. I will likely pick up part 3 when available. Although there are many other P&C games I would recommend before this one, there are also many that are worse...			"

												I'll review chapter 1 & 2 together, as if they were one single game since their mechanics are exactly the same and the chapter two continues the story from the point where the first chapter ends. Also their play times are very short individually. Even though i like to explore every detail in such games, it took me about 7.5 hours in total to complete both chapters.TL;DR: Get it if you like pointing, clicking, humor, a bit noir style, a bit mystery, the good old jazz and Bob Marley. :)ReviewThe Journey Down is a very nice point & click style adventure game with humor that i would recommend to anybody who likes the genre. If you decide to buy, get the both chapters together. The game doesn't have tedious parts like some members of this genre does. You don't have to watch your character walk for ages, it skips to the place if you double click.StoryThe story is not the most amazing one i've seen in a point & click style game but it's decent enough. It has some mystery elements and can make you curious at some points. In short, not amazing but good enough to keep you playing.PuzzlesMost of the time the puzzles are pretty easy. You usually know what you need to do when you first see an item ,if not, you can figure out quickly. The game is rather relaxing than pushing you hard to solve a puzzle.CharactersThe characters are cool and their accents are really fun. Their heads are inspired by african tribal masks. You play as a young guy named Bwana. There are two other main characters named Kito and Lina. I liked all of the characters in the game especially our guy Bwana.Art and AtmosphereThe art design is very charming. The game has a nice carribean and also noir atmosphere. The hand drawn places look wonderful. SoundtracksOne of the best things about the game ,besides its art design, is it's soundtracks. It includes some reggae and jazz tunes and the soundtracks become more jazzy in second chapter. The music fits well with the atmosphere of the game.ProsCharming atmosphereLikeable charactersBeautiful art designAwesome soundtracksGood enough storyFun accentsCharacter animations are not tediousGives you access to some nice behind the scene content when you finish a chapterConsShort play timePlaces are somehow limited, not many different placesPuzzles are too easy sometimes, they don't require much thinkingSometimes it feels like things are happening faster and easier than it should (or is it just me?)

												What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a definite improvement over the first chapter that I already enjoyed plenty. The double click fast travel is a welcome addition, the puzzles flow somewhat smoother while still being easy (and I still don't mind) and the art and music is as lovely as ever. What else is there to say? It's as it should be, being a total improvement in every way. Bring on the third and final chapter!			"

												It's got a really great art style and a simple one button interface. The soundtrack is great too, mixture of Jazz and big band stuff which goes well with the setting. You could play this game without havng played the first chapter, (a character will recap the story for you if you promt him to) but the first one is just as good, although a lttle shorter. If you know you like point and click games, then buy it.			"

												I got this game (along with the first chapter) in a game bundle, and I was expecting nothing when I first lauched it. And what a good surprise it was. This game is one of the bests point&click adventures of the decade. It is nothing of the trending ""telltale"" style games where all is about ""choices"" and nothing about enigmas. The journey down is a classic linear drill, featuring puzzles that are neither too simple nor too ""alternative logic"" kind of. The graphics are pretty good, and the music is absolutely delicious. The whole thing will remind you Grim Fandango. The game is also quite funny.The first part came out seven years ago, the conclusion is coming this summer and you should get totally hyped.			"

												One of the coolest Adventures of recent times. The voice acting is marvelous and you can really see all the love that went into the design of the game and the painting of the backgrounds and the animation of the characters. Also of note are the beautifully rendered fim sequences, snippets of which can be seen in the trailers.The music is again marvelous and the more big bandish feeling than the first installment really enhances the atmosphere. The game took me about 5 hours in total to finish but it were fun hours none the less - and this is what matters. The puzzels are not super complicated but fun with cool jokes strewn in between. The story has gotten even better than the first part. I liked the really moving behind the scenes part that you unlock after finishing the game.I can definately recommend this game to everyone who loves adventure games, even at full price (which is not that high to boot with).The 1.5 years until I could play this game were a long time, but seeing how it turned out I must say that they were very well spent by the team. I am looking forward to the next installment and, although I would like it best to be available right now, I must say: take your time so that I can again play such a marvelous game in the near future. Thanks SkyGoblin!			"

												If you are a fan of Grim Fandango, this is a LOT better than Broken Age (and I did enjoy broken age).Originally seeing the trailers for chapter 1 I thought ""this looks a bit like grim fandango, but a little rough around the edges"" so I wasn't convinced. Since Chapter 2 came out and the first one was on sale I bought it and it is worth it. The storytelling is great, shot-not-tell, and the atmosphere smacks of Fadango, but is certainly a unique tale of its own. Each character has a distinct personality. Imagine if there was only one jazz album ever, anyone who tried to emulate it could be accused of ""copying,"" but suffice to say this is expanding the genre in a fun way and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THIS.Soundtrack is also top tier, contributes a great deal of the atmosphere.Overall the game is pretty simple, you don't get stuck, but if broken age is 1/10 difficulty and the original discworld is 9/10, then this is about 3/10 in terms of difficulty, but really it is more about the dialouge and atmosphere.If you are looking for a story-driven adventure game and questioning whether this is worth it: It is.

												Alright this was another amazing game it's not too long but nowhere near as short as chapter one and was actually quite fun. The puzzles were better this time around and weren't any overly easy puzzles like in the first chapter and there are many memorible charecters in this one Ride Reynolds immediately comes to mind. The overall story is pretty good by itself but there are a few plot points that you'd need to play chapter 1 to get. This game got me so pumped for chapter 3 coming out soon and I will definately be playing that all in all 8/10.			"

												The second, even more fabulous part of The Journey Down.Are you into Noir? Have you played the first game? Grab this one for sure.If you haven't played the first one, go ahead and try it, read my review on that and find out if it's to your liking or not. I wouldn't say that everyone will like it, some will hate it for some obscure reason (maybe simply for it not being Grim Fandango).It has all that noir fan would want: misty, dripping wet streets, shaded lighting, the whole backwater town atmosphere, characters... Even a typical crooked cop and a <spoiler here>. It is still a very good adventure game without too much obscure connections to be made, and with a slight tint of humor. A few traditional puzzles (nothing original here) also made their way into the game without disrupting much of the process or making you rack your brains too much.And I still rank this better than Deponias.

Puzzles are fun and actually make sense, which is a rare thing in most Point&Click games I've played so far, none of that ""get a rubber duck to shave a poodle in order to power the generator!"". They just feel right, and game drops just enough hints so you know what to do, but its not ""in your face"" about it, Voice acting is great (why so many accents tho?) and the plot, locations, atmosphere... I had so much fun with it.As for the Linux version: Its a Point & Click game, hard to screw up, so no surprise here, works great.			"

												The Journey Down: Chapter Two continues the story from part one.In part one we didn't really get much of a story or what was going on - it was basically just to set up the initial plot and give you a feel for the world and characters.In part two we get a lot more story and a much better idea of what is going on.Again, there is a lot of charm to the world and environment. The game has a real noir/jazz French feel combined with carribean influences.The puzzles are fairly simple again - similar to the first game in difficulty. I wouldn't say any of the puzzles are too difficult.Overall I was very happy with this title and I am looking forward to part three! Great work here. Highly recommended for point and click fans - or if you are new to the genre this is a great series to start with.The Journey Down: Chapter Two takes about 3-4 hours to complete.			"

The graphics are wonderful, the story excellent, the characters funny and interesting. And, oh, that completely AWESOME soundtrack! It's hard to believe this is an indie adventure, there are AAA titles that never come close to this level of polish and dedication to detail. Hell, I even love the voice acting. If you're familiar with adventure games, you know this is something that's very hard to get right. If you loved Lucasarts and Sierra adventures, you owe it to yourself to play this amazing game.

												In short: This game is absolutely awesome. Truely, one of the, if not the best adventure series I ever played, in one line with masterpieces such as Monkey Islands, Grim Fandango, Simon and Sam&Max ... maybe even better than those.Ultra funny, great soundtrack, awesome voices, marvelous graphics and last but also very important a thrilling story. I'm absolutely stunned.The puzzels are very logical, no stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t combinations, maybe sometimes even a little bit to obvious, could be a little trickier sometimes. And just as it ought to be there are plenty of hidden hints in the dialogs. Perfect!The story is the perfect combination of thrilling adventures with enough hilarious dialogs to ease up the excitement so it never gets too tense. Bwana, is cool with any situation.The dialogs are brilliant and the voices of the characters are a true pleasure to listen to, especially of course Bwana and Kito.The whole adventure is supported by an awesome chilling and thrilling soundtrack.All together a true masterpiece. My new favourite adventure.The first part was a little bit short but honestly, time flys when playing such a great adventure.

												This is the second chapter of the strange grim fandango-like game. Basically this is the world where european cities and culture are taken over by african people and motiffs and everyone is dead. You control a silly guybrush like character to try and find your father who is lost in limbo. Personally I found the game really fun but the last puzzle was way too hard. Looking forward to Ch3			"

The Journey Down: Chapter Two picks up exactly where the first installment left off, and it expects you to have fully played it as it wastes no time with lengthy re-introductions, save for a quick recap conversation with your trusted friend Kito.For its intermediate chapter, the series traded its positively laid-back vibe for a resolutely noir ambiance. This is in part due to the nature of Port Artue, the game's main location, set in the confines of a dark mist. Consequently, pitch black darkness and haze envelops most scenes' skylines instead of the warm hues of dusk, city lights and waterfront of the first game.The visuals look great as a general rule, though some of the art panels are manifestly sketchier. It is never too distracting but it feels lightly inconsistent with the other fully realized backgrounds. Many scenes feel monochromatic, whereas the first game was resolutely more lively. The music is also somewhat less festive but just as effective most of the time.Regardless of the change in tone, the game hasn't really lost much of its charm. Its characters and situations are truly enjoyable. The first half of the game features less of the cinematic moments and animated transitions. Whereas Chapter One felt more immediate, Chapter Two takes some time to build up into a genuinely fun experience. It picks up tremendous momentum about halfway through, and ultimately reaches the simple greatness of its shorter debut episode.Bwana remains one of the most original and charismatic characters I've played in point-and-click adventure games. While a lot of his success resides on pure luck, he's delightedly never portrayed as an idiot or incompetent. Puzzles are generally fairly obvious and pleasant to solve, focusing more on the story than on challenging enigmas.The story unmistakably sets the stage for the third and final chapter but is still satisfyingly conclusive on its own. Chapter Two is nearly twice as long as Chapter One. If you have any interest in this game, and you should, you owe it to yourself to start with the first episode, for which I also wrote a short but glowing review.Chapter Three can't come soon enough!

Its a good length for the price too and its definetly a must buy for any lovers of the old Lucasarts point and click titles.Note: It was a bit longer than 2 hours.

												A definite improvement over Chapter 1, which was just solid. Chapter 2 elevates Journey Down to the higher quality adventure games that have been keep coming out in recent years. This time around the game is up to its neck in noir and the atmosphere is really good. The writing doesn't rival the greats but the cast is likable and it has a fun story. The puzzles are logical though some are a tad bit trial and errory but they're overall good. I never had to consult a guide which is a plus for me. Hopefully Chapter 3 really ends on a high note because the game's been improving.			"

The game follows the same formula as the first and relies on classic point-n-click gameplay. Much like Chapter One, the game's strengths lie in its witty characters,  clever puzzles and funky soundtrack. The game introduces new locations, characters and takes roughly twice as long to complete than the original. Another fantastic installment in the trilogy,			"

												Yess... This game is just plain beautiful. It's the tiki bar of adventure games.It manages to be nostalgic without blatant references, to be zany without being stupid or infuriating, and generally manages to avoid most of the pitfalls of its genre. Most of the time the puzzles flow effortlessly, and you only rarely experience the sort of dissonance between story and puzzles that came to be the killing flaw of the adventure genre.Overall, this is one of the big new titles, right up next to neo-classics like Wadjet Eye's Resonance, Primordia and Blackwell, or the Telltales Monkey Island revival series. I'm not mentioning Daedalic, because Daedalic should pay these guys to give them lessons in game design and story writing.Big, big A+. I'm sure it's possible to do better than this, but these days nobody has actually done better. Love it.			"

As before, the puzzles make you think but they're always solvable; the interface is easy to understand; and you can never screw up so badly that you can't complete the game, No reflexes necessary in this point-and-click, perfect for a klutz like me.  The music and graphics are fun and refreshing.  I've only encountered technical difficulties in one spot and they were minor, easily fixed by moving out of the scene and back in.			"

It is VASTLY superior to the first game in every way and there were NO puzzles I wasnt able to muddle through and solve via logic... unlike the the one specific ingredient thing from the first game. I would HIGHLY recommend this rather chill rastanoirian adventure... PLay the first game to get ready for this EXCEPTIONAL sequel though.

While I thought the first game was a fantastic appetizer, this was a great follow-up with a meatier, more satisfying second course. The music was wonderful, the dialogue and acting are all great and enjoyable throughout. Now the worst part is having to wait for chapter three! I'm almost glad I didn't find out about these until now because the wait would've been that much harder if I had been there since day 1.Absolutely fantastic and should not be missed if you enjoy point and click adventure games. Frankly, this fits right in there with the greats of the genre. 9/10!			"

												In the second chapter of The Journey Down you will once again be playing the part of Bwana, sorry to spoil it for those who haven't played the first chapter, but the game picks up with the plane crash. You will get to spend the vast majority of this chapter in Port Artue, a city below the previous city that you played the first chapter in. The biggest difference between this chapter and the previous, though, is the fact that the pace has picked up. There's definitely some urgency, and some large obstacles standing in your way. Remember you are still trying to get to the final destination, but there's going to be people who will do anything to stop you.Graphically you are still looking at the same type and feel as the first chapter. I did like the locations of the game a bit more than the first chapter. You are in a city where it is perpetually night, but there's definitely different levels of feel and look to this chapter. You are going to see the Club Temba, you are going to see a light house, back alleys, some places you don't even want to be in, but you are going to be in. I felt like this game just looked crisper than the first. I know that sounds weird seeing as this is the same engine that powered the first, but it looked like there was more flexing of the muscles in the engine this time around.Once again the voice acting seemed to fit the tribal masks that were put to the faces of the characters that you are going to interact with. There's also going to be a bigger cast of characters to interact with, and impressively enough all of them will be voiced. What can I say there's just something about hearing voices put to faces and characters.The controls once again are going to be point and click. Always be on the look out for an object that just stands out, chances are you are going to need to use it, or take it in order to get through this game.Alright, so here we are, chapter 2. I really wish I could write it without doing spoilers, but there's just some that are just going to have to be said. First off you are in Port Artue. A city in that lives in a permanent night time, but seems to sparkle all the more for it. You are going to find yourself immediately on a boat that is lost at sea. Now I know its not really hard to figure out that you make it into port, but there you have it. You will then have an immediate obstacle put in your path and you are going to find that your crew of characters from the first chapter are going to be torn apart, and it is through the majority of this chapter that you are going to be trying to get them back together. There's definitely another round of puzzles, and utilization of objects in order to reach your goal. I'm going to be honest, there's going to be some head scratching at a couple of points, but if you trust in your inventory, and you are paying attention to the objects you can pick up, you should always have some sort of solution at hand. This was definitely a stronger chapter than the first, and it definitely shows itself as giving you a hell of a lot of story, and action packed into over 3 hours of game play. Now I know that this seems like a small number for some, but you have to realize that this is a chapter, and that, in my opinion, is a good amount to play with in a chapter. Now that being said, you are definitely going to need to play the first chapter to figure out all the characters, and story, but this is definitely a chapter you don't want to miss out on. So with that I have to give this game a 9.3 out of 10.			"

So with that I have to give this game a 9.3 out of 10.			"

												After being enthralled with the first chapter of The Journey Down, it really is a nice follow up. The atmosphere is amazing in the game, as well as the soundtrack. All in all, buy this game to support the Devs and follow up with a nice purchase of Chapter 3 which I am eagerly awaiting.			"

More characters, more plot, more areas, more puzzles, and not to mention more awesome music and art. I can't wait for the third, and sadly final, chapter to come out.			"

It's a 10/10 in my book, great job.Cant wait for the 3rd chapter.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable Pont and click adventrues I have play in a long while. It will take you less than 3 hours on your first playthough and yet it does not feels short or incomplete, even while being an episode of a larger adventure. While the Chapter One is full of those irrational game-logic puzzleseverything in Chapter Two feel cohesive. This is a Highy recommended title for anyone playing a PnC for the first time.Finally, th emusic nd afro-noir architecture this game presents is something you simply won't found ANYWHERE else.♥♥♥♥♥/5			"

												A definite improvement over Chapter 1, which was just solid. Chapter 2 elevates Journey Down to the higher quality adventure games that have been keep coming out in recent years. This time around the game is up to its neck in noir and the atmosphere is really good. The writing doesn't rival the greats but the cast is likable and it has a fun story. The puzzles are logical though some are a tad bit trial and errory but they're overall good. I never had to consult a guide which is a plus for me. Hopefully Chapter 3 really ends on a high note because the game's been improving.			"

												I really liked the first chapter of TJD but the second chapter was much better.  Excellent graphics, wonderful music, amusing dialogue, great voice acting.  The story was interesting and the puzzles were fairly simple, but satisfying, allowing the story to move along smoothly.  But that last puzzle - all I can say is I'm glad I found a walkthrough or I never would have solved it.  I am very much looking forward to chapter three.			"

												A great adventure all around The graphics are gorgeous (if a little janky in places, but come on , it is a small studio) and the story really takes off in this part. The characters are really nicely written, even smaller roles are very nicely realized and relatable. The puzzles are somewhat on the easy side, but for once that did not bother me. Just nice smooth sailing throughout, without actually feeling under-challenged. It helps that the results of solving a puzzle are often quite funny.The voicework is also very good, with a lot of charming accents, that do not feel stereotypical in their rasta vibe because of the obvious love for it.But what really stands out to me is the awesome soundtrack. The Jazz tunes by Simon d'Souza are really something special and complement the scenes perfectly.  When I saw that he had died while the game was in development (it is mentioned in the credits and behind the scenes material) I was very saddened. If you like adventure games, I wholeheartedly recommend this.			"

The art and style are original and fantastic, the soundtrack is great, and environment is calm and inviting. If I had to put down a negative, it would be a lack of personality to a few of the side characters. The main protagonist stands out as an individual on his own, though.The game gives you a cultural feel developed from viewing and listening to the environment. I reccomend this game to anyone looking for something calmer, but challenging.			"

The second chapter is considerably longer than the second, however they are both very well down and a lot of fun. The voice acting really makes the game, the characters are so interesting, and you really have to pay attention to the plot because it helps a lot.The jazzy music certainly helped me keep my cool when in challenging spots. Sometimes overthinking will cause you to miss, what you think after, really obvious things. Though the challengs are all apart of the charm.			"

												Steam's time played counter stands at 3 hours for this game for me, 3 hours something likely, and despite that, I don't mind. I don't mind at all. Chapter Two of The Journey Down series is an experience pretty much any point and click fan should play through. It pulls of a pleasant balance of noir and infectious positivity, optimism, backed with undeniable visual stylishness and a superb soundtrack that couldn't be more fitting than it is. Now, I might not like all the aspects of the graphics - something about the main character just doesn't sit with me for example - and he's not the only one, but, face it, pulling off a genuinely atmospheric blend of jazzy noir with African tribal art and a mild dash of rasta culture, perhaps, is worthy of respect. The chapter functions well on its own - my memories of the first chapter are beyond fuzzy, but the game does well to explain the background and add and expand the, again, quite original and interesting lore. It does get silly, beyond silly at times, but that grates far less than it does in some other games. The cast of characters is more or less interesting, tropes or not too, some of them memorable, with some obvious hat-tipping going on around. The game is, as can be seen from my playing time, short, and I'll add easy. I AM a seasoned p&c player, but I've played through most of it @ 4AM with half my brain working likely, and the rest, including the final puzzle(s) did not pose much of a problem. You won't or at least shouldn't be wandering around aimlessly, you can't make a mistake really, everything is more or less dead obvious if you listen/read and remember what's there. Only one puzzle, with a car, had me wandering around pixelhunting (not needed in the game really) until I used an item that's really not THAT obvious or hinted at. But hey, as the old p&c adage goes... ""when stuck, use everything on everything"", right? Eh. Another plus is that, despite it being short, it doesn't feel as short as it is. All in all, a sequel superior to the original that left me wanting more. Will definitely get the third chapter once it's out. Good job!			"

												Point and click adventure game with fun characters, good music, good looking locations, and puzzles that don't drive you too nuts trying to solve them.The first game had an issue where you might notice an item for a later puzzle, but as you had no need for it at the time, you wouldn't pick it up (which was amusing banter until you needed it) and in some cases it was hidden inside another item, so good luck remembering about it if you didn't play it all in a single session and even if you did. This game solves that, which makes it much easier to complete a puzzle cause you probably have what you need rather than knowing what you need and not knowing where to get it.The music fits the flavor of the areas it plays in, the areas are varied, while still making sense together, and I really enjoyed how the characters played off each other.

												Chapter Two of the Journey Down was very satisfying after completing Chapter One. The plot develops well, the music and artwork is even more incredible, and you get introduced to many new people and places. There were a couple of times where I acquired items or seemed to have a task to obtain an item without clearly knowing the reason for it. This isn't uncommon in PAC games and perhaps it's because I talked to people out of order, but I found this detracted a bit from the story. The other thing I found was that Bwana's voice was consistently quieter than everyone else's, and I had to adjust my volume a bit to avoid other characters sounding like they were shouting - just a sound-mixing issue.Looking forward to Chapter 3!

												Short but longer than the first chapter. Puzzles are still pretty easy. I still like the art. Voice acting is slightly better on most new characters, but some performances are pretty bad. Music, once again, is fantastic, very good job. Story is better than in the first part, though I must say im still not super excited by it. The world is more interesting in my opinion though, and so are Kito and Bwana.So, I dont know about paying 11 €/$ for it. On sale, however, its worth buying if you are interested in those sorts of games. I was still disappointed on how the game itself was (easiness), but the interesting world, nice art, and fantastic music gives it charm that makes me want to play the third one, whenever that comes.

												I have been playing P&C adventure games ever since Broken sword first came out on Ps1 (probably even before that actually!) and can honestly say I really enjoyed playing both chapters of this, I was sceptical at first but got ch 1 for about 50p and had to buy this one to see what happens. Great musicGreat animationGood storyPuzzles are what you'd expect from this type of game. All in all a very enjoyable game to play. My only problem is that unless it's on a decent sale, it's far to short to warrant paying £8.00 for. It took me about 3 hours or so to finish (the rest of the time it was just running in the background whilst i did other stuff).If you can get it for under £5 I highly recommend playing this game.

												One of the best point and clicks since Secret of Monkey Island... and from a point and click fan that's saying something. Love the afro-noir theme and music. The 3D graphics don't detract from the authentically illustrated backgrounds. Can't wait for TJD3! Yeah maan!RIP Simon D'Souza who provided the emotive soundtrack			"

												This is a very nice chillaxed game not so difficult you get fed up with it and drop it, however I thought for £7.99 for chapter 2 was a bit pricey as it wasn`t very long and was over with quite quickly. So we have one more part which is fine I just hope the price doesn`t keep going up as this game is starting to mount up.Price issues aside it is a very pleasant and funny game and I would recommend it to any point and click gamer.

												Continue the journey down and come across pirates, conspiracy, and intrigue. This chapter is a bit longer than the first, features slightly more challenging puzzles, but without being too difficult. This series is great; easily one of the best point-and-click adventures from the last ten years. Highly recommended.			"

												Thoroughly enjoyed The Journey Down: Chapter Two. Obviously the gamie is mainly aimed at people who've played Chapter One first. That's not too big a problem because Chapter One is fun and awesome so go play it! There is a very brief re-cap at the start of the game should you want to either skip Chapter One or if it's been a while since you played it.I played the game on Linux Mint 17.3 and it worked flawlessly so well done on the developers for that. I'm proud to say that this is one of the few point and click adventure games I've completed in my life without ANY reference to a walkthrough. I don't think this is because the game is too easy, I think it's because the game is very well designed without any ""Put the octupus in the toilet to get the gold belt"" puzzles. It does help that the game isn't too sprawling so you're not wandering around aimlessly trying to find what you need/where to go. The music in the game is outstanding and really helps create a fantastic atmosphere and the character designs are just great. The designers have crafted a particular style and it really works for them. I've even snapped a few screenshots to use as a desktop background for a while. The voice acting and script is top-notch too. I want to continue playing the series because I want to spend more time with these characters and in their world. Now I just need to wait for Chapter 3. I'm very much looking forward to it.			"

												Loved the first part, and enjoyed this one as well. The humorous spirit of the first instalment is still there, and the music is excellent once again.The issues I had with the first part are still there though, too. I know it's a point-and-click adventure, but I still feel there was too much traveling from one side of the map to the other. I also experienced some audio issues, like skipping, during the cutscenes.			"

												Top-notch art and music, but longer and more satisfying gameplay than the first episode. The voice acting is significantly improved over the first episode too.			"

												First off, this game is much longer than the first chapter which is nice. I love the soundtrack! It really helps brings the game to life. The visuals feel better than the first chapter as well. There's often more detail and vibrant color choices than the first chapter. I also liked that some items are used more than once. It felt less routine and mindless, like I never knew if I'd need to use an item that I had already used but in a different way. An overall solid sequel, definitely enjoyed the game!I'm cheap, so I don't know if I would pay full price for the game, but it was worth every bit that I spent on it via Indie Humble Bundle.			"

												The second chapter of The Journey Down is a bit longer, a bit more complex and quite a bit more interesting than the first one.Recommended for point-and-click adventure lovers.			"

												A decent point-and-click adventure. Puzzle aren't too hard, but at least none of them have ridiculous obtuse solutions. I find the main character obnoxious, but the setting, fantastic art and swinging soundtrack make up for his grating stupidity.			"

												Chapter Two is pretty well done. The puzzles are done really well (better than Chapter One, imo), relying on logically drawn conclusions, without the item-management-guesswork you see so often in bad adventure games. It's a bit short, but if you liked chapter one, this one won't let you down.			"
