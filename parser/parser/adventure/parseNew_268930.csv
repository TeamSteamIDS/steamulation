								I cannot begin to quantify all the reasons this game appeals to me. That being said, here are a few things I really enjoy:It's obvious to me that the people behind this game, have put their heart and souls into it.It's single character  (which is a huge + in my book), First-person, 3D.The world is persistant. This means if you find a cool location, you can tell others where it is. They'll be able to find, see and experience it themselves.It is  turn-based (huge + for those like me that suffer from tendonitis (carpal tunnel syndrome)). The world is infinite -- really!  No caps on level, and no 'end of the world' to fall off of or bump into.It has permadeath - only way I play.Very active developer, updates are released frequently, along with new features.There are certainly more I have not listed here.I highly recommend giving it a try "

								NEW UPDATE: This game has not been updated for 1 year and 5 months.  Anyone who complains is now getting banned.I am rating this purely based on peoples intentions when buying an early-access game.This game received one update this year, and will not receive anymore updates till release (estimated end of 2015)This game has a private beta going on, and if you purchase this game, doesn't mean you will have access to it.In other words if you buy the game now all you're getting is a much earlier incomplete version of the game, while other people are actively getting new updates while you have to wait till release.The purpose of this review is to make you highly aware of what you're purchasing, and I highly recommend you play the demo, the only difference is that you can save the game.  The demo is exactly what you're going to be playing until release date, and it's up to you to decide if you should wait or not.UPDATE: it has been 12 months, soon to be 13 months since the last update.

								Having been a long-time follower of Malevolence and one of the first backers on Kickstarter, I am very excited to finally see this game take it's place on Steam.Malevolence is a blend of old-school RPG-style difficulty blended with modern systems; for example the various online elements. While you will never see another person in the game with you, if you are online while playing the game you will be able to interact with other players in a number of ways, for example the permadeath ladder where you can compete against other permadeath players, the claiming system where each major part of the world (Such as cities, dungeons and so on) can be claimed, and upon other players visiting that spot, they will see that you were there first.Some online functionality is even a bit more secretive and should be discovered in-game.The combat is turn based and gives the player the option of using melee, bows or spells, or mixing them to make a more balanced character.The equipment is procedurally generated, not just the looks of weapons but also effects and values of armor, weapons and spells.Aside from that there is an array of quest types (The quest system is still being expanded upon), special epic loot for those that brave the deepest of dungeons and take on the dungeon boss, various guilds to join and much else.

								I've been playing Malevolence since the Kickstarter release and loving every minute ofit. I'm a great fan of RPG's and roguelikes and Malevolence definately scratches bothitches. I also love when games are unpredictable and you don't know what to expect oneach playthrough.The game is very old school with some innovative modern touches, the world allthe players play in is truly infinte with each player adventuring in the same versionof the world but discovering areas other players haven't been to yet. When playersdiscover new areas with online functionality it's possible to claim locations so if other players adventure to the same place it will say who claimed the location. Other online functions are planned and the game has a great community sharing gameplay experiences and finds.All the loot, quests, dungeons and the world are procedurally generated but the dungeons and world are the same for everyone once an area as been discovered so if players find really cool/difficult dungeons they can share the coordinates and challenge others to clear the dungeon.Travel in such a vast world is by Griffon and once players have enough gold they can leave the starting area and explore freely going to places far away that have not been discovered by anyone else.Something else I love about the game is the emergent nature, things just seem to happen to throw spanners in the works and problem solving is often required to complete a quest or dungeon.The best way to play is permadeath with the gamma turned to zero so the dungeons are truly very dark and torches are essential. With the lights down low exploring can be very intense and I find myself getting drawn into the game. Permadeath also means your name is entered onto the leaderboard so others can see how your adventures are going.Finally I have to mention the dev team who are the icing on an already delicious cake, updates come frequently and the forums are a hotbed of ideas and player posted challenges which will only grow as the games audience widens. I've seen the game progress from a basic dungeon crawl to something very special indeed and if you value fantastic gameplay and love retro rpg graphics and enjoyed the golden age of RPG gaming then perhaps Malevolence is for you.I certainly recommend it and wish it all the luck in the world as it goes live on Steam.

Early Access Review
								I waited a long time to purchase this game, and finally bought it when I saw the magic and boss systems announced as coming soon. I want to make it very clear I have played only enough to make sure that it worked on my old computer. That was in the first half of last year.I waited to start a playthrough of the game until the update adding those major systems was released, as in my estimation the procedural bosses and magic system were a huge part of this procedural game. I have not started a playthrough yet, as these features have not been released to Steam's early access players yet and are only available to certain community individuals. (I am unclear as to which individuals were granted access; it is my understanding that there is a separate community elsewhere, started earlier, that has some sort of EARLY early access).Communication with the Steam community is filtered through a small group of elite testers / community members that are also the only ones with access to the current beta. I purchased the game with the understanding that I'd have early access to the content that is published as being worked on, but instead it is only available for private testing. Please do not mistake the large number of news posts listed as being updates that have been made to the version on Steam.According to the folks that are in communication with the developer, as soon as those with access to the beta have finished testing it, we'll have access to the stuff they've already tested. I have no reason to doubt this.I can not recommend this game as an early access purchase because it is not clear to purchasers that content added to the beta will not be made available to all early access purchasers. Based on Steam's ""Yes / No"" recommendation system, I must mark it as a ""No."" I firmly believe this game will be worth purchasing in its final version, but I do not recommend purchasing this as an early access title, due to the limited beta access given with purchase.

								Ok, not gonna hide the fact that im IN the game(which i paid for on kickstarter), nor will i hide that i was made a tester.  I am NOT a roguelike fan at all. In fact, i hate permadeath. I play this game on high resolution, and gamma high to see whats coming at me. ive ragequit this game numerous times........that means A ♥♥♥♥ING LOT. It can be hard, it can be easy. BUT, its ALWAYS addicting. even as a tester. I find myself playing the new tomb raider, borderlands, far cry 39(GOD LOVE THAT GAME) but i always come back to malevolence in my spare time. *(and i pay for and love ESO but still play this more)why you ask?   risk and reward, plus sometimes i just tire of rt games.  and yes, the world is infinite, FOR REAL.  how you ask? ♥♥♥♥ if i know, im not a programmer. I do know however, that over the almost 2 years that ive backed this game, ive seen it evolve and loved coming back to it. Pretty much the only game ive been a part of and keep playing. (btw i also reviewed rift for a professional game site and was involved in alpha of bioware the old republic, not to be a name dropper lol)   cant say that for other ones.  (looking at you SoTA_) So overall, i love this game.  Turn based games with this much heart and effort are impossible to come  by.   TAKE MY MONEY.			"

								EDIT: Please don't mark this review unhelpful just because you like the game. If you have a valid argument against what I say here, leave it in the comments. When you blindly mark reviews down it discredits reviews that would have otherwised helped somebody. There was a TON of potential in this game, but the creator's vision is flawed. I'm walking through a town and I can't even see the wall at the end of an alleyway because the render distance is so small. They've said it needs to be that way in order to do this and that, but it really just ruins the immersion. They sacrificed many potential gameplay options in order to pay ""homage to the 90s era FPRPGs.""     Older RPGs are great. They have depth and variety, unlike the current games that pander to the lowest common denominator. The creators should have taken these great old things(which they did), and make a game with a current engine that could also support enhanced gameplay.      Long story short, there have been improvements and detriments to gaming, and I thought this game was going to take the great parts of both eras and make a game as deep as they used to be while improving by way of using modern technology.  btw- Most of the things they say they are missing because the game is ""a homage,"" are actually missing because their engine(which runs poorly because they chose a larger world over improved gameplay) can't handle it. Or because they simply won't put in the time to implement them(and keep in mind this game got like 500+% of the funding they originally asked for, so that is an unacceptable excuse).     I wanted to like this very badly, but I just can't. If you want to play a game that plays and feels like it's from decades ago, get an actual one from decades ago(legitamate advice, those games are great). This (sometimes even intentionally)fails to improve on those ones, so there is no point in spending your money on it. This could have been great, had they put more effort into mixing in some modern technology and ideas.			"

								I read a description of the game and instantly loved the idea, it sounded like the game I always wanted to play.  After reading up a bit more and viewing a few posts on the official forums, the developer's heart seemed to really be into it.  So, knowing that it was in EA, I bit the bullet and dove in hoping for the best.In it's current state, the game is very, very bare-bones and every aspect of it is an ugly mess to put it bluntly.  Now, it's possible the graphics and art could grow on me with time, I'm very forgiving in this regard and I prefer a minimalist approach over a stellar budget with all flash, no substance.  The problem is, I don't see much substance here yet.  There are only a handful of enemies to fight, and fighting consists of clicking until either the enemy dies, or you die.  Sure, there are supposedly a variety of spells, but playing the permadeath mode, I only ever acquired the beginning heal spell before I got bored with the paltry content.  Stats are all very simplistic and it seems like there might not be much room to grow, but I'm hoping it's possible.There are some cool ideas here like having an infinite world to explore, claiming new sites that other players can find and explore, but of the dozen or so different dungeons I've seen, they're nothing special at all and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  Very little variety, but hopefully more will be added in the future.I normally wouldn't review a game in this state, but at the glacial pace it's being developed, I find it very hard to believe this game will ever deliver what it promises.  It's my fault for not doing more research before buying and I definitely regret this purchase.  I recommend putting it on your wishlist and stearing clear of a purchase until more progress is made.  MUCH more progress.			"

								This game scratches that itch.  I grew up playing the old ones- I think the first might have been Wizardry 1 on my Apple IIc iirc.  Malevolence has the feel of those games but it really isn't one of those games.  Ultimately, for me at least, the core being of Malevolence is that it is infinite and has an infinite number of ways to kill you.  In almost all cases I abhor scaling in RPG's but it works for Malevolence- in fact there is really no other way it could work that I can think of.I heartily recommend this game for anyone who relishes a challenge that could potentially never end.  I really, really like this game despite some of the bugs that exist now (none of them show stopping for me).  Alex has done a tremendous job and continues to develop and support a labor of love.This is not a 'AAA' title and that is for the best.  So if you are looking for infinite Oblivion/Skyrim this is not it.  Malevolence is it's own beast and doesn't make any allusions to being something it is not.Prost!			"

								I heard about this game on a forum regarding rogue-like games, it said that this game was infinite so I looked it up and bought it. That was around 2 years ago and I gotta say that this game has made incredible progress in that time. The game is in a finished beta state, fully playable and totally infinitely huge, actually beyond huge, there is no limit. There are unlimited locations to explore, no level cap, I cannot express how much I really enjoy this game. And to think it was thought up and created by one man, with help from a select bunch of testers. The game is amazing and definately worth the money, if in doubt try the demo first. Now this isnt graphically superior, or story rich, but it is definately engaging and will keep one playing a lifetime if they wish. Currently I just bought the Steam version of the game and it displays something like 12 hours played, but that is in 2 days. I have easilly spent 200+ hours since my initial purchace and I am not ever bored, level up, re-gear, go fight more mobs. There is a difficulty scaling and certain dungeons are just more difficult than others, too tough? Go fight a different place. There is no lack of dungeons. My grade for this game is 95% which is very excellent. Try it today!			"

								I've revised my review.  For a Beta game there is a lot of content here.  I think this game has alot of potential.  I didn't realize that you would start at pretty much ground zero in each new dungeon you go into.  I like to grind it's a way to veg out, You can constantly improve your character, but it seems like as soon as you finish one dungeon and are slaughtering everything the next one kills you with ease.  I like to progress my character in game I want a powerful character not one constantly getting beat up by goblins.  I'll recommend it just for the time I've played it.			"

Don't be fooled by the 'early access' the game is a complete product, The main things to come or only bonus extras (more tilesets/monsters/spells etc.) and tidying up what is already there. If you want an old time, retro experience then this is the game for you. Be warned, if you have no experience of the RPG's of the mid to late 90's you may find this a bit of a shock, there are no holds barred, the game wants you dead, at it will get its wish in the end.

Do NOT buy this if you think graphics make a game because the textures look like a PC game from early 2000's.  Other than that, its standard RPG fare.  Grind off mobs in the dungeon and do yourself another favor and put it on permadeath because there's no point in knowing you'll eventually win...you want that fear of dying. And you will die ALOT.

								A turn based rpg within an infinite world what is not to like.Although early access the game has a lot of content to come but at this point in writing the game has a lot in it and a lot to explore and loot. Those seeking a hack and slash game will soon find themselfs looking at the loading screen a lot. Combat is not a click click swing weapon as fast as you can. The game does not work like that. This game is HARD and i do mean it you will die a lot but if you can step back and think of your next move when to cast a spell or when to use a potion and or when to run you will get a lot of of  this.Graphics take a wee bit of getting used to and the limited tiles for dungeons just now do make them a bit samey but it is the gamepay this game shines and this game does have a lot to come which can only enhance a great game.Also of note is the music which sets the mood for the game.For old school rpg players this is well worth the time and money. It wont be for the action rpg players this is not what this game is about but if you do like to explore an endless world and being the first to discover places then this is for you.			"

								An early kickstarter success, Malevolence has given me far more game than I ever expected.While it has an old school First Person RPG feel of a the original Might and Magic, or The Bards Tale games, it adds many new ideas such as procedurally generating the maps and towns. This allows a massive overworld, and allows you to find new things almost every time.The developer has been great about adding new features and fixing bugs, and their roadmap shows a lot more neat stuff coming.  Malevolence is definitely worth your time.			"

								This game just ticks so many boxes on my list of stuff I would like to see in an old-school rogue-lite RPG that it is borderline ridiculous!- Old-school hex-grid turn-based movement and combat is just the way I like it.- The game is huge (well, actually it's infinite, but I'm not gonna explain that here), and all about exploration. Pick a direction and run, you can run forever, just dodging the occasionally tree or rock, trust me, there are no borders or invisible walls in this world!- You can play a game of dice or get drunk in the local tavern, but trust me, save first, specially if you play Permadeath! (I once got drunk and woke up at the bottom of that huge sea in the center of the map, and drowned before I could reach land, hehe)- Personal banks just got added to the game, so you can now store your stuff!And having said that the game is not even done yet, it is still in Beta/Early access, and there is so much more to come:- New mysterious magic system in the makings, and judging by the info we have so far it should be awesome- Fighter, mages and thieves guild quests are coming, and they should be much more challenging than the standard quests currently in the game- Much more including boss fights etc.If you are an old-school RPG gamer like me and loves exploring and dungeon crawling, this game is for you!

								Note that I am not here reviewing a completed game, but the early-access version.  Keep that in mind.  Even at this early stage, the game is incredibly fun.  It's a first-person roguelike set in an effectively infinite procedurally generated world.  Although the world is not regenerated every time you play, the fact is that the size of the world means that you'll never run out of unique lands and dugneons to explore.  Gameplay is actually relatively simple.  But because there's no tutorial, and a lot is left to the player to figure out for himself, it can be frustrating until some things 'click'.The game doesn't have any true classes, but you'll differentiate yourself based on how you kill monsters, and the spells that you cast,  the traps that you disarm, as well as, by your gear.At this stage, the game only has a few different kinds of monsters, a few different kinds of quests, 2 kinds of dungeon themes a couple of minigames (one for removing traps, another for gambling at the tavern) and a number of different facilities in towns you'll visit (including shops, temples, a fighters guild, mages guild and Thieve's guild and two different kinds of fast transports.In spite of the incomplete nature of the game, and a few bugs (including some stability issues), the game is very fun to play.  I find myself wanting to just see if I can get to the next level, clear out al of the monsters on my current dungeon floor, or kill just one more goblin or imp in order to complete a quest.  So I do recommend it.  But keep in mind (as I said) there are issues.Update as of August 2016:I'm not going to change this to a negative review, since what I wrote earlier still is the case. That said, let me tell you that dev has not been releasing updates to the general audience -- only to his limited membership of beta testers.  We've been assured that work is still being done, but the occasional assurance of that is the only evidence.My first instinct in going over my former review was to change it to a negative. But I honestly had a positive reaction to the game back then, so it would be dishonest of me to change my review now. But lets just say that all of the problems the game has still exist, and its biggest problem (Besides not much variety to the game) is that its basic stat system is screwy and works in an anti-intuitive and annoying way, and I'm really worried that promised changes to the magic system, instead of relying on a more rational stats system, will simply be the dev doubling down on the oddball system that is already there. But speculation like that is all a person like me, not part of the devs inner circle can do.When will this be more than what it is? God only knows. Maybe never.So yeah, I'm still giving the game a good review, but as time continues to passs, I've become more and more skeptical that this will ever live up to its potential.			"

								With 40 hours a beta and now the Steam realease, I can recommend Malevolence.If you played Bard's Tale, Wizardry, Might and Magic or any rogulike made, you will be at home here.Nobody is holding your hand here.  You will have to use tactic, skill, strategy and luck to make progress here. "

								I recommend this game, as you can no doubt tell by the thumbs some where else on this page. I like this game, I like rogue likes and this game captures the thrill of what a rogue-like is very well.The graphics aren't too great, and I've run into a couple of glitches. The game IS in early access though. But I never stopped enjoying the game. I think the game has WONDERFUL sound design, lots of little details that give it a ton of charm, and PERMADEATH! Oh boy do I love permadeath.Keep in mind who made this and you'll be really surprised. Most of this is one man's love put into years of work. Overall I would say it's very good for the work of one man. Some of my favorite games have been done by one man. One Way Heroics is one, another is Dust: An Elysian Tail. Of course the guy from Dust had the whole Xbox live thing going from him and etc etc.Thing is, best way to decide if you'll like this game is to play it yourself. Go on, do it. Don't want to buy it? Well here, they have a demo. Demo convinced me. http://www.malevolencegame.com/buythegame.htmlDecide for youself.			"

Early Access Review
								Fantastic 90s style RPG with some incredibly immersive dungeon crawling.First of all, the game is still under development, and as such it isn't very well optimised. I'd ONLY recommend getting the game if you have a pretty good gaming PC.Graphics: Not state of the art by any means, but stay true to what exactly the developers are trying to achieve with this game.For people with older/less expensive PCs there is a low detail mode, which I can't say I really like the look of, but at least it's there.Sound: Fantastic music; especially the piece in the loading screens while waiting to enter towns. The sound effects also stay true to the feel of the game and sound similar to what you'd expect in the 90s. You'll hear monsters grunt and groan as you make your way through dungeons and it really adds to the atmposhere of the dungeons.Gameplay: Turn based. Each map is marked by a squared grid. Each movement uses a turn. Pretty simplistic, and really easy to pick up and play.Dungeons: By far the best part of the game; this is what the game is all about after all. The dungeons are dark and eerie, requiring a lit torch to see where you're going. They range from small narrow corridors with many twists and turns to great halls filled with pillars. The dungeons of Ahkranox are also incredibly dangerous. You're never too far from some sort of monster, or even worse, a trap!Yes, traps play a big part in the dungeons. They range from explosion and poison traps to boulders and spikes, and if you're not careful, they just might be what kills you. When a trap is in your vicinity, your purple gem will glow and you can search by clicking in front of you and attempt to disarm it.Monsters also require some thought as to how you'll approach them. You'll hear their groans and when you get close your green gem will glow. Whilst combat is simple, it still requires some thought. You know the monster is there, but can't always see whether it's only a little imp or a man stomping ogre.Dungeons also have secret passages which are indicated by your red gem glowing. You just simply click the correct wall and it opens up.Loot: There is tons of loot in this game. From new weapons to books to potions to troll pubes. (or something like that)Loot can be found both outside dungeons and inside. It can be obtained from barrels, chests, crates, monsters, urns, tables, and so on. As for monsters, you'll often debate whether or not the loot is worth the risk.Difficulty: Malevolence is an incredibly difficult game overall. However, it is only really as difficult as you make it for yourself.Everything comes down to being prepared, forward thinking, being careful and knowing when you're beaten. You really are your own worst enemy in this game.Permadeath and Leaderboards: By selecting permadeath, your save data is deleted when you die. (obviously) But when you play a permadeath character, there's a chance that if you can survive long enough to reach a certain level, that you'll make the leaderboards.Land Claiming: Any time you find a new area you can hit f11 and see who who discovered the area first, or claim any already unclaimed land. The world is infinite, so there's always a chance that you can put your own name to something.In short: If you're looking for an immersive, challenging dungeon crawler with a retro feel, this is it. It's already fantastic to play and can only get better with time. :)			"

								Game's promises are fulfilled. However, expect...- Badly scaled monsters, due to monster difficulty being decided by your current area and your level rather than spawn location (you can kill monsters by running back to outside the town gates and then just blocking all monster hits)- Long load times (There's a music jingle that plays if you enter a town... only once it actually ends you can play again... the jingle is about 30 seconds long, I think)- More loading (overworld is divided into 20x20 grid sections. Or 25x25. Whenever you enter a new section... the game has to load. So when you're travelling from A to B, or just exploring, you'll constantly be pulled out of your immersion)- Bad graphics (""you might have to tweak them to get a good result"" = don't buy unless your monitor's native resolution is 1024x768 or 1440x900 - because otherwise, game will look bad. Especially trees.)- Bad viewrange (~20 tiles, or about 100 meters). You know how there's towers and castles in this game? Yeah, well, you can 't see them until they're in a section next to your section. Meaning that if a castle takes up most of a section, you can't see it until you're 25-30 tiles away from it (about 125 meters). So when you cross a section border, POOF castle.- NO in-game tutorial. There's one on the menu, but it's easily missed as it's at the bottom of the screen, far away from ""continue game"" and ""new game"". What do the gems mean? You don't know, nobody tells you and without knowing that you will DIE. Red = secret area, green = monster, purple = ""important object"". Which is a town, a dungeon, or a trap. Oh yeah. To exit a dungeon, step off the exit tile, look at it from an adjacent tile, AND CLICK THE LADDER/TRAPDOOR. Again, this had to be looked up online, after I fled from a monster, and found out that I'd easily have been able to escape, but because I was now pinned to the exit tile, I couldn't. Because my character can't stick his arms straight up to pull a ladder down.In short:- You don't get much information- The game is hard because you don't get much information, not because of there actually being things you have to overcome.However, if you don't find the above listed issues a problem, then this could be a game for you. Because of the game does deliver on the things it promises.			"

								Malevolence The Sword of Ahkranox is an infinite old school style RPG. When I say infinite, the world is literally infinite, infinite towns, infinite dungeons, infinite quests, infinite dungeons and so on and so forth something that has never truly been done before. I have always wanted an RPG that ends only when I decide it is time to stop playing and I love the fact and idea of just getting lost in a world and go to places that nobody else has ever been to.The game has a feature where players can claim locations, where if you are the first person to find a location you are forever known as the first person to ever discover that location. Dungeon can contain a total number of anything from 1 to 10 floors, with the further into a dungeon you go the more dangerous and tough it becomes but the better the rewards are with each dungeon containing a mega chest at the end with powerful goodies in it. I find it one of the most addictive games I have played in years with it just being a case of one more floor or one more quest and what feels like only 5 minutes turns out to be actually several hours later.It is currently in Early Access and in Beta stage of developement, but despite that it is amazing stable. Never before have a played a game in Beta as stable as this is. There are still a lot more features to be implemented into the game and if the game is as addictive at this stage, come V1.0, I might as well kiss my social life goodbye. I love this game and truly couldn't recommend highly enough.			"

								This is probably one of the most worth-while buys in a long time, that and Endless Legend. This game is an amazing hardcore/old-school RPG. Incorperating some of my favorite features, such as FPS view, grid-basedness among other things but adds new features too. Including a infinite procedureally-generated world, but that world stays persistent for everyone plays once its generated. I will warn though, for the niche gamer, not everyone. Do beware as the graphics and other things are out dated but that shouldn't matter too much if you dig it. But well worth it, I reccomend to RPG fanatics.			"

								I don't know why, but I love this game so far. I really enjoy how the game itself feels like a puzzle begging to be solved. There is no hand-holding, no ingrained story that tries to tell you how to feel about the world and your place in it. The meaning behind everything is ultimately up to the player. As a result, the world may feel a little emptier, but to me it feels more mysterious and makes me feel more alone and free. These are qualities that not even TES games quite capture for me. Everything in this game is unknown and optional, players are truly cut loose to tackle the game however they want (or however they can!). I can't wait to see what other content is introduced and where this game goes.			"

								-It's not yet there-Early access means: you should be willing to play the game in its current state. You probably won't.There's not much here really. I obviously misread the reviews because the online features are not there as of now. In the sum it's a playable ALPHA like a proof of concept or something.At the moment there is the exploration of dungeons, restocking in the city and repeat.Gameplay is or will be a mix from Might and Magic turn-based RPGs like MM3 and Daggerfall (The Elder Scrolls 2)All weapon or character portraits look awful even compared to those old games like they were made in MS paint. I hope those are placeholders. Loading screens are decently pretty (and loading takes long like the latest Might & Magic). This might one day evolve into a (good) game but that's still far on the horizon.I will update this review in about a year or so.As of now you should only buy if you want to support the devs, there's not much plying the game.

								This was one of my first Kickstarter backed projects. I was extremely interested in the infinite world mechanics of the game and how they would relate to the old style RPG/dungeon crawler games that I played as a kid franchise games like Dungeon Master, Might and Magic, & Dragon Warrior. I have to say I am very pleased with how the game is turning out even in its Beta stage. That being said it is still a work in progress with some minor glitches here and there but the developer stays on top of these issues and fixes them quickly.  The replay value of this game is infinite just like the world it is in every time I make a new character I choose to be cast to a random place in the world and every time I get a unique environment & experience.  This is also a great game for those of you who like to read about the lore of the world with many great books you find while you adventure. This game will also appease those of you who like to loot horde and organize your inventory since there is a plethora of armor, weapons, ingredients, potions, & many other miscellaneous items.  This was made even better with the recent introduction of the infinite bank space to store all the loot you find.  I do have to note that this game can be extremely hard and unforgiving at times so the save function will be your friend since you will die many times.  I would highly recommend getting this game if you enjoy those old style RPG dungeon crawlers games from the 80’s/90’s.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is made by a practically 0-person team, and in a lot of ways it shows.  But as someone who has been following its production for years since the Kickstarter, any fans of Legend of Grimrock (or its grid-based predecessors) owe it to themselves to check this out.  It feels instantly familiar--in no small part because it follows first-person grid-based RPG conventions in expected ways.  But the Roguelike element of its procedurally generated worlds makes this essentially the first game of its kind since Dungeon Hack(!), and Ahkranox has an overworld as well as dungeons to explore.This game almost feels like a potential alternate development path for the Elder Scrolls series; like if Bethesda had made Daggerfall and said ""hmm, we cannot keep making these enormous game worlds with better technology...I know!  We will have the COMPUTER make them!""  So yes, this game is kind of like Indie Roguelike Morrowind, which is indeed praiseworthy.Now, of course, about the 0-person team thing--the art and sound quality is pretty uneven for this reason.  But if you are playing games because you love them, not because you want to be impressed by the money that went into them, then you can likely overlook this.Besides, in some ways it instantly takes me back to my own gaming childhood to hear my character spouting hokey dialogue about the environment in a voice probably recorded with a cheap microphone in someone's basement.  But you can tell the person doing the dialogue was loving it, which still puts even the voice acting on par with some big-name games from even 10 years ago!			"

								Currently the game is still in a BETA state. Some people would say ALPHA, but I don't care about this.I backed this game very early on Kickstarter. I liked the idea of an infinite world and the possibility to experience your own adventures. I started playing without the permadeath option, but turned this option on, once I understood how the game worked.Why permadeath as an option, many people ask. Because a few people don't like permadeath, and for those this option was made. There are some features in the game even some upcoming features were it is essential to have this feature turned on. I like the game for the little things, the details, like the minigame to disarm physical / mechanical traps. The goblin dice game in the taverns, the statues in the dungeons ... nah I don't you that, you have to find that out for yourself.The game is fantastic, but it will be even better, once you joined the great community behind it and met the awesome people who made this game possible. The story behind the game, the work, life, heart, sweat and effort put into this piece. The lore (books) in this game and the music and sound effects are just amazing. You will have banks in the next update, to store lorebooks, ingredients to craft potions, spells and enhace weapons. "

This game is a blast - it is vast (infinite in fact) and very hard. Alex, the developer has been working on improving it for a couple years and it is always a treat when he releases a new version. For him, this is a labor of love and you can tell it in the quality of the game. He is also one of the friendliest and most awesome developers for any game I've seen (which reminds me, I need to get active on the forums again.)I owned this game before it was put on steam and I put quite a bit of hours into it then. Unfortunately, I have been tied up with work and some side projects and consequently I haven't spent much time playing games. However, this is one of my all time favorite games. I am looking forward to going back to it and will be playing it off and on for the rest of my life. It is that cool.			"

Then convert to pints of blood,sweat, and tears, cause the only being that has shed more of that than this dev has poured into this game...... is you when you walk over that first spike trap!Controls are standard fare, done well. And the new magic system is eagerly awaited. Can't wait for the polish run!2,000,000 Pints/Spike Trap. SEVERELY recommended!			"

								Its a pipedream that is never, ever going to happen, despite the developers and a few rabid fans protesting.			"

Only purchase if you like M&M like RPGThe game is good? No, but there are few first person RPG's. This is why i recommend for M&M fans. First of all, the loadings takes a ethernity. Second, the character stats are very ambiguous. Thrid. The insta kill traps + ethernal loadings turns some quests very annoying. Mainly if you have to clear a dungeon and there are few enemies left in dungeon. All dungeons fells like the same in terms of design, but there are few first person RPG's. This is why i recommend the game. M&M X Legacy still worst,			"

								I have died so many times to pit traps.I have waited so long for the magic update.This game is just a lot of fun to play.  The update was worth the wait, and this game shines with it in place.There isn't much more to say here.   Yes, others have claimed the game is unfair as an early access game.B.S.Play it and have fun.September 20th update:Hotfixes have already started fixing the long awaited magic update, and the developer has made it his mission to start fixing and tweaking what he has released.Great game if you're into procedural generation and its madness and roguelike difficulties.Thumbs up.April 23, 2017 update:Developer cares for his community, and cares this game runs correctly.  The newest enchantment update is phenomenal and opens up gameplay possibilities.  It's nearing 1.0 final release.  If you really think you're not part of a community with the game, you're just not trying to get involved.The opportunity is there over at the official Malevolence forums.   A gem of a game.If you're looking at reviews thinking: nah.   You're losing out and will pay more money when 1.0 goes live.			"

								Wait until release. This game updates a couple times a year at most. While playable, certainly not worth the asking price.*EDIT*Well there is a suprise. Big update. Lots of fixes, and new magic system with consistant developer feedback and numerous bug fixes. Changing my review to a thumbs up. Worth getting....I'd still wait until release however.			"

								The price is incredibly inappropriate. This is still decidedly pre-alpha material, and by the looks of it, will unlikely offer as many features / polish / FUN as most FREE roguelikes. Not to say this couldn't be extremely fun one day - but it will never be worth 20 bucks.			"
