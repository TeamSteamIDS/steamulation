												All the bad reviews are true. This game is dreadful. It has poor grainy resolution, horrible voice acting and tormenting ears-piercing background music. Sherlock has an irritating nasal British accent and his remarks are obvious or silly statements, The puzzles are quite easy, but not all of them make sense, and it's easy to miss items. And why make a puzzle game from first person view? It was a bad idea, especially with the oversensitive mouse (obviously, this game was made for mechanical  mouses).And the game crashes, too.This game takes place in the 19th century, and apparently it was made back then, as well.Avoid this game at all costs. 3/10.

												Released back in 2002, Sherlock Holmes: The Mystery of the Mummy hasn't aged well. The pseudo-3D environments having been design for smaller monitor resolutions are pixelated on today's larger and wider resolutions, this results in making the already hidden objects in the game harder to find by being unable to clearly see them. Also it is not stable on modern systems as I had several crash to desktop's while playing the game. Thankfully they are predictable as they usually occurred during cutscenes and with saving before solving a puzzle little progress would be lost. The puzzles in the game are very challenging and added the fact there is timed segments and puzzles that result in Sherlock Holmes death if you get them wrong. This game is a real challenge and should only be reccomended to adventure game fanatics. Everybody else just skip this one and go for the more recent Sherlock Holmes games.			"

												This game hasn't aged well, and I doubt it was ever much fun to begin with. Moving around and picking up evidence is a total pixel hunt, and the game as a whole handles poorly. It's incredibly easy to get stuck because the game wants you to do some random illogical interaction to move on which you usually find by just clicking on everything until something happens. Dying and end of level cutscenes crash the game on windows 7. The voice acting is so bad it's actually pretty funny. The story was almost acceptable, but Holmes' customary explanation of the mystery at the end was badly done and I couldn't understand it. I wouldn't play this unless you really want to beat the whole Holmes series, or you bought the bundle and feel like you might as well try it.			"

												I bought all SH games and decided to start at the beginning, and I'm very disappointed. And yeah, I know this game is old but that is not a very good excuse.You can only play it at fullscreen (in which everything is pixelated and hard to look at - and I only have a 13'' screen, which is considerably small), you can't alt+tab away from the game unless you're in for restarting it (you can't even access the Steam layer) and it happens a lot that the game crashes at cutscenes (that stuff you spent the last hour working on? Lost!).If that is not enough to harden your way through, items are very very well hidden, which is not a bad point per se, but I found they were just overly hidden for it to be fun. I don't know whether this was made on purpose (since Sherlock's primary skill is observing it makes sense to make it hard to ""see"" useful stuff) or not.Also, the puzzles are really difficult (difficult enough they're no longer fun) and most of the time will require you take paper and pen (since you can't alt+tab out of the game) and spend some long time on them, which could be fun if you like it (like I do), but, in this case, it just isn't.Yes, the story is fine, the way you can get letters (backstory) is well thought of, moving through rooms/levels is a very good mechanic, but the bad points weight, by far, much more than the good points.So, unless you enjoy very difficult and time-consuming games, don't spend your money on this.If you get this in a SH bundle and need to check it out just because you're a fan, don't be afraid to have a walkthrough ready on your phone!

Sherlock Holmes: the mistery of the mummy		* 6/10I decided to try the whole Sherlock Holmes series developed by Frogware And I chose to start specifically from their very first adventure. It started in windowed mode and there's no option ingame. I had a few crash loading the 3rd level, the 5th level, and the menu after final credit rolls but everything seems to be solved by setting the Win XP SP3 compatibility, or by skipping the cutscenes.This game takes you inside a mansion where you can see in First person view and you may freelook simply pointing your cursor to the sides of the screen. You move and interact with the classic Point and click system, so nothing particular or new in the gameplay, actually it's pretty minimalist, as you only use your mouse with its left button. Unfortunately there's no way to examine items unless you pick them up from your inventory as nothing shows when you hover on them through the inventory, nor there's a specific function. It's not like you really need it in the game but it surely would have helped a bit...+++PROs+++ STORY. Actually the story is interesting. As you move on you get more and more clues and notes that somehow destroy your certainties and premises. I can't say more to prevent any kind of spoilers but I appreciated the plot. The final scene shows a classic Sherlock moment where he explains all the presents what really happened. MUSIC. I kind of liked the music you hear in each level, I appreciated the compositions.---CONs--- GRAPHIC.  I know it has its age and it's a simple adventure but I really have to say that the graphic is very very poor and low detailed. MUSIC & AUDIO. Unfortunately hearing the same music abrutly interrupted then restarting again for the whole level is really alienating. Besides that, some parts have very bad leveled volumes, and sometimes some sound or speeches are clipping. (though this happened rarely. Except for the first music track which crackled every time it finish to play again) STEAM OVERLAY. Another game that doesn't support the Steam Overlay... SETTINGS. The game started windowed and there were no options to set, nor for the graphic nor for audio (music, effects and speech levels) INTERFACE. As a point & click game the interface is very important. Unfortunately the hot zones (zones that change cursor suggesting movement or actions) sometimes are too specific forcing you to search too long through the screen in the direction you want to move to find out later that the hot zone is really limited and lightly dislocated. Besides that, sometimes it's really hard to understand or see items you can pick or interact with. Not to mention a less important but still annoying bug that shows the wrong cursor icon when you interact with items and instead of restoring the defaul icon or changing to another secific one it stays the previous (and now wrong) one. SHERLOCK'S & OTHERS VOICE. Well, it's not really about the voice, nor the accent. Actually it's his tone that doesn't convince me, as sometimes is really too harsh... And also Dr. Watson's voice sounds kind of... a parody... "

												I didn't beat this game, but if I did, I bet I'd be very impressed with myself for the intricate and puzzling puzzles.I admit that I only got maybe 60% of the game's plot done and then I gave up, because I really suck at some puzzle games, this one definitely killed me.The writing was great though, and I ended just watching youtube videos of the game online, since I got lazy.

												I like the Sherlock Holmes games, but not this one. It's definitely the worst of the bunch.First of all, you can't change the resolution. The entire game looked blurry. Sherlock's voice acting is passable, but everyone else's is laughably bad. (Also, Sherlock mispronounces ""laudanum,"" which bothers me more than it should.)This game commits the worst adventure game sins: pixel hunting, puzzles that are either mindless busywork or completely inscrutable, and unintuitive use of inventory items. The game doesn't explain the rules or objectives of many puzzles. For instance, one puzzle requires you to place exactly four liters of water on a depression. You're not told that's the amount you need, which, considering there's no earthly reason that putting more weight on it wouldn't work, should really be included. One puzzle is a nonogram, something I had never seen before, and the game gave no instructions. The final puzzle is solved by randomly clicking things in your inventory, with no rhyme or reason to why that item should go there.If you bother to play to the end, you find out that the solution to the mystery doesn't make sense and is about as ridiculous as it could get. My suggestion to anyone interested in the Sherlock Holmes games is to pass on this one and get another.			"

												I picked this game up during a sale awhile ago because the series seemed interesting. I figured I would start at the beginning. On it's own merits though this is a pretty terrible game.In it's defense it's also a really OLD game. And it's not like it was easier to make them back then either. A good adventure game should be reasonably intuitive. At some point it's going to degenerate into click everything in your inventory on every object you can, but it doesn't have to be that way all the time.Mystery of the Mummy on the other hand has objects that are very easy to miss. Sherlock himself would have trouble uncovering the mystery of the missing item in the inventory.The dialog is so cheesy that I almost want to call it a feature. At some point I should finish this, but I didn't really feel like it engaged me. "

												A really bad example of an Point&Click Adventure.The gameplay is more like a escape room gameplay, you click yourself from the first person trough different screens and move like this. To be honest, i like this featue and in this game i never had a "" find the hotspot"" game inside. But on the other hand the graphics are pretty bad, well okay its from 2002, but still its very pixelated etc. You never interact with other people, its more like already said, l an escape room game where you solve riddle after riddle to get into the next room. Its pretty hard to figure out what you have to do, even if its very easy to find all necessary items, but very hard to use them actually, since the graphics dont allow you insight mostly on what to do. But they are well, pretty logical . I had not that often troubles to solve them. The story really sucks. I forgot what was the story about pretty quickly. Not that i didnt payed attention, the story didnt actually matter that much. The atmoshpere is actually pretty good, but the main character is giving comments on the current situations like he is watching it from far away. Example: a big mummy comes out of a room(more like a cheap jumpscare) and he comments it as his life isnt in danger at all.The voiceover is bad, but in many different languages.I heard about having crashes, etc. I didnt had any but you have been warned.I actually managed to finish the game in 4.9 hours, but its just because i stucked at 1-2 of the last riddles for a while.Recommended? No not alone, but in the complete collection, yes. If you like very good riddles then give the games a shot, since they are more likely realistic and logical than in other point&click games. The game itself is about a little below average. You can play it, atleast the riddles are good.So i give the game thumbs up to buy the whole pack. Otherwise, nah .3/10			"

												After playing all of the Sherlock games from 'The Silver Earring' onwards, I wanted to go back right to the beginning and play them all through chronologically before the new one due out this year. I'm giving this one the thumbs down as much as I want it to be a thumbs up because of so many speed humps that actually interrupt the flow of the game. Probably the first thing to mention is the continuous crashing, particularly at the end of cut scenes and chapter ends. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE OFTEN. I cannot reiterate that point enough. Much frustration comes after completing a devilish puzzle to have the game crash and redo it ALL over again. However, these crashes can be overcome with the good ole ESC key, for the most part.The second most disappointing element is the visuals in relation to the difficulty of the game. I appreciate the age of a game and God knows how many adventure games I have played over the years but to find a hairpin, for example, on a floor that frankly is blurry and the object resembles a smudge is poor form. Being penalised via having to consult a walkthrough so often for locating objects is not on. On the plus side the story is engaging enough to make you restart again and again and finish it but it feels a chore to 'get through'. The voice acting/recording is atrocious (knowing in the future this becomes its' main selling point) and the dialogue itself is poorly written. After almost no interaction with characters the game finishes with a huge cutscene that wraps it all up with way too much assumption and frankly insults the gamer who has been there all the way by solving the whole thing and saying goodnight with silent credits. Fans of the games NEED to play this one to experience the whole saga but this one cannot have it's age to blame because in its era there were many other adventure games that got this formula right with less frustration. Anyways, onto the next game :)			"

												I dont think this was considered good in 2002, which means its definetly not good now. The game is just littered with pointless impossible puzzles that dont make any sense and defy the laws of physics, and when your not doing those you are going on a wonderful pixel hunt with the thing your looking for being a tiny black dot in the bottom of the screen. The world is literally a panorama shot where you 'look around' for things to infuriate you more. The only way I actually managed to somehow finish this was by watching another person suffer on you-tube as the final puzzle will take around 40mins to solve (Correctly) and the first time you do it correctly it will fail you anyways. If you are getting the Sherlock Collection (Which I would highly recommend as every other Sherlock game is Fantastic) then by all means give it a go, but as a game by itself.......dont.			"

												Disclaimer: I've been playing games since the 80's, so this game tickles my nostalgia in the way that may not be applicable to you. Sherlock with addeniods and an American accent, hilairously bad scripting, horrendous navigation, clunky animations, and timed-death puzzles. Oh, and random crashes (what do you mean, you don't save every 2 minutes? What's wrong with you?) Playing this cornball game really reminds be of playing adventure games in the 90s, and why the adventure game  genre died out until recently (the trauma needed time to recede). I'm playing it with the walkthrough open (this one seems accurate, though I needed to read the puzzle before placing the seal in the vase: http://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcSs/SHMysteryMummy.htm ). I'm reading the walkthrough on the ipad since flipping between windows causes the game to the crash. I've found that when the game crashes reloading it will generally take you past the crash point, especially if you skip the cutscene (space bar, I think). This, a glass of wine, and the hilariously cornball music and voiceacting (it's really bad) played over bad laptop speakers makes for a not terrible way to spend a few hours on a laidback saturday afternoon.

												This game might have been decent in 1995 when I had few gaming choices and didn't mind spending hours walking back and forth clicking random items on any hotspot I could find. (Of course thats only supposing I had already beaten Sam n Max hit the road) It might even have not crashed constantly and I certainly would have had no issue with it not supporting the steam overlay. However I would have expected significantly better in 2002 and since its pretty much 2015 now I would advice all to steer clear.The puzzles were either the same old or made basically no sense at all and I had to give up and use a walk through to find out there is a secret close up zoom area not marked by anything about 4 pixels wide that you need to click on to find an item under a table that from every other angle is quite clear of stuff. GG, you win devs... I guess.Story? Its alright I guess. Kind of sparse but as long as you don't mind filling it in with imaginary details its passable.Audio? Meh, Its got a little of that classic adventure game midi jam but its mostly just annoying and the voice acting is clean but bland.

												""I need something to open this.""I played this through to the first crash-to-desktop, at which point I decided I wasn't having fun with it enough to re-do all of it up to that point (about half-wayish or something, according to walkthroughs).This game has not aged well. The graphics are shoddy and the animations are, well, bad. The dialogue is putrid and very dry, which seems very unlike Doyles' Holmes. The sound of the game is quite good, although the dubbing is dull and lacking of any real... Character.Most of the game is your standard point and click ""find hidden item, use X with Y to do Z and then maybe find something useful"". There was a time where I had more patience with that sort of game, but this just seems needlessly complicated. Find all the pieces to be able to find the puzzle, so you can do the puzzle and move on to the next room. Boring. Nothing is really complex or challenging - at least once you've figured out what you actually need to pick up.Speaking of things to pick up, that's one point I really like.. Some other reviews noted this as a bad thing, but I really love that the items you need don't ""stand out"" more than any other. That philosophy is brilliant, and, had there been fewer things to pick up, it really helped the game along with regards to immersion.There's not much else to say about this, really. The game is dull and features way too many ""This door is locked"" or ""I need something to open this"" lines. I'm a big fan of Doyle's Holmes, and that Holmes would, quite likely, just have bypassed those locks in some ingenious way - not just looked around for a bit and hope to stumble upon the key.			"

												A Sherlock Holmes game must have two reward systems in place: - A story reward. As the mystery unravels piece by piece, the player must want to continue solving in order to find out more.- Joy in actually solving the puzzles. This is unlike most adventure games where the story is everything and the puzzles merely a means of achieving it. Sherlock Holmes found joy in the process of solving the mystery, so it makes sense that in a game which captures the feel of it, the puzzles must be as fun as the story.Unfortunately, this game failed on both fronts but as the first game in a series, I see immense promise in them achieving the second goal. I've heard that they make the ""hidden objects"" much more obvious, so that it's less a hidden objects game, and the puzzles get progressively more elegant. They become less, ""Can you guess what the developers want you to do before you get frustrated and look it up"" and more difficult but solvable. But the first game is not there yet. I ended up just looking up the LP after I got halfway through and frustrated so that I could follow snippets of story that may seep into the next game.After watching the LP, I still have no idea what actually happened in the story. Huh.Again, I do see hints of promise and I have been told that the next games have really improved on the failures of this one so still going to check them out.I think this one is skippable.(I'm not even going to go into the colonialism in this one. How as Sherlock Holmes you end up throwing around priceless Egyptian artifacts stolen by a collector that all end up getting destroyed because of the collector's mistake. Nope.)			"

Even though this was the first game made;  the silver earring is a prequel to this game, just to be confusing. This game has really dated graphic capability, game mechanics, and puzzles that only the true Sherlock Holmes could solve. The PC version of this game requires external software which is very obnoxious because the graphical issues are only mostly solved. Even though the first person point of view would be a smart move to see everything Sherlock Holmes would see was poorly implimented. Instead of a FPS shooter it was more of a point and click adventure to move around a room. With the frustration to get the game running, playing the game, and seeing the game. I suggest you either find someone to play a different version or buy this on a sale if you really want the complete experiance of Frogware's excellent series. Otherwise give this game a miss.			"

												I tried so bad to like this game, but I couldn't.  I wanted to play the first of the Sherlock Holmes series (and hopefully all the entries in the series ), since I liked the Testament of Sherlock Holmes. The game crashing every level change is frustrating, to watch a level end cut-scene means getting crashed right after it finishes, restart the game then reload just before finishing a level, and skip the cutscene to progress. The game is not alt-tab friendly either, it will crash if you alt-tab.However the worse thing about this game is the game mechanic.The puzzles just came out of nowhere, no explanation, no logic.Having the camera movement and the cursor both tied to the mouse is very annoying, because your view will shift as you get close to the edge of the screen while pixel hunting for clues.All the screenshots above are from the game's cutscenes, majority of the gameplay is played on a 2D image of a 3D model, not even a palette cycle for simple animations.If you like adventure games, avoid this gameIf you like puzzle games, avoid this game "

												Save often. The game likes to crash, and occasionally you’ll die for no apparent reason; in both cases, if you haven’t saved, all your progress is lost.Keep a UHS hint file or a walkthrough handy—on another device, or printed out (since this game doesn’t let you multitask). I can’t imagine anyone managing to get through this thing without some kind of guide. Too much of the game just leaves you blind.And my final piece of advice: Skip this game and play the rest in the series. I love adventure games, I had the help of hints, and yet it was still an exercise in frustration. I’d rather see this plot done in Scooby-Doo.			"

												I simply cannot believe that a broken game is being sold. I mean, I can believe it, I just think it's awful. When going from level 2 to level three it just crashes. And that's the way it is. The movement is super awkward having to press in exactly the right place in order to move anywhere. Apart from that I really can't tell, because, as stated... is broken.

												While the game is currently free (can't even give it away!), this had come to me in a bundle. It's 8 years old and has aged very badly.   Windowed mode only, no meaningful changes to the graphics settings.Gameplay is fairly run of the mill point and click/puzzler, not terribly complicated or fun.  Bad voice acting and sound.The technical hiccups, being forced into a tiny window for the gameplay, etc etc just makes this game unplayable.   It's not worth the disk space unfortunately.			"

												Without a hint of exaggeration, I think I can safely say this is truly the worst game I have ever played.  This game is a pixel hunting nightmare and the clues to any puzzles you must solve are generally unhelpful, so many of the unintuitive puzzles are solved through trial and error.  This is a very short game but you spend the second half of the game going over areas that were already explored.  The only upside to this game was the voice acting and dialogue.  Both are so bad that you will find yourself chuckling from time to time.  I would recommend this game as a new form of torture but for nothing else.			"

												Less of an adventure where you can exercise you own grey cells to solve the case, this game is sadly a case of very linear (sometimes needlessly frustrating so) of finding puzzle pieces to unlock the next area.

												Yeah, it's tough to review games like this one. Frogwares' first, the game with which they started their succesful SH series, so of some minor ""historical"" value for the genre - and yet a letdown in most ways... Released in 2002, this game looks dated even for that year. Looking around might be smooth, but moving is clunky, and sometimes an exercise in pixel hunting, which is hardly a recommendation... Inventory management is annoying and slow, and (unless I'm mistaken) no usage of keyboard doesn't help.The setting is, yeah, SH meets Egypt (with a bunch of other clichéd influences & touches), quite uninspired, as is, more or less, the story (Doyle was likely turning in his grave because  of this one), along with voice acting, which goes from ""so bad it's good"" to ""meh""... Sherlock himself, apart from being a Frankenstein of Sherlock clichés has ""accent issues"", failing to convince or interest. Music? I was just playing Transport Tycoon Deluxe before this, and the quality is eerily similar at some points... I honestly didn't expect almost midi level music in a commercial (if budget) 2002 game. So, OK, there are all too often great adventure games hidden behind an unimpressive technical side. Is it here too? No. The puzzles are (so far, I only got to the beginning of the 4th chapter) as uninspiring as they can be. Generic slider puzzles? Check. The ""5l and 3l buckets & you need 4l"" puzzle? Check... Illogical / obscure solutions? Check. Poor & simple puzzles have likely been obscured by, in some cases, a complete lack of hints on what you're supposed to achieve, some backtracking, and extreme pixelhunting in a 360 environment, requiring from you, sometimes, to go from place to place and pass your cursor everywhere in hope it changes. And timed puzzles... They are a personal peeve of mine, but they're quite badly and annoyingly exectuted. Like someone figured it was damn too easy on its own, wasn't capable of creating interesting puzzles and just made it harder by making it more annoying.Basically, it's a dated, generic, dull first person adventure game. It's amazing how much Frogwares have grown and improved since then... but this one you should avoid unless you're a completist & hardcore Sherlock Holmes fan.			"

												Oh dear. I picked up this bundle and thought i'd grabbed a pack of intelligent puzzle games that would cause me to stroke my chin and have to think really hard, or at least do a lot of writing down of clues to work things out. Instead, the main difficulty is finding items hidden in obscure places. I believe 'pixel-hunt' is the phrase used. The interface got very annoying, very quicly as both the inventory and just general movement from room to room breaks the immersion. After less then an hour of frustration, the game then crashed following a cutscene. I was expecting Myst. All I got was a mistake. Do. Not. Buy. Half the puzzles revolve getting the bally thing to work in the first place.			"

												This game is not good. The resolution is very low since it's an old game which becomes an issue right from the very first puzzle. This is not meant to be played on modern monitors. Many puzzle solutions are illogical and some even contradict themselves between their clues and their answers. Some puzzles are pure trial and error with no clues at all. Items are located in locations that make no sense. Expect to get stuck at least once in every chapter because you didn't notice a fork or somehow figure out that turning on a ceiling fan (which you won't know you can do unless you stand in a specific spot and look up) will break open a vase with an item inside it. There are also timed sequences where you will probably die over and over wondering what killed you and how to stop it. Sherlock Holmes' voice is annoying. Also slide puzzles. Do not buy.			"

												It really tries to be good, it does. It does admirably well as far as most mouse-click, item-find games go, and the central mystery is decent enough. There's just a few outstanding issues it faces. One, finding the correct items is unbearable, not because of any sense of ingenuity or cleverness, but because the graphics are shoddy, and necessary objects can often times just blend in to their surroundings. Two, once you do manage to claim all the right inventory, what to do with them, and where to put them is painfully simple. Three, while the game is no difficult in the sense that it will not test your mettle, it is needlessly complicated by timed sections and other hoops to jump through that aren't properly explained. This combined with occasional crashes makes forward progress slightly more difficult. Voice acting, sound and pretty much all presentational elements or subpar.Started here as I progress my way through the Frogware Sherlock games. Nowhere to go but up, right?			"

												This game is just not worth playing. Probably only bought in a bundle with the other games, so just skkip this one, as it is the first one released, and move on to 'Silver Earring'.This is an old game, but it really doesn't justify how bad it is. The graphics are old, the animations are clunky, and a scary mummy just ends up looking dumb and funny moving around. The poor graphics also ruins the enjoyment of searching for things. Most of it is pixel hunting, trying to find a hotspot that's a slightly different type of grainy than the place it's at. The game is stuck in window mode.What annoyed me the most is probably the camera angles. When you wanted to get to one part of the room to another, you might have to sidestep to one side, then go to the place you want to go, which makes moving around annoying as you have to search for the right paths. It also sometimes had places to lean down which was I could only find with a guide when it was needed.The game crashes A LOT. Save OFTEN as every time (at least for me) I got to a failstate, it also crashed my game. Which makes the game a bit more realistic than it needs to be. (Also save because there are failstates, even if the game should not crash).Also, Sherlock Holmes speaks with an American accent. Just. Why?Some of the puzzles are decent, but as they are in no way explained what you are even trying to do, it gets frustrating getting a solution. Some of the puzzle solving design is just terrible; at one point you have to 'write' two decently lengthy sentences and you do this by picking the letter up with a mouse, dragging it to the right spot and should you misclick or pick up the wrong letter, you have to start all over again. This puzzle is timed, because of course.Personally I did like the story, but it wasn't good enough to get me to even finish the game. I'm normally a completist, but this just isn't worth it. Look it up on youtube or find some synopsis if you must, but the story is luckily not relevant to the rest of the games, so you should need to to keep playing the rest of the bundle, which is mostly really good.

												This would've felt dated when it was first released.This game commits just about every sin in the point-and-click genre: - pixel hunting (the environments are incredibly grainy / blurred, and on multiple occasions, you are expected to pick out sand and hair pins from what you see)- a poor interface (items taken out of the inventory have to be put back before a new one can be chosen, and the inventory icon is at the edge of the screen, which means you often spin around when trying to access it) - meh voice work (Holmes sounds like a weird British Inspector Gadget, Elizabeth is dozey, and Watson sounds so bad that I thought he was Lestrade at first) - timed, esoteric puzzles (a tile puzzle that requires you to inexplicably make Holmes' profile, and the fact that inventory items have to be combined in a certain order) - a half-baked plot (the start of the game mentions a made-up cousin, and Lord Montcalfe (or Metcalf) who was found burned to death, yet Holmes is called in to investigate the Lord's disappearance).On the plus side, the first time you hear the music, it sounds alright, and some of Holmes' actions are actually given animated cutscenes.Even Hound of the Baskervilles is better than this, and that's saying something.

												It is flawed. For an old game, the least they could do is to improve the graphic texture, it's appalling on high res screens. The other problem is the control. Although it's simply point and click with only your mouse. When you have a high spec pc expect near uncontrollable mouse movement. The pointer moves so fast, it's like you would on FPS you have to be accurate. Moving around the place is frustrating at times when you wish they would just simply have something/anything that gives you quick access to rooms instead of moving you pointer accurately just to click to move. This is compounded by the fact that some levels have a time limit. Imagine that you're in a life/death stage and you need to find objects to save yourself. But the pointer moves so fast, it's terrible that you also have to move you pointer ever so gently just to access the inventory or the menu. Yes, there's no shortcut keys. It's atrocious that while you can't see the item that you're looking for, very well, you need to be accurate. Oh, and there is a puzzle near the end, where you have to be accurate, gently and slowly, but there's a time limit in that entire level! Oh for the love of..! *Breathe*For a point and click adventure game and Sherlock Holmes for that matter; you would think that you would go and find clues and solve mysteries through deduction, not using items just to get you from A to B of clues. It's like playing an escape game.As for the puzzles... What a joke! It's either mind-numbing or pure frustration. I am definitely disappointed, if not by the logic then definitely the requirement of finesse with you hand. Even if you set your mouse speed, it will make a bit of difference, but it will annoy you if it moves too slow for you to move to a different room.For the other aspect of this game. The music is dreary and the voice acting, rubbish! Even some horribly dubbed anime sounded better than this actor voicing Sherlock Holmes. It is an insult to the English character.You're better off just watch the entire game on youtube and then add this game to your category of completed games, because this is simply not worth it no matter the price.

												This game is not a game you'd want to spend $10 on. If it ever goes on special, it's still a questionable game.So, this game was made a long time ago, which explains its quality. So, if you're into classic puzzles with little to no direction to the next part, sure, this is for ye.But if you're like me, and prefer the finer arts of ""Holmes vs. Ripper"", ""Holmes Awakened"" or ""Holmes: Nemesis"", than this is most certainly not for you.Having said that, let's get straight into it.So, apparently your cousin wants you to solve her father's disappearance or something like that.Sounds reasonable, until you find out Watson will not be there to help you.Immediately, I think one of two thoughts:- ""Lazy programmers want to save on character models""- ""Builds suspense with only one character""The main rant is the puzzles.A lot of the time, you will ask yourself ""Great, I've done that part. What now?""And a lot of the time, you will be bumbling around, searching desperately for clues, and then realising in the darkness was a cloth or related object you had to pick up.Even the very first puzzle, I nearly gave up, because the puzzle itself was that hard to find.Navigation is another weird aspect of the game. You click where there is a hand, and you go there.Problem is, I find this restricts a lot of the playability. If I want to walk around a room, I have to find a place where I can go to, the screen changes and I have to shift my screen view to where I wanted to go initially.Basically, really clunky navigation system. It gets better in ""Holmes & the Silver Earring"", but MUCH better in the later games.And sometimes navigation actually becomes a painful, recurring puzzle in itself. Here's an excerpt of my thought process not far from the start of Level 3:""Okay, I've got 2 keys and there's 2 doors. Hm, seems simple enough.""*tries both keys for both doors. None work*""Well, let's take a look around then for more keys...""*finds drawer, requiring 2 keys*""Great, this must be where I put these keys""*tries both keys, fails*""Fine, where is that last key...""*spends half an hour trying to get under a table*""OKAY, I've got 3 keys, and 2 I can use to open the drawer. Sigh""*tries the 2 keys, drawer explodes and I lose the game*Yeah, that death animation doesn't make me feel any better about playing the game.Character development is barely present, since you only ever meet about 3 important characters in the game.A lot of indirect development is through the readings in the game, but it's just banter for the end explanation.Sometimes useful for solving puzzles, though.Interface is awful. I mean, no hotkeys? Come on. I guess for a game of its age, maybe acceptable.But still, I do want to read my clues while in a puzzle.And the voice acting for Holmes sounds like ""an American with his nose blocked"". Maybe it was intended?So, is there anything remotely good about it, in my books?Well, the whiskey object looks like a cheap Jack Daniel's bottle from Google Images.But, I will say the most fun part about the game is going into the Steam files and changing some of the printed dialogue to make Holmes say silly things. It's a text file called 'msg' or something related to 'messages'.So you can make Holmes say ""Ah, nuts. Another lousy puzzle"" or ""WATSON! I NEED YOU! *sobs*"". Good times.Overall, I can only give it a 4/10. Weak, but if you dig this kind of game style, good for you.But It was certainly the worst waste of 10 hours of my time so far.			"

												The graphics are really fuzzy and low resolution, it feels like I'm playing with serious myopia. The rooms are really dark as well and the action areas are tiny. The navigation is also awkward, having to hop between a series of very specific spots along the rooms which are selectable by those tiny action areas. The camera angle is very narrow, it felt claustrophobic. These ""features"" make this as a point and click detective adventure a lot harder than it should be. I stopped playing when I realised it felt more like a chore than any kind of entertainment.EDIT: Oh, and the screen was continuously flickering under Win7 x64, 1680x1050, but this was less annoying than the other things.

It has nothing to do with ""challenge"", as some other reviewers have clamed.  Certain puzzles literally just do not make sense.  Items that are needed to be attained are also not visible at times and you have to mover your mouse over every pixel on the screen, hoping to find it.  All in all, this is a terrible output.  The game creaters failed to realize the overall experience that this game will bring.  It's just not enjoyable and an absolute waste of time and money.

Fortunately there were walkthrough available and I had questionable pleasure to witness how manor turned to House of Usher stealing last of the believalibity from story. Searching the manor and fnding evidence WITHOUT unnecesary secret door etc. puzzles would've been fine with me.

												While this game is not without its faults and it didn't really age well, it's not as bad as the reviews make it look.The basic gameplay is somewhat similar to the classic Myst. You move around between predetermined points in a prerendered 3D environment, interacting with objects and solving puzzles to progress in the story. The graphics and interface are really dated but servicable. My two major complaints are the navigation (the positions you can go to can be disorienting sometimes) and the hyperactive mouse (which is a result of the low resolution on a HD monitor).All in all, it's not the best game ever, maybe not even worth the pricetag, but it was enjoyable for the most part.

												I originally bought this years ago in a Sherlock Holmes collection box (around 2009 I believe) and because it was the first (as in oldest) game in the collection I wanted to give it a go before I replayed The Silver Earring which was I had played before.Imagine my surprise to discover this game to be absolutely drivel compared to the Silver Earring. Being two years older, I expected a few extra ough edges but I did not expect to find a Myst-style game with equally crappy puzzles, graphics that are way worse than what Myst achieved 9years before and a pretty terrible interface to boot.Honestly, I never played it for more than an hour back then either and that's more than enough to make you realize how horrible this game is. This game could have worked a great deal better if they had made a 3D-style free world the way Under A Killing Moon did but considering how poor the presentation, how poor the interface, how poor everything ... you really won't be enticed to invest the time needed to actually play this game.

Clever puzzle, fun adventures, and memorable experience existed among many ledgend. this did not follow any footsteps. The start is decent, but quickly your searching for a elusive hotspot, or trying to figure how to use items in your inventory with action points that don't seem to exist. I understand deductive reasoning. And maybe if you were there you could apply it.  Most people wont enjoy it, but there are a few moments that might make it somewhat enjoyable to the hardcore graphic adventurist or the hardcore sherlock homes follower.

												Like many early 3D games, the game is pretty much unplayable in 2015 without lots of patience and tolerance. Basically, the player clicks around with the mouse to interact with the 3D environment, to turn around, to move. There's no free movement. The greatest challenge of the greatest detective ever is apparently to figure out what the low-resolution graphics are supposed to represent: what of the stuff is actually clickable and what is just some obscure mess. This difference can be found out by panning the mouse on top of everything and seeing if the pointer changes. Its not even clear where you can click to move, without doing this panning. The inventory handling is also terribly clumsy. If this wasn't all, on my Windows 7 the game reliably crashes on each alt-tab.The mystery of the mummy might have been a nice game to play in its time, but because of its technical problems its no use to go to the actual content, and I wouldn't recommend it for the modern age.

												There's plenty to criticise, from the poor writing and even poorer storytelling, to the highly obtuse placement and camouflaging of important items, to the good old-fashioned random game crashes. But perhaps the most annoying problems come about during the only puzzle I liked in the game: the Japanese tile puzzle. While it makes absolutely no sense storywise (which is par for the course in this sort of game), it was the good kind of brain teaser I spent about an hour on and quite enjoyed, but the whole time I had to deal with:*Unweildy mouse control, since I couldn't control graphical settings or mouse sensitivity;*No explanation as to what I was actually meant to do;*Poor feedback from the game to let me know I was on the right track;*The puzzle resetting if you exit out of it; and of course*A countdown timer, because of course.Some things you can try to blame on it being dated, but most of this comes down to lazy design. If you can play this without consulting a walkthrough, you either have WAY too much patience and time on your hands, are psychically linked to the game's designers, or you're lying.			"

												Incessant crashes... outdated gameplay... tediously hidden gameplay elements required to push the plot along... Those things being said, this was the greatest game I've ever played and I would highly recommend it to any prospective buyers. 10/10 would suffer through again			"

												I didn't really enjoy this game much. You don't really solve the mystery yourself. Instead you manouver around a mansion finding items to solve puzzles, until you reach the end where Sherlock explains the solution to the mystery, I found it didn't run that well on my Windows 7 PC either, and I had to look up some technical help to allow me to progress past a certain point.

												Among the worst adventure games I've ever played.  Everything it is possible to do wrong is done here.  I'm glad though that I got all the Sherlock Holmes games together in a pack because they get much better.  And if I had just bought this one alone, I surely would have avoided the rest.			"

												By far the weakest entry in the Frogware Sherlock Holmes games. With the graphics and sound put aside, the major flaw with this game is its controls and puzzles. I wish I can move to any area of the game and the puzzles are either flawed or contain glitches. The description to the story is false, you hardly encounter anyone in the game and the concept of being stalked by a mummy wasn't as exciting or thrilling as expected. It's a real shame cause I love the idea of Sherlock Holmes investigating a missing Egyptologist in a manor while being stalked by a mummy. But Frogware blew it with this poorly made point and click adventure game that will frustrate and anger many gamers. This game is crying for a remake.			"

												This is the worst game that I have ever played in my life.  The puzzles are unnecessary and illogical.  This game causes more frustration than enjoyment.  It has nothing to do with ""challenge"", as some other reviewers have clamed.  Certain puzzles literally just do not make sense.  Items that are needed to be attained are also not visible at times and you have to mover your mouse over every pixel on the screen, hoping to find it.  All in all, this is a terrible output.  The game creaters failed to realize the overall experience that this game will bring.  It's just not enjoyable and an absolute waste of time and money.  I will try out the other Sherlock Holmes games, to see if any of them are an improvement and worth playing.			"

												Dated, as expected. Which is to say, in 2015 there's no reason to play this. The voice acting isn't believable, the plot is a jumbled, half-explained mess, the graphics are ugly, the music is generic. Also the game design is kind of atrocious too. A good chunk of the game is figuring out which random objects you can pick up, and which random spots you can use them in. Some active zones are tiny and a lot of the stuff you need doesn't stand out at all. A random hairpin on the ground? A few select bottles from a wine cellar? Yeah, yep, indeed...There's also timed sequences involving these ""spot the mystery object"" puzzles, which are -great- let me tell you. Not a whole lot, but they're completely out of place. And yes I used a walkthrough, but even that lead to the issue of the game not letting you play in anything but fullscreen. And you have to reload every time you want to check a walkthrough because the game won't load back properly otherwise. Yay, old games...Really there's nothing to recommend about this one, the puzzles are moon-logic or pixel hunts most of the time, story isn't interesting, and it's dated in every other regard. I only got this in a bundle and that's about what it's worth.			"

												Man, I can't turn off the sound through the options menu. Actually, I can't do anything of importance in the menu. The background music is really annoying and the control over Sherlock is clunky. You can't use your desktop and return while playing unless you close the whole game and restart. I had no fun at all. I can't even get myself to like and try this game. Luckily I bought it super cheap with the sale bundle. No recommendation though.			"

The player controls Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's renowned detective Sherlock Holmes, investigating the mysteriously abandoned mansion of British archeologist, Lord Montecalf. It is the first in the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series of adventure games developed by Frogwares and Viva Media.

												As others have said, this is a crappy point'n'click.It's a bit unfair to criticize the visuals considering how insanely fast computer graphics have come in even the last 5 years. That said, this is certainly a game that does not stand up in time. That's what you get with compressed video/images though. Pixelated, artifacted, and more. It looks like utter garbage and makes it that much more difficult to tell where objects or clickable items are.Beyond that, some of the puzzles here are utterly nonsensical. Use a cane to prod open a hunting trophy. Find a fork under the carpet in the middle of a hallway. And the complete pixel-hunting precision that some of these require are beyond frustrating. Why do I need all of the items to begin this puzzle? Why are half of these items so hard to find? The satisfaction of a puzzle game is NOT finding items, it's discovering how to use them. In-addition, this game has a huge problem with crashing, not to mention ways to set you up for failure. I got to a point where I had accidentally saved after a point where I could no longer progress, and the only way to fix it was to go back almost an hours-worth of gameplay to restart it. I say, ""No thank you, I'm good"".I would consider myself a huge fan of puzzle/adventure/point'n'clicks. But god, this one just nails everything that makes this tedious. I can't speak for the rest of the Holmes series, but I would avoid Mystery of the Mummy like one of the seven plagues.			"

												Like other reviewers, this game is a hard recommendation.  Made originally in 2002, The Mystery of the Mummey certainly shows its age.  As a note, the screenshots on Steam show interaction with people, but those shots come from in-game cutscenes.  The control of the game is similar to Myst/Riven, a first person view where your movement is cell based rather than fluid control over your character using directional keys.  The game is essentially a hidden object game which is perfectly fine, but the problem is that because the game is so old, the resolution of the game does not keep up with the times and objects become even harder to find on higher resolution monitors.  Additionally, the game is available in only full screen mode (unless you use DxWnd) so imagine trying to hunt for objects on a wide screen monitor while the game is originally designed for 4:3 ratio and at a lower resolution.  Everything becomes stretched out and pixelated.  These two issued combine makes this hidden object game less pleasant to play. I actually enjoyed a bit of the game but only because I used an online guide every now and then.  The story is mostly told through the pieces of notes found in the levels and cutscenes, and while not very intriguing it kept me interested enough to listen to Holmes thoughts and keep playing.  Puzzles can be very hard due to lack of feedback from the character (and due to the low resolution of the game).  For example, sometimes keys are used to open locks but other times a knife or hairpin can be used instead.  Sherlock Holmes only mentions that its locked, and because it's a hidden object game, it's likely that instead of trying different objects on the lock, backtracking for a missing key will be the first thought instead.  There's not many soundtracks in the game, about one per level, but they were nice to listen to, and while the game is low resolution the environmental design was pretty cool.The last problem is that the game crashes.  I'm able to alt-tab the game with no problem, but whenever the level ends on a cutscene and begins loading the next level, the game crashes.  The only solution I found was to skip the cutscene by rapidly pressing the esc key once it starts, so be sure to look at a guide every now and then to know to save before the level ends.  All in all, it's a hard to recommend this game.  I gave up on the last level due to one puzzle (combined with all of the previous issues mentioned).  It was simply too much.  I can only recommend this to those who are hard core adventurers, but otherwise if you got this game in the Sherlock Holmes Bundle, play a bit and watch the rest of the game online once you get your share of enjoyment and frustration.  If this game was remastered to a much higher resolution, I might give it a shot again.			"

												This game is not a game you'd want to spend $10 on. If it ever goes on special, it's still a questionable game.So, this game was made a long time ago, which explains its quality. So, if you're into classic puzzles with little to no direction to the next part, sure, this is for ye.But if you're like me, and prefer the finer arts of ""Holmes vs. Ripper"", ""Holmes Awakened"" or ""Holmes: Nemesis"", than this is most certainly not for you.Having said that, let's get straight into it.So, apparently your cousin wants you to solve her father's disappearance or something like that.Sounds reasonable, until you find out Watson will not be there to help you.Immediately, I think one of two thoughts:- ""Lazy programmers want to save on character models""- ""Builds suspense with only one character""The main rant is the puzzles.A lot of the time, you will ask yourself ""Great, I've done that part. What now?""And a lot of the time, you will be bumbling around, searching desperately for clues, and then realising in the darkness was a cloth or related object you had to pick up.Even the very first puzzle, I nearly gave up, because the puzzle itself was that hard to find.Navigation is another weird aspect of the game. You click where there is a hand, and you go there.Problem is, I find this restricts a lot of the playability. If I want to walk around a room, I have to find a place where I can go to, the screen changes and I have to shift my screen view to where I wanted to go initially.Basically, really clunky navigation system. It gets better in ""Holmes & the Silver Earring"", but MUCH better in the later games.And sometimes navigation actually becomes a painful, recurring puzzle in itself. Here's an excerpt of my thought process not far from the start of Level 3:""Okay, I've got 2 keys and there's 2 doors. Hm, seems simple enough.""*tries both keys for both doors. None work*""Well, let's take a look around then for more keys...""*finds drawer, requiring 2 keys*""Great, this must be where I put these keys""*tries both keys, fails*""Fine, where is that last key...""*spends half an hour trying to get under a table*""OKAY, I've got 3 keys, and 2 I can use to open the drawer. Sigh""*tries the 2 keys, drawer explodes and I lose the game*Yeah, that death animation doesn't make me feel any better about playing the game.Character development is barely present, since you only ever meet about 3 important characters in the game.A lot of indirect development is through the readings in the game, but it's just banter for the end explanation.Sometimes useful for solving puzzles, though.Interface is awful. I mean, no hotkeys? Come on. I guess for a game of its age, maybe acceptable.But still, I do want to read my clues while in a puzzle.And the voice acting for Holmes sounds like ""an American with his nose blocked"". Maybe it was intended?So, is there anything remotely good about it, in my books?Well, the whiskey object looks like a cheap Jack Daniel's bottle from Google Images.But, I will say the most fun part about the game is going into the Steam files and changing some of the printed dialogue to make Holmes say silly things. It's a text file called 'msg' or something related to 'messages'.So you can make Holmes say ""Ah, nuts. Another lousy puzzle"" or ""WATSON! I NEED YOU! *sobs*"". Good times.Overall, I can only give it a 4/10. Weak, but if you dig this kind of game style, good for you.But It was certainly the worst waste of 10 hours of my time so far.			"

												Wow! This really blew. Like a storm upon a storm. Controls are bad. Interaction is even worse. Age wise it feels like it was developed in 1995 and it's really stuck there. I didn't even get past the lobby. Not for lack of trying, but it's quite annoying when the game mechanism is clunky and then resets when the answer isn't the correct one. This game is a great example of how to make a game that could have been interesting into a hardboiled stone of difficulty. Difficult in the way that it's hard due to really bad controls and not due to smart ingenious quests or puzzels. Sorry. But this game is at best a really bad time vampire.			"

												I wasted and hour of gameplay, because I miseed some ridiculous pixelated pin under the stool in one of the rooms. It was impossible to notice it, due to it's tiny size and high pixelation. It literally was the size of 2 white pixelated dots and was simply unrecognisible from all other pixelated junk on the room's floor. I had to refer to online walkthrough.Also, already, in the first rooom (the hall), high pixelation of textures made it very hard to correctly read out the number on plaques, hence to find correct hints.

												This is the first game in Frogwares' long-running and successful Sherlock Holmes series, but it is definitely the black sheep. Horrific voice acting, terrible controls and pixel-hunting puzzles mar what is otherwise a worthwhile experience. The game only took 6 hours to complete, and uses point and click mechanics for every aspect of the game, including moving. This is easy to get used to but gets very annoying after a while. The puzzles are so ridiculous that an FAQ is pretty much a requirement for a first-time playthrough.I wasn't joking about the voice acting either, its awful. The whole cast sounds like it can't decide whether it's American or British. The other games in this series do a much better job at pretty much everything. However, if you have played the other games in the series it's a no-brainer because it's free!			"
