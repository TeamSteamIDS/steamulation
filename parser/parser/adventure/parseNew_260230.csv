												An extremely amazing game truly unlike anything I've ever played before.  Valiant Hearts adds a human element to the game that is missing from a lot of these war games that we see and is a fresh break from the whole ""Kill kill kill"" mindset you need for those games.  The majority of Valiant Hearts is done through puzzles.  The player needs to find ways to navigate around in the game, and do it by using their smarts rather than their trigger fingers.  There are indeed parts where you do attack the enemies (you have to so they don't detect you and end the game), so it isn't just puzzles.  Each of the characters are very likable and have their own unique stories, motivations, and reasons for getting involved in ""The Great War"" - and the best part is that those reasons, like these characters, are all believable.  Valiant Hearts also does well in capturing the nightmare that was World War I, and does it without graphic depictions of blood, gore and violence that is prevalent in games set in war.  In the final chapter of this game the full scope of exactly how brutal and bloody this whole sordid affair was becomes obvious (there is a part where you have to take cover from machine gun fire by hiding behind solid cover- a few piles of dead soldiers are used this way at one point).  There are also many very interesting facts this game presents about WWI that most players may not have known, so history buffs and fact lovers are going to be in for some good info.  In my opinion, it is not only good to see a game that is set in WWI when most game studios seem to prefer WWII (perhaps it is because of the ""noble cause"" of the allies in that conflict), but Valliant Hearts takes both an unflinching and unapologetic look at the first World War and presents something as vile as trench warfare in a manner that is much more palatable than a shoot 'em up sort of game would have been.Just a heads up, though: Valiant Hearts FORCES you to download and install UPlay.  This is a fact that is not READILY visible on the store page unless you have enhanced Steam (which I do not).  While that fact may not have prevented me from getting this game, I just don't want to HAVE to download a new DRM console every time I get a new game from a different publisher.			"

												  I reccommend buying this game for its beautiful story and amazing soundtrack. The puzzles are quite intelligent and really interesting to solve. I would recommend getting a box of tissues and an empty bucket alongside with the game. You'll cry... It's okay to cry.Cons:-Uplay-Uplay-Uplay			"

												I bought this game expecting it to be a quick play with a focus on an artistic art style that only an art snob would like. I couldn't have been more wrong.The game will last you about 5-6 hours, which is well worth the normal $15 that this game goes for. If you see this on sale for any less, buy it instantly.The game is simple to learn, with challenges that will stretch your brain, but once you figure them out you'll think ""My god, I'm an idiot"".The story of this game is the main thing that will keep you playing this game. You easily get attatched to the charecters. They will make you laugh, cry, worry, smile, and laugh out loud. There are plenty of plot twists to keep things interesting, but not so many that the story is hard to follow.The game displays plenty of historical facts about the time period, and place, that you are playing in the game. While you are motly never directly tied to the events except for a few level designs, it was refreshing to get some background information about the world, and the war, while you go through it.TL;DR version+great story+great characters and development+simple, yet challenging missions+realitvely cheap for what you're getting out of it+The BEST intergration with music that I have ever seen in a video game-first time I've cried over a video game since Mass Effect 3's revamped endings "

												Simply put, Valiant Hearts is a fantastic game. It's mix of simple yet interesting puzzling and storytelling, combined with its gorgeous visuals make a game well worth it's price. While the driving scenes act like a rhythm game, trying to dodge various things popping up on your screen, they don't distract from the overall game. The story of the first world war is somewhat simpled down to make a game that could be played by a young child, perhaps to teach them about the war. However, the diary and history facts littered throughout the game allow you to delve into the history and the story of WWI.Your faithful canine companion gives some depth to the puzzles, and also a character to feel for and love. Even though the characters themselves aren't developed massively, you can connect with them on a personal level. Overall, Valiant Hearts gets an 8/10.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great Wars tells you the story of 4 different characters where destiny brought them together. As soon you start the game the first thing you will notice is the simple yet very creative art-style from the world during dark times. With brights colors and a very warm design, soon you find that while the cartoon style may try to tone down some aspects of the true events of war, the pages of the Diaries as well the photographies from these past events may hit you. I dare to say that, depending on your sensitivity one or two can actually make you feel uncomfortable, but war never was a pleasing sight to start.The soundtrack is quite simple but it’s strong enough to make a nice companion here and there or even on those tiny bits when you find a solution to a puzzle or when are about to discover something related to the main plot. You can expect one or two plot twists but it’s nothing serious, yet, the story managed to keep me hooked until the very end. I simply couldn’t stop until I found out what happened to them, and I’m glad for being able to experience this game from start to finish without feeling any sort of boredom. There was however, some emotions which brings the next point.The game may offer a big contrast depending on who is playing and how someone plays a game. If you play for a mere completionist purpose or because you simply like to play videogames, you will find a 6-8 hours long depending on how much time you take to discover the solutions to the puzzles or if you are interested in collecting every hidden object. However, this game offers much, much more depth. It’s clear that the creators did their homework and worked hard to deliver great content for those interested in the culture of war. The “Facts” are filled with a variety of knowledge from all sorts of equipment, weapons, special events, conditions from the soldiers such diseases and locations where this war took place. Since a little bit of knowledge is always welcome I found this to be a satisfying surprise to see in a 2D game. Then there is the immersion. I felt for it and I’m glad I did. By letting myself ""fall"" into the game I could enjoy the Story as it might be intended by the creators. A warm hearth will love the constant ups and downs that the player will experience. This game did not made me laugh, but it did made me smile quite sometimes and while It didn’t made me cry, it made me a bit emocional because they created a story showing the horrors of war, where when you are faced with a bit of hope, it quickly dies and you are in deep trouble yet again. It’s not a fair story, there are no heroes, there is no right or wrong, only wrong because this game showed how pointless and destructive is the war. The letters who are based from real ones, written by the people back then showed how the quick turn of events made regular people into soldiers and how bonds like family and brotherhood can play a decisive role during such times. I honestly hope anyone can play this game with a open heart and look at it as a mean, cruel time-machine who let you experience a tale of the horrors that happened during war and how love can patch a wound, offer hope or give the only strength to sustain such adversities when all seems lost and pointless.

												One of the best all around adventure story games released in the last few years. A mix of a beautifully composed musical score, stellar artwork, great story, impressive puzzles, and real life historical content. This game actually made me think about the collectibles and ponder the historical facts as much as I did the story at times. Set during World War I (The Great War), Valiant Hearts gives you a look at individuals in war and how this particular group of individuals finds themselves connected. A German man married to a French woman who is forced to go back to Germany and fight. His father-in-law forced to fight for France. An American who befriends the Frenchman. A female doctor that finds herself crossing paths with all of them. Then there is Walt, the war dog, who becomes their ally, friend, and savior at times. While they all may battle for different reasons, countries, or leaders, they all care for one another. They all find ways to help one another overcome struggles, support one another in troubles, and connect to one another as humans rather than enemies. While the art style is cartoonish, you feel immersed with its very stylized and life-like animation. Faces and body language are done well so that you can see the story without having to hear dialogue. Even most of the speech bubbles are only pictures to give you clues as to how to solve the puzzles, or where you should go. The puzzles that are incorporated into the gameplay are interesting and clever at times. They aren't overly difficult, but a few make you feel like you figured something clever out. They are easy enough to keep frustration low and you focused on the story. Besides puzzles there are quite a few action sequences. This makes the genre tip a bit away from a point and click adventure as it would seem from the outside. These action sequences aren't hardcore fighting, or anything extremely daunting, but there is a lot of interacting with objects and other people in the game to push it away from a traditional puzzle solving adventure game. You even have a pet dog named Walt that you can have fetch you items, pull levers that you can't do, or have him distract an enemy while you slip in and steal something you need. It adds a nice change to just simply having to solve puzzles in the old fashioned way. You can actually die in the game as well, although it is only about 2 seconds of time lost if you do. Dodging bombs, bullets, and even driving sequences become part of some action sequences that keeps you on your toes and gives certain battle heavy chapters more immersion. Then there is what many may feel is annoying, the doctor rhythm quick time event sequences. They aren't difficult to pass, but can seem annoying to some with slow reactions. Within the game there are dozens of collectible items that are some of the best collectibles for any game I have ever played. Each chapter has 4-6 of them where you must find items that are pieces of war memorabilia. You will find things from war helmets, dog tags, items that soldiers made themselves to pass time, and even things like bars of soap. Each items carries with it an explanation of its historical uses in the war. You will see some very interesting and thought provoking items here. Sometimes you will find old letters from soldiers to family, or wives. Everything is quite interesting and adds a lot to the overall feel of the time period and the war. Some of these items are even from contest winners who shared things their ancestors had with them during The Great War and were used in the game. All of these are materials and collectibles you will want to read, and find not for some Achievement and completionist ideal, but because they are just that interesting that you want to see what their story is. They put a human face on the war with a bit of a shared humanity and recognition. They make you consider what it was like to be a soldier based on the things they carried, and this is why they are such a great addition. These are items that we can understand because they are simple and we can put them into the context of how they were used while in the battlefield.On top of all these collectible items you get historical data that will explain the real life battles that you are playing in the game, talk about all aspects of war from the economics, farming, civilian life, military police, and many, many others. All this additional material is fascinating and a phenomenal addition to the game. Some of these items, or histories had me pondering war and just how horrible it must have been as a soldier in these battles. Trench warfare, the weather, barbed wire, the mud. Even the idea that they were fighting in mines underground where enemies would set explosives below them to have them crushed. They really tried to give you a sense of the reality of it in this material. Valiant Hearts is a complete adventure game that excels in all areas. It is a polished experience with lovely art, a soundtrack worthy of separate purchase, and a “feels” story. It has some of the best collectibles and supporting material of any game I have played.  I would recommend this game to any fan of story games. Especially those of you that like to feel some emotion. Point and click gamers should be fine with it, but realize that there will be some action sequences that you may get a bit frustrated with if you don’t have OK reflexes, but I would still give it a chance because it is worth it. Included are 3 card drops. There are NO Steam Achievements in the game because...this is a uPlay game. It does have uPlay Achievements, but who cares about those. uPlay I had to go online just to paste the CD key in after I bought it, then I put it in offline mode immediately and never had to go back online. The game will start from your Steam Library, although it will launch uPlay before running the game every time. Since I already have about 5 uPlay games I have no issues with it. If you do then either buy it on a console, directly from uPlay, or don't buy it at all. Your loss. ;)			"

												The game is by Ubisoft, so you'll have to have a Uplay account in order to play the game.  A bit of a pain, but worth it if you love a good story!The screen resolution is adjustable anywhere from 640x480 through 1980x1020, and you can play Windowed if you wish.  We have separate sliders for sound effects, music, and brightness, and if you want subtitles, they are NOT the default.  Luckily you can adjust the settings at any time.  If you're using the keyboard you can rebind the keys to whatever you wish, but the controller buttons are not adjustable.  Speaking of which, we have full-controller support on this title.The game is rich in history, though dosed out in segments small enough to keep one from getting overwhelmed (or bored ^_~ ) if not a history buff.  These tidbits are easily accessible, and while it's not required reading, it surely enriches the story!  In addition to the facts that are unlocked as you play, there are 100 collectibles, and each has its own story to tell.  We also have a diary with separate entries, which I didn't realize until later on in the game.  The diary, like the hints, is accessible through the game menu (hit Esc.)Speaking of hints, there are multiple modes of play -- regular and veteran.  I believe you have to complete regular mode before you can access veteran mode, however.  Hints, if you wish to use them, are tiered, and give you a picture of one of the steps you'll need to take to progress in the game.We play as multiple characters, giving us varied views of the war and its toll.  These characters' stories are beautifully weaved together in a touching story.  The gameplay is a combination of point-and-click, puzzles, light platforming, and arcade-like action scenes.  Anyone looking for a thrilling ride, rife with action and glory might want to look elsewhere, as the compelling story is the driving force behind this game, and it's the story that will keep bringing you back to the game.  The narrator will explain things as we transition, and his voice works beautifully with the story.  Our characters' voices, on the other hand, are intentionally garbled -- you don't actually need to understand what they're saying.  It may sound strange, but it really does work well.  Any person you see who has ' . . . ' over their heads means you need to ""talk"" to them.  You will see what they want or need via images in speech bubbles.  It's not terribly hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing -- most of the time when I was stuck it was because I had missed seeing an exit or some such. :p  I highly highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, with one caveat:  Some of the action scenes need to have quick reactions, and I know that some of my friends have issues with this kind of thing.  Let me give you an example.  This will not be a spoiler as long as you don't watch the whole video -- Just watch the first ten seconds or so:


YouTube™ Video: Valiant Hearts: The Great War - Anna (#6) 

			Views: 63,955		

			Kim plays Valiant Hearts: The Great War, a beautiful videogame developed by Ubisoft to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of World War I. In today's episode, we help Anna heal the sick and wounded.		

I had to redo the above-referenced kind of scene more than once, but that is not the part of the game I'm worried about.  There are sequences where you have to press buttons quickly in succession, switching around between buttons, and sometimes hitting more than once button at a time.  I don't know how well I would have done if I'd been on the keyboard instead of a controller!  I can't give you a visual of what I'm talking about without potentially spoiling some of the story, just be warned!I finished the game in somewhere between four and five hours -- not really certain since I got interrupted a few times.  Remember those collectibles I mentioned at the beginning of the review?  It turns out that you can replay any part of the game you wish in order to gather all of the collectibles!  Go to the Chapters & Collection section of the main menu, and you will be able to see how many items you gathered, and how many you missed for each section.  Personally I think it would be better to go back to get some of these rather than grab them as you play, as sometimes they're sitting out in the open during a time when you could easily get killed!  It interrupts the flow of the story a bit to stop and examine these things during the action sequences.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a moving journey that kept me guessing 'til the end, and had me happily learning about the first World War (history is NOT my forte).  I really did love playing this game, and recommend checking it out if the above review appeals to you.			"

												Valiant Hearts is a puzzle-platforming game with a rather unique subject matter: World War I. Instead of shooting waves of enemies or commanding massive faceless armies as is the usual in most war games, Valiant Hearts instead decides to focus on the lives of several characters with WWI merely serving as the backdrop that changes their lives forever. The main cast of characters are Emile, a Frenchman getting on in his years who is conscripted into service despite his age; Karl, a German living in France who is married to Emile's daughter Marie; Freddie, an African American Creole who enlisted in the French military to avenge a loved one; Anna, a Belgian field medic who's father designs weapons for the Germans; and Marie, the daughter of Emile and wife of Karl who struggles to maintain her family farm as the war escalates. This game is first and foremost about its story. Not just the written story per se; in fact there is very little spoken dialogue that isn't from the interlevel narrations and most of the in game diction is handled through speech bubbes with cartoonish graphics inside them along with body gestures. Rather, this game is about story in a much deeper and meaningful way, its about how these characters as well as the minor and even nameless NPCs are shaped and affected by the terrible war around them. It says so much with very little, letting the emotions and feelings of the situation grab ahold of you and fill it in itself. There's no egregious monologues or exposition or self-indulgent angst; just pure humanity in all of its forms, and it touches you in a very personal way because you really feel for what these characters are going through.Now the game itself, as a game, is nothing too terrilbly spectacular: it is about a 10 or so hour game given or take a few more for finding all of the hidden items (it can't be an Ubisoft game without a hundred odd pickups, could it?) with basic sidescrolling and controls. You move left and right, can climb over ledges and sneak behind cover when permitted, perform context specific actions as well as character specific ones (such as using Emile's shovel to dig through tunnels), all while solving modest item based puzzles where you pull levels and turn wheels and blow up walls or unlock doors. It is honestly nothing groundbreaking or new, and the puzzle solving is broken up with a handful of obstacle course style driving levels (which are my personal favorite) and the occasional quicktime event. Nothing about the gameplay is truly spectacular, but it is adequate enough to serve its purpose and keep you interested in progressing.However, while the gameplay might be standard fare, everything else does truly stand out. Along with the story, the game has a beautifully composed original soundtrack, as well as a few classical bits too (Brahms's Hungarian Dance no. 5, the French Cancan, Flight of the Bumblebee, and Night on Bald Mountain all play during the various driving segments). The art direction is simplistic and charming, but deceptively dark and grim when it needs to be (and given the subject matter, that is often). Backgrounds are beautifully illustrated and detailed, and character animations are smooth and well made. There are collectibles as said before, over 100 items spread throughout most of the game's 20+ levels which are divided into four chapters. These items are all historically researched and finding them adds an entry to the in-game ""Wiki"" describing what it is, what it was for, and why it came to be during WWI. There is also more history to be found every level with short articles about what is relevent to the current level: be it a battlefield history, an elaboration on colonial army units, or chemical warfare. The game goes the extra mile to really help you feel what it was like to live during this time and in turn that helps you better associate with the characters in the story.Ultimately, Valiant Hearts is a simplistic and unassuming puzzle sidescroller that has a LOT of heart and soul in it. Beyond the so-so gameplay is a gripping and upsetting tale of one the 20th century's greatest catastrophes, uncensored and unabashed in a beautiful package that serves to keep the past alive and help us never forget the tragedies that were had. Forgive the underwhelming gameplay and let everything else engross you and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I have. It is a work of art.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a puzzle adventure game, developed and published by Ubisoft, being released in 2014, on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One, and with a further port to Android and IOS. Valiant Hearts is also made by the same team that developed another original IP from Ubisoft, Child of Light. Gameplay wise, whilst this is a puzzle adventure game, there are no really generic puzzles, and they are only puzzles if you think about it specifically when you are playing. The game takes place during ""The Great War"", and you play the role of a couple of different characters throughout the story, an American soldier named Freddie, a Belgian Nurse named Anna, a Frenchman named Emile, and his German son-in-law, Karl. All four of these characters have their own story and all cross paths throughout the game.  At the core, the game is a side scrolling adventure game, as you have to either find certain items to progress, solve puzzles or defeat bosses. A lot of the game is also revolved around avoiding fire fights with enemies, so using bunkers and trenches to avoid fire is also something you should get used to.  Each of the characters also has their own special ability. Anna is able to heal patients via a quick time event; Freddie is able to cut through barbed wire, whilst Emile has a spade which allows him to dig tunnels in the ground to get around certain obstacles. The graphics in Valiant Hearts are very nice. Whilst they are not high quality ultra-realistic, they do present a nicely drawn out look to the game. These are some of the best 2D graphics I have seen in a game and they really fit the setting well.Valiant Hearts also has one of the most compelling and interesting stories to be seen in a very long time too. As you play as all four main characters, you learn about their history and how the war is affecting their lives, more than the expected misery. This game will pull on your heart strings and may even bring a tear to your eye at parts. You get attached to all of the characters instantly and will be immersed completely into its world. This is another game that has a major role in it for a narrator, and most of the story is told through his voice. The main characters in the game, whilst they do speak, they don't speak very much. The story is mostly told through their facial expressions and the narration. The rest of the sound effects are really good too, there are plenty of ambient sounds in each level to really draw you further into the immersion to make you feel like you are actually there in the trenches. A couple of the levels also have some classic musical sound tracks, such as the can-can when you are escaping Paris as Anna. Valiant Hearts is not a difficult game to complete; all of the puzzles are easy enough that you can work them out without much effort, but not so easy that you can breeze through without any thinking involved. Sometimes the most difficult aspect of the game can be when you are trying to maybe go a little bit too quick for yourself and end up running into bullets when you should really be taking it a little bit slower and hiding in cover. I think if the game had incorporated puzzles which were too difficult, that it may have ruined the immersion of the game if it forced you to look up guides to progress. The fact that even I (someone who is horrendous at puzzle games) was able to finish the game without a walkthrough just shows how easy the game can be. This games levels are so widely explorable, and there is so much to find and interact with too. You can get some form of dialog out of the majority of the other characters in game, but nothing more than maybe a few special grunts, or speech bubbles with pictures in, which maybe a clue of some form for your puzzle, or something completely unrelated. Each level also has a couple of hidden objects which you can set out to find, these bear no influence on the game play, and are merely there for the complentionists. Valiant Hearts is split into four chapters, and a full play through of all four chapters took me just under ten hours, for me that is the absolute perfect length for any story driven game, as it allows all of the loose ends to be tied up sufficiently and still leaves you wanting just that little bit more. There are achievements in the game, but are not linked to Steam since this uses uPlay, but you can go off hunting for them too. There is however no reason to play it through for a second time, the story is linear and will not change in anyway depending on how you play. I didn't have any technical problems whilst playing. The game has full controller support, but also works perfectly well with a keyboard and mouse. I personally went with the controller just for the ease of being able to sit back in my chair and enjoy the story. The game did not drop below 60 fps at any point and has a really nicely built in auto save feature too. Some people may be put off with the need for uPlay to play, however it's not exactly like its intrusive when you are playing, and it’s simply not a major problem; so please don't be put off by the DRM on the game.I loved this game, it was one of the few games I was able to get fully immersed into and played it from start to finish in one day - I just had to find out the ending of all the characters.

												Get the tissues ready, this game is a true tearjerker.  Probably one of the biggest suprises of 2014 for myself, I had only first heard of and seen this game during the trailer that was shown during E3.  Even during that time I had no idea how the game would play, but the interesting visual artstyle caught my eye.  I played the game over a course of 4 days (1 chapter a day) and it played out well as each Chapter was broken into 6-7 sections each that would have you switching over the course of 4 characters, telling how their stories interweave with each other in a war ravaged time.The game itself plays like many adventures games before it where you are tasked to use the enviroment and items around you in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game.  I just felt something special about how they mixed the gameplay perfectly with the art sometimes during what you would think are cutscenes, are scenes you are actually playing yourself.  Another surprise for me was how well they had woven the boss battles into the game, with each chapter having at least 1.  In between the chapters where you are solving puzzles, you also have fun minigames that also fit perfect with the story being told, whether it's you being a medic and having to time presses to keep someones heart going so they don't die, or driving away from a whole bunch of bombs in a car minigame that actually goes along to the rhythm of the music.  Just pure amazement all around for a game that I thought would be more just a story with a few interactive moments.  There are even items to collect for those that wish to truly investigate each part of the world (I ended up with 82/100 collectibles) and each collectible has it's own history and write up in the menu section.This brings me to the story of the game.  It's really hard to say much without spoiling anything in the game.  It's about 4 different lives all from different countries affected by the war, and their tale of hardship and friendship.  The story will have it's high happy notes, but also very low times once the game is reaching it's conclusion.  The ending of all things is what got me the most.  Those who have finished it know what I mean, but just the fact that the finale is playable just adds that much more emotion to it.  Also <3 DoggieThe game is done all the better by a amazing soundtrack, and the shining gem of Ubisoft, the UbiART engine.  What you see in the screenshots on this steam store page are all actual playable portions in the game.  The animation is just done so perfectly, and a game where the art can be so bright, vibrant and colorful is also to display huge emotions of despair and sorrow within the actual images itself.  In fact most of the story of Valiant Hearts is told through it's art, and the short narration sequences at the beginning of each level. The characters themselves do say words in their native languages, but it's usually simple commands or just them being relieved, but they leave the storytelling up to the brilliance of the UbiART engine.Honestly this is my favorite game to have been released so far in 2014, and was a huge surpirse to me as I don't have much experience with Adventure games in the first place and didn't expect to fall in love with this game as much as I did.

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ is absolutely amazing!The story is based on the first world war told by an awesome voice acting storyteller. You gonna play alot of different characters in the game but all of them are well connected with the main story. Basically the story is about Karl finding a way back to his family after he got separated and deported to serve the german army. To me the game tells and teach much more than that Valiant Hearts made me realize once more how important family  and true friends are. It also shows how  unnecessary war is you are just a fighting slave fighting for other people interests, killing people who never wanted any war, people like yourself, people you would probably consider as friendly or even your friend. Beside from that the game is a little history lesson you can find a lot of facts happend during the first world war. The gameplay is quit simple for a puzzle adventure game at the same time well conceived. It force you to think without being unfair or unnecessary hard. For myself I can say the gameplay was entertaining from beginning to end. Who ever was responsible for the design of the game made a great job the levels are lovely created. One more point I wanna mention is the wonderful music fits perfectly to the atmosphare. You gonna be golden with Valiant Hearts: The Great War™  if you looking for a game with a good story and fun gameplay.			"

												-SPOILER FREE-Without a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played. The graphic style is cartoony but the story and theme are deep and touching. The puzzles were great, gameplay was fun... and all the while, the story moved you. I don't even know how to really recommend this game other than: play it. It's an amazing experience.If you've played the game and you're here to read other people's thoughts, read on. Otherwise, be warned, there are **SPOILERS** from here on out.-REVIEW WITH SPOILERS-Valiant Hearts is now among my top games. I'm not going to say it's a perfect game: it's not. But for me it was an amazing experience.The graphics of the game might turn some people off... You know, the people who want realism all the time and want life-like HD textures. Well, VH is one of those games that prove realism isn't everything. I loved the art style of this game. It does what it needs to do: It's attractive, appealing, yet clear. It artistic enough to be pretty and illustrate what's going on but simple enough to keep the focus on the story.Same with the game play. It's not overly difficult but entertaining enough to keep you playing and interested; and simple enough to keep the focus on the story. Most puzzles in the game are fairly straight forward. Yet I still got that little feeling of accomplishment as I solved them and moved forward. The more action packed parts of the game also served their function well. There is obviously no emulating the feel of actually being in the battle field and having bombs raining down on you nor is that the game's purpose. It strives to ride that balance between showing the player a bit of chaos and still keeping it fun. For me, it achieved that balance. The digging part with Emile near the end is a great example. It was hectic with the cacophony of explosions in your ear, new bombs appearing out of no where, and realizing that you need to go as fast as you can or you're not going to make it. I failed a couple times... and that's when you have a little voice in the back of your mind saying, ""You get another chance but this kind of stuff really happened to real people and they only got one try. Failure was fatal."" Fatalities of war... so easily accepted by the ""higher powers"" yet so devastating on an individual level. The story of the game is really its best part. Each character shows the different kinds of people in the war: farmers and fathers who wanted nothing to do with the war; the nurses who had a never ending job to do; and the people with real anger in their hearts. The plot wasn't ground breaking. It had lots of cliches and was a little predictable but that wasn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I feel like these people's stories were meant to be a little more wide angled and ""general"" because that's who they represent... people like them in general. It's predictable and cliche to us precisely because the kind of stuff that's happened to them in the game have really happened in real life and we've already heard so much about it. I feel like the little touches the devs put in really helped this game feel like a piece of art. It was a very good decision on their part to have the player decide whether Emile kills that officer or not. Clearly, there was no real choice. We can all recognize that it would be wrong to send out a man into certain death for no reason like the officer did. The fact that you're the one pressing that button makes you feel complicit in Emile's action. I used to be against that kind of thinking for video games really... and I still am for the most part. If I have to kill some guy to progress in a game, I'm generally NOT going to feel bad about it. It's a GAME. But the fact that the situation they created here evoked a feeling of helplessness out of me speaks volumes. That's what art does; it evokes emotion.Don't even get me started on the end. You may or may not have noticed from the video but it is the player who has to walk Emile all the way out to the shooting post. YOU are the one marching Emile to his death and there's absolutely no choice about it. The decision has been made already by those in power. I tried to hide it in the video but I'll be honest here: I cried. It's why I didn't really give any good analysis in the credits. I was still trying to deal with the emotions. It wasn't sad just because Emile died. It was sad because it was so unfair. He didn't mean to kill the officer; he just wanted to stop another man from being killed. It was also doubly emotional because I pressed that button to make Emile do that. I didn't even need to see whether the game wouldn't let me progress without doing that. I knew what I had to do, and I did. I expected it only to knock him out but that's what Emile thought too. And so, Emile has to die. It was also an interesting contrast of endings. On one hand you're happy that Karl is reunited with his family... then they throw Emile's death at you. You watch the credits thinking it's over but then you see Freddy, clearly about to participate in further battles. There's no end to these war stories. They go on and on.			"

												In the First World War, tens of thousands of dogs were tasked with transporting equipment and locating explosives, among other, very important duties. Yet arguably their most significant role was to comfort soldiers who knew that they could be weeks, days, even hours away from death. Between 1914 and 1918, the bloodshed across Europe was like nothing seen before, and Valiant Hearts: The Great War tells this story to a new generation, in a way we haven’t seen any video game do before.Emile, Karl, Freddie and Anna are four regular people who come across each other at different stages during The Great War. While they’re fictional, it’s clear they’re all inspired by people who lived through this four year span – normal people, thrown into an extraordinary situation that they must adapt to. All of their individual stories intersect at different junctures as they help one another deal with the atrocities of war. For example, Emile was a farmer from Saint Mihiel in France, until conscription forced him to join the French forces only days after the war broke out. It was on this farm where German-born Karl met Emile’s daughter Marie and started a courtship which resulted in their son being born. War is the backdrop for this story of human struggle and heartache, which is communicated through beautifully narrated letters sent home from the trenches.While telling an exquisite story, Valiant Hearts is a puzzler that will initially not test your logical thinking but, as it progresses, will pose a slightly tougher challenge thanks to larger levels. They’re never too taxing, though some of the latter puzzles can be quite clever. But those looking to be truly challenged will need to find their kicks elsewhere, as they do merely act as a means to advance the plot.However, the glue that holds everything together is Walt. Raised to serve the German army, Walt the dog goes from character to character throughout and offers a childlike view on proceedings due to his almost always chirpy demeanour. When the world is crumbling down around the four protagonists, Walt is there, and for one fleeting moment he can melt their hearts and, subsequently, yours. Your canine companion is also a capable one, as he’s helpful when it comes to solving some quandaries. By holding one of the shoulder buttons and hitting one of the face buttons, you can command Walt to interact with levers or distract guards, for example – an advantage that’s especially useful in some of the stealth sections.And that’s one of the wonderful things about Valiant Hearts – it tries its hand at integrating a number of genres and, for the most part, succeeds. In one outside area, you are trying to stay hidden from a legion of soldiers with searchlights and a desire to see you captured. In order to pass them unscathed, you have to shield yourself from their glaring eyes by strategically moving with a flock of sheep that appear to be aimlessly toing and froing in a field.Another example of Ubisoft Montpellier’s diversity are the stages where you are behind the wheel of a car and have to avoid the onslaught of your adversaries. As they are attacking you with a barrage of weaponry, they are doing so in time to the music. As the crash cymbal hits, a bomb that was headed your way will connect with the ground – as long as you were able to avoid it, of course. These inclusions are a fresh change of pace for Valiant Hearts and are far superior to Anna’s medic-focused gameplay.When controlling the Belgian-native, you’ll be able to patch up some of the officers that need immediate attention. A rolling line, similar to that in an ECG, will appear at the top of the screen and at random intervals, the wave will deviate from the norm with a sudden peak and valley. When this occurs, you’ll be instructed to press one or two of the face buttons at the same time in order to tend to your patient. Boring is the best way to describe this little mini-game as it rarely poses any form of challenge, and is a distraction from the touching story and more enjoyable gameplay offerings.That touching story is marvelously accompanied by some graceful piano arrangements that capture the mood perfectly. Whether a troop of blood-thirsty young men are hurtling toward the enemy, or someone close has died at the hands of your foes, the score compliments it. Without this mesmeric music, The Great War’s more emotional beats wouldn’t have half the emotional impact. The same can be said for the art style. The UbiArt engine has been used in a number of titles, but none as dark as Valiant Hearts. This interactive cartoon contains tragic events from a time period that we’ve rarely seen tackled in recent years, and that dichotomy is brilliantly unsettling. The harrowing scenes at Verdun and Ypres are the ultimate contrast to the comic book-like appearance.Thankfully, Ubisoft’s research is impeccable and their eagerness to document World War I correctly is evident. When in a new area, there will be an on-screen prompt which allows you to indulge in some historical facts and this is where you can see the work that has been put in to make Valiant Hearts a piece of art, faithful to the time period. We’re all aware that collectibles can be superfluous from time-to-time, and they aren’t integral to the main narrative here, but they add some more context to what the soldiers, nurses, civilians, et al, were going through at this time. It’s both terribly interesting and deeply saddening, reading up on the events that took place during The Great War.All entertainment media has a tendency to glorify war and games are no different. On most occasions, we select our loadout and happily headshot anything with a pulse. Valiant Hearts tackles the harsh realities of what this war did to regular families. It tore people apart and, conversely, brought strangers closer together. It’s a beautiful tale of love and woe, with a consideration for the chilling realism of war. History may be in the past, but it should never be forgotten, for the people affected truly were Valiant Hearts.			"

Valiant Hearts: a tribute to human compassion in harsh timesSo much has already been written on Valiant Hearts: The Great War that it seems almost redundant to add yet another glowing review admiring all the things this game does so well. Situated in the First World War, Valiant Hearts is at heart a 2D side-scrolling adventure game with quite some puzzles added into the mix. While the gameplay itself is top-notch on its own (controlling the different characters is a breeze and solving the puzzles offers a decent but surely not too steep challenge), the true genius of the game lies in the way the story conveys all the emotions that can be linked to a catastrophic event such as the First World War.The story tells in a gripping way the effect of the ware on four characters: a French soldier Emile, a German soldier Karl (the son-in-law of Emile, which offers a lot of possibilities for the story-writers), an American volunteer Freddie who gets befriended with Emile and a Belgian nurse, Anna, who tries to help and comfort as many wounded a possible, without looking if they are friend or foe. The game surely is not ""heroic"" in any sense: it's not the (often false) heroism of the war that stands in the spotlight, but rather the life of different ""ordinary"" people who try to survive amidst the carnage. If there is one theme that stands out, it's that of human compassion even in such horrible circumstances: not only does the nurse tend to all soldiers she meets, the familial relationship between Emile and Karl puts the French-German conflict in a completely different light. The unexpected but true friendship between Emile and Freddie offers yet another layer of interaction. Furthermore, on several occasions there are situations in which soldiers of the different armies help each other out rather than blindly slaughtering their enemies. You even get a dog as a companion, who helps out on many occasions and is often the key to solving a puzzle.The story is told both during the actual gameplay and in different scenes between the chapters and portions of the game, and it turns out to be a true rollercoaster of emotions with a gripping, desolate end. It is rare for a game to move the player into tears, but Valiant Hearts managed to do so on more than one occasion. I truly felt emotionally shattered once the game had ended. Ubisoft Montpellier also went to great pains to provide a lot of historical background on the First World War, and it manages to do so without giving the impression one is playing a mainly educational game. It was a very smart move to introduce ""collectibles"" throughout the game, which add a lot of information about daily life during the war and which can be picked up during actual gameplay. Together with the diaries of the protagonists and the historical facts which unlock when the game progresses, one gets a ton of interesting information.There really is no reason not to try and probably love this game. I know that it is a Ubisoft game and that it forces to use Uplay, but believe me: the quality, also from a technical point of view of this game is miles above the big budget games Ubisoft have released over the past years. The only downside is that there are no Steam achievements, which could have been a very fine addition - the Uplay achievements, though well done by themselves, are no match for the real stuff. Be sure to use a controller for this game; the controls are nigh-perfect and very intuitive.In every other department the game shines as well: graphically it does a very good job at conveying the often bleak atmosphere of the front - using a cartoonish comic-book style was a risk, but it pays off very well in the end. The sound department is even better, with a wonderful soundtrack and exactly the right background sounds at the right moment.Essential purchase and gaming experience, a true classic of the adventure genre and a deep emotional experience.

												Valiant Hearts is quite simple but moving puzzle game. It's story is placed in first world war, connecting the stories of German Karl, French Emile, Belgian Anna and American Freddie. The story is based on actual letters sent from the war to the peoples families. The visual style was the first thing that really cought my eye on early E3 trailer, had been waiting the game to release since. The music and sound also added to the great experience. Unfortunately the gameplay is bit lacking. Some action scenes and puzzles feel a bit repetitive, though it doesn't grow to be a big problem because of the games quite short lenght of 5-7 hours. Also there is a ""villain"" a German Baron whos character is bit too over the top and caricaturized. So it broke the atmosphere for me a bit. Otherwise the little moments of humour didn't bother me at all. Overall the game was great experience while played in short bursts. There is also lot to read about events, locations and items of the war for those who want to educate themselves a bit. Highly recommended for fans of great mature stories and/or  casual puzzles.[Score: 85]			"

												This game looks really awesome so far. Unfortunately I've got stuck because of what I can only assume is a bug. I can't get Freddie through the mud before I get shot and there are no items to use or hints available. I'm about an hour and a half in with nowhere to go. However I'm sure this will be sorted out shortly or I will spot my (potentially) glaringly obvious mistake.Based on first 90 minutes I would reccomend this to fans of platformers and people who like creative graphics from their games.*My 'obvious mistake' was to use a laptop where I was making the graphics card work too hard. I wouldn't call this a challenging game but the style and story make this worth playing for me.			"

												It seems only natural that since we are in the midst of the centennial anniversary of the war that was to end all wars, a game should be released. In the gaming world, it seems that almost every war has been covered. Sadly, little to no recognition has been given to the war that launched the world into the modern age and changed how we live today. Valiant Hearts proves to be one of the first games to give a great picture of the struggles of World War I as well as a satisfying gaming experience.	 In Valiant Hearts, we follow the stories of five heroes: Emile, a Frenchman; Hans, Emile's son-in-law who is deported from France because of his German origins; Freddie, an American who volunteers and fights alongside the French in his quest for revenge; Anna, a nurse searching for her father in Belgium; and Walt, a German first aid dog that comes across the path of each of these heroes and helps any way he can. While it may seem highly coincidential how these five individuals continually come across each other's paths, their backgrounds and motivations are very believable. The friendships that they build are genuine and felt by the players, without dialogue. Most conversations in this game are done by comic book bubbles and short distinct phrases that are spoken by the characters. 	The gameplay is fairly simplistic since it is a side scroller with puzzles and mini game scenarios spread throughout the game. These two aspects seem to be the only thing reminding the player that this is a game. These puzzles serve to help bring missions to successful conclusions and do not feel thrown in for the sake of having a puzzle. 	Throughout the entire game, there is a narrator that tells the story. The narrator serves to take the place of the spoken dialogue between characters and any reading. Having a matter-of-fact narrator makes the game feel like a documentary. As you play each scenario, there are pop ups that inform you about the historical events that inspired the in game events. The pop ups cover everything from battles to the affects the war had on civilian lives.   This is a great part of the game, making it entertaining and educational at the same time. Honestly, who really remembers being taught anything about The Great War in school? 	It is hard to criticize Valiant Hearts because of the emotional attachment that will develop. Unlike most war games in which the protagonist is the only competent character and can take on entire armies by themselves, our five protagonists are thrown into a conflict that is much bigger than them, and outside of their personal story arcs, they are just cogs in a giant machine. While they do a lot, they are shown to help other soldiers accomplish their duty, not do it for them. The protagonists go through being wounded, watching comrades die, suffering as POW's, and watching their hometowns be destroyed. There are also the subjects or desertion, mutiny, and treason. I have played games that have brought me to tears. This game was a sobering experience that was beyond tears. 	Technically, the game is put together very well. The look of Valiant Hearts is unique in that it looks like a comic book. While the look may seem somewhat childish, it does not change the fact that mature content is being dealt with. World War One contained some of the most brutal war conditions. The first gas attacks, trench warfare, and the controversial decisions that resulted in the unneccessary deaths of millions are all looked at in this game. The music is very appropriately used, from being contemplative, to exciting during a charge, to showcasing the popular classical music of the day during the mini game chase sequences.	This game was entertaining, sobering, and educational. While there are other games being released that deal with The Great War, none of them approach it with the heart that this game does. Valiant Hearts is more than a game. It is an interactive memorial that brings to mind a conflict that changed the world yet today gets so little recognition. Valiant Hearts should not be missed by anyone.  "

												The most stylistically beautiful yet intense and horrifying World War I game you will play. As there are no longer any living World War I veterans alive, this game is a wonderful memorial to their struggle and our freedom.The game is a simple 2D puzzle game but the real highlight is the story and its gripping delivery.Highly recommended. RIP WWI Veterans.			"

												There are games which suck, games which you like, and games that remain in your memory forever. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is definitely part of the third kind.An intriguing story which keeps you in suspense from the start till the very end. During the game you play with 4 characters: Emile, Karl, Freddie and Anna. Your mission - to guide them towards peace in a world torn apart by an awful war. Unlike most games about war - there is almost no violence inflicted by the characters except the necesary one to survive. It focuses on deliverance, redemption, human emotions, friendship, love and sacrifice rather than on destruction. The whole game is a chain of smart puzzles which must be solved in order to allow the characters to continue in this living tragedy, and after each sad part of the game there will always be a flash of hope to motivate the purpose of each character. The story is amazingly touching, graphics are superb and the voice acting is great. I urge you to try it it and see for yourself how much enjoyment can provide a game which depicts a war focusing on the emotional appeal rather than the war itself.			"

												""War makes men mad.""OMG, where do I begin? I just love this game so, so much! I've finished the game once already on my tablet a little more than a year ago and I've just completed it again, this time on PC / Steam. Completed it in one sitting for 6.3 hours.The story and the awesome soundtrack kept me engrossed in the game the whole way through, even with my second playthrough. I just cannot find fault with this game, not even with Uplay.+ Loved, loved, loved the soundtrack. Helps with the ambiance and the build-up of the story.+ Loved the story. Made me smile, laugh ,yell and cry from start to finish.+ Loved the comic-like graphics.+ Loved all of the characters.+ Loved the diary entries, letters and snippets of history.- NONE. ZILCH. NADA.- Okay, maybe one teeny tiny thing. I wished the ending wasn't so sad. But then again, war is sad. =(  Well worth the full price. A steal if it's on sale. Would re-play just to go through the story again.Do I recommend this game? Definitely a 'YES'. A thousand times of 'YES'-es.My rating: 10/10.			"

												Shortly put it's very easy to recommend Valiant Hearts. The basic gameplay reminds me of The Cave in the sense that it shares a lot with the logic behind traditional adventure games while mixing in 2D movement, puzzles and even some action. Gameplay isn't why I would recommend this title. It's simply passable meaning it's not the best in the genre but it won't annoy you. Puzzles in this game aren't really hard at all. Some action scenes and even a few classical music levels where you dodge bombs and other obstacles appearing in rhythm with the composition (they reminded me a bit of the music levels in Rayman Legends) act as good pallet cleaners.Where this game really shines is everything else but gameplay. Main draw is obviously the presentation. It's as beautiful as you could expect if you have followed Ubisoft's UbiArt Framework games (Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends and Child of Light). You may look at the screenshots wondering if it really looks as good in motion and indeed that is case. Actually that comic book artstyle in motion really makes this game what it is. It's just hard to find anything bad to say about the presentation of this title. Some very minor problems present themselves when the game combines 2D art with 3D environment but it is not nearly enough to draw you out of the experience. Music fits perfectly the overall mood of the game and the OST is up there with the other great soundtracks.Ubisoft has managed to create a very powerful story with Valiant Hearts. First of all it is about World War 1 that is very a very underrepresented scenario in video games. That is just the surface though. The really special part of this game is how it treats this period of time. Some of the themes the game is all about are something you just aren't expecting to see in video games. It's hard to go too much into detail without spoiling it all but one of these subjects is war's effect in civilians. This is just one of the many examples I could provide. Ubisoft Montpellier managed to put a lot of substance under the beautiful coat of paint. The cast of characters in this game is quite diverse. As a main characters there is a war dog, belgian veterinarian now acting as a war nurse, American man fighting as a volunteer in the war, older french and younger german (who is a son-in-law of the french man) drafted to fight in the war on different sides. All of the characters are very believable with different things motivating them. You grow quite fond of the cast while going through the story. The story is mainly told through narration and diaries. The character interaction consists mainly of symbols which actually works very well. I have to give extra mention to the amount of WW1 trivia they managed to get into the game. It's all optional but if that kind of thing interests you then I think you will be like me and read everything available to you. You shouldn't underestimate the value these bring to the game. They bring the game alive. Attaching small facts about the war-time life during WW1 to the collectables makes collecting them feel worthwhile.The game featured a few small but still unfortunate bugs. It's just not acceptable to have game-breaking bugs in the game as short and limited as this. Especially considering the powerhouse publisher behind it. On two occasions I was forced to restart the chapter. The checkpoint system is rather baffling. There are too many places where checkpoints are situated so that after a quick death you are forced to go through some monotonous tasks before getting to the point where you died again. In a game where the challenge is more about figuring out what to do rather than the execution the checkpoints should be far closer to each other. This game features Ubisoft's in-house DRM solution called Uplay. It brings no value to the table whatsoever. Uplay is a funny thing because usually it's in the background and you don't mind it at all but that's just when it works. When it doesn't work it quite literally can stop you from playing the game. Some of the common issues people (me included) have had with Uplay in the past include disappearing save files and various problems when Ubisoft's puny servers are down (common with a new game release or Steam sale). There is just no reason to use Uplay while neglecting the far superior Steamworks. At best it's just another program you have to run in background.The GoodPresentationStoryThe BadFew minor bugsCheckpoint placementThe UglyUplayValiants Hearts is a beautiful story I can recommend to everyone. I feel it's especially crucial for people that think the history and WW1 as a scenario for video game is interesting. It is as essential for people that like to play video games where the main draw is a really good story.			"

												Very sad and tragic story... This game is unique in so many ways. It amazes by its art style, story, characters, locations, music, the background information about World War I. But the gameplay sometimes can be very repetitive, tricky and unjustifiably difficult (it demands you do strict pixel- and timing-perfect actions) which immediately throws you off the immersion and the story. Especially the QTE scene at the very end. And by repetitive I mean very unnecessary repetitive element, some scenes would definitely benefit from less forcefully complicated repetitive pazzle-elements which were already done in similar way numerous times earlier in the game.But nevertheless, it is a great game with a very strong and important story, a lot of real facts about WWI, and I receommend everyone to experience it.

												Sometimes a game will have a standout moment, the kind that makes you wish so dearly that EVERYONE could be watching or experiencing it right now, the kind that makes you want to point at it and go, ""look at how incredible this medium can be at its very best!"". Valiant Hearts is a good six-or-so hours which is full of that kind of feeling. The puzzling is fairly light on, and feels slightly repetitive by the end, but the wonderful presentation and execution imbued throughout makes it rise far above any faults that I could possible find with it. This is one of 2014's essential titles.			"

												Overall: 8/10Valiant Hearts: The Great War takes you on a journey through the intertwined lives of characters through the first world war. As the player progresses through the story, the game captures some of the ills fated for those who lived through the war and how it affected the lives of individuals. The music at times is a bit hokey, but overall the audio in game helps. Game play is fairly simple and nothing is too complicated. Anyone should be able to enjoy this game. The comic book style of the art at first was something I wasn't very interested in, but grew on me the more I played. Game is worth the price, but has been on pretty good sales before. But for just under $2/hour definitely worth the asking price.Story: The story in Valiant Hearts has been exquisitely crafted to bring together the lives of several individuals including one who cannot truly speak for themselves. Watch the trailer if you want to know what I mean by that. Time after time I was angry with the game for sending the feels in after me and dragging me out of my cold little hearth where I nurse my jadedness at the world... not because it was contrived, but because it succeeded in dragging me into the feels zone. Stupid game. :PGameplay: Super simple, nothing to it. Easy to play though sometimes you're not entirely sure what the game wants from you. This didn't really happen till much closer to the end though. Audio: Overall great, but sometimes the music made me laugh a little. I get that symphonys were still big things back then, but just made me giggle a bit. Graphics: The comicbook style of the game is very well done, with backgrounds and details lending to the overall immersion into the story by the player. Contrasts in some scenes help express a complicated feeling that you grasp instantly, instead of having to read words to get what is being communicated. Final Notes: Definitely worth the play and the money. The game has been on some pretty good sales and one major knock against it for me at least is the Ubisoft DRM that's required to play it. Game is pretty short though, about half 6-7 hours of my play time were from me having walked away and left it running while I went to do something else. Still... an excellent game.			"

Puzzles build delicately and are relatively clever by the end of the six hour story.

Aside from some unfortunate gamey elements, such as dodging carpet bombs or ridiculous QTEs, this is a tale worth experiencing.			"

The music is amazing, the artwork is superb, and there is historical content to be uncovered for trivial knowledge. The gameplay is a simple side-scrolling cartoon, yet each character you play will uncover a personal story that is easy to sympathize with and get emotionally attached to. As the stories progress, they eventually cross paths and you will cheer and cry together with each passing moment.There is sadness, but war brings sadness, yet we become stronger as a result.			"

												This game destroyed me. It has all the ingredients for a serious tear-jerking story: the tragedy of war, friendship and family, characters you become connected to, hope, successes and failures, and a loyal dog. Expect to cry so much you become dehydrated and cause water damage to your carpet. If there's one flaw to this game, it's that it tries too hard to be a game, which can sometimes distract from the emotional moments. It's kind of hard to explain without demonstration, but rest assured it isn't nearly enough to ruin the experience. I do, however, for that very reason, think this story would be wonderful in book or movie form. Because of the nature of the story, I recommend playing it in as few sessions as possible. It's a six-hour game (I play games kind of slow, so I took 7), so you could feasibly complete it in two or three sittings. Or one if you have a Saturday to yourself.			"

												A fantastic game with an excellent soundtrack that incorporates a lot of historical facts into the plot. Very emotional at times and shows the true death and destruction of World War I. Only downside is the extra DRM which wasn't too huge of an issue but buyers beware, Valiant Hearts uses Uplay along with Steam. However, this one little downside shouldn't change the fact that Valiant Hearts is a game to pick up and immerse yourself in the history of WWI.Overall score: 10/10 - Tells an interesting and emotional story from four different perspectives of the war.- Great game with an amazing soundtrack and art design. - A lot of collectables that explain how significant each object had impacted the war.- Actual images of the different parts of the war and detailed descriptions that accompany them.\\Still good. Just doing this for a badge			"

												Beeautiful game. It has such a strong and emotional story.I love the way gameplay focus on lives of several individuals but simultaneously showing fates of milions of others as well, how their lives are connected. I'm very glad I played this game, not to mention all the historical facts and trivia, I learned a thing or two :) "

												I'll just keep this relatively brief, because there's a lot you can say to praise this game. Valiant Hearts is a fantastic game that treats WWI with intelligence, dignity, and care. The game does not flinch very far from the horrors of war. You'll be finding yourself dashing through trenches filling with mustard gas and avoiding German machine gun fire as people are cut down around you. But the game doesn’t just focus on the brutality but the humanity as well. It shows the innocent people caught in the crossfire and it makes its main cast quite likable and endearing. The game also does not take sides, showing that there was no good or evil side, just a whole bunch of normal people dragged into a situation they had no control over and forced to kill each other. It’s also very clear that the devs did their research and there’s a butt load of articles and entries detailing facts about the war. The game does have some tonal issues at times, the main villain kind of seems he would be more at home in something like Professor Layton or Henry Hatsworth than a game trying to be a mostly realistic take on WWI, especially because he's pretty starkly evil in a mostly morally gray game, but ultimately it’s not a major flaw.In the end, Valiant Hearts is a well-written and powerful game that will keep you invested until the end. This game is going to be on everybody’s GOTY lists, I guarantee. An absolute must play.			"

												A simple puzzle-based 2d game with brilliant narration and story.Valiant Hearts takes the background to World War 1 era, when French battled Germany. Needless to say, it's very tragic already to remember one of the worst of humanity's darkest history. But hey, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, right? Not my quote, though. It cleverly incorporates the story of WW1 war into the game and adds more background story in a log book for you to review.Anyway, the game's one hell of linear one. You mostly control one protagonist (swapping around four as you progress) at one time.... and a dog. Puzzles are fairly simple and don't require you to do much. Some don't make sense - and mostly it's just like hidden object games bring this stuff to there rinse and repeat, but more often than not it's engaging. There are some boss battles, a bit nonsensical on top of it, but fun.Playing with controller is my preference, and this game's great at it - suitable to lay comfortably on the bed, read the narration and play. It's even able to detect controller on the fly.Achievements and game saves are stored cloudly on uPlay. If you detest it, alas, there's no help for it. I also found one game breaking bug, because of it I failed to pass the level so many minutes. It's on chapter 2, but there's a workaround for that, at least I was able to pass it. And no patch so far, either. uPlay also prevents me to take screenshots at all on Steam's Overlay. It doesn't even appear. Ah well... an annoyance, but isn't gonna do anything against my enjoyment of the game.Replayability only involves collecting more hidden objects. There's a progress bar in main menu that helps you to track what's missing. Other than that, the game has literally zero replayability unless you just want to remember the story again. Though, for sure, the value diminishes after first playthrough - I sure have no interest to beat this game again, did once already. That doesn't change the fact that the story is sad but beautiful.So, for once, I have to say ""Well done Ubisoft!"".			"

												I've never had such irreconcilable feelings for a game.As an actual game, to play, it's mostly pretty fun. The puzzles are well-designed, but there's a few very annoying bits. There's a lot of obnoxious stipulations to puzzles to artificially make them harder than they are, such as not being able to see the whole screen, trial-and-error time limits, missiles that come out of nowhere and kill you...but I can forgive it. I can't remember the last time an adventure game was this long and varied.The much vaunted, award-winning story felt very strange to me, though...I don't know what this game really wanted to be. It is trying to be a tragic, heartfelt war memoir, but also the characters communicate in cartoonish mumbles, there's boss fights with a stereotypical Evil German General who utilizes ridiculous contraptions, there's very Rayman Legends-esque rhythmic car chase segments. There's one point where a character, in typical adventure game fashion, speaks a speech bubble with a picture of a saw cutting off a human arm, because he needs medical attention. It felt absolutely surreal and tonedeaf, to jarringly gameify something so serious, that the game itself WANTS me to take seriously. Very, uh...""Press F to Pay Respects.""The villain, Baron Von Dorf, who I can't believe is named Baron Von Dorf, is the most cartoonish, Dr. Robotnik type villain. He felt like something out of a wartime propaganda cartoon. There are other minor characters--mostly those in leadership positions--who felt like absolutely stereotypical. That isn't necessarily a problem in itself, especially in a game set in a war hat was heavily influenced BY the caricaturization of its enemies. But in a game that is intending to humanize the war, show that people on both sides of the battle were unique, real humans going through something unimaginably difficult, it is cancelling out its own moral, the point the writers and developers seem to genuinely want you to believe, to have such unbelievable stock characters juxtaposed against the tragic, human element of the game is almost uncomfortable.As I stated, the game simply doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a funny cartoon. It's a sad memoir. It's a platformer, it's a puzzle game, it's a stealth game. It's a game about the harsh realities of war. It's a game where someone chases you down in an unreal mechanical zeppelin. It's an upbeat story about three unlikely wartime buddies chasing a common enemy. The mood shifts so much and so frequently, and the game doesn't really seem to understand how off-putting its vaccilating tone is.I can think of no better way to describe the game's uncomfortable tone shifts than the ending. Truth be told, it got me feeling choked up! Genuinely! I was very misty-eyed as the credits began to roll. I was expecting the typical Ubisoft 2-hour credits...but then halfway through, like a Marvel film, the game cuts to a sequel hook; one of the surviving characters watches on as America joins World War I, with the narration stating that war's hunger is insatiable. A sequel hook for a game about finality and the tragedy of war. That's Ubisoft!When the game was announced, I was surprised--it seemed so far out of Ubisoft's wheelhouse, it didn't seem like something they could do. After playing it...I guess I was right, unfortunately. Playing the game was a complicated emotional roller coaster and I felt like I was being split in two--ultimately I realized it was because while I was feeling very sad emotions contemplating the actual reality of World War I, I was simultaneously off-put by the game's tone, its inherent goofiness that in spite of appearances to the contrary, it seems to revel in.I'm putting ""no"" for if I recommend the game or not, but it still feels harsh. Ultimately I didn't like it, but my feelings were more neutral. If they added a ""I'm confused about how I feel about this game"" button between ""yes"" and ""no"" I'd be ticking that one off. For as discomfortingly unaware the game's overall vibe was, I think there was merit to it.Also, the dog is really good, and he doesn't die.			"

												TL;DR – This will weigh down your heart like it’s sporting a 20 ton anchor beret. But you will not regret the pain.Note: Took around 10 hours not 14 as I put game on hold to watch a bit of The Walking Dead which turned into a marathon, silly me. :PIn life there are those with very certain objectives that they are intent on completing. Many of us look up to these individuals. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is tremendously goal orientated. It is a game that deserves the praise we give to those focused enough to live their existence out, dedicated to an important cause. I am sure that many games look up to it for the superior level in fusion of storytelling and gaming entertainment it delivers. At first the familiarity is reminiscent of point and click games though it is far from it, the more you advance. Progression is achieved through guiding several main characters through a set sequence of actions to continue on their respective journeys as they experience the First World War. It is a puzzle adventure game that is the most basic it can be as a game without falling into any variation of boredom. You will be taken along an interactive journey of warfare, dodging bullets while under fire, digging trenches, plonking soldiers on the head with fist or ladle and receiving aid from an enormously well trained and helpful war dog named Walt. Walt is “uberadorable” and if you are anything like me, you’ll be turning to him for comfort by rubbing his belly each time you feel a little jolt of heartache playing this game. The lives of the main characters will interchange constantly over the course of this game and they will save each other’s lives and make new-found friends. It is a story about average people and their part in a war that will never be forgotten. It is not biased or too depressing. However, it is intense towards the end and also during some of the later “boss battles”. Thankfully this game has zero tolerance against procrastination. You will not find yourself sighing like in some puzzle adventure games where you don’t know why you’re collecting a bunch of items or trying to finish the same puzzle for hours on end. Not a single function is for mere substance within the game. Every detail owns its own historical relevance and is provided to successfully enlighten the player about WWI (including weapons and tactics). It was a joy to search for as many artefacts as I could find (you can go back after finishing the game and look for any previously missed) and read all the extra material provided through photographs and descriptions. I will bet on the likelihood that some cool history teacher out there is using this as the most spectacular teaching material. It is not overly story-driven that it winds up like a visual novel and also has a good percentage of logical puzzles and basic “mini-games”. The art is splendid like a good portion of Ubisoft games tend to be. It knows no age, gender or background and imagine it would be wonderful game play, not just for adults but for families together or even younger children alone. I took my time trying to read everything and indulging myself in all the gorgeous art but as the controls are basic, most will find the game play short, efficient and rewarding. Hints will appear courtesy of war pigeons and they are impeccably timed so you will likely figure things out yourself before the hints appear. They are clear solutions or obvious clues so calls for less online surfing. Saving is automatic but is frequent enough not to be bothersome after your initial adjustment at the start of the game. Though the game is fiction it is based on truth that should be told until the end of all mankind and deserves all the “feels” it will make you muster. If there were a perfect book in this world specifically designed to amuse gamers, this would be it. The bookworm in me also wishes there were a book.I think this is a first but I literally have no cons to note.Uplay is aesthetic and has a separate achievements and points system where you can unlock extra features. I feel it lacks the community Steam has but it is a well made client that I do not mind using at all. It is a shame Steam doesn’t have achievements for this game as of yet. Also, this game disallows me from regretting my Uplay installation.Tackling Steam’s “already running” error using Uplay (was a problem I encountered)Shut down Uplay & game from Task Manager – Delete game content from Steam library – Delete Uplay – Go to Ubisoft website and download Uplay from there – Open Steam if not already open – Go to game list in Uplay and press PLAY from there – Steam’s navy popup will appear (may be in background, minimise windows to see it) – Click that popup to download – When finished click PLAY via Uplay. Imagine Steam as a guy in the shadows, they need to be there but when you play Uplay always play from Uplay client and just leave Steam in the background to do its thing.Edited for layout. "

												The story of Valiant Hearts begins in 1914. Archduke Franz Ferdinand has been assassinated and Germany declares war on Russia in response. In anticipation of a war, France begins to deport all German citizens. Karl a young German farmer is forced to be separated from his family, consist of his wife Marie, their son Victor and his father-in-law Emile. Karl is forcefully drafted into the German army while at the same time Emile is drafted into the French army.The story follows their journey of Emile and Karl as they try to survive a war neither of them want nothing to do with. Along the way they meet many wonderful characters, faced countless hardships and joyful moments.The gameplay is a side scrolling game. You're controlling either Emile or Karl most of the time, sometimes other characters. Most of the time you'll be solving puzzles and picking up items to advance on to the next area, while following the story. Gameplay-wise it isn't incredibly difficult at all, if you're good at figuring out how to use your environment to solve the puzzles you should be just fine. Certain part of the game required you to sneak through behind enemy lines. So patience is more needed here than skills, other times you are required to dodge artillery shells which can be a bit frustrating until you learn the patterns. There are parts of the game where the game turned into short of a dodging game where many vehicles are chasing after you and you must avoid bullets, grenades and incoming traffic. Last but not least, there are quick time events. You will encounter them at scenes when you have to heal someone. They get progressively harder as you go through the game, the last QTE is quite difficult, at least for me.The game does a wonderful job with the narration between loading screen, even though most of the characters does not speak at all, they only provide you with speech bubbles to portray the feelings and thoughts of each characters. The narrator does most of the heavy lifting. In the game you will be able to find many collectibles, that when you open up the menu, you can examine them and read about the history and interesting fact regarding the Great War. I highly recommend reading them, as it will enhance the experience. The music was very fitting with the game, since characters do not talk, the music help give you the sense of danger and sadness that you normally need words to describe.I have not encounter any game breaking bugs when I played it, the only bugs I encountered was one time my character was stuck in a ditch and I could not dig my way out of it, so I had to restart the chapter, the other time was when I was healing another character and an extra arm appeared out of nowhere on my character. But it was gone the moment the healing QTE was finished.This game being one of the first games I played after the Summer Sale, I highly recommend this if you enjoy a grand, epic and emotional story. The only major problem I have with this game is that sometimes, certain part of the game might dragged on for a while, but others might be over very quickly, a bit inconsistency in pacing. There are many great characters that you will like, the way they accurately portray the hardships of warfare at the time is also a welcoming addition. It took me 10 hours to finish the game, but if you want to get all the collectibles. It might take you a bit longer. This game is definitely one of my Game of the Year contender, or at least for great storytelling. I hope if you already played it, that you enjoyed it. If you haven’t, what are you waiting for? =] "

												If you are a military vetran, as I am, be aware that this game does (reasonably) accuratly portray the reality of war. If you suffer from PTSD please take this into account as you play.I recommend this game in the srtongest terms possible. It is a very moving story of how one family is drawn into and affected by the events of World War I. Though the story focuses on this one family it does intersect with two others (three if you count the dog) in such a way that the story is very moving.  The driving force behind each participant is clearly portraied and links them together very well.Just remember, in war there is death. Even heros do not always live.			"

												Ждал игру примерно месяц, часто обновляя страницу игры - ""вдруг будет предзаказ"" и в итоге подарил друг в первые секунды продажи игры. За что ему ОГРОМНОЕ спасибо! Это не игра, это интерактивный анимационный фильм. С первых секунд в игре интересно наблюдать за всем что происходит на экране, за персонажами, за тем как они выкрикивают свои реплики (именно выкрикивают, потому что тут это гиперболезированно до смешного) Очень красивый арт в игре (один из пунктов, почему ждал игру) анимация не самая сложная, но не выбивается из гротескного стиля всей игры. И в контраст к шутливо-мультяшной подаче происходящего в игре сразу поднимаются не радостные события в истории реальной. Дальше как говорится будем сомтреть, будем думать. Игру посоветовал бы брать тем, кого впечатлил  Machinarium, кто знаком с Deponia и кто вспоминает Broken sword 1-2 естественно делая скидку на то что в VH ""экраны"" намного динамичней чем в этих выше перечисленных играх.(играл всего 30 минут, но самые первые впечатления, самые непредвзятые, только только из игры)			"

The illustration, animation, music, sound effects are all really really well done. The story is good, and the added facts and tidbits about WWI are very interesting. It's sad that for many, it has become the forgotten war, having been overshadowed by WWII. Highly Recommend this game. It's not long, but very worth it.			"

												Well... that was rough. x_xValiant Hearts is basically an adventure game-thing centered on a small cast of characters caught up in the First World War. An extremely rare setting for games since, more than most wars, ""The Great War"" was an abyss of futility and horror that should never have happened. The gameplay here is pretty much puzzle-solving and a few sequences which is rather reminicient of music rhythm games. The gameplay works, but that's not what you play this game for.No, what this game does, and does very well, is atmosphere and painting a picture of just what kind of war WW1 was. The game is chiefly focused on the French perspective of the war and the horrible price that was payed by France to ultimately win a pyrrhic victory. The game follows the course of history, and particularly upon the general attitudes about the conflict as it progressed. You start off in the optimistic summer of 1914 when it was believed this would be a short glorious war. But when plans for quick victory fall apart, the trenches are dug and the war descends into an abyss of horror. Most of the major battles on the Western Front during 1914-1917 are featured in this game: 1st Marne, 2nd Ypres, Verdun, The Somme, Vimy Ridge, before closing things with the Nivelle offensive at Chemin des Dames. This does make me a bit disappointed since they came pretty close to covering the entire war and ended up missing both its most horrific campaign (3rd Ypres/Passchendaele) and its most dramatic (Kaiserschlacht and 1918 in general). Despite that, the ending works just fine, though it is a downer. But by the time you are coming close to the ending having played this game for a few hours, you already know this won't have a happy ending. And it chooses it's conclusion to be the battle that broke the spirit of the French Army and led to widespread mutiny within it. And since this game is very French-centric, ending here is okay with me because although the French remained one of the great Allied powers for the rest of the war, it was the British, its Commonwealth allies, the Germans, and finally the Americans that took center-stage from this point onward in the west.WW1 is one of my most extensively studied periods of history, so I really appreciated the work that went into this game in keeping it close to the setting. Games set in this time period are so rare that any that do things reasonably well in regards to representing it accurately are liable to getting my wholehearted recommendation. Alas, I cannot do that here for one reason: Uplay. That is reason enough not to touch a game for alot of people and I don't blame them. But if you can get past that, then this is a pretty good game to pick up, especially for those with an interest in history and specifically WW1. :)Enjoy the abyss!			"

												There are a lot of games out there who have a cool artstyle, a captivating story and rewarding game mechanics.But none have touched my heart, like this game.I honestly believe, that 50+ Years, when I turned from a young meatbag to a old meatbag, and I look back at my life, this will be one of those very few games that I'll still remember.Ok, just ignore the meatbag part. Just play this game. It's worth it.			"

												This is a must play, everything of it is well made: the story, the chars, the OST, the puzzles. Lets talk about the puzzles: they are quite easy, through the levels there will be different kind of things to do, it never gets boring, sometimes you have to find an item, bring it to someone in order to proceed with the game etc, other times you'll drive a car and avoid the obstacles or the bombs that would make you explode and die (how surprising), or you will cure injured people with some QT events where you have to press the right buttons at the right time. As I said, it's quite different and doesnt get boring or frustating, because if you are clueless, there are hints that will help you anyway :D (I confess I had to use them a couple of times because I'm blind :| )I like this game so much, made me drop a tear as well ;_; If I really have to think of something negative, I had a couple of crash (in almost 10 hours of game) and the checkpoints arent the best. Beside these, game was amazing.I can only reccomend Valiant Hearts. 9/10			"

												There is no limit to which one can praise this game. While not as action filled as its counterparts, it fills the player with a sense of roleplay that makes one envision themselves in the spot of Emile in this conflict that rocked the world. It demonstrates that there is no good or evil on either side. It is all but gray as the dirt below you as you make way passed the countless bodies of the fallen. Whether German, English, French, Indian, Australian, American, and ect, it does not matter to bullets.While there is no humain way to picture World War 1, this game comes the closest than anything I've ever played. Having a Great-Grandfather that fought in The Great War and the stories he left behind, this interpretation of the conflict says it all; The poison gas, the damned whistle, the booming artillery, the heartless machine guns, and the smell of death. There is no reason not to play this game yourself or watch a gameplay video on youtube. It follows Anna, Karl, and Emile as they venture to survive through a conflict bound for disaster. Playing this game will make you feel something deep and significant if you ever go to the cemeteries that litter the french fields.			"

												Already an enjoyable adventure/puzzle game, Valiant Hearts: The Great War also has an absolutely excellent story about the horrors of war thrown into the mix.  Throughout the course of the game you spend your time switching between four characters, each of one which represents a differing experience of World War I, though they are all good, common people who suffer greatly against their will.The adventure and puzzle aspects of the game are relatively simple, I rarely found myself stuck and even when I did it was only for a short time.  If you're looking for a game that is going to challenge the limits of your skill this is not the game for you.  However, if you are looking for enough adventure and puzzle elements to keep you 'playing' and you want to experience an excellent story, I definitely recommend this game.It took me seven hours to beat the game.  The only real complaint that I could offer up is a rather weak one about the game seeming to on occassion have small segments that felt like 'filler' to me.  The story slowed a bit for a few minutes before picking back up - which was usually when I took a break from it.I would recommend this game to anyone who is into story-oriented and even historical games, though I would recommend those looking for a only hardcore and challenging experiences to stay away.

												I have never written a review on Steam before but this game was just too good not to. As of today, it is the only video game I have ever played that made me cry. This story is brilliant and unique; not to mention it's filled to the brim with emotion. A robot could play this game and still be bawling its eyes out by the end of it. The gameplay is fun, interesting, and special. You don't see many puzzle games based around war but Valiant Hearts pulls it off. I can not recommend this game enough. Just buy it, whether it's on sale or not. Even f this game was $1,000, I'd still say you should buy it.			"

												Mechanically, Valiant Hearts has what it takes to be a fun, quirky puzzle/platformer/adventure hybrid. Instead, it takes on the First World War and all the associated brutality that came with it. And while it does a good job of driving home the differing perspectives, showing you the meaning of loss, and hammering you with the trauma of war, one can't help but wonder if the Great War was the right setting.Games tend to demand three things: 1) player agency, 2) the feeling of progress, and 3) the feeling that the world responds to your actions. World War 1 presented correctly could never do that. You grow attached to the characters because of their clear relatable goals, but a proper picture of the war would leave them wholly unable to act upon them. And by placing your characters in some of the rare pivotal moments of what was otherwise a four-year intractable meat-grinder of a conflict, it feels like individual moments of heroism can really save the day. It stands in jarring contrast to the reality of the war: a bureaucratic nightmare where political expedience and officers' incompetence fed young men into machine-gun fire by the hundreds of thousands.The game that was truly faithful to the war would kill everyone around you regardless of your actions. Your decisive push for new ground is turned back the following week. One day, your commanding officer gets it in his mind to secure glory by feeding as many of you into bloodbath of No-Man's-Land as possible. As you seek cover from machinegun fire, a howitzer shell bursts the thin strip of ground between you and a muddy crater and you drown in the blood, mud, and necrosis. Your commanding officer is later promoted for bravery. There is no rationality or narrative, just the slow drift of whole economies toward each other and a tectonic snap at the point of conflict. Valiant Hearts just barely scratches the surface of this.It's hard to imagine any game in the traditional sense being able to convey that. Valiant Hearts does the best job of it I've seen, but it's still much too far from the truth.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Valiant Hearts uses Uplay, Ubisoft's utterly needless third-party DRM and achievement/social system. It's less obtrusive than in some games but still ought to be removed.ENDING SPOILER:The last ""puzzle"" does attempt to drive home more of the senselessness of the war by having a commanding officer shove your squad through increasingly brutal segments of a French counterattack. I feel like the solution may be more effective on other players than it was for me. The growing sense of despair, confusion, and hopelessness that comes from your commanding officer demanding you push through a literally impassable section may drive players to the horrifying conclusion that they need to mutiny against their own officer as the only way to survive. There was no moment of dawning horror for me since offing him was my very first response to meeting an impassable puzzle. People with less wildly anti-authoritarian bents might get more out of it. "

												Valiant Hearts - runs well (even on Uplay, don't frown),  and offers surprising depth compared to most Ubi games, in the form of collectible items which unlocks  copious amounts of historical information. A good game - would require unique gameplay and controls to be great, but it's on a good way. Be wary - despite its serious content, don't expect much action and combat, because you will be gravely disappointed.Valiant Hearts is a game that's really hard to classify, and to review. It mixes animation fitting children's books with the horrors of war, simple controls, mild puzzles, and some quick time events while trying to hold up and carry a storyline with multiple protagonists. And not all of these are perfect.The animation is nice - the presentation is good, it's easy to distinguish certain parts of the gameplay area, and it becomes clear pretty soon that a game has a distinguished art style, which is always a good sign for a unique, good visual experience.The controls and puzzles work together nicely - the puzzle parts usually make good use of the game's control scheme, but after a while it gets stale. There is a limited version of puzzles you can create with (controller layout) A for grab and operate, RB/LB to send the dog for contextual places (ABXY), and one for throwing the item that you're holding. And that's it. The game has the potential to become extremely boring simply because the gameplay is a single-path sidescroller, and most of the action parts are as intense as getting past a strictly scripted guard.But the narration saves the day. Without the historical facts on each map, without the unlockable mementos of the era, the game would fall onto its own face. There are many letters, everyday items from the world of WW1 and the countryside, from the soldiers and their families that THAT'S the main reason in my opinion, that people consider this game as good as it is. These help people without the in-depth historical knowledge to appreciate more the simpler graphics, to imagine the mud of the trenches, the freezing cold nights and the problems with communicating with the loved ones. It's needed to make the cute-ish graphics into something that hints the reality of the past.Technically the game runs well, each episode has around 5 levels, each of them can be completed in maybe 30-45 minutes if really looking around, if needed to restart the level, it can be done in a few minutes - they are pretty short. If one dies ingame, respawns at last checkpoint, if the player exits, the whole level needs to be replayed.  In my playthrough, I've faced two  bugs that forced me to restart the respective levels, but as I said, it's minimal time loss. At least based on my experience, both the game and Uplay was trustworthy and hadn't caused problems besides this little hiccup.So, after all, I would recommend the game for everyone - at least to check it out because it's a really inclusive game, I think almost everyone could get into it because of it's simplistic control scheme.  But the gameplay is plain without the additional collectibles and the lack of challenge can make it hard to go on - in shorter bursts it's easily approachable for the lovers of more action-filled genres.

												I had an eye on this game for a while, and upon Ubisoft releasing it on steam officially, I decided to pick it up since the whole impression of the game after few videos was fairly solid. I didn't have high expectations for this game, because frankly, I'm not a huge ""puzzle"" fan. However, Valiant Hearts plays its role of a puzzle game perfectly.One of the most compelling and story driven game I've ever played in my life, has 4 playable characters, Anna, Karl, Emile and an American solider that becomes your friend at the very beginning of the game. The life of these four characters is rather well described as they suffer and feel on their own skin the outcomes of  the war. They fight for, not only their own life, but the life of their dearest friends and family. It's a life of survival, and a game that shows how cruel war is, and what consequences it has for the whole mankind.Pros: +soundtrack - one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in my whole lifetime. The game excels at that part and the sound is done so well, you'll stop and listen to the music before you finish your puzzle even if you know the answer+story - the story isn't anything that SPECIAL, but is very well made, and isn't as robust as some of the stories in the same genre+gameplay - now, Valiant Hearts is a puzzle game, and puzzles in this game aren't as hard as maybe they should be for a person that bought Valiant Hearts in inention to play it for hardcore puzzles. This is the part that I like in the game, and the reason why I don't have a fond of puzzle games is that they end up being hard which affects storyline and it's tempo. I really like how puzzles are not quite hard, but sometimes enough challenging for the player to stop for a minute and think about them thourughly.+graphics - The artstlyle, whole graphics of this game are wonderful, it's really amazing how well they are detailed even tho they have cartoonish look for them.Cons: I honestly don't have any real cons for this game, as this game is one of the most charming and exciting games I've played. My honest conclusion is that this game is apsolutely worth 15€, and it's a fari price for what this game can offer. Maybe only negative thing about this game is the lenght of the story itself. You'll need around 6.7 - 8 hours to finish the game, but there are also collectible items that may impact on the lenght of the game. 9.5/10			"

												WARNING:  This game is great: Beautifuly made with a very engaging story line, BUT you will need to install the invasive bloatware DRM ""uplay"" from ubisoft, and each time you want to play, you will need to load 2 or 3 loaders/logins. Sincerely, if I knew I would need to install and cope with all those damn things, I would rather use a cracked copy of the game instead.  Steam must get away of Uplay. If the producer doesnt want to use steam DRM only, then steam shouldnt sell it.UPDATE: Many people commented this review in a negative way, arguing that im not reviewing the game, but reviewing uplay"" here. You are wrong. As I see, the 3rd party (non steam) DRM - uplay - is absolutely indissociable from the product (you cant legally use the game without uplay), so I believe it must be reviewed as such - as an unavoidable bad part of the whole product. As a paying customer who paid for it and didnt liked it, I reviewed accordingly. If you dont mind about the intrusiveness and clutterness of uplay, good for you. But you will not change my mind about it.			"

There are all kinds of collectible objects you can find scattered throughout the game's four chapters that will unlock informative articles about the war and it's impact on those who suffered and died and lived through it.Rating: 10/10If you love historical fiction about one of the most tragic periods in modern human history, this game is for you.

												To all you Battlefield/COD/WAR Based FPS... This game is NOT for you. Not unless you really want to play a game that makes you feel like you're in a REAL war. The game its self consist of solving puzzles and getting from Point A to B to C to... It is not open ended and very laniary. BUT it is still an amazingly fun game to play. The puzzles are challenging and there are a few moment where you're going to laughs. But that's about it. The rest of this game is a real emotional trip down a series of REAL WW1 events. Although the story its self is fictional, the game is filled with historical facts and REAL historical values. This game is simply AMAZING! One of the things that I love about this game is that FINALY we have a game that shows war as war. It's not Terrorist vs. Soldiers, Black vs. White or Good vs. Evil ,  its war. You can save a German soldier as much as saving an Allie, befriending an someone and then have to kill him moment later... why? because my friends ... that is war. I hope I am not spoiling anything here but I cried . . . I freaking cried real manly tears at the end of the game and yet I still want to go and play this game a second time.So if you want to know if this game is really worth the 15$ Hell yes! This game is an experience like no other and exposes you to the real deal. Finally the real war experience in all its true emotions and fights. In closing, this game arrives just in time for the 100th year anniversary of WW1, good timing Ubisoft!Lest We Forget!  "

Posted: June 27, 2014
												Valiant Hearts is the latest game by Ubisoft, made using UbiArt, the engine that also powers recent Rayman titles or Child of Light. It's set during World War I (one), telling the tales of four characters: a French conscript farmer, a German expelled from France who then got enlisted into the German army [also, the son-in-law of the French conscript], an American who lost his bride during a German bombing in Paris, and a Belgian nurse. Oh, and a German rescue dog, as well.The most immediately striking feature of Valiant Hearts is the art: it looks like an animated Belgian/French-style comic. Of course, any game about trenches, piles of corpses and Mustard gas will look bleak, but the bleakness here is extremely beautiful. Watch the trailer, and you'll immediately see what I mean.The French narrator (who also voices the French version of Dumbledore) is excellent and, judging from the trailer, so does the English-speaking one. Other characters speak some kind of gibberish with a couple of recognizable words, and it works well. Overall, it's hard to not be extremely happy with the audio-visuals.It's clear that Ubisoft Montpellier had three aims with this title: to entertain, to tell an emotional story, and to teach about the ""Great War"". The result is inconsistent.Perhaps the biggest success lies in the ""teaching"". Thanks to its different environments and to the 3 years that the story spans, many aspects of the first world war are evoked. Those aspects are sometimes barely hinted at in the actual game, but the touch of a button brings small explanatory texts, all well written and illustrated with actual pictures of the war (taken from ""Apocalypse"", a highly successful French documentary series that used actual footage from the war, colored especially for it). At the end of the game, you'll have read a micro-encyclopaedia (or not, it's always optional). What's more, there are 100 collectible items scattered throughout the game. Finding one brings another small text related to that object, though those are focused on the mundane, daily lives of soldiers instead of the bigger themes from the encyclopedia. Sometimes, those get too mundane: I really don't need to know about all kinds of ID tags that were used by the belligerent armies. But most help ground the story into something I could relate to, because of human scale.The actual story is more of a mixed bag. For the biggest part, the heroes are alternatively living the life of ordinary soldiers (or nurses), and partaking in extraordinary, completely unrealistic adventures, the like of which would not have looked out of place in the pages of a pulp magazine. This tended to create an unfortunate distance between me and the characters. Fortunately, the last hour largely redeems whatever silly stuff I was subjected to: an especially gripping action sequence, very effective at conveying the horrors of big assaults between the trenches, is followed by an extremely emotional conclusion. Yes, I cried a little.Sadly, the actual game is lacking. It alternates between adventure, puzzle and action sequences, but stays average (at best) in all the genres. The adventure segments are especially disappointing. When they don't consist of boring fetch quests, they don't always make a lot of sense: your actions rarely have logical consequences, and you are left guessing at random. Thankfully, the adventure environments are so restricted that the guesswork never truly blocks your progress (that, and the built-in hint system). The rare puzzles lack variety. Only some action sequences are able to enthuse: You can't beat the driving levels, where the to-be-avoided obstacles arrive in rhythm with a French Cancan or with ""Night on Bald Mountain"".Overall, Valiant Hearts was a disappointment to me, because I was so in love with its trailer. I still admire the concept and the art is unarguably fantastic. I can forgive the uneven story thanks to the great finale. But when you strip the game to its core, you're left with decidedly uninspired mechanisms.It is unique, though. WWI is rarely explored by video games and war in general is rarely treated from this kind of perspective. Therefore, I would still cautiously recommend the experience, expecially given the soft price of entry.			"

Make sure when you play to try to pick up all collectibles and press TAB to read about them. Read all historical facts and diary entries as they come along. These things gives so much information and depth to the game. I have learned more about WW I than I thought I would and in the best way possible, as a game.There is a lot of emotional depth as well and we get to understand and feel for all characters in the game.Highly recommended.

												WARNING: Small spoilersAn incredible, charming, and unforgettable experience. Distinct from other games by its characters and their struggles, showing that not every one involved in war is just a generic soldier, and that everyone is a unique person with their own set of morals and history and their own way of life. A definate way its set apart from games like Wolfenstein and Call of Duty. Its a game about people, more loyal to eachother than their respective nations who struggle in a world covered in blood where the sound of clashing steel overtakes all. For those of you who dislike Ubisoft (I do too) i didn't even realize it was an Ubisoft game (I didn't realize U play is ubisofts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of steam) until I came to write this review. It is really not the type of crap (cough cough♥♥♥♥♥creed) Ubisoft normally puts out. Only downside is you have to go through Uplay to play the game.While it may be a war game its not action packed in the sense of running through the battlefields and shooting everyone you see, if you want that buy Verdun (WW1 shooter game available on steam) or Battlefield 1 when it comes out. The gameplay aspects of Valiant Hearts is that it is a puzzle game, of course with the World War 1 theme, which if your a history fan (like me) you'll enjoy quite it a bit more than say Portal 2. Instead of escaping a facility like Portal your turning switches and pushing minecarts around to turn off Mustard Gas switches so the soldiers can advance. In correlation to earlier where I said about the characters being people with their own morals, at one point you find an enemy soldier hanging by the ankle from a rope in an underground tunnel (he got caught in his own trap or was hanging something up and got himself instead). Instead of picking up his rifle on the floor next to Emile (one of the main four characters you play) and shooting the guy to leave his body hanging there, Emile cuts the rope and gets the German soldier back on his feet. While you may think its a poor decision the soldier then thanks Emile and you two go towards the German line, (something that would never happen in nearly all other games around) and once you get the the end of the tunnel you run into three armed German soldiers. They point their rifles at Emile (Him being French), and could either take him captive or shoot him dead on the spot, though the guy you just rescued convinces them to let you go. And they agree, showing you the way out.It also has many historical aspects, it has an amount of trinkets and other memerabilia you can collect each stage of the game, each has a description of what it is and its use and relevence. You can find dog tags, letters, helmets, gas masks, rations, medals, personal items, and other stuff. It also gives out loads of facts and information about all this stuff and World War One in general, making Valiant Hearts very educative. The characters are also put into historical events you probably didn't even know happened, like at one point your fixing then driving a taxi to bring soldiers to the front line. Wait. What? This made little sense when i was doing it though the game explains that during the Initial push to Paris the French government hired out a bunch of taxis to drive out soldiers from the city to the frontline to stop the Germans from taking it. I sure as hell didn't know that. It also features the old trapezoid models of tanks seen during the war, along with biplanes and older models of artillery. One of the main antagonists of the game is a german baron, who infamously has a pretty large and impressive Prussian zeppelin. It occasionally will show you a map as well of where each character is towards each stage of the game, showing the trench lines and fronts in the Western Theater. The game is also brilliantly atmosphere depending on how far you are in the game, there are four main stages that definately show this. Towards the start of the game you play as Emile, a french farmer turned soldier, and you go through basic training. During this you see all these soldiers in this bright, sunny, and colorful training area, flags and insignia are easy to spot and you get this proud, nationalistic sense of the area, that the French are confidant in victory. Shortly after that you are at a train station, soldiers about to be loaded onto the train, headed for war. The colors are bright, happy, and lively. Their uniforms are bright and clean, you can clearly see the blue shirts and red pants of the French Uniform. The soldiers are talking and their is even a little band there by the train, You get this overall feeling that the French are optimstic in the war, ready to see combat, and that they will kick the German army's♥♥♥♥♥all the way back to Berlin, That the war will be over in weeks with little loss or devastation. Later in the game its winter, and everyone feels it, though doesn't pause the war from it. The people and in general the entire stage is greyer, more war battered and combat experienced. You can tell that the Morale is lower, soldiers complain about not having shoes or socks and the bad meals, when they get food at all. You can still see that both sides are still willing to fight for victory. It gets far worse as mustard gas gets used.Towards the end of the game it is pure hell. The entire war is grey and blood stained. Both sides are so invested in victory after leaving millions dead the men rarely sleep as they are constantly fighting, and you can see the desperation in the officers and the rise of tension between the soldiers and command. Emile runs with a group of French soldiers, its obvious they have had their limit tested through war and suffering. They are grey, dirty, demoralized, injured, and covered in bandages. As you run with this group of frenchies you run into a French Officer, I felt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by this guy. All around him were these wounded, tired, dirty soldiers and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is standing there, fit as a fiddle, wearing a clean uniform and looking like he just had a hot meal and a nap. He yells at the men you ran with to run into an onslaught of German machine gun fire. They are hesistant for a momment, but after more order yelling they run into the open area, only to be cut down in a swarm of flying lead. The officer, so desperate to get results, so out of touch with the soldiers and proper strategy, so wasteful of human life, so impatiant, using backwards♥♥♥♥♥tactics in modern warfare, gets the french soldiers killed. Its makes you upset inside. What happens next is pretty important so I won't spoil it here.There are a few minigames in it as well where at one point your amputating someones leg and if i recall giving cpr. There is also a part where you get a paper saying locations to destroy, and find yourself in front of a piece of artillery. Not gonna lie pretty fun shooting at things with it. Also has a fun though somewhat long minigame where you drive a taxi out of the way from bombs the previously mentioned Prussian Baron is dropping on you from his zeppelin, and you dodge various debris and garbadge in the road. The puzzles also are pretty interesting and complex yet simple enough that you don't need to look up a guide online. In conclusion Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an unforgettable and educative experience not matched by many if any games as narrative games go, a game about people and their struggles and history, national and personal. A game I highly recommend that shows the true horrors and struggles of Modern Warfare.10/10 would make german sausage again.			"

Good writing.Collectibles will make replay interesting.I like the puzzles and how the story is intergrated into the puzzles. I don't like dodging bombs, driving, and Anna's medical part. The collectibles and diaries can/should have been blended into the stories better.Play through takes about 8~9 hours. Wonderful experience.			"

												WARNING: Small spoilersAn incredible, charming, and unforgettable experience. Distinct from other games by its characters and their struggles, showing that not every one involved in war is just a generic soldier, and that everyone is a unique person with their own set of morals and history and their own way of life. A definate way its set apart from games like Wolfenstein and Call of Duty. Its a game about people, more loyal to eachother than their respective nations who struggle in a world covered in blood where the sound of clashing steel overtakes all. For those of you who dislike Ubisoft (I do too) i didn't even realize it was an Ubisoft game (I didn't realize U play is ubisofts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of steam) until I came to write this review. It is really not the type of crap (cough cough♥♥♥♥♥creed) Ubisoft normally puts out. Only downside is you have to go through Uplay to play the game.While it may be a war game its not action packed in the sense of running through the battlefields and shooting everyone you see, if you want that buy Verdun (WW1 shooter game available on steam) or Battlefield 1 when it comes out. The gameplay aspects of Valiant Hearts is that it is a puzzle game, of course with the World War 1 theme, which if your a history fan (like me) you'll enjoy quite it a bit more than say Portal 2. Instead of escaping a facility like Portal your turning switches and pushing minecarts around to turn off Mustard Gas switches so the soldiers can advance. In correlation to earlier where I said about the characters being people with their own morals, at one point you find an enemy soldier hanging by the ankle from a rope in an underground tunnel (he got caught in his own trap or was hanging something up and got himself instead). Instead of picking up his rifle on the floor next to Emile (one of the main four characters you play) and shooting the guy to leave his body hanging there, Emile cuts the rope and gets the German soldier back on his feet. While you may think its a poor decision the soldier then thanks Emile and you two go towards the German line, (something that would never happen in nearly all other games around) and once you get the the end of the tunnel you run into three armed German soldiers.

												As a man coming from Picardy, a region devastated by the Great War, and as the heir of men and women who came to fight in it, I felt obliged to play Valiant Hearts as soon as I saw the E3 trailer, and it became the first (and surely only) game I pre-bought on Steam. A lot of people seemed to dislike this game for the sometimes clumsy narrative (notably, the boss fights), the numerous clichés present in the game or the fact that it is ""unfinished"" (the story of George, the British, will be coming as a DLC). If I can stand those reasons, I can safely say they are missing out so much. Valiant Hearts is phenomenal, and as someone who knows the Great War very well, I can say Ubisoft Montpellier has done a monstruous work with their new baby. Many notable moments of the war are depicted in a very rightful way (the Marne, Ypres, Vauquois, Verdun, the Somme, Vimy or the Chemin des Dames) and the characters (Emile the French, Freddie the American, Anna the Belgian and Karl the German) are likeable and realistic. The gameplay follow as well with multiple types (minigames, QTEs, point & click) but never feels bland. Sure, this game can make the events a bit easy or naive (notably with clichés), but the Great War is a very complicated conflict and this game does a wonderful job simplifying it (even if it is only the Western Front!): also, I really liked the fact there are no ""bad guys"": you fight Germans as well as French as most people from both camps will try to stop you in your quest (war reasons...). Also, the folks at UbiArt (who already worked on the new Rayman games) did a superb job with their artstyle, cartoony but never childish. This is a different way of depicting the war far from all those FPS cliché styles, and it feels very fresh.But if I recommend Valiant Hearts, it is also for the awesome documentation that Ubisoft prepared with the folks that made Apocalypse (this spectacular series gets also a must-view mention from me btw); whether it is for the letters, the objects you get in the game or the simple documentation on the events, they do a great job explaining little details of this war.Valiant Hearts is a really good game, a bit expensive maybe, but it delivers very well, and even more. If you like everything around the Great War, wants to discover this conflict more or if, like me, your family has been involved in it, I would highly recommend giving it a try.Also: there is a dog in this game. And he does everything. Literally: EVERYTHING.Also: feels. A lot of them.			"

												Despite this being an Ubisoft game it turned out much better then I expected. The visuals were unique and the controls were very easy and straight forward. I am not much of a puzzle gamer but all the puzzles in this game tend to be quick and are rarely tedious. They generally do not impede the flow of the game or the story.They brought in some great ideas in the fields of sneaking and driving. The driving parts although few and far between (and short lived) were by far my favourites. They were fun and brilliantly put together.I did encounter some bugs that stopped the progress of the game but considering how frequently the game saves for you its not an issue.What surprised me the most was the story and history lesson about one of the ugliest and costliest wars this world has seen. You do start to care for the characters and the game threw one or two curveballs I really was not expecting. Throughout the game you find trinkets and receive automatic journal entries that detail some information on the life of a soldier at that time, how they survived, the sordid conditions they had to endure etc.Its a quick game to work through and I have no regrets on picking it up.

												Au-au.-FreddieBeen playing for a little bit (3.5 hours), currently on Chapter 3 (out of 4 in total). The game is absolutely fantastic. The war feeling and the charisma of every single character truly add to the experience. Although the gameplay can sometimes feel a little repetitive, the beautiful art will definitely keep things fresh.The game isn't difficult at all. So far, I didn't have to look up any hints or anything of the sort. There is a Veteran mode, but I'm not sure what that does. I've been playing on ""normal"" as this is my first playthrough. There are 50+ collectibles in-game though, spread throughout every chapter, that you can try to collect even after you finish the game.It's impossible to be disappointed by Valiant Hearts. The game is definitely not as touching as the trailer is, but it's still a wonderful experience that's worth playing.			"

												The game has been a bit mishandled. It was announced around the same time as Child of Light but did not get near the marketing push that game did. It also was advertised as being this very somber tale about the gruesome realities of war. But that's really not the case. Quite a large chunk of the game is sort of action adventureish. I might even dare use words like ""caper."" There's even a few comedy segments. The game is sad when it gets down to it, but if you're looking for a game that maybe does more than lecture you on the horrors of war, this might be it.Anyways, gameplay was never really shown much for this game. It'd say it's a bit of a blend of genres. 3 are most prominent though, and each level tends to devote itself to one or the other. 1st is the adventure genre. These are typical ""You need Item X, but it's guarded by Person Y that wants Item A which is guarded by Person Z that wants item B,"" sort of things so that you end up helping every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you come across in order to get a measly pair of bolt cutters. These levels tend to be either for character introductions or as pace breakers. 2nd are puzzle levels. These tend to be the biggest chunk of the game. You're often navigating large environments and trying to figure out how to alter the environment so you or NPCs you're in charge of can progress in the level. Lot of valve turning and sending your dog to go fetch items in these levels. They also often have some stealth elements, where you'll need to avoid patrols or distract guards. 3rd are more arcade / action stuff. Usually in the middle of a big battle and dodging incoming bombs and constantly running. Some of them have what could even be described as boss battles. They tend to get mixed up so you won't get too tired of one or the other. It's pretty well paced overall.Game is pretty easy overall. It's probably a bit more ""game like"" than say, Telltale's recent output, but most of the adventure elements are about the same difficulty, so expect more of a console ""adventure"" game than an old school PC one. There is one pretty big moon logic puzzle though toward the end. Puzzles seem to me to have never really been one of Ubisoft's strong suits, and it's largely continued here. But it's overall pretty fun, just not going to stump most people.The game is told through the eyes of 4 characters and you'll switch between them a lot. Usually you'll have the dog with you too. The art style is a bit weird at times. Very comic bookish, but more art comic book than superhero. It sort of reminds me a bit of Terry Gilliam's It's generally gorgeous. There's no real dialogue in levels, it's all very basic stuff like names or basic emotes (the cast is varied in language so I think this mostly works versus everyone speaking English or subtitling 3/4 of the game). In between levels there's actual dialogue. It largely works well but a couple characters end up a little short changed in the character development side. One of the 4 in particular doesn't have near the importance to the story or even a compelling character arc and honestly feels like could've been cut without changing much. The music in this is great and used very well. One of my favorite moments is a car chase set to the Can Can. There's a load of well used classics as well as originals.Anyways, the game is relatively short. Ubi for whatever reason tried to pad the length out with a bunch of collectibles scattered through every level which don't have a ton of relevance. I honestly kinda just decided to ignore them after a while, as I thought they kinda detracted from things. Seems to be a sort of current trend with some story heavy games where they don't seem to think they can hold your attention so they just vomit doodads to collect every 10 feet (recently Murdered Soul Suspect was awful about this too). But even if you try for 100 percent I'd wager you're looking at a 7 hour game tops, if that bothers you. But I think it was very well paced and ends pretty perfectly.Honestly I'm a bit flabbergasted that Ubi pimped Child of Light over this. I think Valiant Hearts will have more staying power than CoL, which is a game I enjoyed, but largely for the battle system. Overall, get it, it's good. Just don't expect it to make you cry every 5 minutes. But it does pack a wallop when it needs to.			"

												Despite all the drama, about this containing Uplay, it is unbelievably worth it, i can honestly say i really dont like Uplay but i chose to ignore it and get this, and i couldn't be happier with my choice.Edit : 7/20. , I have finished it, and i can honestly say this sent me on an emotional roller-coaster... i for one can relate to the horrors of war, the losses the agony the bloodbaths.and it captures it all so perfectly you can actually feel it.This is NOT just a game, this is a story, this is a whole bunch of feelings you unlock by playing, this is reality hidden behind pixels.You will be denying yourself from something extraordinary if you stick to your opinion on hating Uplay and not buy this...Every story that passes by in the game every cut-scene i just watch silently... the story is so will written that its unbelievable that something so beautiful can come out of such a tragic war, How all the characters have their stories connects somehow, how the plot keeps moving and keeps you up with the story without losing it for a second, how it all works out so perfectly this is a total 10/10The artwork simply is outstanding and it is something you cannot possibly overlook.The characters are well designed, their behavior their voices, their looks.The music and the animations and all the background effects makes you feel more deeply involved that you forget you're just playing a video game.I cant really find anything wrong with it, it is even educational, it has facts and real photos of what happened in WW1 and how it developed, how it started, how it was fought, who fought who and why.It slips you into its amazing adventure with that beautiful graphics and all the artwork and GOD I love that Walt ( Dog ) Character... Cutest thing i'v seen in my life, grown found of him.How you can keep up with the characters feelings by reading their ""Journals"" Finding items to know even more about what is going on, and to Solve puzzles like no body's business... i give this fact a full 10/10Summing it up With an amazing tear-dropping story that combines all aspects and mixes them in a beautiful master-piece.The soundtrack and effects are all so well-done ....i want to marry the entire Dev team.The puzzles, the action, the adventure, the scenes... everything keeps it all going on for you to not lose touch with the story or the gameplay.Amazing character design, outstanding levels, exquisite animations, and a tremendous story that is so epic words cannot describe it...if you ever had ANY doubt about buying this, and hopefully read this review and now all the doubt is gone buy it, trust me with this outstanding artwork designed as a video game you will forget you ever needed Uplay to play it, if you can afford, buy it at full price .... they earned it.

												A beautifully designed, highly polished and all-around impressive game of mild/average difficulty combining environment/physics puzzling with cutscene-ish time-based trials having you endure the hardships of World War 1 through the perspectives of characters of different sex, age, race and species (persons and a medical/rescue dog).The game has great art, great music, highly varied levels and gameplay executions (as much as is possible within this theatre of war anyway) and generally feels very thoughtful. There is a brief encyclopedia updating itself throughout the game giving info on the places you're finding yourself in and there are collectibles that are actually interesting to seek out because they relate to specific situations, behaviors or events of the time - for example bullet/artillery casings turned into other tools or decorative items by soldiers out of boredom, logistical necessity or in an attempt to keep the mind occupied when hunkered down in the trenches (I can't always be bothered with the brainless collectibles in other games; I might actually replay this one at some point just for those).The story has you switch between characters rather frequently, each having their own abilities of sorts and reasons to join the war (willingly or unwillingly) in some form or another until the individual lines of at least parts of them converge into one. This was done rather well, and has you wonder how everyone is holding up when not playing them, even though at times it can feel a little artifical how by the unlikeliest of circumstances and against all odds they still find each other again in a conflict as chaotic and brutal as this one consuming lives left and right regardless of ambitions and hopes. The story itself has some emotionally striking moments but otherwise left little impression to me. That's no real issue though since this game is more about the people and their imminent struggles within this time period which all works well enough as it happens. Even so I could've lived without the first half or so of the game having you chase down some evil German general criss-crossing Europe in his Zeppelin because that was just too much a cliché for my taste. There is a genius scientist of sorts too, fortunately not a mad one. If you can forgive these stereotypes you still have a beautifully designed and emotionally engaging experience that can be called bold for presenting things in such a rather unique, thoughtful manner and tackling a war that might be criminally underrepresented in games.

												This wasn’t as good as it should’ve been. Yet I still can’t help recommending it. Unlike Brothers A Tale of two Sons this game doesn’t marry the gameplay and story particularly well. There’s even sections of pure padding where you’re solving puzzles for no reason and with no payoff.Thematically it largely manages to pull off the WWI setting without disrespecting the dead. There’s a few sections where it feels like an adventure, like the kind the soldiers marching into WWI imagined they’d be having. I’m not entirely ok with these sections. It has a comic book villain, which I guess is appropriate since it looks like a comic book. But because it also tries to convey how horrible WWI was it feels out of place. I understand the need to not bum out the audience too much since it’s “entertainment”. But I personally would’ve preferred it to be darker and more authentic. Compared to WWII games though this is still way better.As a puzzle game Valiant Hearts isn’t great. Or even good. But thanks to the art direction, music and the attempt at a poignant story it’s worth playing. Some sections are brilliant, and the ending was particularly good. Too bad they had to pad it out with simplistic, repetitive puzzles. "

												Valiant Hearts is a masterpiece.Even tough this games runs with Uplay I can't believe how well made this story was and how even the facts they offer you start to amaze you.The artwork is amazing and the storytelling is great. Not only will you learn more about WW1 it also makes you give respect for all those that fought in that hell. I had a few small glitched but nothing major and I definitly recommend this game to everyone who loves single player games or games that gives you feels.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War StoryIntroduction:Valiant Hearts: The Great War (VH) is a story-rich side-scrolling puzzle platforming with some spotted action sequences.   If that doesn’t make it sound unique let me assure you that it is.  I am going to focus on the main aspects of this game to avoid spoilers so I will not be commenting on some of the specifics.  I picked VH up on one of the Steam sales for a few dollars.   This review relates to the PC version.  Screenshots by me unless otherwise noted. The GameThe Story – This is the big hero of the game. The story follows four individuals (and a dog) as their paths entwine from the beginning of WW1 to the end. The characters are an American soldier, a Belgium nurse, an older French father and his German son-in-law.  I won’t say what happens to them as I don’t want to spoil anything.   I will say that the stories are very well written and very moving.  The characters are voice-acted well and during the six hours of play you will get to know them well.   The actual game alternates between the characters as they go through the trials and tears of the war. How to Play – Most of VH is played as a side-scrolling puzzler.  Most challenges require you to find an item, use it in the right place and then move forward.  Some puzzles are the turn valves, pull levers style.  The majority of the puzzles are fairly simple but there is a hint system in case you get stuck.    In addition to the puzzles there are also action sequences.  Being set in WW1 most of these involve dodging artillery, sneaking past soldiers, throwing grenades or driving vehicles.  Again, most of these action sequences are quite forgiving so that they don’t spoil the story with needlessly atmosphere-breaking difficulty.   If you do get blown up by dynamite or captured by an enemy the game will rewind a few seconds so you never feel like you need to replay a long hard sequence and get that Groundhog Day treatment. The Art – The graphics in VH are comic-book style.  This is done very effectively with great animations.  Although the game is 2D, there will often be animations in the foreground or background to set the atmosphere.    The music is another hero of the game.  Some classical music is used to create pacing in the action sequences such as The Flight of the Bumblebee.  Other music is used in the puzzle scenes with great emotional impact sometimes.  The Education – Throughout the game there are loads of historical facts you can ready about.  They explain how the war started, some of the battles that took place, the weapons used, and plenty of facts about casualties suffered.  There are also over 100 hidden collectibles to find. Each one has a blurb about its historical significance.  Furthermore, there are diaries of the main characters you can read although these are not historically based. How I played itIt is hard to say much about VH without giving anything away.  The impact VH had on me was that within 30 minutes of beginning I was emotionally involved and eager to continue playing.  I played the whole game within a week.  The story was tense and well-delivered with numerous cliff-hangers to keep you wanting to play more. Near the end of most sections I’d hit TAB and read about mustard gas, Russian dog tags or tunnel warfare.  I thoroughly enjoyed almost everything, particularly the puzzles involving the rescue dog, although the first aid sequences were probably the least enjoyable. The only other negative is that the controls seem a bit arbitrary at first, but within 15 minutes I had no issues doing what I wanted to do. SummaryValiant Hearts is an emotionally charged game where the story outshines the gameplay.   This should be a must play for most gamers.   9/10 "

												Excellent game with a great story and some really emotional moments. Soundtrack fits perfect! Only negative moments are some of the ""mini games"", which really break the athmosphere sometimes. But after all, if you like games with a deep story, you will love this game.Playtime: ~6 hours. So in my opinion, the price is justified.While watching the ending/credits & listening to the great music, i just thought to myself ""that was some piece of art!"".			"

 Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™  Ubisoft showed us that if they want they can do an excellent game. Valiant Hearts is an adventure game set in the time of the First World War. The game tells a story of four people. Each of them has a reason to participate in the war, forced duty, revenge or finding his father. The gameplay changes depending on the character controlled by us. According to me this is a great and serious title with an amazing story and soundtrack, with many interesting characters and collectibles that give us a pinch of information and trivia about WWI. In my opinion this production is worth buying.  "

The gameplay is simple and allow to full immerge in the story, low replayability in itself (only the hunt of the collectibles or wanting to read the story again) but one single play... One single play of this story ALONE is worth in full the cost of the game.Buy it and play it, you will NEVER regret the money spent for it.(Only cons: REQUIRES UPLAY TO PLAY IT EVEN ON STEAM... But it's so worth that this should not stop you at all. On a side note I didn't had any issue with UPLAY at all so it didn't really disturbed me.)			"

												I beat this game on PS4 previously. I decided to play it again on PC. I'd say, by far, this is one of the best games on World War I.The four characters were tightly connected by the war they fought. Other than the French soldier was the father-in-law of the German one, the rest of them did not know each other until this very war. They trust each other with their lives. They saved each other, and would die for each other. This is a sad story with a stunning ending. It's a story about ""the little people"" during the war. The First World War affected everyone, regardless if one was a soldier or a civilian. WWI put both sides into a 4-year agony. In the frontline, war was no more glorious. The future of Europe lay dead in the trenches while machineguns firing, artillery shelling and poisonous gassing took souls. In the Battle of Verdun, on average, 1 French and 1 German died in every minute. And this tragedy lasted for 10 months! Back at home, families were shattered in pieces and family members were apart. You would even know if your loved ones had survived the bombard if you were a soldier in the front line. Remarque once remarked that none of his generation had escaped the war, including those who survived. He believed that his generation was destroyed.Nowadays people are still slaughtering each other in every corner of the world. We are experiencing war in video games and movies while people in Gaza, Syria, Iraq, etc are experiencing it themselves. Human history is a history of killing.			"

												This is another very short game with roughly 6-7 hours of gameplay. I can describe it as an easy hidden objects, point and click graphical adventure with many easy puzzles, with a mix of some easy arcade moments and some easy stealth touches here and there.You can think the price is way too high for a game like this and indeed the first paragraph sounds bad. So if you like playing games but you are the kind of guy that just focus on the gameplay, maybe this is not for you —or if you hate Ubi of course.Why all the positive reviews then, even my own?Well, if you however value charming characters, feelings and you are a more emotional, empathetic kind of person, keep reading. There is potencial you will love this game.Valiant Hearts excels in many ways. It has gorgeous comic style, cartoonish graphics. It is very polished. The characters have their story and it's very easy to empathize with them. But for me the most interesting feeling the game teaches you is there are not good or bad sides in a war. There are just people dying and suffering, both inside and outside the trenches. And there are too some nice persons caught into the nightmare the war is.Because of the negative points listed at the start I wont give it a 9/10 like other players, but maybe a solid 7,5/10			"

												Where do I start, this game is an absolute masterpiece and I suppose it's made its way into my top 10 games. I just finished this and I must say everything about this game was beautiful, the story, game-play, music & sound, historical importance and art. I recommend this game to anyone who loves history, especially WW1 (which seems to get overlooked, not only in games but in historical remembrance). This isn't an FPS, this is a game with a beautiful story and amazing historical lessons. I didn't even mind reading the long history mini lessons thrown in there, and the collectibles were nice too and gave some nice added character to the environments. The story wasn't a very huge lore oriented plot, it was simple, and I actually cared. The game-play was innovative and fun and I was absolutely never bored. Music & sound, just play it, beautifully done. As for the art, it seems like everything was tastefully drawn and quite attractive. The 4 chapters were an absolute joy to play through. I recommend this game to anyone, seriously, buy it. Le verdict: 10/10 - parfait !			"

												I don't even know what to say.  This game is possibly the greatest game I have ever played in my 27-year-old video-gaming-nerd life.  I love music, I love reading, I love movies and television.  Of all of these media, this stands in a category of its own.  Calling it a ""game"" is an insult.  It is an artful creation of mankind.  I can scarce remember ever feeling this way about anything.  I feel like Ubi Montpellier made a list of emotions and focused on making the experiencer (player doesn't do it justice) feel every one.  Few media, hell, few things in life have made me feel as deeply as this masterpiece.  This is a must play if there ever was one.  Valiant Hearts: The Great War will hit you at your core and imprint itself upon your mind, body, and soul.  In a world saturated with moneygrabbing trash games and unoriginal content, this is the brightest star in the sky.  This game is the ♥♥♥♥ing sun.			"

												Should you play this game? Well, it depends...From the game-mechanics point of view, it's not particularly appealing. Especially in the first few hours the game feels really dull because there aren't many game-mechanics to speak of. But as the game progresses it's getting better, even though the mechanics remain the same and there are only about five different things you can do, they are used in different circumstances and they bring a breath of fresh air into the game. You will do basic puzzles which aren't hard, but at least they make sense. There'll be stealth parts which are really basic and some driving instances which are really bad. The most interesting mechanics is that you can give orders to your dog, who can do stuff that you can't. The important thing is that even though the mechanics and little quests you have to do are not strong, they communicate a strong message (most of the time). It shows what was important for those unfortunate enough to be a part of the Great War.Some actions are there to represent the conditions of the soldiers, like digging through mud. This had a strong impact on me, because I've read all the little historical information offered by the game. The problem is that if people don't read them (and I bet there's a huge number of those who don't), the message will be lost to them. It would be much better if all the historical information was presented through the gameplay itself, or via the narrator, who did a really good job.The game caught my eye because of its art style and it was the main reason why I bought it in the first place. And although it's really nice in most cases, it brings the game down in some situations. The graphical fidelity of the art assets isn't particularly great and when the game zooms into an item, it looks bad. And I mean really bad - the game looks really unprofessional and feels really cheap in those moments. But most of the time the game does a great job of setting the mood with the colour pallet and all the assets.The story is about four more or less random people whose lives are closely tied together and you will play the roles of all four of them. The connections between them and their motives unfold as the story progresses and you'll grow to care for them.So, it's not the best ""gamy"" game but it brings about a really strong experience, if you can endure the first few hours (which you should). As for the price tag, I would buy it in a sale.			"

												World War One is a conflict that is severely underrepresented in all forms of media, but for videogames, it is in an interesting position. Many cry that it would be too difficult to make a game about World War One ‘not boring’, or ‘not too difficult’. Ubisoft announced Valiant Hearts: The Great War quite suddenly late last year. A new IP from a AAA Publisher and Developer is always news. Valiant Hearts is not only a new IP, but is a 2D Sidescrolling Puzzle game about World War One. Valiant Hearts is the answer to the cries of “Not too hard” and “Too Boring”, as it is neither of those things. It encompasses great art direction, style, music, story, and atmosphere. It is rare to see a new game like this from a AAA publisher, and I am quite shocked, and pleased.If you are buying from Steam, as with other Ubisoft titles, it does require Ubisoft’s U-Play DRM service. In addition, for some, the length may seem short (7-8 hours for my first playthrough). However, for its price of $15 USD, the length is just right. Ubisoft was smart in pricing Valiant Hearts. Valiant Hearts features four Protagonists, each with their own personalities and skills. Anna, Emile, Karl, and Freddie. Anna is a Belgian woman who was studying to become a Veterinarian in Paris before the war broke out. When the Taxi to the Marne began, she drove to the front and started helping the wounded soldiers of both sides. In game, Anna is able to heal wounded soldiers with a minigame that is reminiscent of Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Emile was conscripted into the French army at the start of the war. He fought at the Marne, and was wounded and captured by the Germans. As a POW he was made to be a cook, and Emile has the ability to dig in certain areas. When general Mobilization by the French started, Karl (Who is Emile’s Son In-Law) was deported from his home in St. Mihiel and sent back to Germany. There, he was made to join the German army. Karl also has a wife, and young son whom reside at St. Mihiel for the duration of the war. Freddie was an American living in Paris at the start of the war. Driven by a lust for revenge, he joined the French army. Freddie has a pair of Wire Cutters and is able to cut through barbed wire whenever he pleases. As well, his strength allows him to destroy any obstacles in his path in one hit. These four people are brought together by a German medical dog. The game is described as an interactive Comic-Book, and that is something I can certainly agree upon. Many sections of the game feature comic book panels showing something else going on as you are solving a puzzle or moving through the lines. The art itself, although it looks like it could be aimed at children, lends itself to a mature story about humanity and the true cost of war. It is a unique, fresh style that is surprising coming from a AAA publisher.  However, in some cases the Comicbook style is a detractor. For the first 3 chapters, there is a comic book style villain, and he mainly pertains to Freddie. There is a boss battle within each of these chapters, and each of them feels forced. They are extremely out of place, in what is otherwise a poignant story that does not paint one side as the villain. However, the epilogue to that portion of the story is a fitting conclusion. As well, Anna’s healing rhythm minigame can get tedious quickly. Had it been used less, or in each case shorter overall it would have been better. In spite of those issues, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a good game. It does not hold any punches in showing the senselessness and horror of the First World War. My favorite level is towards the end, at Chemin des Dames, during the Nivelle Offensive. With an officer to his back, threatening to shoot if he starts retreating, Emile is forced to charge forward and watch his fellow soldier be slaughtered. It is moments such as those that truly make Valiant Hearts a beautiful, poignant puzzle game. The Dog is also used as a good puzzle solving tool. He is able to go through spaces too small for the humans, and is able to retrieve objects for the characters, and is also capable of pulling levers. He helps tie the stories of Emile, Karl, Anna, and Freddie together well. He provides something that they can all communicate with, and loves them no matter who they fight for, or what their beliefs are. It is also an interesting addition to the game, due to the prevalence of dogs that were used for war purposes during World War One, one of the most famous being “Sergeant Stubby”, who was a member of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th (Yankee) Division. Showing that the war effected not only humans, but our closest animal friends, helps show the destructive power of The First World War, and war in general.  A detriment to some would be the historical accuracy in some places. Although the game is littered with facts (Hit tab in any mission, and historical facts relating to that mission will be shown. You can find a variety of objects in the game, and it will have a fact about that object, but more on that later). There are levers, anachronistic clothing, and objects abound (looking at that giant Chlorine Gas machine early on at Ypres), and to some that would be something to be put off by. Now, I am someone who is obsessed with World War One, and everything to do with it. However, in this case those sorts of things only enhanced my enjoyment of the game because it complements the comicbook style well, and helps keep the story and gameplay flowing at a good pace. An example of that would relate the story, as it would go nowhere if our protagonists were not allowed to freely move about the front. I am actually a fan of the charge sequences, in which your character is running to the right side of the screen, and you must dodge shells and machine gun fire. It helps break up the game some, and to keep you focused. In addition to those sections, I also enjoyed the vehicle sections. There are two types of those: Tank and Taxi. The Taxi sections have you driving towards the bottom of the screen automatically, and you must maneuver the car around obstacles and enemies. They also seem rhythmic as they are timed with the song that is playing. My favorite of those is when Anna is driving her Taxi away from Paris, to the “Can-Can” song. The Tank Sections have you moving left and right, firing at obstacles and enemies. These are also a nice change of pace, and keep things interesting. Something mentioned earlier was the objects that you can collect in the game. Some have noted that this seems out of place in a game like this, but personally I feel that the objects that you can find, and where you find them make sense. A lost Dogtag or Helmet dropped in the mud, a child’s gasmask in a cabinet in a bombed out building. When you pick up these objects you are treated to a factoid about them, and what ttheir context within the conflict was. It is an interesting way to shed some light on the war, and the objects that people used every day during the conflict. In the end, I really enjoyed my time with Valiant Hearts: The Great War. It is a remarkable game from a AAA publisher, and although it does have some minor issues, they are dwarfed by the good things about it. The “Come Back” trailer for the game said this: “Lives shattered, love lost. One day a farmer, the next a soldier. Sent far from home, torn from their loved ones. These unexpected heroes are swept away into the Great War that rages on, always hungry for more. War makes men mad, but Humanity can shine, even from the darkest of hours. And those Valiant Hearts stand up fighting for love, friendship, and honor. To the point of sacrificing everything, even their own life. Some made it, some did not. These are their stories”.  That is what the game is about, although names may fade, deeds and sacrifices never will. So those with Valiant Hearts, fear not, as your sacrifices are not forgotten.			"

												World War One is a conflict that is severely underrepresented in all forms of media, but for videogames, it is in an interesting position. Many cry that it would be too difficult to make a game about World War One ‘not boring’, or ‘not too difficult’. Ubisoft announced Valiant Hearts: The Great War quite suddenly late last year. A new IP from a AAA Publisher and Developer is always news. Valiant Hearts is not only a new IP, but is a 2D Sidescrolling Puzzle game about World War One. Valiant Hearts is the answer to the cries of “Not too hard” and “Too Boring”, as it is neither of those things. It encompasses great art direction, style, music, story, and atmosphere. It is rare to see a new game like this from a AAA publisher, and I am quite shocked, and pleased.If you are buying from Steam, as with other Ubisoft titles, it does require Ubisoft’s U-Play DRM service. In addition, for some, the length may seem short (7-8 hours for my first playthrough). However, for its price of $15 USD, the length is just right. Ubisoft was smart in pricing Valiant Hearts. Valiant Hearts features four Protagonists, each with their own personalities and skills. Anna, Emile, Karl, and Freddie. Anna is a Belgian woman who was studying to become a Veterinarian in Paris before the war broke out. When the Taxi to the Marne began, she drove to the front and started helping the wounded soldiers of both sides. In game, Anna is able to heal wounded soldiers with a minigame that is reminiscent of Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Emile was conscripted into the French army at the start of the war. He fought at the Marne, and was wounded and captured by the Germans. As a POW he was made to be a cook, and Emile has the ability to dig in certain areas. When general Mobilization by the French started, Karl (Who is Emile’s Son In-Law) was deported from his home in St. Mihiel and sent back to Germany. There, he was made to join the German army. Karl also has a wife, and young son whom reside at St. Mihiel for the duration of the war. Freddie was an American living in Paris at the start of the war. Driven by a lust for revenge, he joined the French army. Freddie has a pair of Wire Cutters and is able to cut through barbed wire whenever he pleases. As well, his strength allows him to destroy any obstacles in his path in one hit. These four people are brought together by a German medical dog. The game is described as an interactive Comic-Book, and that is something I can certainly agree upon. Many sections of the game feature comic book panels showing something else going on as you are solving a puzzle or moving through the lines. The art itself, although it looks like it could be aimed at children, lends itself to a mature story about humanity and the true cost of war. It is a unique, fresh style that is surprising coming from a AAA publisher.  However, in some cases the Comicbook style is a detractor. For the first 3 chapters, there is a comic book style villain, and he mainly pertains to Freddie. There is a boss battle within each of these chapters, and each of them feels forced. They are extremely out of place, in what is otherwise a poignant story that does not paint one side as the villain. However, the epilogue to that portion of the story is a fitting conclusion. As well, Anna’s healing rhythm minigame can get tedious quickly. Had it been used less, or in each case shorter overall it would have been better. In spite of those issues, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a good game. It does not hold any punches in showing the senselessness and horror of the First World War. My favorite level is towards the end, at Chemin des Dames, during the Nivelle Offensive. With an officer to his back, threatening to shoot if he starts retreating, Emile is forced to charge forward and watch his fellow soldier be slaughtered. It is moments such as those that truly make Valiant Hearts a beautiful, poignant puzzle game. The Dog is also used as a good puzzle solving tool. He is able to go through spaces too small for the humans, and is able to retrieve objects for the characters, and is also capable of pulling levers. He helps tie the stories of Emile, Karl, Anna, and Freddie together well. He provides something that they can all communicate with, and loves them no matter who they fight for, or what their beliefs are. It is also an interesting addition to the game, due to the prevalence of dogs that were used for war purposes during World War One, one of the most famous being “Sergeant Stubby”, who was a member of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, 26th (Yankee) Division. Showing that the war effected not only humans, but our closest animal friends, helps show the destructive power of The First World War, and war in general.  A detriment to some would be the historical accuracy in some places. Although the game is littered with facts (Hit tab in any mission, and historical facts relating to that mission will be shown. You can find a variety of objects in the game, and it will have a fact about that object, but more on that later). There are levers, anachronistic clothing, and objects abound (looking at that giant Chlorine Gas machine early on at Ypres), and to some that would be something to be put off by. Now, I am someone who is obsessed with World War One, and everything to do with it. However, in this case those sorts of things only enhanced my enjoyment of the game because it complements the comicbook style well, and helps keep the story and gameplay flowing at a good pace. An example of that would relate the story, as it would go nowhere if our protagonists were not allowed to freely move about the front. I am actually a fan of the charge sequences, in which your character is running to the right side of the screen, and you must dodge shells and machine gun fire. It helps break up the game some, and to keep you focused. In addition to those sections, I also enjoyed the vehicle sections. There are two types of those: Tank and Taxi. The Taxi sections have you driving towards the bottom of the screen automatically, and you must maneuver the car around obstacles and enemies. They also seem rhythmic as they are timed with the song that is playing. My favorite of those is when Anna is driving her Taxi away from Paris, to the “Can-Can” song. The Tank Sections have you moving left and right, firing at obstacles and enemies. These are also a nice change of pace, and keep things interesting. Something mentioned earlier was the objects that you can collect in the game. Some have noted that this seems out of place in a game like this, but personally I feel that the objects that you can find, and where you find them make sense. A lost Dogtag or Helmet dropped in the mud, a child’s gasmask in a cabinet in a bombed out building. When you pick up these objects you are treated to a factoid about them, and what ttheir context within the conflict was. It is an interesting way to shed some light on the war, and the objects that people used every day during the conflict. In the end, I really enjoyed my time with Valiant Hearts: The Great War. It is a remarkable game from a AAA publisher, and although it does have some minor issues, they are dwarfed by the good things about it. The “Come Back” trailer for the game said this: “Lives shattered, love lost. One day a farmer, the next a soldier. Sent far from home, torn from their loved ones. These unexpected heroes are swept away into the Great War that rages on, always hungry for more. War makes men mad, but Humanity can shine, even from the darkest of hours. And those Valiant Hearts stand up fighting for love, friendship, and honor. To the point of sacrificing everything, even their own life. Some made it, some did not. These are their stories”.  That is what the game is about, although names may fade, deeds and sacrifices never will. So those with Valiant Hearts, fear not, as your sacrifices are not forgotten.			"

												This game sort of resembles an old school point and click...only you don't use the cursor, if that makes sense. You'll interact with objects in the environment in order to progress and solve puzzles and move along the story. You'll be hinted at what to do through simple cues given by the npcs, and more direct clues in the menus if you need more explicit direction. You'll play as multiple people throughout the story, and each of them focuses on slightly different abilities.  You can carry only one item, which you can either drop, give to your dog (if it is present) or throw. So this limits what you can do and the complexity of the puzzles, which is okay. Some of the puzzles are tricky but there's always only one solution so with the limited number of items and small areas, it's generally not hard to exhaust your options and figure out what has to be done.The game leans style over substance, but not to an excessive extent. The artwork is great and very pleasant to look at, and the music is equally fitting. It has an emphasis on piano instrumentation, which I always enjoy. The limited scope of the puzzles is somewhat disappointing but there's enough variety to what the game has you do that it never feels like you're iterating the same thing too many times.  It even has a pair of events that's reminiscent of something out of Rhythm heaven, to give an idea of some of the ways the game changes how you'll progress. The only exception is that the nurse character, Anna, will have to go into a QTE-GuitarHero-Lite sort of minigame far too many times to treat people. The game itself is fine, nothing special, but you'll do it maybe 3 times as many times as you should have needed to.Might go without saying, but the game is extremely easy. Checkpoints are very often, and the boss encounters (not that many, maybe 2) are obvious general-fair that you've surely seen before in a different coat of paint. The story is not told with much voice acting, but what little is there sounds fitting and is narrated from a third person view, with the characters only rarely ever speaking full lines for themselves. There's also optional diary entries for the characters, as well as little factoids that will act as educational snippets about WWI. It's all optional, but it's good to see that at least some deal of research was done to keep this portrayal of the war to be somewhat faithful and respectful.It probably took me like 6 hours to go through. There's collectibles but that don't seem to do anything other than...be collectible. The UPlay unlock is just 4 parts of a comic. Yeah, it requires Uplay. Once I remembered my login and updated, I didn't have any issues. So a fun game to spend a couple evenings on, especially if you got it for cheap. The last sequence is pretty memorable. Just don't expect something complex or challenging.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is very different to all of war games have been made. You wont shoot as many people as you can to finish the game. It tells you how bad, terrible, and destructive war is.The game is about four peoples caught in the middle of World War 1, their all had their own problem to solve and destiny brought them together. Theres also a dog that will help and accompany you solving simple puzzle along the game. I wont say much about the story here as i dont want to ruin it for anyone, all I can say the story is very deep, and you'll find an emotional ending at the end of your journey.The other thing that I love from this game are its creative art-style and great soundtrack, delivering such an enjoyment as you playing the game.Conclusion, I can recommend this game to all of you.+ PositiveStorytellingCreative art-styleGood soundtrackSimple puzzle & gameplayDelivering collectible items & facts about WW1Not Call of Duty- NegativeReplayableUPlayScore: 9/10*edit: I nominated this game in Steam Award for ""The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award"" category.

												Valiant Hearts is an Ubisoft Montpellier game made with the UbiArt Framework engine. This alone should be enough to convince you to buy Valiant Hearts, but let's go on. :DAt first I was puzzled about what this game was about, since the marketing campaign of Valiant Hearts was handled poorly. In the end, Valiant Hearts is an adventure game with puzzle/action/stealth elements. The gameplay is pretty basic: the game is more about telling a story and making you learn something. Even though the gameplay is basic, it's still appealing and well-paced enough to keep you engaged until the end.The plot is about four characters (and a dog), which stories intertwine as the First World War rages on. It tells about their struggles, their motivations and their desperations. It's a grim tale where hope is the only element that makes men and women keep going on. You'll grow fond of the characters, and as you play you'll empathize with them. The presentation helps greatly in making you 'feel' the story and empathize with the characters: the artwork is phenomenal, the music is always spot on. Playing is truly a joy for the eyes and ears, the UbiArt Framework has delivered once again. The game is also full of information about the war. Reading such information is totally optional, but you should not skip it. :)My only gripe is that there is a story arc which could have been excluded from the game without consequences. It's not a meaningful story arc, actually it's detrimental to the whole plot (you'll see by yourself, no spoilers here).I hope this game and Child of Light performed well, so we can get more games like these from Ubisoft.

												An awesome story about World War I and how people was affected by it. The story, art and sound are excellent. The gameplay is hard to describe, it's a mix of not really hard puzzles, some action and stealth scenes, that are hard to describe without spoiling parts of the story. Found 2 bugs that blocked the advance and had to restart from last savepoint. Did I say that I loved the story?  Just beautiful. Give it a try, you won't regret, I hope :)			"

												To this day the single most tear-jerking game I have ever played. Don't be fooled by the cartoony graphics, you're in for some heavy stuff. Consisting of four related emotional storylines, the game presents a horribly realistic outlook on wars and at the same time educates you about all the atrocities that happened during WW1 via collectible items and historical facts. The only drawback is the repetitive gameplay, but it's too short for it to really start bothering you.			"

A great story with enjoyable gameplayValiant Hearts: The Great War is a game set in the dark days of World War 1. You are put in the shoes of 4 different  characters, each set on their own personal goal. Emilie, the old father, drafted in the french army against his will. Freddie, A american volunter fighting for his wife. Anna, A belgian nurse looking for her father. Karl, emiles son in law and german soldier.Amazing story worthy of an oscarFirst thing first. I mainly bought this game because of the story and setting. I had read so many good reviews for this game and the fact that I am interested in both world wars. I got what I paid for and more. At first the story starts of a bit slow. Emile says goodbye and are drafted in the army. We dont know what Karl is doing for the moment and we meet Freddie at the train station. However the story picks up quickly and once it does you heart will be pumping. Now I am going to try and keep this short and not give away too many spoilers considering this game focuses a lot on story. The story is very similair to the classic war movies/series like Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers and Generation War. This game is not like the story of Call of Duty, Battlefield or Medal of Honor (Comparing to the topic here). In this game war is hell on earth, and there is nothing worse than war. Now that is what makes this game different from those games. You can also learn a lot from this game aswell. While playing the game you can pick up collectibles. each time you find a new collectible, you get a new entry in the journal, which describes the object and gives us information about it. each chapter and mission has it's own entry in the book and tells about the battles like, verdun, somme etc. During my history class I can tell you that I pretty much owned the test thanks to this game. Very simple puzzle based gameplayI had already seen gameplay of this game, so I already knew what to expect. To be honest I was surprised by it, and I had alot of fun. The gameplay is so simple but yet addicting somehow and the puzzles are simple but yet tricky in some parts. I think that the collectibles also has a very strong part in the gameplay considering I was looking for them throughout the whole game and it added alot more to the experience. Not much more to say other that it was fun and simple.Would buy againThis game lives up to it's reviews and more. Got a good grade on my history test and I enjoyed every second playing it. Worth the money.			"

The game has disastrously beautiful soundtracks that bring some real charm into the gaming process. Graphics are astonishigly good, they really look exotic and I'd say they remind me of comics. All characters have their own charisma and the war somehow makes their destinies interconnected.The story is rich even though the game may be a bit short but I still was absolutely satisfied. The game also gives the player lots of interesting information related to the First World War, I really enjoyed reading all those facts showing how cruel the war was. 9/10.			"

												Valiant Hearts is most definitely a worthwhile experience and not solely because it explores that often overlooked subject of World War 1, but also because it manages to be a competent if somewhat simple game. Speaking about the game - you should most definitely activate Veteran mode to turn off most prompts and alike because it's not like the game itself is actually difficult in its side scrolling ways, some light puzzles included, but also because it does wonders for immersion factor if you care about such things. And you should because the game's storytelling hits that right dose of minimalism infused with mellow narration that keeps you invested in Emile's, Karl's and others' stories throughout the game as they go through the horrors of war. In my opinion game gets better as it goes on relying less on direct narration and more on pure atmosphere and sparingly used set-pieces, especially in the last chapter. I guess in the end it depends heavily on your emotional investment in characters and their stories, but I would definitely recommend it if you're into story-driven games with some relatively basic gameplay.

												Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, history, or just a good story. The tale of four normal people caught up in a horrendous, bloody, and ultimately pointless meat grinder of a war really brings a human element along with it. Despite actual spoken dialogue being somewhat rare outside of the narration, it's easy to connect with the characters as they try to survive The Great War with their (extremely cute) canine companion.If you get this game (which, again, I very much recommend) then get a box of tissues. Actually, make that two boxes. To be on the safe side, of course. The game is a real tearjerker. 9/10			"

												I'm about 3/4 done with this game now and it's one of the best surprises I've had in awhile. The genre can most accurately be described as Adventure game with some light arcade elements, however the actions you will be performing range from ""Pipe Dream"" style puzzles to angle based tank artillery combat. The stoy keeps you interested and the characters are almost instantly lovable. Each ""Valiant Heart"" has their own speciality and personality which makes them all feel like people you'd like to see make it to the end of their Great War tale. Sadly, this won't be the case (as you know from the outset). Who will live and who will die provides drama, but the great music and haunting backgrounds do more than enough to create atmosphere without the fear of death.If you enjoy games about human strife and warfare without the need to constantly shoot someone, or if you just like a good adventure game with a fairly easy difficulty curve, you will love this game.

(TL:DR and Multiple-Character Perspective/Gameplay portion continued in comments. Not enough space.)I received this game from a friend that I consider my brother and know in person, Earl[33rd], and thank him immensely for the opportunity to play this heart-pulling title! Also a special thanks to LockeProposal of Locke’s Big Day Out for reviewing this lengthy review! Valiant Hearts is a game that is, simple enough, one that focusses on the story as an experience with puzzle elements, with World War I taking the setting in comparison to the generic World War II setting. This title takes approximately 7 hours to finish-probably much less if you do not mess up on the puzzles as much as I did-but thought the game to be challenging as it was intriguing. Oh, and this requires UPlay, which does not take long to set up. Apart from the practical things you might hear about Valiant Hearts, I must say that the game pulled at my heartstrings quite severely, boasting an amazing story that is effectively presented in ways that will be explored below. Even if you believe yourself to be proficient in World War history, the pure magnitude and scope of this game's masterful storytelling will find ways to show you something new. It does well to explore the conflict, more as a person affected, and less as a distant observer.There are a few things that I found really interesting about this title:Voice Acting (or the lack thereof) - Valiant Hearts takes an interesting approach on telling this gripping tale. Though there are short phrases utilized by some of the characters to give them more depth-such as Freddie saying, “Good dog,” whenever the companion is pet throughout the game-the story is only told primarily through between-chapter narrations, as well as through other means, described next. This take actually turned out pretty well, in my opinion, as it allows the characters’ actions to tell the tale rather than context having to be provided by openly speaking.Collectibles - Normally, collectibles in video games are just that: collectible figures that are meant to distract the players or add extra content without contributing or taking away from the story. This is one of those rare occasions-shared with other games such as The Darkness II-that actually utilizes collectible items as background to the story in contexts with history. Also, the items are pretty well placed, so they do not feel as random as collectibles in other titles.Diaries - As explained previously, there is almost no voice acting in this title, but that does not limit the characters from giving their view on story progression. You can access these through the Start/Esc menu, and can give perspective to how the characters are thinking at given times. Some diary entries may be a bit repetitive at times (e.g. Freddie speaking of a certain person and not being able to relieve his pain of loss) but still are a nice little read.Comparison to History - Valiant Hearts moves between specific movements between key battles and events during World War I. The history lessons given in the Tab menu, diary entries, and collectible backgrounds allow the player to draw context between the game and the true history of World War I. For example, the Germans were the first to utilize chlorine gas as chemical warfare during this war, and these gas attacks appear in numerous portions of the game. However, if you review the entry on chlorine gas in the Tab menu on the level when the deadly gas is introduced, you are given a background from history as to why this agent was introduced in the game.

Review - Valiant Hearts: The Great War™""Spectacularly delivered! Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ brings you a classic deep and emotional drama that would make you shed tears without the use of romance.""Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ is a point and click game set during World War I. You play interchangeably between the four protagonists of the story. The game very well emphasizes the hardships and struggle during the Great War. You'll be able to see the Great War through Four perspectives. You'll encounter some puzzles as you progress through the story. The game is quite short with only 4 chapters but the plot itself is very much worth it. The story itself is the main selling point of this game. It also features some historical facts about the Great War and challenges the player to collect all historical items scattered throughout each chapter. The game's music and graphics are well-made. The narration is also done very nicely. You'll sink in into the feels as the story goes deeper.[b1]My Personal Rating:[/b1]Gameplay: 8/10Story: 10/10Music: 10/10Graphics: 9/10Overall Rating: 9.25I recommend this game to those who love point and click games. If you're not much of fan of Point and click games then how about trying it for the game's storyline? Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ offers not just the usual point and click puzzles but there are also unique minigames which are totally connected to the story. Once you start playing this game, the only thing left for me to say is:""Brace yourself for the feels are on their way!""NOTE:This game requires you to run UPlay so it'll be quite a burden to computers who don't have good RAMs and processors.

												Hello fellow humans, this is review is coming from an alien *COUGH* I meant human, who loves WW1. I'll try to write this as mature as possible (not really). Now, I'm going to tell you WHY you should buy this game. BEFORE I START I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN'T SHOOT IN THIS GAME, SO IF YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE SOME BATTLEFIELD ACTION GAME THEN DON'T BUY IT!!!So let's start with performance!:The game doesn't drop below 60 fps, even a Windows/286 could run it! So if you have a slow computer then this game is for you!          ==> 10/10So then, let's move on to the story! The story is better than perfection! I can't even tell you how good the story is. This game makes you feel like you're in WW1, the characters are superb, there is a mixture of puzzles and minigames. AND THE FEELS, I can't even handle them.          ==> 10/10Ok, were almost done (yes I know, this is rather a small review), controls.I would recommend playing with a controller, it's much simpler in my opinion. But on keyboard, meh... YOU CAN'T customize you're control settings so thats a bummer :/ But otherwise I'd say 9/10To add things up, this game is a masterpiece and I'd give this game a 10/10 just because I love WW1 and well done stories. BUT if it weren't for that maybe 9/10, depends. If you came this far I wish you a AWESOME life and pls feel free to comment, I love talking to strangers on the internet ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												This game just managed to take my breath away. It's rare that a game shows you that you don't have to feel victorious to make the time worthwhile.This is not a ""no guts, no glory"" game about war. This puts you in the position of unwilling German infantryman, just trying to get home to his wife and son. It puts you in the position of a Belgian nurse, trying to help out as best she can. You direct an old French farmer through the trenches and tunnels, and never feel like a ""chosen one"". And the American leading the charge? He feels more fallible than heroic.With items to find that bring up pictures and short pieces of real WWI history associated with them, you're more connected to these beautifully animated characters and the dissolving world around them. Well chosen music just helps to set the tone.I've wanted to play this one properly since it came out, and with ANZAC Day strongly in my mind, I'm glad I found time for it this year. I'd encourage anybody with an interest in the history and sombre side of war to check it out. Glory hounds need not apply.			"

												The short:Valiant Hearts is a fantastic experience that explores the devastating effects of WWI through the eyes of several different characters. The story is superb and emotional, connecting the player to each character through arresting visuals, enjoyable gameplay, and a soundtrack that enhances rather than distracts. Discussion of the WWI era is often lost in the shadow of it's more devastating successor, but Valiant Heart brings the struggle to light in a way that is visceral, honest, and captivating. Despite it's very few flaws, this is a rare game and provides an experience that is not soon forgotten. I highly recommend it. The long;Writing a review worthy of this game is near impossible, so I just want to briefly address the few negatives that I have seen regarding this game. There are only two, the need for Uplay and the puzzle difficulty/frequency. -Uplay is annoying yes, but once I was launching this game through my Steam library I never even saw UPlay. It was just like any other Steam game. The only time I dealt with it was when I felt like looking at what achievements I had or needed. Really not a deal-breaker for a prospective buyer and certainly not worthy of a negative review.-The puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part. While some do take more thought, this is not a game about difficulty, it is about an experience. The puzzles can at times distract from this so I do get why some people have issues with them, but still it is a game and some of them are actually pretty smart. I enjoyed most of the puzzles but sometimes did feel like I was just dealing with them to see the next part of the story. As above, still a very minor gripe about a fantastic game. Regarding the core aspects of the game: -Graphically the game is just gorgeous to look at. Beautifully hand drawn characters and environments just pop out of the screen and give you a perspective you have never had before. The game is very unique graphically and I couldn't be happier with the direction they decided to take here.-As we all know music can make or break a game, and in this game music amplifies an already engrossing experience considerably. In situations where it couldn't get more emotional, the music comes in and provides some serious steroids for your sadness. In times of intensity the music adds a sense of urgency and importance, with music starting and stopping on perfect queue. The timing and selection is just flawless and really well done. -The gameplay is loads of fun and really intelligently done. This is a 2D game, but there are certain things that just felt so innovative to me. Despite how it may appear, this is not a game that plays like an old NES platformer. You are not just running and jumping through a level, you're stopping, going, interacting, collecting, and sometimes working across multiple characters in the same level (across different ""layers"" of that level) to achieve an objective. It really is neat. If you are into the history of what happened, there are also several collectible items scattered across the game, each providing a brief background on how the item was utilized during the war. Additionally, there are journal entries with pictures and dates of the events that you are playing through at the start of each level. As someone who is extremely interested in history I found myself looking forward to these little excerpts every time I started a new level. They are extremely enjoyable and put the devastation of the war into format that is factual and interesting to read. -Story. I don't think I can say much here that hasn't been said already. Without spoilers, all I can say here is that this game is worth your time. To be fair though, once you play through it once you will unlikely play it again. It just isn't that kind of game that offers loads of replay value. You play it once and you're done, some folks may not like this, I am totally fine with that. Ultimately, this is a game worth buying that everyone should play and a stark reminder that war does indeed make men mad.			"

												That was one of the most amazing games I have ever played in any genere. It captures the horrors of World War I so well and the art style is fantastic. The way it tells the story and the way you feel like you're there with the characters is some of the best I've ever seen. There are very few moments in games that have ever made me shed tears, and I am not ashamed to agmit that the ending to this game is now on that list. No matter what types of games you're into, this is a must play game.			"

												Analog Reviews: Valiant Hearts -  The Great War


YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Valiant Hearts - The Great War

			Does Ubisoft's side scrolling adventure invigorate the first World War? Take a look at our review to find out!		

Valiant Hearts	It's easy for publishers to take a look at 20th century history and create game adaptations by ordering developers to simply squirt out another generic FPS game. The stalemates and trench warfare of World War 1 do not lend themselves to compelling game design however and as such has largely gone untouched. Ubisoft has stepped up and put together a creative game that not only recreates the events of mankind's first world war but has managed to do so with a bit of personality and even a touch of levity. The end result takes a bit of side scrolling, a dash of puzzle solving and a tablespoon of history and turns them into one of the most compelling games of the year. 	Diverging from action and focusing on the narrative and history of the first world war, Valiant Hearts follows the lives of Karl, Anna, Emile, and Freddie. Karl, a German immigrant living in France with his wife and child is deported in anticipation of war. Emile, Karl's father-in-law who is drafted into the French army. Anna, a Belgian veterinarian student in search of her scientist father taken captive by the German forces. Freddie, the volunteer American out to exact revenge on those responsible for the death of a loved one and lastly Walt, a doberman pincher canine companion who plays a key role in the lives of his human counterparts.  	Despite it's cartoon visuals, Valiant Hearts doesn't shy away from the cruel reality of war and puts you in the shoes of those affected by it. Whatever the reason the harsh truth is that War changes lives and the fight for survival is not only for ones self but friends, family, and country. It isn't always a dark experience, its visual charm and humor often gives it a soft hearted touch reminding you that even in war we can empathize with our foes in the darkest hours. The lives of our heroes repeatedly intertwine, along the journey, whether it's to support a fellow soldier in battle to aiding in an escape the journey is repeatedly done along side a partner developing them not just as individuals but as group. Each with their own goal but with a shared link.	With each new chapter Valiant Heart lectures the audience by giving the player a bit of history via pictures and artifacts. They not only give insight on the history but inform the player of the roles and purposes of the items found and the evolution of the war tactics.	 As a sidescrolling adventure game Valiant Heart's gameplay is largely composed of puzzles. The controls are the same all around with certain characters having unique abilities. Some puzzles involve item gathering and swapping while other become a bit more elaborate without becoming too difficult. They often develop the character and never feel too tedious with a only few coming off as filler. There's enough variety to keep  the proceedings fresh with a few tasks becoming a bit of chore while other are too complex for their end result. One moment you're assaulting a strategic point and the next you're escaping a POW camp through stealth, it's a brilliant perspective not often explored by developers with the given context. 	Powered by the same engine that gave life to Rayman Origins, Legends and Child of Light we could only expect the best from the artist of Montpellier. The necessary amount of color, and grudge depict the world brilliantly. The multiple layers and comic book strips are not only aesthetic implementations but a gameplay accessory. Most of the in-game audio chatter is expressed though jibber jabber while the narrator does most of the telling. It's a perspective that gives insight between character shifts without being out of place. The soundtrack fits the era and immerses the players into the experience, an orchestral tone compose of wind instruments sets up the action intense moments, as the strings tag the tense heavy scenarios. Let's not forget to mention the enchanting piano pieces through out the emotional segments, all in all it's an exceptional soundtrack. 	Inspired by the letters of soldiers fighting along the western fronts Valiant Heart inspiration is given a the proper care. It may seem short and easy for the average and hardcore gamer but in the end the experience is well worth the asking price. Valiant Hearts is an educational for those not so keen on history and a delightful take on a subject that usually leans heavy on action. The characters are memorable, the art is beautiful, and the subject at hand is real. There is justice done for this horrific time in history and developer Ubisoft Montpellier implemented their style to create an experience that honors the Valiant Hearts of World War 1. Score: 8.5+ Amazing art direction and soundtrack+ Memorable cast of characters+ Variety in puzzles+ Fresh take on a game inspired by war+ History lesson for non-history gurus - Boss fights are underwhelming- Easy for the average gamer- Low replay value- Short length			"

												Valiant Hearts is an emotional-driven game with good storytelling that revolves around the events that occured during WW1. The Graphics have a cartoony/artistic feel to it which matches nicely with the 2d sidescrolling-puzzle world. The Puzzles themselves are not too complicated However, they are intelligent and really interesting to solve. Also, if you get lost there is a hint system which can be turned off. The Soundtrack is a mix of orchesteral music that meshed quite nicely with the plot.The PC port is managable but it has no graphics options to tweak within the menus and is capped to 60fps. But, the game ran smoothly and I didn't encounter any problems even though it had uplay. I played this game using an Xbox 360 controller as it felt more natural since most of the puzzles have rotating levers that suit the analogue stick. Note that you have to plug in the controller first before launching the game so that it can recognize it.Highly recommend to buy this game. The story is very addictive and you cannot stop until you see how it ends.Serious historical setting, touching story with a dash of comedy. This game is deserved to be one of the games of the year 9/10			"

												It's a very touching, emotional piece of story with wonderful graphics and music. Worth playing as a piece of art. However, I can't really call it a platformer game - it's indeed more of an interactive comic book. It has some puzzles (most of them are very easy, just require running from one end of the location to the other, bringing some item on the way) and very few arcade moments (like car chase). The game is quite short and easy - you can easily finish it in 2 days with no haste. It's also filled with educational material and the violence of war is shown in a subtle way (yet your comrades are often being killed in front of you, be aware) - so it might be a good game for older children.If you expect a challenging, fast-paced arcade game - don't buy it. You'll get bored.If you want to recreate a sad, but interesting story, packed with artistic value, then Valiant Hearts might be a good experience for you.Just a warning - Valiant Hearts is an Ubisoft game, so it requires installing and running Uplay (even when bought on Steam).

												Great, great and great again!!! I loved this game from start to finish, a 10 hours dip into WW1 and in a melting multi-character story about war's harshness, stupidity and senselessness.At first glance, looking at its screenshots, someone could be fooled thinking this is a kid's educational game; but once you take the gamepad in your hands, you'll discover the comic style graphics are perfect for it, as every location is so full of character and detail. And when you'll hear the FANTASTIC instrumental soundtrack, so emotional and vibrant, you'll start to be captured by Valiant Hearts.The gameplay is on the easy side indeed, the environmental puzzles and action sequences will not block your progress towards the end titles. But during the game you'll guide different characters and in some instances you'll have to switch between two or more of them in order to help each other. This brings a bit of diversification in puzzles and level design, which is not bad at all. I also think that difficulty and game length are perfectly and intelligently balanced, keeping you interested and never bored until the end.Something that started as a small project to commemorate the victims and heroes that died 100 years ago in World War 1, in my eyes became one of the best games produced by Ubisoft in the last years, and one of my personal favorites. Not to mention all the very interesting infos about all aspects of WW1 the game provides to the player, from daily routines in trenches to the war's consequences on civilians. As someone said, this could be easily used as an educational tool in schools!Please Ubisoft, continue to support this little projects of yours, Valiant Hearts is the perfect example of what a very talented team can realize with a small budget but great ideas. We love ""triple A"" games like Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell and Far Cry, but sometimes a brief but refreshing breath of wind is necessary.

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™.  War-based games have been frequent over the years, but the majority seem to skip over the personal story aspect, favouring an ""us-vs-them"" mechanic that doesn't go too deep. Valiant Heart: The Great War is a puzzle-adventure game that changes our perception on perhaps the least covered war in Gaming; World War I. The story centres around the interwoven destinies of five characters, inspired by actual letters in that war. Each character has their different motivations, and it is through their camaraderie that they can act upon them. Each story is compelling, and you'll definitely be whole-heartedly immersed. The art direction and animation style is probably what you'll find the most striking.  The 2D comic-style art doesn't attempt to hide the gruesome and brutal truths from the Great War  , which is very important. These are incredibly sombre themes they were trying to tackle, and the fact they didn't skirt around or trivialise the horrors, is admirable. Its not all horrible, however. There is some great humour in parts, which eases up the tension. When travelling through each area, which is usually a famous setting or turning-point in the war, you can bring up war facts about the area, the conditions the soldiers lived in, etc. In addition, each level has collectables to find, which sheds further light in retelling what life was like at those times. This experience wasn't only immersive, but also educational. I learned far more here than I probably would in a lecture environment. Maybe, in future, games like these can be used for more formal educational purposes.  The orchestral soundtrack was perfectly fitting to each scenario.  Haunting when trudging past piles of corpses, yet delightful when in a car chases (to the music of the can-can, to name one!). The puzzles themselves have a perfect difficulty curve as you progress. In no point did I get truly frustrated, yet you feel pretty clever when you get it right. The tasks range from going on scavenger hunts, trading with several people until you get what you need, to digging your way around trenches, to safe-cracking. Plenty of variety.  Overall, this small-scale human perspective of the war is an excellent way of not only retelling an important time in history, but also producing a heartfelt story that resonates with you for a long time after completion.

												One of the best stories in gaming. The controls are straight forward and still allow for many unique puzzles. I truly enjoyed every second of this game and I recommend it fully. The game opened my eyes to the true victims during WWI and really left an impact on me I will soon not forget. It has one of my favorite endings in gaming, hands down. The Positives aside, the game does require Uplay which is annoying. It is fairly short but well worth a sale price! I recommend this awesome game to everyone, casual and pro alike :) "

												So I've just put a few hours into the game. And I must say that is a very very beutiful game.Incredible pleasing for the eye. I'e died multiple times because I've looked at the background instead of looking at the foreground.The story is incredibly sweet, and very learning. There is small history parts with every mission that explains different elements of the war. And collectable items that have a little background too.I like the puzzles, not too distracting or phase-ruining. Not too hard either.The only reason I'm not playing is because I need to hit the sack.10/10, will play again when I wake up.			"

												I don't know what you're playing at the moment but drop it because it can't be better than this. This game should be payed by your education ministry. It's a public service to society. It's fun, it's different, it's challenging enough, it's has a captivating naration and visualy refreshing. On top of that, it makes you smart, unlike anything out there.fun fact; the classic german pistol P08's full name is Parabellum, from the anciant saying ""Si vis pacem, para bullum"" (who wants peace, prepare for war) and the 08 doesn't come for the round diameter, that is 09mm but from it's year of production, 1908.

												I do not think that I have to do a detailed review about how amazing the game is. It's obvious. The storyline, the puzzles, the missions, the atmosphere, the music, the collectibles, the facts, the diaries, the characters - everything inside this game is excellent! But I just want to say about how I felt after playing this game. I felt educated, because I learned so many things about the war. I felt alive, because the atmosphere was so great that it felt like I was inside the game. I felt sad, because of the cruelty of the war. I really felt like I got aboard the feeling train, I went a trip with it, then I disembarked from it, and then it ran over me twice. I always enjoy games with a deep storyline, but no game ever has touched my feelings before. Why is it so hard for developers to make games like this? Why games nowadays are only mindless fun and they lack even a simple storyline? Why don't you take an example from this game? Thank you, Ubisoft, for making this game.			"

This game, has brought out more raw emotion in me, than the ending of Walking Dead Season 1, which I thought was my favorite game until I played this.

												A game which contains several puzzles, a few boss battles and is relatively short (around 7 hours). Valiant Hearts is more like a game that tells you a story, a story about WW1 of course. You have characters from different nations that end up meeting each other for different reasons.The puzzles aren't complicated and boss fights aren't hard, but they are fun to do. The best part about this game for me is all the knowledge you get from the many facts and curiosities that are given as reward for collecting optional items and such. As someone that loves the subject of wars, specially the 2 world wars that happened, it was a good experience for me since I got to learn about things I didn't know before by playing this game. The story is good. Before I played this I saw a lot of people saying it was really emotional heavy and I was expecting lots of things to make the players cry or feel bad somehow, but after completing it I must say it isn't that heavy. You'll probably only get the ""feels"", as they say, by the end.The only thing that I think is missing from the game is another character with a different perspective from the others (they are all on the allies side), it really bothers me how there's no one having their story told from the German side (Karl doesn't count), specially since that kind of perspective is very often not known by people. I wouldn't say the game tries to deliver the ""good guys vs bad guys"" crap, but if I was making the game I would add another character.I rate this game 7/10 and recommend buying it during a sale if you like games that focus on the story and find the history of WW1 interesting.

												It is difficult for me to write a negative review for this game because I find its goal absolutely admirable. The Great War is a notoriously difficult topic to approach due its complexity and, to a contemporary observer, absurdity. As such, the AAA industry is frequently guilty of 'WWII-fying' WWI (actually Valiant Hearts is also somewhat guilty of this to some extent). Incidentally I believe that some people will vehemently disagree with my assessment and believe me, I really wanted to love this game. At the very least, I would like to see other attempts at the challenge Ubisoft Montpellier set before themselves. Eventually somebody is bound to succeed at it.The main problem of Valiant Hearts is the extreme inconsistency between the tone and the subject matter. This is the single worst conflict in human history, as horrifying to the people of last century as is to us today and yet this war is stylized here as a Franco-Belgian bande dessinée. You may argue that the cute cartoony style is used to attenuate of the sheer unspeakable terror of the war but if so, the stylization goes too far and robs the scenes of their impact. Valiant Hearts does attempt to redress itself towards the end with the mountains of corpses and hellish landscape of Chemin des Dames but this actually sends the wrong message by implying that the Nivelle Offensive was somehow worse than the rest of the war (if you disagree with this particular point, I invite you to compare this chapter with the depiction of Verdun earlier in the game).While the story is at least serviceable, there are several things I wanted to point out. First of all, it is quite strange that the protagonists of Valiant Hearts include an old French farmer, a German expatriate living in France, an African-American who volunteered to fight in the French army and a Belgian faculty of medicine student in Paris. You can see the pattern here, right? Walt the dog is basically the only character who is not affiliated in any way with France. You may argue that this was a deliberate decision to allow the characters to meet sooner in the story but, by taking clear sides in the conflict, Ubisoft Montpellier made a big mistake. After portraying Germans as sausage-munching, beer-guzzling mustachioed villains throughout the first half of the game the developers did only token attempts to undo this stereotyping by the story’s conclusion. While I can’t blame a French developer for siding with France in a fictional depiction of WWI, the war requires a more nuanced approach and Ubisoft’s partisanship contributes to an industry-wide misrepresentation of WWI. It is downright irresponsible to draw from WWII archetypes to characterize Baron von Dorf. I don’t care that a 20th century French peasant is somehow fluent in English and appears to be the strongest man alive. I draw the line at Baron von Dorf however: the character belongs in Wacky Races, not in a historical drama.When it comes to the gameplay of Valiant Hearts, I admit to being something of a fan. The list of influences is wide and varied, including titles such as The Incredible Machine, Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, Metal Slug and the Sierra/LucasArts classic adventure games. Despite the simplicity of the controls scheme the game was quite varied and enjoyable, save a few trial-and-error action sections towards the end of the story. I do not actually have many complaints here. The annoying hint messages, which appeared whenever you stopped to admire the multi-leveled level art, were completely unnecessary and got in the way. Admittedly this is a minor complaint and in fact I can only think of one major gameplay issue: Anna’s QTEs. QTEs in general are something of a lazy shortcut, used whenever the designer wants to keep the player engaged in the game but can’t come up with anything better than timed button prompts. In Valliant Hearts Anna’s rhythm game sections are initially harmless but quickly overstay their welcome. More importantly, the ‘game-ness’ of QTEs actively distracts from the unpleasant nature of Anna’s actual tasks, which include applying stitches and even an amputation! In fact the game's finale is particulary impacted by these obnoxious QTEs. Fortunately the ending still has emotional impact due to the strength of the overall presentation.Like I wrote at the beginning, I really wanted to like this game. It certainly has a lot of merit but for me the bad ended up outweighing the good. I think the aesthetics and 'game-y' aspect of Valiant Hearts clashes with the message it tries to convey. The desperation and misery of the human condition as it is conveyed through context, collectibles and historical footnotes throughout the game is frequently undermined by the chunky and friendly exaggerated art-style, silly mumbling voices and Walt’s disarming charm. I applaud Ubisoft Montpellier for attempting to convey the tragedy of the Great War to a wider audience but I find the results unconvincing and difficult to recommend.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Ubisoft Montpellier Publishers: UbisoftInitial release: June 2014Genre: Adventure#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationReally well done historical account/recreation. Homage really. You play as multiple characters that are narratively connected but some of the time not directly involved in the war. The cartoonish style seems off putting for such a serious subject. However in practice the emotional attachment is that much more surprising and effective due to its first glance appearances. This is adventure/puzzle game first and foremost. You won't really be doing any shooting or combo breakers. Something I found rather immersive was the grabbing and then pushing, pulling or rotating things around. Levers, switches, boxes and carts etc. It felt like you were more responsible and had to take more deliberate action to complete the task. With that being said I had a real problem with the healing mini game that is mostly used in the Anna sections. Its a simple rhythm game with a bandage that will get progressively more or less bloody based on your performance. Its not a bad mini-game but compared to the to the other puzzles and deliberate action taking place. It just seemed like a placeholder. And as a result not nearly as satisfying to solve. Additionally, the game is well paced. From the somewhat leisurely if not extremely depressing POW camp sections, to saving people from mustard gas under fire to leading the charge into an impenetrable mounted gun on a hill. This was a pretty huge departure from the kind of games Ubisoft typically makes. And I believe it payed off.  Turns out, as if you needed a reminder. War is not so great.Follow my curation for more "

												Utterly brilliant. Valiant Hearts was an incredible experience to play through. Summed up, It's a side scroller with puzzle aspects, wonderful art, music, and a thrilling story. The writing is excellent, and the story is told very well and is fitting honorarium for the the many who fought and died in the Great War. The only real critiques I have are that some of the puzzles are lengthy and slow the game to a crawl, specifically during some high intensity action sequences and a possible game ending glitch during one of the chase sequences that does not have a patch available. *I should also note that I'm not really a fan of the U-play interface that must be signed into and used in order to play the game which is in addition to my steam overlay. I think this game is fantastic and worth playing, but the necessity for U-play is a big turn off for any additional Ubisoft games that require its use.			"

												Truly great adventure and experience! This humble game came out of nowhere and has a lot of going on. Gameplay is varied and combines puzzle solving with rhytmic fast-paced sections, it even has some boss battles. While generally consistent, it always adds something fresh and new. But most importantly, the biggest drive of this game is the feeling, overall atmosphere and art style. There is always stuff happening in the backgrounds, graphically the game is simply gorgeous and the biggest thing is, that you feel like a soldier trying to survive in madness that war is. Sometimes you'll get to kill others, but most of the time you spend doing ordinary things that aren't boring in the slightest. For majority of developers, FPS is the first thing to come in mind when we talk about war in general, and shooting anything that moves and has a wrong color is a theme that overshadows anything else happening on battlefield. Here, it's the opposite. Battlefield is the theater, but you're not playing crazy gunman #315 that kills every nazi (most war FPS happen in WW2 anyways), you're playing as a group of different people, none of them being Rambo.Which takes me to the next point, characters. Are all great and likable, while being quite different. One of the driving things is also that the game is almost silent, there is very little dialogue, well, characters and NPCs say stuff, but it's quiet and unless you speak german, french and english at once, you won't understand these shouts anyways. The game can be very light hearted (it feels like an old fable, but it's not disrespectful, it's still has a very mature settings) but sometimes dives into downright silly situations with crazy inventions or invincible airships, which kind of takes you out of the otherwise naturalistic and brutal portrait the rest of the game is painting. Well, I guess they had to add at least some shooting stuff as a safe bet. It would be perfectly fine without it, but it's not like those sections are annoying or anything, they just feel out of place. Most of the time though, it's great. And the music is brilliant too - doesn't feel out of place, but doesn't feel too old or archaic as well.There are a lot of collectibles which I wasn't sure about at first, but after I've found out that it's basically building a little encyclopedy for you (everything you find adds a little bit of an interesting background information), I've collected pretty much everything, because I love games that educate you in an entertaining and noninvasive way. It's completely optional of course, but it's fun, brief and interesting, because first world war is generally overlooked, so many of us never learns much about it.As I've said before, game is quite varied, there are no two levels that would really look the same, content is a king. I beleive you can finish it in 6-7 hours, which can look short on paper, but because there is always something new going on, beleive me, it's more than enough. Story and game itself feel complete, it doesn't look like they had to cut something because of budget limitations like in other games (namely Kane and Lynch), you'll be enjoying every moment of this game and for that, six hours is just fine. Overall, the game only gets better towards the end, so you're left with satisfaction.There are few annoyances like the occasional moment in any adventure game, where you just aren't on the same wave as the designer and it isn't obvious to you what you're expected to do. Annoyingly enough, it usually happened to me when there was no hint available, so I guess I'm just an idiot. I was fighting my keyboard before I've just given up and plugged in gamepad, it's clear they haven't spend much time making the keyboard version, if you have gamepad, just don't bother with it. Some bugs here and there, and the difficulty of quick time events can get a bit annoying, but those are small issues, there is nothing that would prevent you from enjoying the game.Verdict: This game has personality. Gameplay is decent, but it's secondary to the overall experience you'll get. So if what you see doesn't touch you, don't buy it, because you'll probably won't enjoy it.			"

												I am not an uBisoft Fan...far from it...but this game deserves attentionHow to review this without spoiling everything..If you are looking for a action packed game, well, this game kind of has that, but it is NOT an action game, it is a puzzle game taking place along the German-French lines of WW1 between 1914 and 1917, and do they take you all over those lines.  From Ypres to Vaquois to the horrendous Nivelle Offensive.  If you know your history--or are a WW1 nerd like me--then you can guess what happens action wise.The artstyle is great.  For how charming it is, the artstyle quickly delves into the dark, muddy hell that was trench warfare.  The main characters do not speak much, just one or two phrases in their languages...oh and a bark or two...but the atmosphere of the story, music, and even the artstyle is really something to digest.  From the beginning, it does look like it is going to be a light hearted...until the Battle of Marn where the bright colours of pre-war jubilee quickly turn into the grey, brown, and red hues of hell, with each extra ""cell"" (I guess we can call it that since it is a comic-book-style game) throwing in a great impact of emotion.  Thank god for the three driving scenes, those were a needed--and really, REALLY fun--break.I almost cried at Vaquois, and I definitely stared blankly at the screen at the end.So, unfortunatel, you need uPlay, but unlike the other games that require uPlay to play that I have...I actually want to complete this game.Shame uBisoft can't make a game with this kind of story for their AAA titles.----Side note: this game is what BF1 won't be.

												I've visited so many battlegrounds, read so many books and articles, seen so many documentaries... I thought I'd seen and read it all. I was wrong. This game just broke me. After the ending I was just staring at my screen realising so many men, women, childeren, animals died because of a useless war. So many never saw their families again. So many have been forgotten, sank away in the mud never to be seen again. And eventhough this is just a game, I dragged me in. The characters are fantastic and so relatable from time to time. The scenary is immersive and the cartoonish style fits so well. Luckily there is some room for comic relief but still... The hardest game I played on an emotional level.Never forget!			"

												A rather simple 2d platformer game telling a story of four characters whose lives are entwined together because of the First World War. My friend recommended me this game for its beautiful artwork and a deep, emotional story and as far as I can agree with the former, the vision of war shown here was in my opinion way too simplified which made it impossible for me to take it seriously. That being said, having historical facts added within the game was an interesting idea and I learnt much about the Western Front of WW1 that I didn't know before. Overall, I would say the game is worth checking out but I wouldn't call it a heartbreaking one.			"

												A puzzle game that takes you through the battles of World War I. It's kind of weird to have a game where you can dodge tank shells by car to the tune of 19th century composer Johannes Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5 in one level, and be pulling soldiers out of rubble the next, but I never felt that the zany sense of humor in the game was disrespectful to the subject matter.For some people, the inclusion of Uplay is a deal breaker. I'm not the biggest fan of Ubisoft myself, but I see no reason to hate it here. After you play the game for a certain time, it unlocks downloadable comics. For Far Cry 3, you unlocked wallpapers. You couldn't do that if it was just Steam, and it didn't get in my way in the least.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			"

												Valiant Hearts is as it says, a puzzle game about World War I. The game starts off a little too easy, but by mid-game I felt responsibly challenged and never felt the puzzles were so impossible that no one could humanly figure it out and there were many puzzles where I felt competely awesome for doing it without any kind of help.Any cons? The game's story can be a tad silly at times. Also the character Freddie wants revenge against this baron guy (you learn that pretty early on so it's not really a spoiler), but they don't really explain what he did. Without going into detail you learn what happened (kinda), but not why. With Emile and Karl you always know what their motivation is, but Freddie I'm still wondering what was is in better detail the Baron von Dorf did and more to the point why.An additional con is like with other puzzle games I've played I'm not really motivated to replay them because you basically know everything. The fun is figuring them out so avoid watching lets plays or you've pretty much spoiled the puzzles and the story which is the entire reason for playing this game. If I replayed anything it was the awesome soundtrack which is for sale on iTunes. Annoyingly you have to buy the whole album instead of the one or two songs I actually wanted, but if you like the soundtrack it is available for purchase.Also they make you play one of those Guitar Hero style button timing minigames when you play as Anna the nurse. The last one is especially frustrating and I nearly put my fist through my computer. But despite that I would still recommend the game because the rest of it is fun.Still the game really feel atmospheric and it gets pretty grim towards the end. I feel like a play a slightly cartoonish version of All Quiet on the Western Front.Valiant Hearts is a game that never overstays its welcome. With very little dialogue you learn most of the characters motivations and their backstories. I liked the art style and had a lot of fun with the puzzles. I think it might be a little lacking on replay value once you understand the puzzles (especially the early ones). If you are on the fence maybe what for a Steam sale for ask for it as a gift. I don't regret buying Valiant Hearts and had a lot of fun playing it and I hoping to see more story driven World War I games as we celebrate the 100th Year Anniversary of the start of the war.			"

												I'd first like to start by saying that for the longest time I've been wanting a video game that took place in the First World War. However, I'd no idea that the very first dedicated title I'd receive to fill that desire was going to be Valiant Hearts. At first I was quite skeptical, it being a 2D side-scroller that lacked direct combat and all. But the trailers had me hooked none-the-less, and I was eager to throw down my pre-order the moment I was able.This game had me emotionally involved the moment it'd begun, it has a very, very good way of toying with your psyche. At first, you're all hyped, the game's atmosphere when Emile goes off to join the army makes you feel powerful and ready, and the game does a good job at using the characters and imagery to make you feel a sense of patriotism for France. But then, you actually get into the war, and gradually that hope begins to falter as you lose faith in the grand scheme of your nation's war-effort. Instead, you begin to focus solely on these characters who're doing their best to keep their lives together in this harsh time, hoping that only the best can happen to them in the end.Instead of direct front-line combat, the characters you play have more support roles. Game-play is present, and it takes place in the shape of various puzzles and stealth-scenes that require a healthy brain to surpass, rather than an itchy trigger finger. Boss fights are satisfying, just like most of the puzzles, and the game does a damn-good job of making sure that there's no needless fluff or filler to waste your time; everything you do feels like it's where it needs to be and is relevant. This game's story is a tear-jerker, even if some of the plot is easily able to be anticipated. Yet, the writers did a fantastic job at unfolding this tale, and I can honestly say that it has one of the best endings from both a literary, and emotional stand-point.In fact, it wasn't until the ending that I cried, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's not a story about martyrs, war-heroes, or soldiers, it's a story about people who just want to live their lives and be happy. As much as I want to write about the only ending in video game history that ever made me bawl like a ♥♥♥♥♥, I think it'd be better to just let people who've yet to experience this wonderful title to indulge in it themselves. Seriously, you'll survive Uplay just this once, you damn pansies.			"

												Let’s state the most obvious flaw with Valiant Hearts prior to me actually talking about the game itself.This is a Ubisoft game. Meaning you are forced to use their 3rd party DRM, Uplay.Take that as you will, I just feel that it is important to mention when it comes matters such as this as many people deal with many issues in Uplay.Valiant Hearts is 2D puzzle game set in the first World War, following the story of several characters of which you get to play as Emile, Freddie, Karl, Anna, and a dog called Walt.The art style in Valiant Hearts is that of a comic book.In itself, this is no issue at all, it’s perfectly fine. However, graphically the game is unimpressive to say the least.Countless times I’ve witnessed the camera zooming-in slightly on a certain part of the scene, only to be distracted by the incredibly jaggy lines of objects or general area on the screen which I’ve stumbled upon.I understand that some would consider this a minor and petty complaint, but as I see it, it is still important to mention as it can completely pull you out of the game while trying to get immersed with the story telling the game tries to offer you.The puzzles are a weakness of Valiant Hearts. They’re no-brainers, yet at times illogical. They easily break the pacing of the game and disconnect you from its narrative.You follow our unlikely heroes’ unlikely story through unlikely puzzles.Most of the time the game is divided to the gameplay (mainly puzzle-solving) and the story. Both of which are the most important, main components of Valiant Hearts as an adventure-story-driven-puzzle game.Valiant Hearts is incapable of balancing these two pieces, and fails in combining them so they could add up to make this an enjoyable game.The story is emotional, tear-jerking, and as mentioned – unlikely. All which make it stronger together as a whole.It’s incredible to think that it’s based on a true story connected through letter from the War.The unlikelihood of the events of Valiant Hearts are what makes the art style fitting and not just a mean of presenting the irony and contrast in showing the grim, dark, horrific reality of war through a  softly painted world with the aesthetics of a children’s comic book.It’s also worth noting that throughout the game you are provided with little bits and pieces of information regarding the War. These are very much worth reading through. They are not given to you for nothing and they’re not forced as you can access them through the menu. All in all, in the end, after crying for a while, you don’t remember the puzzles. You’re only left with this one, final image from the last scene, and the beautiful, mesmerizing, heartbreaking soundtrack playing in the background.And that’s what makes this experience so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ worth it.

												This game...what to say about it. It is charming, yet somber. It is bleak, yet hopeful. You play as one of 4 people, navigating your way through the trenches and towns in Western France and Southern Belgium, and some sections in Germany. It's a fun, puzzle filled adventure that never punches you in the gut emotionally. You feel prepared for it all. When all seems lost, you steel yourself for it and you believe you can handle it...but when you get to the end, you will find that such a tragedy has played out before you. All those hours of that wonderfully sad theme resonate inside you as you begin to feel yourself fall apart. I don't know how they did it, but the people who made this dark but hope-filled adventure will make you feel as though the losses were your own. Perhaps you would think it silly or ridiculous to shed a tear for a game, but I think you would be heartless not to. I cannot recommend this game enough. Perhaps there is something perverse about feeling grateful to have been brought to such an emotional point, to sit for an hour after the credits with head in hands and so many tears falling onto the table, letting that beautiful little theme play over and over and over again. In the end, we have all lost, just like so many millions lost in that horrid war. No, the grief can never be comparable to actual loss or those of the First World War. But, in the end, you will wipe away the tears, sit back, and let that lovely, somber little tune play as you reflect on those valiant hearts.			"

												Without a doubt, the best game dealing with war ever made.  The story is both epic and personal.  Loads of history, and amazing vignettes, one after the other. The 4 main characters and the dog, all without voiced lines, convey such amazing personality and emotions.  The game is split up into 4 chapters and each of those into 10-30 min 6-8 part sections that make the game easily to play in short spurts.  The gameplay itself has a lot of clever puzzles that usually aren't overly difficult and many have to do with timing as well as logic.  None are every exceedingly difficult and there is a hint system that is available.The graphics and artwork are probably in the top 10 of any game i've played. I thought child of light was beautiful but man ubisoft went even further with this gem.  The music is also perfectly moving at every step.Every single gamer should play this for a whole host of reasons, which i think the nearly unanimous praise for this game is a sound testament to.			"

It makes you look into a war in a way most war games never do to explore said subject, it makes you think about the soldiers as the people they were, the lives they lived, the experiences they got, and not just killing machines programmed to follow orders mindlessly.It is also very didatic and very historically accurate, giving you one more thing to enjoy about it: The Story of the first World War and many things about it that you probrably didn't knew, too! While playing you may simpatize with the characters and feel for them, live with them, feel the joy and the bitterness along with them. It is deep and a truly great game that not only gives you nice info, a good and touching story, but also honors all those that should be honored but we often forget. Totally recommend it. "

												Valiant Hearts is a masterpiece in nearly every aspect. Valiant Hearts follows 4 characters and a dog as they try to survive the horrors of the first World War. Everything ties in nicely with historicly acurate events and areas in the game. The writing is excelent and will make you fall in love with each of the characters. The whole game is a rollercoaster of emotion from begining to end. While the story is certainly a claim to fame the gameplay its self is extrodinary. Puzzels are challenging yet enjoyable and satisfing and new mechanics are introduced throught to keep gameplay fresh. And all of this is packaged perfectly in a beautiful astetic and topped with incredible sound and music throughout.Positives:+Great Story+Great Characters+Historic Ties+Well Paced+Interesting Gameplay+Varied Mechanics+Well Designed Puzzels+Gorgeous Astetic+Wonderful SoundNegative:-Not enough non-cutscene voice acting-Hints are not always usefulOverall Valiant Hearts is an experience worth having in every way. 10/10			"

												Breathtakingly tear-jerking. Even ""Brothers, a tale of two sons"" comes second in these terms. Amazing art style, and storytelling to mach. And apart from that, educational in a way few could achieve. Truly a masterpiece, showing the horror of the Great War, the bravery of women, man and animals who took part in it, and the utmost futility of most of that effort. A show of the best and worst in human nature. This game should be part of the curriculum in high schools and universities, and a shining example of how to make games that are not only fun to play, but also leave a part of them in you for the rest of your life. Simply put, play this game. Expect to cry.			"

												World War 1 games are rare. Those with a compelling and touching story are even rarer. 'Valiant Hearts: The Great War' is a 2D puzzle adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. Set in France during WWI it tells the story of four characters (and a dog), a French, a German, an American, and a Belgian Nurse and how the war affects their lives, dependencies they build and friendships that are made in the process.From a gameplay point of view, Valiant Hearts is less of a game and more of an interactive animated movie/comic. Gameplay mechanics are restricted to solving a few easy puzzles in the form of tossing objects, pulling levers, issuing orders and executing QTE sequences. There are absolutely no hair-pulling moments or frustrating puzzles which is a positive because, in games belonging to the same genre, narrative often gets buried underneath tough gameplay and extremely difficult riddles.Art is one of the two areas (music being the other one) where this game truly shines. The art-style is, simply put, phenomenal. The story events are set in France and the areas include trenches, underground tunnels, field hospitals, prisoner of war camps, towns and farms.Now coming to the soundtrack.............it was brilliant! Easily the best in-game music I've listened to in some time. Really captures the mood and reminds you of war-themed movies like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.The game touches the themes of war including conscription, desertions and mutiny. The characters are very close to life and it's easy to empathize with their condition. The story is touching and, suffice to say, I almost shed a tear when it ended. Not to mention it was fun and very informative reading the diary and historical facts related to WWI that were included in-game. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is the best six bucks I've ever spent. Who says Ubisoft only makes rubbish games?			"

But usually, they don't cover them as effectively as this one can.) I know many people that are skeptical because this may be the first story based game they have heard of or played.

												2D Adventure Historical game. Main Story was originated from WW1 (The Great War), and the tension between France and Germany. We play as many characters like soldier from USA, German Soldier, French Soldier, Nurse and of course WALT the Dog. It has a nice gameplay and atmosphere that brings you to itself. Puzzles were not that hard but they were not that easy though ^^. And the best part is STORY, it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing that i couldn't stand crying at the end. Historical facts were absolutely awesome that you imagine that you lived in these age. I Really hope we can see another episode for this game cause it doesn't matter how much is it, i'm pretty more excited seeing next game more than seeing Half-Life 3 released. So if any Developer is reading this review please, please and please release another game like this cause we see that you guys made an awesome work there and this masterpiece deserves more award than call of duty ♥♥♥♥♥ ! LOVED THIS GAME <3 <3			"

												I would LOVE to leave a positive review of this game, but it seems that UPLAY won't allow me to play it, as it doesn't believe I bought the game, even though I bought it on STEAM.My 0.6 hours (38 MINUTES) of ""Playing"" this game, consisted of trying to get my login and password to UPLAY, so I could PLAY A GAME I BOUGHT.Apparently STEAM isn't a good enough DRM for Ubisoft, so I'm locked out of playing a game I legitimately bought on STEAM.Seriously, when is this Draconian DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going to end?I CANNOT PLAY A GAME I BOUGHT, BECAUSE OF ANTI-PIRACY MEASURES, WHILE PIRATES ARE PLAYING THE GAME WITH NO PROBLEM.This shows you how dense Game Developers are.I will tell you this though, this is THE LAST GAME I Buy from UBISOFT, and the LAST GAME THAT REQUIRES UPLAY, because they really need to rename it to U-CAN'T-PLAY			"

												Valient Hearts: The Great War was just... one of the most powerful games that I have ever played in my life. As someone who is an avid history buff, this showed me a different view of WWI that I have never seen before, a personal one. This game takes you on a journey of emotion among 5 friends, five comrades, five lost souls to the treachery of war. Emile, a Frenchmen, Freddy, an American fighting alongside the Entente, also Emiles best friend, Anna, the blue bird that saved them all on countless ocations, Karl, a French born man with German roots, that was conscripted to fight against his own family as a member of the German Empire, and of course, the beloved medical dog, Walt. These 5 characters take you on an emotional rollercoaster as they brace the harsh conditions of war together. You learn a lot about the First World War in this game, the bone chilling facts of the war and have your brain put to the test with the various puzzles in the game. I have never, in my life played a game that has given me so much emotion, ever. The ending of this game made me cry for 3 reasons; 1: This wonderful game came to an end. 2: It made me realize how lucky we of this generation are to have had such brave souls, members of that ""Lost Generation"" fight for us back when they did. 3: The ending was just terribly sad, I literally cried. I can't reccommend this game enough, it has taken me on a wonderful ride and I HIGHLY reccommend you all play this game, whether you know about The Great War, or not, this game will teach you about it, and do it while entertaining you.Verdict?10/10 Would cry again.

												Valiant Hearts is fun, engaging and terribly sad. The puzzles were neither too hot nor too cold, but just right. Similarly the history nuggets were all the more appealing for the engaging caricatures, exaggerated art style and fantastical narrative.Most all of my minutes while playing were enjoyable with the exception of those five  after the ending when I was too busy crying like a champ.10/10 would cry again.

												This game is one of the most amazing games I have ever played in a while. The music, the characters, the story.They all make a great factor in this game. So far, the story has been amazing, not to mention that it is emotional.The only thing I have not liked, is the need to install U-Play, it wasn't a big deal to me, but eh, kind of wanted to state it here. I appreciated the game a lot, the story is so amazing. You should definitely buy this game. The graphics are great, even tho it's a 2D Game, I like the graphics of it. You get to play as 5 characters in this game (states below);Emile - A French farmer who becomes a POW (prisoner of war) while searching for his son-in-law.Freddie - An American soldier fighting in the war to honor his fallen wife.Anna - A Belgian nurse tending to the wounded soldiers on the battlefield.Karl - A German soldier who is married to Emile's daughter.Walt - An adorable dog, who interacts with each of the characters and can help solve puzzles.Fully recommend it, as it is a very, very, great game.

												This game, I have no words.This game did something wat many AAA titles failed to do, make war look wat It really is gritty, horrific like there no hope for peace.WW1 didnt took as many casualties as WW2, but that doesn't mean It was a walk in the park. Charging in to battle with your fellow soldiers quikly turns to a nightmare, soldiers getting gunned down, blasted apart or worse.The amount of soldiers that were marched to their deaths is inhuman, but let us never forget those brave men and woman who fought for Europe and our liberty.But that doesn't mean Valiant Hearts: The Great War is horror game, it shows a story of 4 people Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl and Walt the dog.It tells a beautiful story of these characters that are trapped by the war.But I wont spoil anything.And then there is of course one downside. Uplay, even though Im not a person who gets angry that I have to install this DRM since for me it worked fine.So If you can get past Uplay this game is truly a glorious game.			"

												Can a video game be fun, emotional, and educational all at once? The short answer is 'of course' but it's a tough combination to pull off. Enter Valiant Hearts, a narrative-first, 2D puzzle game set in the oft overlooked First World War.Lets start with aspects that provide most of the ""fun"". The mechanics are a smooth blend of point and click style puzzles and physics or action based puzzling. There shouldn't be any puzzles that cause undue frustration and for the most part the solutions are fairly apparent for anyone who's been around the video game block once or twice. In other games the relatively low challenge level of the puzzles would probably be a detriment but, at least personally, in Valiant Hearts the puzzles were there to simply add contrast and tension to the story. There was even a small section in the final third of the game where the complexity of the puzzles started to draw too much attention away from the story, opening some chinks in the immersion.The hand-painted artwork is very well done, especially some of the character designs, but is easy to overlook because the setting doesn't allow for much color and variety. The animation style is simple but an effective use of parallax backgrounds give the scenes plenty of motion and depth. A simple but hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is used effectively and actually provides some needed levity during the driving sections.Unsurprisingly the emotional punch is brought mostly by the story. I say ""mostly"" because it was actually some background NPCs that delivered one of the bigger blows personally. With that said, the story is no lightweight, as is to be expected from a game dealing with the travesty that is The Great War. You play four, really five, characters whose personal stories weave back and forth in an implausible but satisfying manner. In fact that's probably a good way to describe the entire plot. While it's clear that the story is a work of fiction and contains some obvious embellishments, it manages to remain grounded through its presentation and focus on the personal side of war. The decision to not focus on nations and figure heads is terrific and gives the frantic and unexpected ending the gravity it deserves.Now to complete the tri-fecta we have the educational aspects. Despite loving pretty much all of the rest of the game this was probably my favorite part. In the U.S. at least, WWI is almost criminally overlooked in most educational curriculums, probably due to our late entry to the war and no fighting happening on our soil, so the chance to learn more in a game setting was exciting. Valiant Hearts accomplishes this in a couple of ways. First off they use real places, real battles, and an accurate depiction of the players involved (it likely would never have occurred to me that the Canadians were heavily involved let alone how instrumental they were at times). For me though the more intriguing tidbits came from the short historical background info, complete with real photos, provided in each level and the collectible system. Scattered through each level are a number of items relevant to the level and war in general. When you find an item you can open a page that provides a little insight to the nature of the item and life during WWI in general. The combination of dramatized but immersive story and real life accounts allows for greater impact than either could provide alone and there in lies the beauty of using games for education. I really hope that the developers can find a way to give some other overlooked conflicts the Valiant Hearts treatment.As promised, that's fun, emotion, and education in one game shaped package. Usually when making recommendations there are caveats like, ""probably best for fans of genre X"" or ""Feel free to pass this up if you don't enjoy Y"" but Valiant Hearts has no such caveats. I really feel that there is something here for everyone. Even if you know all the WWI facts already or don't typically enjoy puzzle games (there is a hint system for you folks by the way), simply being reminded that wars are fought by humans, on both sides, is something we all could benefit from.

												I've now finished the game in 8 hours.This game got me standing out of my chair at times of action and also slumped in it at times of emotion. Ubisoft has somehow made a game about one of the most devastating conflics in history without thrusting a gun into your hands and killing all those dirty huns. What's more, it has been pulled off spectacularly. The soundtrack is simply beautiful. The puzzles are clever. Hints are available if you get stuck (Which you will, don't think you can play this game without getting frustrated only to be shown the answer was right in front of you). The characters have so much personality. Although they hardly speak you know what they mean and what emotions they express. I could not find a single bug or glitch. In my opinion, best game i've played in a while. Crying in those last missions is understandable (Half of my sadness came from the game actually ending).10/10 It deserves much more recognition than it gets, buy it for your friends.P.S I don't know why everyone complains about Uplay. It's worked fine for me, i even got the comic strips from it.			"

												I've now finished the game in 8 hours.This game got me standing out of my chair at times of action and also slumped in it at times of emotion. Ubisoft has somehow made a game about one of the most devastating conflics in history without thrusting a gun into your hands and killing all those dirty huns. What's more, it has been pulled off spectacularly. The soundtrack is simply beautiful. The puzzles are clever. Hints are available if you get stuck (Which you will, don't think you can play this game without getting frustrated only to be shown the answer was right in front of you). The characters have so much personality. Although they hardly speak you know what they mean and what emotions they express. I could not find a single bug or glitch. In my opinion, best game i've played in a while. Crying in those last missions is understandable (Half of my sadness came from the game actually ending).10/10 It deserves much more recognition than it gets, buy it for your friends.P.S I don't know why everyone complains about Uplay. It's worked fine for me, i even got the comic strips from it.			"

												Fair warning: You will cry.An extremely beautiful, emotional game, visually similar to Belgian and French BD that will make you cry, laugh, dance, smile and scream as you follow the lives of five unlucky players in the great Seminal Tragedy. It does an amazing job of driving home the senselessness and brutality of the Great War, and the way people were swept up in it and destroyed without any choice of their own in the matter. Don't let the cute artstyle and funny sounds people make fool you: this game is brutal in its depiction of the horrors of trench warfare.Its gameplay is simple, even a bit rudimentary for a puzzler, but the main attraction here are the visuals and the story. The game can be enjoyed just as much as a playable motion comic as a video game.You have to install Uplay to get this game to work, but I think it's worth it, because everything is so beautiful you are made to forget about the vile, intrusive drm-ware infesting your computer.An instant classic.

												its an okay game. tbh i feel that perhaps the target audience (based on the gameplay at least) is targeted for kids it seems. most of the puzzles are pretty easy , and the ""action"" scenes are actually quite boring. there are some good sections but 60% of it is meh. if you are gonna buy your kids some kid friendly game, id say this would be pretty good in fun and education wise since its not difficult at all and all the puzzles just need a little look around. also nice to show them how horrible war can be so they can learn something out of this game (there is 1 section with a bit of gore like dismembered limbs, corpses and whatnot, but its cartoonish so i think its a'ight for kids)really dig the art style though. i find it kinda cute and fun. though some of the dialogs outside of narration sounds kinda strange like its garbled (or in another language) for the npcs. music is quite enjoyable and fits the game perfectly.they have collectibles in this game but i just cant be bothered to find them all because it gets boring after a few hours in the game. they really should hold off with the QTE nursing. i have played for around 5 hours as you can see and this is going on my own pace, and never actively look for the collectibles + afk , so maybe it can be even faster.characters are awesome,but only the important ones, the rest are intentionally just there to be crowded i guess. but the best character is walt, best doge ever 11/10 would doge again, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so smart and cute and pretty much immortal since he's not gonna die even if you try, makes you wonder why the enemy dont just kill the dog, because half the game you pretty much depend on walt to get to another section.theres also the driving section, its pretty okay even though they almost over-used it, i was pretty close on getting pretty bored with the driving sections.the story is one of those ""feels"" kind, although a bit predictable in some parts, the game says its based on a true story so i suppose it is. theres even tidbits about history facts from the game or from the collectibles you find, its nothing a good google and wiki search cant find. the game's story is gonna revolve around 4 characters which you will switch back and forth or even use them at the same level, each of them with their own interesting story.i dont think i would really recommend this at full price, since its pretty short and gameplay is really meh. the only thing that makes this going is probably the story, characters, visuals+art style, and the music. so i'd say wait for a discount if you want to give it a shot but not so much to grab it now.

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an adventure game that crosses a rather rudimentary platforming mechanic with item puzzles similar to those typically found in point-and-click adventures. Interspersed in it are driving sessions and a rythm-based minigame for the nurse character. It is set in the first three years of the first world war and covers the story of several characters of different origin and situation and does a real good work of what in a fully fictional story would be called world building, but in this game is history education.The game has really good music, voice acting and audio design in general, and the aesthetic of the game is based in a comic book/animation style that really hits the mark for telling this kind of story that is in essence rather grim. And make no mistake, it is a really grim setting. The story of this game has it's ups and downs, but it is in content really a message of how bad life during and in the middle of war can get.The puzzles are easy to medium difficult I would say (there is a hint system if you find yourself having trouble with any of them), the driving sessions and the rythm games are nice break ups from the puzzling, and there are a few boss battles as well.However, the story is this game is it's strong point. It is a really strong story, with characters whose motivations, dedication and emotions are well fleshed out and make you really empathise with them and the decisions and consequent actions they are forced into.

												This game, I have no words.This game did something wat many AAA titles failed to do, make war look wat It really is gritty, horrific like there no hope for peace.WW1 didnt took as many casualties as WW2, but that doesn't mean It was a walk in the park. Charging in to battle with your fellow soldiers quikly turns to a nightmare, soldiers getting gunned down, blasted apart or worse.The amount of soldiers that were marched to their deaths is inhuman, but let us never forget those brave men and woman who fought for Europe and our liberty.But that doesn't mean Valiant Hearts: The Great War is horror game, it shows a story of 4 people Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl and Walt the dog.It tells a beautiful story of these characters that are trapped by the war.But I wont spoil anything.And then there is of course one downside. Uplay, even though Im not a person who gets angry that I have to install this DRM since for me it worked fine.So If you can get past Uplay this game is truly a glorious game.			"

												Never. Have. I. Played. A. Masterpiece. This experience, no, this.....once in a lifetime event, the commemoration of the centenary of the great war of 1914-18, is an absolutely immersive, heartwarming, cold, dark, and yet unique take on the trauma and consequence of a war that really did shake the world. From the start off, I was hooked, the simplicity of the gameplay, not to mention the loveable and  well constructed characters, with a backplot not over-emphasized but yet provides enough information so that you can relate to them each in a different way, from the tough Freddie, to a father's love of his family (Emile), enough to go to war, to a german's complicated existence (Karl), and a young woman's heartfelt (Marie), yet innocent journey to find her father, this experience of the great war is one that I will not forget. The feel of each level is clear, emotions are high when going through this, i'm not one to cry, but this had made me reflect on the life the world has today, and the frailty of human life, why wars happen again and again, and the effect it has on each of us as individuals and human beings. I have nothing to recommend further, than this game is  a pure, honest and heartfelt account of various persons, going through their own hardships and tribulations, with the most violent and reflective backdrop. There is no need for action, the game itself is a work of art, and a masterpiece of the difficulty of the first world war. A game that focusses more on the real life emotives of humans, how events can change us, rather than a game of pure enjoyment. If you are willing to invest a relatively small amount of time, I heavily suggest you give this great title a try, and being the 101st anniversary of the great war coming up, there's no better reason to reflect on what many of us take for granted today, and how easily things can change, and change each of us.....10/10, an experience i've never had.

												Although the characters in this game are fictional, Valiant Heats teaches us of a war long forgotten. This game delievers something that I have never felt in any game before, and after more than a decade of gaming, it is the only game that has ever made me cry. Though being a fairly short game it delivers a message more than any other war game out there. It adds a twist of problem solving and the animation tops of the uniqueness of it all. It is important that we remember history and learn from it, for if we don't we are doomed to repeat it.  Bottom line, EVERYONE should play this game and learn what it has to teach.PS. I have never reviewed a game in my entire life until this one.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™ must be the game with the longest name on Steam :POn the 100th birthday of the beginning of WWI, Valiant Hearts was the best work of art we could expect, to mark this date. The game manages to teach us a lot about WWI (really, there is an exceptional historical accuracy, main facts about the war are covered and you get to play on some historic events), while also achieving quite a lot on other areas. The music is exceptional, the art is beautiful, the history it's touching. Only cons: Sometimes it's a bit infantilized for my taste, but that's because they probably created it in a way to reach the young persons, too. Overall, is one of those you should not miss.			"

												Valiant Hearts is not a great game: the gameplay is practically non-existent, the puzzles are mind-numbingly easy, and the graphics (though artistically really good) are very low resolution and look pretty terrible close-up. That said though, most of Valiant Hearts was a great experience, and almost alone amongst video games, portrayed war in a humanist manner. The puzzles and exploration of this point-and-click game is focused far more on surviving the fields, trenches, prisoner camps, and occupied towns of the Western Front of World War I, than on actually fighting the war itself.This is also very much a character driven event, with a cast of fairly interesting and sympathetic characters for protagonists, representing several different nationalities from both sides of the war. I would say that the game succeeds at neither making heroes or villians out of either the Allied or Central Powers, but this attempt is undermined by a somewhat out of place and ridiculous sub-plot about a cartoon-ish evil German Baron some of the protagonists are chasing down for several reasons. Luckily it isn't the main focus of Valiant Hearts, but this story ultimately ends rather suddenly and bizarrely and serves almost no purpose other than to give a reason for the characters to move from location to the next.The better moments of the game are the first half hour or so (as the blissful civilian life for one character is tranformed by the war's beginning) and the surprisingly emotionally end, though there are highlights scattered throughout. Overall Valiant Hearts is a mixed bag, and while I've mentioned a lot of things it doesn't do well, there's a real emotional core to this experience that made it worthwhile to me. Hopefully Valiant Hearts is successful enough to become a series, with future games that continue to maturely tell stories of living through a war, not just fighting it. Hopefully this series also does a better job with consistency in tone and having some greatly improved player agency and gameplay. That said, I still recommend Valiant Hearts if you are a history buff, enjoy character driven stories, or if anything else about this unique project seems interesting.			"

												I really can't recommend this game enough.  It's not perfect, but it tells a damn good story, has a lot of fun but generally not frustrating puzzles, and looks fantastic.  It also has one of the best endings of any game I've played.Honestly, my only complaints are that the driving segments were a little too frustrating and the game occasionally got a bit too cartoony given its generally weighty subject matter.  This was particularly true early in the game during various showdowns with a German Baron that played more like a parody than the rather dark material that the game covers during most other segments.I really loved how the game included actual facts about the war into the menu system for each level.  It gives a sense of perspective to the events that occur, while also providing framework for what the characters are doing.  There is very little dialogue in the game, only during the occasional cut-scene, and so these tidbits really provide depth to the experience.  You can also find collectibles in each level that give additional little facts about the war, the people who fought in it, and the items they left behind.  Finally, the various playable characters (and one who isn't playable but is central to the narrative) have diary entries that you can read as you go through the story that add a bit more to their characterization.  It's nothing too deep, but it's a fine added touch.And again, the ending is absolutely fantastic.			"

												While less of a feels-trip than I originally expected (due to hype I guess), Valiant Hearts was a very pleasant 5 hour ride, with quite a few captivating moments. I stopped and looked around the beautifully crafted scenery more than once and just stood there, taking it all in - presentation and story. The presentation is one of a kind. Music, Sound and astethic all blend into one big awesome something, that just works all the way to the end. Nothing to complain here.The gameplay is quite simple most of the times and it seems it is more of a means to deliver the narrative anyways - and that folks, works just fine.There is a lot to see and experience storywise. War is depicted from a different angle, which we only rarely see in games (Spec Ops as one good example). Valiant Hearts focusses on helping people and especially touches the topic of friends in war. People you meet, at times only briefly, feel closer to you, than your family at times - at least this is what I felt during my time playing. Brief and simple encounters made me stop and think - which is a good thing. War is told not only through the direct atmosphere and presentation of the story though. Even stuff like the choice to go for a 2D-Setting - having a focus on limited movement and ultimately no choice but to move from one side of the screen to the other, might carry a message as well. This message -LIGHT SPOILER ALERT- climaxes in the finale, where moving left is no longer an option. Realizing this while playing made me feel weird. Wanting to go back just one step for a personal reason, but not being able to do it. - SPOILER ENDING -Anyway - Valiant Hearts is a nice example of interesting storytelling and a lot of additional stuff to find and experience, if you are willing to look and listen closely. uPlay is a disgrace though.

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War was able to accomplish much more than what I was expecting from a side scrolling, 2D adventure game. I’m not a big fan of the genre, but the game’s setting and appealing art style was enough to draw me in. The game did a good job of creating a compelling story that didn’t feel constrained or restricted by the overall historical accuracy of following World War 1. Also, attaching interesting historical facts and information to the game’s collectibles was a smart way of adding extra content into the game worth finding, rewarding you with context and backdrops for the levels you were playing through. Even though the game’s story was pretty whimsical at times, the serious undertone of what was going on and constant clash between the playful art style and the horrors of war definitely made playing this game a captivating experience. I would reccommend this game to those who enjoy a good story, engaging but lighthearted puzzles, and are generally interested in learning more about World War 1.			"

												A beautiful, introspective, and yet informative game with an involving storyline. A game that puts you on the shoes of charismatic characters during the terrible great war, It's easy to get involved with their hopes, fears and dreams while they struggle and you witness the terror of the war. It's more than a game, its a statement on the tragedy and senselessness of war. I cannot recommend it more. It's a short experience, but one that you surely won't forget anytime soon.			"

The characters are trying to survive the horrors of war during missions, and are followed by a faithful dog companion. In the game the lives of all the characters are inextricably drawn together over the course of the game. Friendship, love, sacrifice, and tragedy befall each one as they help each other to retain their humanity against the horrors of war.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™ is a great game the campaign is amazing since it's the only part of the game. The story is great but the story is actually quite sad. But if your not big into puzzle games then this wouldn't be your cup of tea. Now normally I don't get puzzle games either but this one I wanted because I saw it 75% and I like WWI history and this game is based in WWI and to be honest I was shocked by how much I liked it! For how much it does cost it is worth it but if you can get it on sale. (Btw it's ok to cry at the end.			"

												Very Rarely in video games do developers touch the first world war, these days developers wanly focus on Modern warfare and these are mostly 3rd or 1st person shooters. Valiant Hearts does neither of these thing it instead focuses on a more narrative driven experience within a Semi 2-D world focusing on puzzles to progress the story. The story focuses on 4 protagonists.  Emile who is a French farmer who becomes a POW during his first battle while searching for his son-in-law. Karl was German living in France before the war started. He is married to Emile's daughter Marie, both of whom have a son together. Karl is deported back to Germany when the war begins and is conscripted into the German army. Freddie who is an American soldier who enlists as an engineer for the French and vows revenge on the Germans who took away the life of his wife and Anna a Belgian nurse tending to the wounded soldiers on the battlefield. In the search of her father, captured by the Germans, she continues to tend to the wounded and find her father and finally there is the dog, an unnamed German shepherd who becomes a valued and trusted friend to each of its four human co-stars at one point or another throughout the game. The puzzles often boil down to simply finding an item in one location and bringing it to another, though the context of these fetch quests manages to keep them interesting as you race to save civilians or use stealth to navigate behind enemy lines. The dog's presence also augments the puzzles in interesting ways, allowing you to control two characters at once, reach areas into which no human could fit or distract guards by simply being an adorable puppy. There are also rhythm mini games and these are used for the charging the trenches section of the game where you have to avoid enemy fire in order to progress. There are also similar section where you do the same in a car avoiding obstacles while the can can, can be heard playing in the background which is a nice touch. The boss battles should also be mentioned because while they are very smart takes on puzzles and bosses together they do seem to stretch they do give the sense of new technology in the war and having to overcome insurmountable odds. But that’s not to say that all the games aspects are solid. The medic mini-game, however, is dull to play and forces your attention away from the action at hand so that amputating a soldier's arm is treated with the same rote monotony as giving a tired soldier a sip of water through rhythm quick time events. There can also be some confusing puzzles in late game but that should not be held against the game as the game does give you hints if it sees that you are stuck in a certain section and these usually helped enough so that the narrative could continue and move on to the next section of gameplayValiant Hearts: The Great War is a superbly titled game. It does its job of showing that war is one of man’s worst creations and how families were torn apart back then and are still being torn apart today by current wars.  It is a valiant effort at a sincere depiction of war by developers whose hearts were clearly in the right place, telling a gripping story that is still respectful of its source.Final Verdict: 9/10 "

												If you expect this game to be another FPS or RTS war game, then I don't recommend this game. Valiant Hearts brings the other side of wars (in this case, World War I), so instead of killing enemies to win the game (SPOILER ALERT: although at nearly the end of the game you are forced to kill someone), you will solve puzzles (and collect items, which is completely optional but required towards 100% completion of the gam... ahem... achievements). There are only four characters, and most of the time you will control only one of them. Don't get disheartened; a canine friend will help during the quest of war (and sometimes your cooperation will be required to continue). This game needs only less than 10 hours to complete, and if you are stuck on a particular puzzle, wait until the game gives you hints (or pay attention to your canine friend, mostly he will bark to item of interest). Great story, the last minutes are pretty tense, and the ending is quite emotional; be warned. Assassin's Creed players will be familiar of the Animus Database; this game also offers similar journal, or real-world facts about WW I, and you can fire up the browser to find more information. What a fun way to learn history!In short, this game is for you who love historical events and to show that wars offer us no good.Some may be concerned about Uplay (and its frequent updating), but don't let it discourage you from buying and playing this game. If you can install Steam to manage your games, then Uplay is not a big deal.Oh, and for some players, this game might be punishing. One hit of a bullet is a one hit kill. Explosions will kill instantly if you are within range. Gases will also kill. So enjoy your timing to avoid them at all costs :)			"

All the way through there are facts about what took place at various battles and times in the war and who did what, which if your interested I think is good to know.I'l say it again a gem.

What a fabulous game!  I wasn't expecting such an incredible story and adventure!The game is a side-scrolling, platform puzzle game with views into WW 1 through the lives of 4 characters you play in the game.  And when I mean ""views"" -- literally!  At the start of many levels there is a ""Facts"" page that can come up where it shows you ala a press photo or something and a paragraph of what's going on in WW1 at the stage of the game you're playing.  So while you're playing a game, it gives you the background of what's going on.  Also there are a number of hidden items that you can collect on each mission (over 100 in all) that then shows you a blurb about that item from that period in history.  It really sets the stage and atmosphere for the game.The Good:+ Story.  I wasn't expecting such an engaging story from this!+ Multiple playable characters for different viewpoints of the story.  You play the game as four different people, not counting the helpful dog that you run across who assists your characters and you can give him commands too.+ Good length.  It took me 8 hrs to complete the campaign (with just some of that time looking for the hidden items :-) )+ Graphics and Animation.  I just love that ""moving pencil sketch"" look in the game, and they all move smoothly and comically.+ Voices and Sounds.  Fabulous.  The game is NOT narrated with speaking playable characters, but they do have voices.  The voices just give a hint of what they're saying, in the accent of the character, and adds to the charm.  The narrators they do have in between missions are great.+ Pop up story boxes.  The NPCs in the game that you meet communicate with unintelligible words, but it is made clear through pop up boxes or icons in speech balloons.  It's done very well, and conveys the meaning perfectly.  Great.+ Many hidden items.  Each mission there can be 3 to 8 items that you can find in out of the way, hidden spots.  And each gives you a little paragraph of history.  Loved it.+ Good puzzles without being too easy/tough.  And if you do get stuck, they have a nice Hint system.The Bad, or just OK:- They're so minor, they're not even worth mentioning...Overall:  This is my new favorite ""point-n-click"" (kinda), platform, adventure game -- one of my few 10 out of 10's.

												(Writer's note before I share my further thoughts on my experience: If you are avoiding this because it needs Uplay, you're making a big mistake and really missing out.)No spoilers in this review - I wouldn't want to ruin the experience for anyone, after all.Valiant Hearts:Playtime: Roughly 9 hours (includes collectible collecting).Requires UPlay. So if you buy this through Steam, you still need a UPlay account to play this through. I had no issues with that though, and I experienced no trouble setting it up.Valiant Hearts was a game that I had not heard a single thing about before E3, but also one that captured my attention the moment I saw the trailer. The whole idea about exploring different people's stories throughout the first World War was an intriguing one, especially seeing as how much effort had gone into research and making the game historically accurate in both it's locations and events.I was not disappointed.From the first level to the end, every moment had me at the edge of my seat, wanting to explore more and find out how the story would end. The game does not shy away from the horrors of war, and makes it painfully obvious how many brave souls were lost during the fateful years. Despite this darkness, there is humour and happy occasions as well that balance the experience out nicely.What I loved the most about this game is that it does not point fingers or blame anyone - it simply gives us the facts and lets us experience the events through the characters we play. And it is educational too - by reading the historical facts and collecting the items scattered around the map, I found myself learning more about the war than I ever had before - and I was having a great time whilst doing it. The facts also coincide with the levels you're playing, giving you more information about the things you're experiencing in the level.The gameplay itself is simple, almost point n- click -like. You move around and interact with other characters and things you come across to move forward. Sometimes you find puzzles (eg. number codes or item trading) that require a bit more thought but at no point are the puzzles actually hard enough to make you want to give up. With a little bit of logic and thought, you'll soon be on your way again.Both art and audio-wise this game absolutely stunning. The visuals reminded me of a graphic novel with great use of colour and detail. It pays off to just stop at times to really look at the things around you and listen to the scene. They make everything just seem that much more significant.Fair warning though - this game will pull at your heartstrings. The war was emotional and traumatizing, and whilst Valiant Hearts will not thankfully get quite that extreme, everything I experienced through it definitely made me pause and think -and perhaps see things in a slightly different light than I had before.All in all, Valiant Hearts was an amazing experience and well worth playing through. If they ever make more games like this, I'll definitely give them a go.			"

												Okay, even though I haven't finished this game I will say it's a masterpiece! The art, music, and mechanics of the game are amazing. The title screen amazes me everytime I can just sit there and listen to the music all day. I would totally reccomend this game to anyone who likes History and puzzle/action games. As soon as I saw this I had to get it. History is my favorite subject.			"

												Mémoires de la Grande Guerre is a great game!It has been 100 years since the beggining of the First World War. Anniversary has led to release of several games based on the Great War. Mémoires de la Grande Guerre is one of the latest games about WW1. Where other games try to accurately describe horrors of the war, Mémoires de la Grande Guerre has it's original view. Mémoires de la Grande Guerre is cartoonlike animated 2D adventure. Cartoonlike approach brings memorable design to the game. Storyline of the game consists of the real events of the Western Front. While the game proceeds the player is given lots of information about the true events of the war. The game has large base of information with lots of authentic material from the war. To complete the game it is not necessary to explore everything that game has to give, but authentic stuff makes great bonus to the game. Characters controlled and their actions are fictional. Game takes its own freedoms in creating entertaining events to the main characters. Most of time the game is indeed very entertaining. Mémoires de la Grande Guerre manages to be alternately both funny and sad. However the game is not perfect.As you could predict from the French name Mémoires de la Grande Guerre is heavily French-based game. Most of the Germans are evil, Britons do not exist, Americans are volunteers for French army. Game is not even description about the WW1 in its full extent. Other fronts than the Western Front (for instance Italian Front & Eastern Front), are not even mentioned in the game.Sometimes fictional happenings in the game are irritatingly silly. For example in the real life you really can not dodge poison gas by going to your knees.The game is optimized to work with amazingly large variety of computers and installations. However gameplay is not always fluent. The game also has some major bugs that could crash the game. Great, entertaining and educational game with few minor flaws in story and technical difficulties.			"

												This game is the demonstration that the UbiArt Framework is an engine which can be used in games with more serious topics than Rayman.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an awesome adventure game with beautiful comics style graphic and a perfect soundtrack.Once you start playing it, you just cannot stop, even if it's a very easy game.The story is very addictive and you cannot stop until you see how it ends.Serious historical setting, poignant story with a dash of comedy. I sat down today and played it all the way through. I couldn't stop. It was very fun gameplay and the story hooked me in. It really immersed you into the whole WW1 atmosphere, from the gas to soldiers. Top notch game. A single tear rolled down my check at the endingAbsolutely recommended to everyone!			"

												This game is one of the few so far this year that makes me want to play it. The atmosphere is probably the reason why. The way the visuals mix with the music just puts a smile on my face. The story is a simple, if not cliche, but I am definitely ok with it. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. I have never been one for puzzle games, but so far nothing has been so difficult that I could not get past it. Some might say that it is a little too easy but I am not playing this game for difficulty. While playing the game you will get notifications during certain points where the game will pretty much give you history lessons on the first world war. Some will probably complain because its a lot of reading that kind of takes you out of the game experience. You could skip reading these but I think that in the long run you would be missing out on the full story. Some people are complaining about Uplay and I can almost understand why. I would say do not let this impact your decision to buy this game. You'd be missing out. Uplay is only 50mb or so and it pretty light feeling as far as game launchers go. Also steam overlay still works with the game and it still tracks your time in the game. I'm only a couple of hours in but can already tell that this game is a gem. It won't be for everyone but I definitely would recommend it to my friends:)			"

What really amazed me was the story. You learn a lot about the history and the outcome of the war. As for the gameplay I found it versatile, mostly because there were various characters/roles to play. I found that the style of the game and the graphics and soundtrack beautifully matched together. In the end, this is a game which provides fun for a couple of hours with its manifold story, the sometimes humourous parts, fun puzzles etc.At last, it's indeed very tragic. Tears were shed.			"

												Valiant Hearts was a game which straight away called for my attention. The graphics alone were mesmerizing and especially the dog was too charming to simply pass. When I found out that the game was about war, it pushed me away a bit since I haven't prefered war like games in the past. However, I strongly recommend this game because it's storyline is just too touching and amazing to miss! This game will truly show you especially the more hidden side of the WW and I guarantee, you will have tears in your eyes when you reach the ending. At least I did.			"

 Property Rating Explanation Graphics 7.5 The 2D graphics are very easy on the eye and they depict the World War 1 atmosphere really well. Not top notch but they do their job. Gameplay 8.5 The gameplay is the classic 2D sidescroller with platforming elements, many easy to medium difficulty puzzles and some arcade elements Multiplayer N/A Single-player only. Story 9.5 The storytelling in this game is stellar. Wonderful characters, great dramatic moments and a very touching end. You will cry if you invest in the story and get attached to the characters. Also this game is a serious history lesson for World War 1. Read everything you can, it can do nothing but good to your overall history knowledge. Sound-Music 8 The music is very beautifully crafted and adds to the overall atmosphere. Optimization 9 Optimization is great, this game can run even on the more weak laptops without any problems. Cons N/A Some other minor inconsistencies and weak moments, but nothing big really. Overall 9 This game is a piece of art. Perfect characters, perfect music, very emotional.They should demonstrate this game to History students at schools and universities to better understand the Great WarP.S. You will cry at the end. "

This game looks incredible and if you have NVIDIA's 3DVision I highly recommend using it. The depth perception in the background to the foreground popping out, it really makes this game visual art style stand out. And who would of thought World War 1 would tug away at the heart strings. The story mixed with amazing music makes you experience ""hardcore feels"". This game is amazing and Ubisoft needs to release an OST. STAT!			"

												I'll start with the backstory: The first world war between France and Germany.The graphics of this game are simple yet 100% satisfying - Everything looks amazing and real.The music of this game is truly amazing - Classic music synchronized with the happening at the game.At the story of the game you go through important events of the war like The first gas bomb that was used by the germans.Throughout the game you play as four different characters,each one with his story but all of them collide.This game is extremely EMOTIONAL - Happy and Sad when time comes.You get instantly connected to the characters and care about them.As soon as I started to play the game I didn't stop even for one second because how good it is.I didn't stop playing until the end of the game - 8 hours straight!It will be hard to imagine some one to not like this game.If youre debating about buying this game, you shouldn't because this game is worth every cent and I would pay even more for this game.I never saw an indie game that good and satisfying in my life.To end this,BUY THIS GAME!Thanks for reading and have fun playing the game!

												Prepare to have a few manly tears slip out of your eye sockets. I've never been one to enjoy war movies or games based on wars of the past, but I gave this one a chance mostly because I'm a sucker for story-based games. Don't expect breathtaking 3D graphics or an epic soundtrack from this one. Play this game for its story. Enter the lives of fictional characters who represent those who lived, suffered, and fought during the so-called ""Great War"".Play this when you have a lot of time to spare. To be fully immersed in the awesomeness that is Valiant Hearts, one must play the game straight and without distractions. Treat it as if you're watching a movie.			"

												What an absolutley beautiful game! This game is exactly what I expected it to be and even more. Its an adventure story, told in a heart warming way. The reality of war is harsh and cruel! everybody looses when countries can't get along and kill each other.I loved that these were WWI Stories!! SO tired of WWII, heard those stories hundreds of times. It was so refreshing to see so much love, dedication, and comittment put into the game.The music is absolutely brilliant, a gorgouse piano piece with a violin floating behind it enchanted me in the title screen.The extra parts that I was not expecting were the extreme detail to historical accuracy, real life photos of soldiers, the equipment (urine soaked rags as gas masks), and real letters home that are woven in the story.I absolutely recomend this game without any hesitation. I have played through the entire 1st chapter and it looks like ther are 3 more to go!			"

												(N.B. 5 hours played)A beautiful adventure game with enchanting music and characters who may move you to tears. Despite the doom & gloom outlook surrounding the game's setting, Valiant Hearts stands head and shoulders above perceived conceptions to deliver a mesmerizing moment of brilliance complete with scenarios of joy, sadness, and complete empathy.It is one thing to create an entertaining product about World War I and tell a story -- it is another to tell that story while dismissing the overall whitewashing of general World War I history taught in schools and to be able to provide facts and lessons through a valuable medium such as videogames. As a fan of our written history, I would not only like to thank Ubisoft Montpellier for sticking to what I was most concerned about i.e. telling a story about World War I without blemishing it... I feel it is also noteworthy enough to celebrate what the development team have crafted by going above and beyond what I had initially hoped. Mentions and depictions of foreign countries fighting the war effort (Canada, India, Tunisia - represent!), including heart-wrenching personal letters from both sides of the conflict illustrating that no matter our lineage or culture we are all human.On the centenary ""celebration"" of one of the greatest infamous events in our history -- one in which we still feel the aftershocks today -- I feel overjoyed to experience something like this in an entertainment medium form that I've spent immersed and loved dearly for almost three decades of my life. And yet it is World War I. There are portrayals of trench warfare, there are portrayals of troops blindly running over no-man's land in the hope of a few more metres to build more trenches. But this one feels right. We witness the events of World War I through the eyes of four controllable characters (five if we demand to include the medical dog) and through all of these events we see many parts of the Great War. The launch of machine guns as a defensive mechanism, the introduction of gas warfare, the importance that nurses played upon the battlefield, the harrowing experience of artillery raining down upon people, and the debut of three weapons which were defining moments in both theatres of World War II - the tank, the aeroplane, and the flamethrower.In terms of gameplay, the puzzles themselves are not troubling due to common sense, and veterans of adventure games may find them trivial, yet the biggest stickler of all adventure games is whether the puzzles themselves make any sense to what is happening to the character in the universe. Thankfully Valiant Hearts avoids this quagmire. Controls are simple and neat both with M&KB interface alongside controller of choice. So far there have not been any issues regarding playability and it has that Ubisoft Montpellier polish to it. My only downfall is the fact that, despite the characters speaking their own form of mumbled speech within the game that is easy to understand (French characters saying ""merci"" while American character says ""thanks"") - it's a little disheartening to hear Emile, a major French character, speak in an English accent during story sequences at the beginning of a chapter. Perhaps a harmless contra, but one that grinds my teeth in little ways. This game also modestly steals the ""greatest title screen music"" from Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy XIII respectively at the same time.Don't let the 2D animated quality of the graphics fool you. This game is full of grim, yet majestic, atmosphere. The mere fact that Ubisoft Montpellier managed to capture the real-life concept that death is everywhere and these people struggled through an immense scale of adversity in order to live through over 4 years of hell should be enough to reconsider and think about what the ""lost generation"" went through.Highly recommended.

												The game is one of the best game i've ever played. Like many, i laughed and cried. This game will touch your heart and your mind. The puzzles are at a perfect difficulty. The story will grip you within mintues. If you like a game that touches your heart and ensures emotion, this is the game. I can't stress enough, how much i love this game. This game is a testament to all games indie and triple-A, that it's story and gameplay over graphics. Great game. I highly recommend to any with a heart.			"

												After having trouble in chapter 4 getting past the tanks (bug in the game) last year I picked this up again this year and it works fine. Now, I was finally able to finish the game, and I have already started the replay to find all the hidden objects. Overall, anyone who is looking for games with a story depicting historic events, please check this out. There's a grabbing story, lots of puzzles, and many things to discover. Actually, I'd wish there were more of these unique games out there, where the publisher is not trying to milk every last dollar out of an existing franchise.			"

												Sit down and let me tell you a story, one of blood, sweat, tears, and VICTORY.From the start - when I saw the unveil trailer at E3 - I already knew that this game was going to be incredibly touching.. I knew from the start that there would be a time somewhere in the game that I would break down and cry for mankind.And the tears did flow.Valiant Hearts is a game that I haven't seen in nearly a decade: a game that has a story so simple, but so deep, that one gets sucked in and finds themselves thrown into the midst of warfare on a horrific scale. We've all seen death and war, we've all played those games.. but it's hard to feel sorry for the person you're killing; how often does a game tell you both sides? How often do we see the faces of the families that a soldier is forced to leave behind, or hear the letters and emotions that seep from their own stories and woes.How often do we feel a connection all our own?From the start, from a simple farmer, to the bitter end - through good times and bad - we FEEL them. For once in generations, we can hear the echos from a time that I hope we never see again..Will you, my dearest friend, listen..?10/10			"

												Innovative and daring concept, but combining the grim historical realities of World War I with a cartoonish puzzle game just doesn't work for me, and I suspect others will feel similarly.

												For the record posting reviews of games is generally something I do not do too often. But having played this game I feel that I owe it to the creators, as it was an absolute pleasure to experience. The game has a really easy puzzle system, but the way in which it was integrated in gameplay created a seamless immersion. Next there is the art style which I fell in love with from the moment I saw the first cinematic, and that doesn't come close to the soundtrack which perfectly guides your mood throughout the game. Finally there is the amazing story line, it is so incredibly heartfelt and the facts they give throughout the game makes it all feel so much more real and personal.This game deserves 10/10.			"

												It would be easy to say that 'Valiant Hearts' is a game about the First World War - but that would miss the game's essence, in the same way that saying 'Star Wars' is a movie about space would.  'Valiant Hearts' is about four people forced to live through one of the most tragic and trying eras imaginable.That isn't to say that 'Valiant Hearts' doesn't contain a wealth of information about the First World War.  Through the characters you alternate between controlling - a German soldier, a French conscript, an American volunteer, and a Belgian nurse - you experience different aspects of the war: the initial excitement of the call to battle, the terrors of the trench, the desperate fight to save lives.  Historical facts and objects provide additional real-life context.The gameplay is straightforward.  In between the occasional stealth and driving segments, you'll be pulling levers and solving find-and-fetch puzzles.  The puzzles are neither easy nor especially hard; they feel appropriately sized as a driver for the main narrative.It's this narrative that is the true star of the game.  Backed by a wonderfully melancholy soundtrack (and leavened by moments of odd hilarity), it forces the player to understand history - not as an abstract catalog of dates and facts, but as a story with real human stakes that still relate today.--------------------When the bullet cameI closed my eyes, saw your faceAnd went home at last.

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle game. The thing that separates it from other games like this is that this game is set during the first World War. It follows the adventures of four people and one dog as they fight through the war. It is rich with history, and provides a lot of information about the Great War and the different people that were involved in it. If you love history and puzzle games, this is for you.This game is fantastic, but I suffered through a lot of glitches. Changing the keybinds made controlling the digging mechanic mess up, and the only way to fix it was to rebind back to the original controls. Another instance was getting caught in an infinite loop that prevented me from beating a boss. The only fix for this was to change my resolution to something incredibly low (800x600) just to get the boss sequence to work correctly. This game is filled with bugs but the steam community page has threads upon threads of bugs and solutions. The addition of having to use Ubisoft's UPlay system made my game launch a lot slower and it forces you to sign up with UPlay to actually play the game. The story is very fascinating, gameplay is pretty solid (took me about 8 hours), music and art are very charming and fitting. I would definitely recommend this game despite its glitches as it is one of the most moving games I've ever played, as it is based on true events of a terrible time in our world's history.			"

												Valiant Hearts is more an interactive story than a game. Wrapped in a World War I puzzle-platformer, this story is not a challenge to play through. Puzzles have no complexity and the player is only dealing with one at a time. Challenges primarily involve pickup and deliver quests between elements on the level, block pushing, block pulling, and shape-matching. There are a few platformer-style action sequences reminiscent of Frogger-style gameplay. These same sequences are timed to epic orchestral music, which at least makes them enjoyable if not a frustrating chore put in to progress the game's story.There is a meta-game of finding historical items. Every level possesses a half-dozen collectibles that can be found and picked up. They serve no gameplay purpose and are completely optional, but come with facts relating them to the historical setting of the level they are found in. Paired with multi-paragraph articles introducing the historical significance of the different settings of the game's levels, this adds an element to Valiant Hearts that transcends the colorful animated cartoon warfront and grounds it in historical context.Don't play it for the puzzles, play it for the story and for the beautiful art style. The level backdrops and bullish character art evoke the war setting magnificently and even bring it some enjoyable color which realistically did not exist. Unfortunately, animations are not particularly well-executed and there is one severely lacking artistic element: blood. In a game set in a theme of death and destruction, purposefully not including blood in the game (likely to maintain ratings standards) harms the ability to tell a story as powerful and evocative as Valiant Hearts.Finally, a sweeping storyline with a twist of historical education around the setting of WWI cannot ignore the subject of death. The characters traverse several death-defying accounts throughout the game's four chapters as the player believes the protagonists are immune to war's ultimate price for the sake of story progression. At times, this is a bit ridiculous, with dozens of animated characters being mowed down by machine gun fire while the player continually respawns to pass the movement-timed trench-death puzzles. Ultimately, the game addresses the topic of death as a part of the finale and it is potentially one of the more controversial moments that will keep this art-piece game out of classrooms. It's hard to tell if it is a well-placed plot-twist element or a final historical morality message written into the narrative, but it works very well.In summary, Valiant Hearts is a brilliantly packaged, historically sprinkled interactive fiction. The puzzles are overtly simple and linear, but this is a game you play for the experience rather than the challenge. Going forward, while I believe there are too many World War Two-themed games out there, a Valiant Hearts sequel: WWII would be a worthy cut above the rest. Let's hope it gets made. In the meantime, experience World War One through the moving story Valiant Hearts.			"

												Valiant Hearts is an incredible gaming experience for anyone with any interest in knowing more about the terrible conflict that ravaged the European continent on the beggining of the 20th century. Don't pay much attention to the gameplay - it just does the job with simple puzzles and fect quests. Instead, try to keep track of the journals, itens and ""codex"" entries: they provide loads of information about the Great War, the European lifestyle and some particularly intriguing and sad stories. Graphics and sound are top notch, providing nice ambience and little, delicate touches like the use of English, French and German in small audio snippets.Oh, and since this is a game about one of the worst moments in Wolrd History, be prepared to cry and be struck by the horrors that took away so many lives. This is a serious game, and definitely a must-play for almost everyone - makes you think a lot about how we deal with violence today, making Hollywood-like FPS war games look like silly parodies.

												""Valiant Hearts"" is an epic game telling the story of an epic conflict. The First World War as seen from the eyes of its individual participants, bound together by fate, is something that will stay with you for a long time even when you finish it.The cartoon-like approach to the game graphics starkly contrasts with the gruesome reality of trench warfare on the Western Front: human wave attacks, incompetence of the leaders, industrialisation of warfare, giving an unforgiven experience to those who decide to follow Emile, Anna, Karl, Freddie and Walt the dog on their journey across the war-torn France.The game plays equally well on a gamepad and the keyboard. The steering on the latter is rather unorthodox, but it's easy to get used to it.The music, both the classical pieces and the one written especially for the game, is catchy and emotional, but fortunately it does not drag the player's attention away from the main events.My one complaint is that because of the mandatory usage of uPlay, there are certain bugs that may hinder or even prevent further progress. For example, when I was playing with a gamepad, certain sections of chase sequences would glitch and repeat forever, making it impossible to beat this fragment. It wasn't until after I unplugged the gamepad and disabled uPlay that I was able to finish it. Also, if you choose ""New Game"", you'll loose access to all the chapters you've already played - in my case, the whole game. If you want to keep them, never use the ""New Game"" options after starting it, always pick them from the ""Chapters"" tab.If you're tired of repetitive, clone-like fpses set during fictious, futuristic conflicts, Valiant Hearts is a good choice. Just prepare some tissues, because feels shall be had.tl;dr version: 19/18 made me cry.			"

Think of a graphic novel about the Great War come to life. It is clear that everyone who worked on this game were passionate about it, and it shows. Playing through the story will stay with me the rest of my life.For the completionists out there, there are lots of things to look for and collect. Every item you collect gives you a little history of the life and horrors of the Great War. I am playing through a third time to get everything.This is the kind of game that deserves strong support from the player community. This is the kind of game that should be the gold standard for a video game as art and entertainment. I had fun, I felt the full gabmit of emotions, and I learned something.Buy. This. Game.

												Absolutely beautiful story, bringing to light the horrors of war and how it impacts the people affected by it. The ending almost had me in tears.Add to the above the overall narrative and distinct visual style coupled with interesting puzzles makes this game absolutely worth a playthrough.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a breathtaking, awe-inspiring journey that the depicts the horror of war in a perfect gameplay mix of action, adventure and puzzles.You experience the great conflict that was World War 1 through the perpectives of 4 characters, all with their own backgrounds, personal motives and abilities: Karl, the german soldier who focuses on stealth. Emile, the french farmer and Karls father-in-law who focuses on solving all sorts of different puzzles with the help of his dog companion Walt. Freddie, the american volunteer who focuses on running forward, dodging mortars and knocking down anything and anyone in front of him with his fists and Anna, the belgian student turned medic who focuces on healing and saving wounded soldiers and civilians.Despite this game having a rather silly and friendly looking art style, you should not let that fool you since you will be taking cover from machine-gun fire behind the corpses of your fallen comrades, watch adult men shiver in fear and see innocent civilians cry over the loss of their family members. The game goes from gut punch to gut punch to the occasional kick in the heart as you, the player, will have to watch these loveable and colourful characters fight their way through the seven rings of hell without knowing that the more they fight, the more horrible it's going to get.A true testament to the bravery of every army man who has ever lived, who I feel, does not get the respect they deserve. Doesn't matter if they are american, british, french, japanese, german etc. Any man or woman who can pick up arms and risk their lifes for the safety of their family and country, is a true hero.			"

												Since I'm nuts for this genre and topic I highly anticipated Valiant Hearts and I can tell you, I'm very happy about buying it.Not only because of the brilliant character introduction and evolvement, but also because of the nice historical background facts you get indosed step by step. They really got the right balance there. Unfortunately this all comes with the cost of very simple gameplay, that feels more like something they implemented, so the whole thing can be released as a ""game"". No minus point for me, but if I had to complain about something it must be the characterization of the germans. I was very disappointed to see that there is no deeper thought behind them and all they serve for is the villains. Just because germans are bad and they need no reason to be so. For a game that is trying to be historically correct, to some extend at least, it's just very lazy. Or maybe it's a french-canadian thing, not letting germas be human as well. The only german we can sympathize with is the one who actually left that ""evil country"" to live in the ""great nation"" of france. And don't get me wrong, I couldn't care less about my own roots here... I'm a brazilian living in germany, grew up in austria and a big part of my family is jewish with roots in lebanon. So it's really just the portrayal that made me sad... to realize the game I hoped to be so much more, falls into the same bland trap of stereotypes like a Call of Duty or Wolfenstein. Heck, even Wolfenstein differs better... Sorry for the rant.Still, great game nonetheless and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes storytelling and historical settings. :)			"

This game has something for everyone, I guess, There is vast historical information and knowledge that comes with it, and logic puzzles for those interested in the smart stuff. For the casual gamers, though, it has incredible gameplay, and I am saying that as a person who keeps distance from 2D games and platformer-like ones.Recommended for any person of any age, this game holds something we must all know and remember.

												""Valiant Hearts"" is an epic game telling the story of an epic conflict. The First World War as seen from the eyes of its individual participants, bound together by fate, is something that will stay with you for a long time even when you finish it.The cartoon-like approach to the game graphics starkly contrasts with the gruesome reality of trench warfare on the Western Front: human wave attacks, incompetence of the leaders, industrialisation of warfare, giving an unforgiven experience to those who decide to follow Emile, Anna, Karl, Freddie and Walt the dog on their journey across the war-torn France.The game plays equally well on a gamepad and the keyboard. The steering on the latter is rather unorthodox, but it's easy to get used to it.The music, both the classical pieces and the one written especially for the game, is catchy and emotional, but fortunately it does not drag the player's attention away from the main events.My one complaint is that because of the mandatory usage of uPlay, there are certain bugs that may hinder or even prevent further progress. For example, when I was playing with a gamepad, certain sections of chase sequences would glitch and repeat forever, making it impossible to beat this fragment. It wasn't until after I unplugged the gamepad and disabled uPlay that I was able to finish it. Also, if you choose ""New Game"", you'll loose access to all the chapters you've already played - in my case, the whole game. If you want to keep them, never use the ""New Game"" options after starting it, always pick them from the ""Chapters"" tab.If you're tired of repetitive, clone-like fpses set during fictious, futuristic conflicts, Valiant Hearts is a good choice. Just prepare some tissues, because feels shall be had.tl;dr version: 19/18 made me cry.			"

The true essence of warUnlike those badass military-shooters, this game tells what the real consequences of a war are. Not many games have tried this kind of 2D/2.5D-puzzler gameplay and for this, Ubisoft truly deserves an applause. Many people assume that cartoon-ish graphics may make the game unnatural or incomprehensible. Believe me, after completing the story, I doubt any graphics engine could have gone so well with the story and not-to-forget, the voice acting. Moreover, its soundtrack is indubitably one of the best I've heard in a video game. Anyone seeking for a story-rich experience should definitely try this.Overall rating - 8/10 "

												9.5/10 Finished the game in 1 breath! 13 hours playtime (I did not hurry).  The very well excecuted story , the funny voices , the perfect symphony of music and gameplay, the gameplay itself...I got sucked in and did not stop playing untill the story was finished! Drawing style is awesome, historic value is pretty neat. I actually learned something.  Atmosphere is great! Even before I started playing I knew I would like it. But I never expected it to be this awesome.  It's not very easy, but also not very hard.  Perfectly balanced.I think they did a great job in showing the atmosphere of WWI.  A dirty war...I felt like I was right in the middle of it!   This game shows that a game does not always have to be 3d to be excellent. The only reason I do not score it 10/10 is because I had to restart the game 3 times because of a flaw. I got stuck  because the game did not seem to ""read""what should happen next. Result was that I could not get out of a room for instance. Restarting fixed it on all 3 occassions. Apart from that: Perfect game!			"

(no more spoilers)Controls 6/10 - Clearly shown at te start however sometimes can get confusing (e.g- do i press a or b)Music 9/10 - Always relates to what is happening in the game, relaxing but tense in specific moments.Overall - This is a game which everyone should have, granted nobody will have 1000+ hours in it, but I think that everyone should have at least played it through once. Buy it, especially if it's on sale. "

												Absolutly LOVED this game, both fun and very educational and tells a very emotional story based on actual letters from the Great War. Feels like you're living through a children's book, but one with a very artistic and powerful tone to it that makes the gamer take it seriously. It makes you wander through the destruction and horror that scarred the earth in the years of 1914-1918 which shall remain as one of history's most crucial and pivotal time period. This game is EXTREMELY emotional, and I finished the game crying. A true masterpiece of what educational games should be. If I were a history teacher, I'd have my students play this to learn about the Great War. Like I said, this game is a Masterpiece and shall remain as memorable and heartwarming one. Follows Emile, a grandfather and a father-in-law to a German Soldier (Karl) as he fights in the French Army and endures the horrors of one of greatest conflicts that has forever shocked this world to its deepest core. Loveable characters with simple yet fun gameplay and a story that every gamer must play through. Warning: You will cry playing this game, trust me. If you think the endings to both the Last of Us or the TellTales Walking Dead are sad and emotional. This one tops them both combined.			"

This game gives a great mixture of showing the emotions of battle with the emotions of life outside. While some gameplay elements are a little aged like quicktime events and fetch quests, for the $15 price tag it gives enough to be one of the best games I've played.

The best thing they released in 2014. It's related to the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 and is filled with historical facts. Despite goofy and cartoony art style (which looks great) it shows the war in a way you wouldn't expect. EVERYONE suffers in war and that it's a gruesome thing that destroys lives of all involved. The gameplay is really fun and I cannot think of a dull moment when playing any of the four characters. The collectibles in each level are fun to look for and contain historical information. Only thing holding it back a bit is uPlay. Overall a GREAT and touching experience and I recommend this game to everyone!			"

												A crushing vault through a war lamentably untouched by gaming. The mechanics are nicely varied, ranging from simple puzzle-solving to guitar-hero style sequences, although the story takes precedence over actual gameplay. There are a few historical inaccuracies that don't fall into the remit of artistic license, mostly to do with continuing the same tired old tropes that the Great War has acquired, although that doesn't detract from the storyline which is stark and depressing. Although set in one of the bleakest periods of human history which is reflected in its score, the game's core theme is that of hope and the inherent goodness in all people. The biggest problem is ♥♥♥♥ing uplay, but I suppose we can't have everything.			"

												This game is a masterpeice. Some say video games cannot be used for anything other than entertainment, but this game did so much more. I honestly learned so much of WWI with this game.It starts with the war seeming so righteous. Brave men go to war, strong warriors! But as the game goes on, the true face of war reveals itself. Bombing of clorine gas kill thousands and refined weaponry turn Warriors into nearvous wreaks of men that must trudge through mud and their fallen allies to most likely get shot. This artistic decision is so great because WWI was the war to make define wars as not something good and honorable, but something horrible and bad. But what sells it is the story. Damn, that story is one of the, if not THE, most moving I've ever witnessed. I cannot spoil that, you'll have to play it for yourself.I encourage you to buy and play this game. The 100th anniversery of the start of WWI is coming in August, too. So now is the time to play it.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough for its story, art direction and sheer emotional weight, which do more to convey the horrors of war than any Call of Duty, Battlefield or their many clones (with the possible exception of Spec Ops: The Line) will ever do. However, those interested in very challenging puzzles may find themselves relatively unchallenged by the gameplay, but even then, I would still recommend a playthrough when it goes on sale.			"

												Coming off of my playthrough of Child of Light, I was excited to see what this game would bring with its creativity. Valiant Hearts takes the Great War and manages to place it in a narrative that, while not showing the bluntness of the war, still manages to capture the bittersweet emotions and troubling times.The game is a 2D puzzle platformer, and for the most parts puzzles are fairly simple. However, the 2D, while at its strongest due to it's art style, did present drawbacks when it came to puzzles where you initially hide from the enemy. 2D lacks depth, and so the first few times I had to hide, I didn't know I could hide behind walls because there was nothing to separate it from the background dimensionally. There was also one time where I felt it wasn't clear which button to press, but I think that was due to me being tired while playing. For the most part, it'll be a simple game if you are used to puzzle games.Given that, the story and creative design with the game make this shine. Based off of letters sent during the war, you follow five people whose paths cross and friendships are built. It's a touching narrative, and it helps that the background and historical facts they give you help you to immerse yourself in this time period. The art is in a comic book style, with atypical colors for their protagonists - everybody is mostly colored grey or with muted colors (especially as the game goes on), something I find very nice in representing the feelings of WW1. There are also scenes presented like a motion comic book, which I thought made for a great visual presentation. Musically, the score is fantastic as well as melancholic, and I absolutely loved the driving scenes set to the sounds of famous classical pieces.Some may find this game a fluffy version of the war, especially those that are history experts on this time period. While it definitely does not show in explicit detail the suffering of the soldiers and those around them graphically, I think it does a good job in presenting it to an audience that may not know too much about the war in the first place. I think, personally, this would be a great game to play with kids to help educate them about the history of the war. The many historical facts presented help to aide this, and I think the themes it brings up are great themes to discuss with children or teens wanting to learn more about WW1. As the game says, ""We must strive to cherish their memory and never forget."" "

												Valiant Hearts may not be the most innovative game, but Ubisoft makes up for it in spades with a unique artstyle, strong atmosphere, and hard-hitting story based on actual letters from WW1. Gameplay is mostly puzzle-based, nothing too hard but expect to get stuck every now and then. Most mechanics are introduced by the second chapter (out of four), making the latter half alittle repetitive. However, the real meat of this game lies in the world it paints, a vision into the lives affected by the outbreak of war in 1914. It's an underexplored field few games tread, and Valiant Hearts does a superb job detailing our modern history to people unfamiliar with 'The Great War'. Both uplifting and sorrowful, the story (while fairly simple) is an emotional rollercoaster tapping into the morally grey nature of the raging conflict between the Allied Powers and the Second Reich along the western front. Even so, I felt some of the side characters, like Anna the Nurse or Baron Von Antagonist, would have benefited from alittle more expositional depth.Overall, Valiant Hearts is a faithful and colorful look into the past packaged into a decent game, a special experience for those interested in the most dramatic turning point in Western culture since 1648, and an honest bargin even at full retail $15. This is one game I'm actually hoping has DLC!*Word of Caution to Parents: While the artstyle may suggest this is kid-friendly, Valiant Hearts' story pulls few punches and does not disguise it's subject matter. I would suggest not letting your children play this until you are comfortable with them watching 'Saving Private Ryan'. C'est la vie.			"

												Valiant Hearts is a side-scrolling puzzle game where, perhaps, the main focus is to showcase the  human element (sometimes mundane, sometimes emotional) beneath the hateful shell of a war machine. The puzzles themselves are quite simple and easy, mostly consisting of performing tasks and trading items to progress through the story, though other characters provide different gameplay mechanics into the board (shooting down planes with a tank, anyone?) If you do get stuck over a puzzle, the game does provides helpful hints unlocked over time.I'm not going to divulge any details on the plot, though I will say - I think this is the first time a game actually made me cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.

 Serious Review down below Just finished the game, literally in tears right now.""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""10/10, would cry again.Valiant heart is one of the most original and unique game I have played in the last few years. The gameplay is nothing exceptional, a few puzzles here and there, some challenging, but most of them pretty straightforward. However, what this game does well is the narrative. You follow the story of a handful of characters during the World War I, most of them soldiers. The game succeeds in portraying the sacrifices of the normal soldiers who fought in the front lines as well as some heartbreaking stories of their families' struggles. The art in this game is another thing that really stands out, and I personally never thought that it would fit a game about war, I was very wrong. They managed to pull off a great narrative off the back of this very neat and simple 2D art-style.			"

												A great little bite sized game that you can sit down and play in about 4 hours. The game really stands out to me because of how much heart it really has and by the end how invested you feel in the characters struggles. It differs from traditional war games by not making the war about fighting a soulless enemy. The game is about helping the people who are being hurt by the war, allied, enemy or civilian. One part the stuck out to me was when you come across a stuck enemy solider in a mine, you help him out and you both work together to escape the mine. On your way out, you get caught by enemy soldiers and he saves your life in turn. The game really is good at putting the point across that you are fighting people who are in the same situation as you but were stuck on the other side of the line when boarders were drawn. The game is satisfying and emotionally engaging and has an adorable loyal dog following you around the whole time. The game and its puzzles are not particularly difficult and usually really easy to figure out but it fits the direction of the game and they are often worked into the story so I don’t fault it for that. I would recommend if you are looking for a short but heartfelt experience.			"

												Just beat it, and I will say it is a wonderful little game. The art and music are beautiful. The music perfectly captured the somber tone of most of the game, while swelling to cersendos at the most daring moments, while the art was just just cute enough to portray the gruesome nature of the war, while still being beautifully charming. Done by the fine people at UbiArt, same folks who did Rayman Origins and Legends, so expect high quality. Easily one of the strongest suits of the game.The gameplay is puzzle based... and bit nonsequitor with the game, to be honest. The Great War is happening around you, and yet you are turning wheels and throwing bottles. I understand the bind of telling a story ABOUT people DURING the war, and trying to stray away form combat, but is a bit odd. There are a a bit of diversity with some other forms of gameplay and they were a nice change of pace, often highlighting a tense moment. Besides that the puzzles are simple and yet clever. You will more often have trouble executing than figuring out the puzzleStory and chracters are top notch. Despite mostly speaking in Gibberish or short clips of their natuve language, the characters all comminuacate a depth of emotion and feeling. I think that is really sttributed to the art team, once again. The story is truly one of valiant people, and you will be attatched to them and thier struggles and hopes.Finally, there is actually quite a bit of learning here! I've taken AP European History, and there is still a great deal here I didn't learn in my studies. The collection of War Heirlooms fit nicely into the educational bits, and some of the sweeping historical facts give very nice contecxt to a level or area. I really think this information enhances the gameplay and helps you really geta  feel for what our Valiant Hearts are battling through. The collection aspect of it may add on an extra 1.5 hours, so a brief stroll for 100%. I highly reccomend looking for them and reading up, as it is another strong suit of the game. This is edutainment done right.Thing of note: Double DRM with Steam and Uplay. It is a pain to ahve to go thropugh and can be iffy. experienced issues with being unable to open the game, due to their being an instance of then game alredy running, despite Task Manager revelaing this as untrue.Overall it's a nice, small heartfelt game. Any history junky should play and enjoy this. Strong aesthetic aspects from a strong animation department with beautiful music and characters are the backbone for a simplisctic puzzler.			"

												Valiant Hearts is able to tell the horror of the war, while also finding hope and love amidst all the chaos. It has some charming puzzles and some interesting set pieces. You become invested in the characters, despite the only characterizations are their short simlish like one liners to each other and the narrator's story. Some parts near the end of the game get a little aggravating, only because it forgoes some of the gameplay you were taught to expect and essentially play a very patient and quick game of Simon Says, where I ended up losing and restarting multiple times because the reaction time was very small compared to the rest of the game. Though annoying it didnt deter from the overall experience. As you would expect, the story culminates in one hell of a feels train.			"

												Now, I don't usually write reviews.  But I was so moved by this game, I felt I should.  Valiant Hearts is a brilliant story about 4 different people in world war I.  All the characters are likeable, and have their own goals and reasons for fighting.  The story is top notch, probably one of the best stories I've even experienced.  The game does well of capturing the feeling of World War I, but without you killing anyone.  The gameplay mostly revolves around puzzles you have to solve, which are challenging, but not incredibly hard to solve.  You feel as if you are genuinely a person, instead of a machine that shoots bullets everywhere.  The ending was so emotional it brought me to tears.

Fun fun! The gameplay is very adventure game mixed with mild platformer.There are puzzles that require grenades. This constitutes the only form of combat, really.There are also driving sections that synchronise to music. It's actually pretty neat.Thing is, I wasn't sure who would and wouldn't make it at the end and the execution of the ending was just fantastic.

												Aside the Worms franchise I am not into war-themed games but in these last days I've found a new exception to the rule, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, and with very good reasons.The game is based up in events of the First World War and you meet characters you get to play with each in the course of the game: Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl along with the company of Walt, a loyal Doberman Pincher that will help you a lot in different puzzles and situations. All the human characters share a different story each and see their destinies crossed to overcome the war. The story is excellent. It links with loyalty with real events from the First World War and aligned with the really well made English narrative (it reminds me of historical documentaries), it captures your interest and curiosity to know what's going to happen next. You end up getting a great sympathy towards the main characters and feel greatly involved, and you definitely figure that out in Chapter 3 and 4, the last chapters of the story. Even the way it ends, although I was not expecting such a closure (I'm still shaking, I just finished the game minutes ago but I found Chapter 4 very intense. I even had tears on my eyes at a point!) I do believe it was an honest ending. Lets remember that what happened around a century ago wasn't pink and roses.The gameplay consists in a mixture of platforming (although you don't jump in this game), puzzle and historical. You need to explore your surroundings to look for clues in dropped objects, talk to characters, look carefully to the scenario, etc. There's no actual dialogue between the characters, pictograms are used instead inside talk-balloons and they are very efficient to understand what they are trying to tell you. The puzzles are very very clever. I found a lot of variety and not all of them were piece of cake, you really need to explore well your surroundings if you want to continue. They aren't super hard but expect to lose few time thinking a little. Due to the nature of the game (more in particular the fact the characters do not jump) the controls (sharp by the way) aren't very complex and don't require a high dexterity but don't think it is because of that that you will be bored: the game features some interesting real-time events that might require a little more dexterity like avoiding missles, covering yourself and your companions, healing someone, etc. The human characters share a special ability each too: Emile can dig through soil, Freddie can clear up barbed tape paths and Anna can heal people. Being a game based up in historical facts, as soon as you progress diary entries and historical facts are unlocked. The diary entries tell you more about the characters of the game and their thoughts in the course of the story and historical facts tell you about different real facts from the First World War which are pretty educative. These elements help the player to understand more the contexts of the game. As a bonus for explorators/collectors there are more than 100 historical items to collect during gameplay with a description that tells you more about them. Again, it is educative and helps to understand more the context of the game. The objects are discrete enough to be easy to miss them, especially if you own a small display/resolution so make sure you look everywhere!The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, just like they were in Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends: both games developed by the same studio and in the same game-engine. Everything is hand-drawn under a high-definition digital format but the cartoony look works really well for the atmosphere of the game. It is not kiddy but at the same time it is not too realistic. The perfect balance. If the game circunstance allows you, please play calmly and appreciate the view. There is too many good detail to ignore. The animations are equally irreprehensible.The music and sound are equally excellent. The music is orchestral and marries really well with what's going on in the screen. There is even a small treat for music/rhythm lovers with some ingame-events that require a perfect syncronization with musics like the French Cancan! The sounds are varied and adequated. I would like to congratulate the voice actors in particular both for their work in the English narrative and in the gibberish language of the characters. Despite the human characters talk gibberish I can ensure you that in the highest moments of the story, their voice performance will give you the shivers.Complaints? To be honest it felt quick but that was probably because I was really immersed in the game. I will have to start it over anyway to collect the items I've missed but without me noticing I played over 10 hours!Since I heard about this game for the first time in a E3 reveal I was interested in it despite of being a war-themed game. I decided to take the risk and I don't have any regret. Ubisoft Montpellier once more showed the brilliant team it has got in the studio like it already proved to have with the Rayman titles it developed before. Valiant Hearts: The Great War is worth every cent and is 100% recommended to every fan of bidimensional platformers, with diverse puzzles to solve, scenarios to explore and like to hear (and feel) a good story.

												So, this is my first review ever!From my point of view the story is excellent! I like the graphics too, not a hard game (the last chapter was a bit harder though). Always made me connect with the character that I play with. Lots, I mean, LOTS of feelings are in the game.I would recommend it to all the war-related-story likers. Let's say that it's a minimum of 5-10 hours of intense play, maybe even more if you can't figure out many of the puzzles.			"

												This is not your regular game, this is an art/emotional puzzle game that does not shine in gameplay, but in the story and the characters. I wouldn't say the puzzles are hard, which they probably aren't supposed to be because they are just there to give you some kind of gameplay element. So yeah, this game is one emotional rollercoaster, but a fantastic one. I highly suggest you bring tissues with you.Amazing game.			"

After just finishing the game I feel obligated to tell everyone that this is the most meaningful game that I have played so far and is worth every penny. If you can buy it i would suggest it greatly and do not regret anything. 10/10 We need Ubisoft to make more games like this. "

												If you're interested in the history of world war 1 you should definitely pick up this game. The great story of Valiant Hearts, combined with events that has happened in real life, makes up for the SOMETIMES irritating puzzle elements.Gameplay last about 5-6 hours and you will not regret spending that amount of time on Valiant Hearts.I picked up this game on sale and didnt know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.Keep in mind that you unfortunately have to use Uplay to acces the game, but it's well worth it.8/10 "

												""Valiant Hearts"" is maybe Ubisoft's tribute to the victims (soldiers as well as civilians and aid workers) of World War I - and wow, was it an impressive experience!The player controls four different characters as they try to survive the war or help to survive. So it's a mixture of action, adventure and puzzle game which also challenges the player's skill and concentration.Don't let the comic book-like visual style confuse you: This game does not hide or relativize the horrors of this war. Sure, there are no deformed faces or guts seen in the game but still enough blood and corpses to keep serious and yet it's not glorifying the lust for blood. In a time where one war ego shooter after another gets made, ""Valiant Hearts"" touches the player's heart due to the characters and the constant reminders of humanity and kindness between (or even in the middle of) battles.Sure, the game has its funny and lighter moments, too. But they hardly ever make the whole story and situation look silly.The puzzles are quite easy but fun to solve. And the game gets more and more intense the further the player goes.You can also collect information about World War I, achievements and special hidden items which served special purposes back then. And last but not least: This game can be a real tearjerker at the latest in the final chapter.In a nutshell: I can definitely recommend ""Valiant Hearts"" to about anyone. It was a great experience of a game and I would replay it someday.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a game like nothing I have ever played. It is not the type of war game that commands you to kill and kill again; instead, it asks you to solve puzzles and play through a war story that is incredibly human in every sense. Mark my words, by the end of the game, you will feel emotion toward these characters and when a video game does such, it is quite special. If you're looking for a war experience akin to Battlefield/Call of Duty, etc. this game is not for you. If you are looking for an intense storyline that involves you on a deep personal and emotional level, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a perfect match. I was a bit skittish purchasing the game in the first place due to the fact that I'm not a fan of puzzle games by any means but this game is so much more than that. Bravo, Ubisoft.. You made one hell of a game!			"

												Just Finished the game, i'm going to go through again. This is the first war game and first WW1 game that isn't demonizing a side or a shoot em' up game. It reflects the humanity  and emotions of the men who fought on all sides of the war. the scenery  is amazing as it changes  from a bright  green scenery at the beginning of the war into the dark muddy horrific blasted and body covers no-mans land. Another good think I liked was the character development, they put each characters background and how they react to everything during the game. This game also requires you to think. Also for all you history nuts out there ( my self included ) they have tons of facts for each part of the game as well as diary's that also add to character development. So I'd give this a 10/10TL;DRPros:+ Great Story line+ Great Characters and Character development+ Great scenery/ Art+ Shows the trueness of what war is+ Has facts from each event in the game+ Great SoundtrackCons: - Some bugs and glitches here and there, there minor and tolerable- Uplay 9.5/10			"

												Coming off of my playthrough of Child of Light, I was excited to see what this game would bring with its creativity. Valiant Hearts takes the Great War and manages to place it in a narrative that, while not showing the bluntness of the war, still manages to capture the bittersweet emotions and troubling times.The game is a 2D puzzle platformer, and for the most parts puzzles are fairly simple. However, the 2D, while at its strongest due to it's art style, did present drawbacks when it came to puzzles where you initially hide from the enemy. 2D lacks depth, and so the first few times I had to hide, I didn't know I could hide behind walls because there was nothing to separate it from the background dimensionally. There was also one time where I felt it wasn't clear which button to press, but I think that was due to me being tired while playing. For the most part, it'll be a simple game if you are used to puzzle games.Given that, the story and creative design with the game make this shine. Based off of letters sent during the war, you follow five people whose paths cross and friendships are built. It's a touching narrative, and it helps that the background and historical facts they give you help you to immerse yourself in this time period. The art is in a comic book style, with atypical colors for their protagonists - everybody is mostly colored grey or with muted colors (especially as the game goes on), something I find very nice in representing the feelings of WW1. There are also scenes presented like a motion comic book, which I thought made for a great visual presentation. Musically, the score is fantastic as well as melancholic, and I absolutely loved the driving scenes set to the sounds of famous classical pieces.Some may find this game a fluffy version of the war, especially those that are history experts on this time period. While it definitely does not show in explicit detail the suffering of the soldiers and those around them graphically, I think it does a good job in presenting it to an audience that may not know too much about the war in the first place. I think, personally, this would be a great game to play with kids to help educate them about the history of the war. The many historical facts presented help to aide this, and I think the themes it brings up are great themes to discuss with children or teens wanting to learn more about WW1. As the game says, ""We must strive to cherish their memory and never forget."" "

Each one having moments where you feel as though you are the hero with them. I think that's what makes the end so haunting and impacting. Some will survive, and some won't, that's the nature of war.

												For the record posting reviews of games is generally something I do not do too often. But having played this game I feel that I owe it to the creators, as it was an absolute pleasure to experience. The game has a really easy puzzle system, but the way in which it was integrated in gameplay created a seamless immersion. Next there is the art style which I fell in love with from the moment I saw the first cinematic, and that doesn't come close to the soundtrack which perfectly guides your mood throughout the game. Finally there is the amazing story line, it is so incredibly heartfelt and the facts they give throughout the game makes it all feel so much more real and personal.This game deserves 10/10.			"

												Well... I played this game with so much joy and so few expectations that it just blew my mind. I won't lie, at first i did not liked it. I saw it at a friend and i was like nah, 2d ain't for me. Big mistake. A few weeks later i find myself buying it and never regret. This is definetly the best 2d i ever played. The story and characters make you fall in love from the begining. The naration is just briliant. But as everything good, it has and a bad part. The ending.  The end literaly made me sad. They say that you know you have read a good book when, turning last page, you feel like you've lost a friend. Dam, it could't be more acurate. Watching Emill's letter made my so sad about his death. I totaly recommend this to anyone who wants a thriling 2d world war. 10/10. Rip ending.			"

This game is dark and emotional. The music is on point, it is beautifull and fits the game so perfectly. I especially liked the music from the driving stages.

												Great game! Pretty short cause I completed the game in one day... But man was it worth it!!! I was so hooked I could barley stop. You get a broad aspect of how to the war affected all people on or off the front. Giving you great details like how they first dealt with gas attacks or how bad the first tanks was.Enjoyed it a lot and recommend it highly.			"

												This game has a good message and does a very good job of connecting each character's story. It's a simple game that has a great meaning, which I applaud. The gameplay was a little repetitive for me though. It's pretty much all fetch quests through puzzles, which got pretty old after a while. However, the game is only about 4 hours long, so you'll reach the ending by the time you're fed up with any of it.			"

												This game is a neat little puzzle game set in WW1, about a father who joins the war on the French side after his son is sent back to Germany and drafted into their army. I liked the game because it was very smooth and polished, the characters all had interesting backstories, and the music was just right. I also liked the fact that there was a little fact window in the pause menu that gave you actual WW1 facts that pertained to where you were in the game. In all, I'd say its a good buy.			"

												A great game about the other side of the madallion. We mostly play as a powerful 'invincible' soldier in games. it could be either CoD or Battlefield or CS:GO it doesn't matter but this game shows the real face of the war, the game we choose not to see and it displays the real evil face of war through the ordinary people from both sides of the opponents. While playing the game, it reminded me a German television show named 'Unsere Mutter, Unsere Vater' meaning 'Our Mothers, Our Fathers'. We eager to play the war games as the powerful, unstoppable man but the reality is different. In wars, people die, families, children suffer. All the inheritance of mankind can be destroyed with just one bomb. Valiant Hearts is showing that ugly side that we do not want to see. It is a beautiful game, a emotionally strong game. I strongly recommend it.			"

												Valiant Hearts is able to tell the horror of the war, while also finding hope and love amidst all the chaos. It has some charming puzzles and some interesting set pieces. You become invested in the characters, despite the only characterizations are their short simlish like one liners to each other and the narrator's story. Some parts near the end of the game get a little aggravating, only because it forgoes some of the gameplay you were taught to expect and essentially play a very patient and quick game of Simon Says, where I ended up losing and restarting multiple times because the reaction time was very small compared to the rest of the game. Though annoying it didnt deter from the overall experience. As you would expect, the story culminates in one hell of a feels train.			"

												Valiant Hearts is more an interactive story than a game. Wrapped in a World War I puzzle-platformer, this story is not a challenge to play through. Puzzles have no complexity and the player is only dealing with one at a time. Challenges primarily involve pickup and deliver quests between elements on the level, block pushing, block pulling, and shape-matching. There are a few platformer-style action sequences reminiscent of Frogger-style gameplay. These same sequences are timed to epic orchestral music, which at least makes them enjoyable if not a frustrating chore put in to progress the game's story.There is a meta-game of finding historical items. Every level possesses a half-dozen collectibles that can be found and picked up. They serve no gameplay purpose and are completely optional, but come with facts relating them to the historical setting of the level they are found in. Paired with multi-paragraph articles introducing the historical significance of the different settings of the game's levels, this adds an element to Valiant Hearts that transcends the colorful animated cartoon warfront and grounds it in historical context.Don't play it for the puzzles, play it for the story and for the beautiful art style. The level backdrops and bullish character art evoke the war setting magnificently and even bring it some enjoyable color which realistically did not exist. Unfortunately, animations are not particularly well-executed and there is one severely lacking artistic element: blood. In a game set in a theme of death and destruction, purposefully not including blood in the game (likely to maintain ratings standards) harms the ability to tell a story as powerful and evocative as Valiant Hearts.Finally, a sweeping storyline with a twist of historical education around the setting of WWI cannot ignore the subject of death. The characters traverse several death-defying accounts throughout the game's four chapters as the player believes the protagonists are immune to war's ultimate price for the sake of story progression. At times, this is a bit ridiculous, with dozens of animated characters being mowed down by machine gun fire while the player continually respawns to pass the movement-timed trench-death puzzles. Ultimately, the game addresses the topic of death as a part of the finale and it is potentially one of the more controversial moments that will keep this art-piece game out of classrooms. It's hard to tell if it is a well-placed plot-twist element or a final historical morality message written into the narrative, but it works very well.In summary, Valiant Hearts is a brilliantly packaged, historically sprinkled interactive fiction. The puzzles are overtly simple and linear, but this is a game you play for the experience rather than the challenge. Going forward, while I believe there are too many World War Two-themed games out there, a Valiant Hearts sequel: WWII would be a worthy cut above the rest. Let's hope it gets made. In the meantime, experience World War One through the moving story Valiant Hearts.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle game. The thing that separates it from other games like this is that this game is set during the first World War. It follows the adventures of four people and one dog as they fight through the war. It is rich with history, and provides a lot of information about the Great War and the different people that were involved in it. If you love history and puzzle games, this is for you.This game is fantastic, but I suffered through a lot of glitches. Changing the keybinds made controlling the digging mechanic mess up, and the only way to fix it was to rebind back to the original controls. Another instance was getting caught in an infinite loop that prevented me from beating a boss. The only fix for this was to change my resolution to something incredibly low (800x600) just to get the boss sequence to work correctly. This game is filled with bugs but the steam community page has threads upon threads of bugs and solutions. The addition of having to use Ubisoft's UPlay system made my game launch a lot slower and it forces you to sign up with UPlay to actually play the game. The story is very fascinating, gameplay is pretty solid (took me about 8 hours), music and art are very charming and fitting. I would definitely recommend this game despite its glitches as it is one of the most moving games I've ever played, as it is based on true events of a terrible time in our world's history.			"

												This game details the story of a French man, his daughter, her German husband, their Belgian friend, an American soldier, and their loyal dog, during one of the most traumatic events in human history; World War I. If you're a history buff, you'll like this game. If you're not, you'll learn a few things. It takes some liberties with history but it portrays facts in it's own quaint artstyle. The gameplay mainly consists of non-difficult puzzles, stealth elements, and small quick-time events. But the beauty of the game comes from the imagery conveyed, the narrator, and the splendid musical score.Also this game requires UPlay, but after playing through Valiant Hearts once....♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'd play it again on Origin, Steam, UPlay, Impulse, GWFL.... Definitely something that makes your eyes sweat and your nose runny, so prepare your tissues.			"

												I was interestet in Valiant Hearts, because I have never seen a RPG game regarding WWI.Now I have finished all sequences in round about ten hours. Ok, this is not very long, but these 10 hours were really nice playing time. There are a lot of secrets to discover and to unravel a lot of mysteries.You are playing four different characters, that all have a common history / story together.A really nice thing was the idea with the lovely dog, that helps you to survive different situations.During the game you can also read a lot of facts and watch different fotos depending WWI. I am hoping that this game will get a second part (what the last sequence in the credits let me guess :-)).I can highly recommend to play this game for everyone who likes to play RPG and is interested a little bit in history.

												A game about resolving puzzles and complete obstacle courses which tells a superb story in the meantime. You take the role of several people whose fate got crossed during the First World War and now must survive until the end to go back to their loved ones. It's an amazingly sad story with so many points in which it seems like everything is lost but you somehow manage to keep going. This game proposes multiple challanges that will require you to be think for a while in order to progress.Thing is, this is SUCH a GREAT game that it can't be described with words. And I know it is going to be the shortest of my reviews, but you have to experience it by yourself. You want to know if it is worth your money or not? Belive me, IT IS.+ Varaiety of challanges which will require you to sit back and think your way forward.+ The in-game graphics look like out of a comic. They are very well drown.+ Definetely one the best stories I have seen in a while. I know I'm repeating myself, but I was genuinely crying in the final cutscene, and I'm not ashamed of saying that. You've got to see it.+ Optional collectibles and some pieces of trivia about the First World War keep banging your head to remember you that this is no fiction. That horrible war happened.- The puzzles only have one possible answer and it is not going to take long for you to figure it out.- Overall a short game. Took me about three sesions (seven-ish hours) to finish it, and I stopped to search for most of the optional collectibles. It is very easy to blaze your way through puzzles, obstacle courses and boss fights.- UPlay. Enough said.This game gets a 9 out of 10. It was going to be a 7.5, but then I remembered once again the ending and I decided to go the extra mile.			"

												I have always been intrigued when it comes to history. More so with wars that has shaped our world how it is today. This game filled with bits of historical insight that would probably never be seen in a history book, I grew some sort of connection by it. The characters were simplistic in some ways yet it was not hard to grow attached to them as they progressed through the years of Hell. Scene after scene of carnage, the bodies withering to the ground, even as a game you cannot help but think what was going through the minds of the ones who were fighting this war. And at the end, when the game was all done, as someone who was in Iraq I could not help but think, how much time will pass until this war has been forgotten.////Edit//// Battlefield 1 might have the right feel for WW1, but I still think this game does a far better job.

												SUMMARY: For those who don't want to read more, Valiant Hearts is simply an awesome as well as moving game and I highly recommend it; you won't regret picking it up.As someone who has been fortunate enough to live in a peaceful country, war is something that, thankfully, I've never personally experienced.  As a result, it's hard for me to truly understand the terror and horror of what being in a war actually is.  I've seen the awful photos and videos but that's not like actually being there, fighting for your life or just trying to survive.  That's why I appreciate games like Valiant Hearts that puts a real and human perspective on war and shows just how terrible both sides can be sometimes.Valiant Hearts is an adventure / puzzle game set in Western Europe during World War I.  You play as one of four regular people (or their dog companion) who didn't want war and are simply doing their best to survive it.  The gameplay involves solving 2D puzzles (e.g. collecting required parts, flipping switches, etc.) as well as timing your movement to avoid enemy obstacles and hazards; it's not too difficult in general, even though there can be some challenging parts.There's also an educational component to it; the developers of the game partnered up with a group of WWI historians to ensure that the game is as historical accurate as possible.  As a result, there is information on each the big battles and events that occured during the war; in addition, every level has historical objects that the player can collect, each of which has their own descriptions.  While not required, reading this material adds more immersion and ultimately understand of what life what like during that time.The graphics are great and the art style is truly unique; all of the graphics are hand-drawn and are unlike any other game I've seen.  There is an incredible attention to detail; obviously, a lot of care and effort went into making the world feel alive.  The backgrounds are frequently dynamic, highlighting that you're just in some small part of the war and that there's action going on elsewhere.The music and sound effects in the game are amazing and add further immersion to the game.  They actually use songs and anthems that are appropriate to that time period and place; it made me feel like I had been transported back to time.  It really is a beautiful soundtrack and one that I actually purchased because of how nice it was/While the rest of the game is great, the real appeal of Valiant Hearts is its atmosphere and story; it shows regular people, not super soldiers, who have to deal with the brutality of war.  It makes you invested in these characters and you end up finding that you really do care about them and want them to live through it.  It shows the human side of war and how not everything is black and white.  I'm not going to spoil anything here but I actually did tear up a bit at the end; I'm sure I'm not the only one who did. So to make a long story short, Valiant Hearts is an amazing game that I highly recommend that you experience for yourself.			"

												My first ever review of a game. It is true, I swear and yell at my opponents in CS. Animosity is part of most FPS shooters. However, games like Valiant Hearts show other parts of gaming. This game moved me deeply. Its music, its atmosphere, its  attention to detail makes it fantastic. It is a game that will bring you down to earth after having spent hours and hours yelling at your incapable teammates in other games. This game shows the realities of war. This game shows you the costs when politicians without skin in the game ask for foreign intervention. It makes you think about bigger questions and for this alone it deserves to be played!			"

												A masterpiece with amazing art design, beautiful music and an emotionaly moving story line. Gameplay wise, it's pretty easy to handle due to the fact it is a 2D based game that uses the keys to move. The puzzles in this game are challenging and get your brain to work, which is great. However, some moments in this game (like in many other puzzle games) are immencely frustraiting but can be overcome.... after a couple tries at it that is.  Needless to say though, it brought me to tears and is, in my opinion the best game of 2014. I highly recommend it to others for a change in the usual and for an experience that will stay with you for the rest of your life.			"

												Great game that taught me a history lesson without even knowing it. Fantastic puzzles, not too difficult nor too easy but it really made the cogs turn in my brain. Great story as well. Almost made me tear up but I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing man so I didn't (but I really wanted to). Just shows how the people who fought in World War 1 was going through and how difficult it was. Great game from the story, to the puzzles, and the history lessons in between. 10/10  IGN			"

												The second game ever to make me cry. A moving and powerful WW1 tribute, that doesn't always get by on it's rudimentary adventure/QTE gameplay, but hits where it counts.Also, well worth it for the hidden collectibles, diary entries and fact pages which provide a great deal of interesting historical information about the war.

												My game of the year so far.. Just finished it a few minutes ago and tears are still rolling down my face. It's very rare that a game has such a heavy emotional effect on me. I also find it sad that every dull CoD or Battlefield game always rules the game-charts before they are even released and a beautiful game like Valiant Hearts which even tells a real story of the horrific wars that mankind went through is almost unnoticed.I'd recommend everyone to buy this one. And yes it requires Uplay but seriously - it would be a shame to miss this masterpiece of story-telling for such a small reason.			"

												Just finished this. It takes a while for the heft of the story to build, but it was deeply affecting. It somehow injects humor into the puzzles without taking away from the seriousness of the plot. The art and music are incredible. The puzzles aren't too simple or too hard. They feel just right to keep things moving, and never get in the way. Much of the time they are teaching you history without being too heavy handed about it. I need some time to reflect, but right now this is definitely a 2014 GOTY candidate for me. Just a perfect little game.			"

PROS:+ absolutely amazing story+ original gameplay approach+ fun level design & puzzles+ nice art style & many historical facts about WW1+ great optimalizationCONS:- uPlay- I couldn't handle the feelsComment:Ubisoft did many wrong things lately, especially in 2014, but they did this game right! The best thing they released in 2014. It's related to the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 and is filled with historical facts. Despite goofy and cartoony art style (which looks great) it shows the war in a way you wouldn't expect. EVERYONE suffers in war and that it's a gruesome thing that destroys lives of all involved. The gameplay is really fun and I cannot think of a dull moment when playing any of the four characters. The collectibles in each level are fun to look for and contain historical information. Only thing holding it back a bit is uPlay. Overall a GREAT and touching experience and I recommend this game to everyone!			"

												A crushing vault through a war lamentably untouched by gaming. The mechanics are nicely varied, ranging from simple puzzle-solving to guitar-hero style sequences, although the story takes precedence over actual gameplay. There are a few historical inaccuracies that don't fall into the remit of artistic license, mostly to do with continuing the same tired old tropes that the Great War has acquired, although that doesn't detract from the storyline which is stark and depressing. Although set in one of the bleakest periods of human history which is reflected in its score, the game's core theme is that of hope and the inherent goodness in all people. The biggest problem is ♥♥♥♥ing uplay, but I suppose we can't have everything.			"

												9.4/10A beautiful emotional story from the first world war about family, friends and loss.This games follows a family and how the War ruined their every day lives. It shows how terible this war was and shows this from different perspectives. Father and husband are both taken away from Marie, both to fight in the war but on different sides and this leads to complications. During the war they make friends and do their best to survive another day and try to create a better world, even though it is so cruel. For a better explanation of the story, please watch the trailer.+ Emotional story, Beautiful music, Lovely graphic style, Nice simplistic gameplay- Minor bugs which require you to return to main menu and continue  A beautiful story which really learns you a lesson about the soldier life during the war. If you like the feeling the trailer gives, expect this feeling for the entire game. It is a story to remember.			"

The collectibles and location facts provide interesting information about The Great War and life at the time, which adds to the experience.

												I was interestet in Valiant Hearts, because I have never seen a RPG game regarding WWI.Now I have finished all sequences in round about ten hours. Ok, this is not very long, but these 10 hours were really nice playing time. There are a lot of secrets to discover and to unravel a lot of mysteries.You are playing four different characters, that all have a common history / story together.A really nice thing was the idea with the lovely dog, that helps you to survive different situations.During the game you can also read a lot of facts and watch different fotos depending WWI. I am hoping that this game will get a second part (what the last sequence in the credits let me guess :-)).I can highly recommend to play this game for everyone who likes to play RPG and is interested a little bit in history.

												This game is one of the best games i have played in a while. The gameplay is fairly straight forward, a 2D puzzle game, but it is well done. The puzzles are done well, they are not too difficult and not too easy. I think this was a good decision from the developers, you don't want to go through this game raging or getting stuck at puzzles. I love the art style, it has a certain flair to it which i think really fits this game. Some people might get discouraged by the art style and think this game is this happy shootie game. IT ISN'T. This game is dark and emotional. The music is on point, it is beautifull and fits the game so perfectly. I especially liked the music from the driving stages. This game shows you the horrors of war and it will make you cry at the end. I suggest you watch the ending with a box of tissues next to you. Don't worry it is oke to cry, everybody has cried at the ending.			"

Gameplay wise, it's pretty easy to handle due to the fact it is a 2D based game that uses the keys to move. The puzzles in this game are challenging and get your brain to work, which is great. However, some moments in this game (like in many other puzzle games) are immencely frustraiting but can be overcome.... after a couple tries at it that is.  Needless to say though, it brought me to tears and is, in my opinion the best game of 2014.

												Aside from Uplay poking it's ugly head into your business, this game is awesome. Great sound design, solid gameplay and even okay graphics.Now for some cons:The graphics... Some options would have been nice. I know that it is designed to lock you in and immerse you, but the lack of really ANY settings partaining to visual fidelity is a bit obnoxious. It looked good at 1080p, but sometimes it left me feeling like I was running out of screen.QUICK TIME EVENTS! Holy crap people can we drop the damn QTEs already!? The nurse character is nothing but QTEs and although they aren't that challanging, it completely destroys immersion. The game is a button-masher for sure, as there is no mouse control (aside from in menus), but man when a QTE kicks in I just want to kick a puppy.And the pros:LOVELY! This game has an amazing aesthetic that is extremely immersive. Although quite a few points in the game do shatter any and all immersion, it won't be long before it pulls you back in. Just suspend your disbelief for a second and it'll get you.Fantastic gameplay. If you're into story driven puzzle platformers you'll enjoy this. The game also features collectables that have actual historic descriptions written in, so you can technically learn a couple things while you're at it.Now the real question, ""Was it fun?"" Absolutely it was! My gripes are really just nitpicks. This game is a lot of fun all the way to the end. There was never a moment I felt like putting it down, so I didn't. I think if you need to spend 8 hours you definitely can't go wrong with this game.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a game that I will never forget and hold dear to my heart. Valiant Hearts follows 3 loving characters named Anna, A medic willing to her father who was captured by the Germans, Freddie, An American who joins the war to seek revenge on a German Warlord, Baron Von Dorf. I saved the best for last, Emile, A man who is drafted into the war and hopes to return to his family. This game's artstyle is what really ""draws"" me in. The game is a puzzle type of game that some people may not enjoy but I must express this ""Play the game!"" Although the game is full of puzzles, the game has a hint system to help you if you're stuck! The game is really well made. The story is quite dark and well strung together. The characters are ones that you will love! Play the game to enjoy a fun, yet gritty and dark story of sadness and death. For Example: On one of the missions, you play through a level in Verdun, A battle that lasted 300 days and had 600,000 casualties. Imagine that. Put it into a game. Amazing! I forgot to add this but throughout the game, on every mission you are presented with amazing facts about WW1. Now time to finish this review! 9/10 (On my scale at least) Make sure you buy this game for the original price and An absolute buy if its on sale!			"

The puzzle can be very confusing, and you may need to look them up, but they are still very fun. Only con is that its pretty short (9 hours). The ending is also very sad, but I count that as a middle thing. (In my humble opinion). Overal, I give this game an 11/10. I think they might make a sequel in World War 2, because at the end after the credits there is giant metal destroyers that look like ones used in WW2.			"

												This is an absolutely beautiful game.   I also thought the levels were well thought out and I enjoyed the historical informaiton within the game, although it really felt separate from the actual gameplay.  Some people seem to get really emotionally invested.  It does seem shaped to play on emotions and while it never felt unnatural,  I never felt connected to the characters like that.I did run into bugs twice that forced me to restart the levels, which was only a mild frustration.    Uplay was as frustrating as ever, giving me a lot of difficulty actually getting the game to start up for the first time  and minor difficulty a couple times after that.  Overall, I feel pretty comfortable recommending it.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a breathtaking, awe-inspiring journey that the depicts the horror of war in a perfect gameplay mix of action, adventure and puzzles.You experience the great conflict that was World War 1 through the perpectives of 4 characters, all with their own backgrounds, personal motives and abilities: Karl, the german soldier who focuses on stealth. Emile, the french farmer and Karls father-in-law who focuses on solving all sorts of different puzzles with the help of his dog companion Walt. Freddie, the american volunteer who focuses on running forward, dodging mortars and knocking down anything and anyone in front of him with his fists and Anna, the belgian student turned medic who focuces on healing and saving wounded soldiers and civilians.Despite this game having a rather silly and friendly looking art style, you should not let that fool you since you will be taking cover from machine-gun fire behind the corpses of your fallen comrades, watch adult men shiver in fear and see innocent civilians cry over the loss of their family members. The game goes from gut punch to gut punch to the occasional kick in the heart as you, the player, will have to watch these loveable and colourful characters fight their way through the seven rings of hell without knowing that the more they fight, the more horrible it's going to get.A true testament to the bravery of every army man who has ever lived, who I feel, does not get the respect they deserve. Doesn't matter if they are american, british, french, japanese, german etc. Any man or woman who can pick up arms and risk their lifes for the safety of their family and country, is a true hero.			"

												""Valiant Hearts"" is maybe Ubisoft's tribute to the victims (soldiers as well as civilians and aid workers) of World War I - and wow, was it an impressive experience!The player controls four different characters as they try to survive the war or help to survive. So it's a mixture of action, adventure and puzzle game which also challenges the player's skill and concentration.Don't let the comic book-like visual style confuse you: This game does not hide or relativize the horrors of this war. Sure, there are no deformed faces or guts seen in the game but still enough blood and corpses to keep serious and yet it's not glorifying the lust for blood. In a time where one war ego shooter after another gets made, ""Valiant Hearts"" touches the player's heart due to the characters and the constant reminders of humanity and kindness between (or even in the middle of) battles.Sure, the game has its funny and lighter moments, too. But they hardly ever make the whole story and situation look silly.The puzzles are quite easy but fun to solve. And the game gets more and more intense the further the player goes.You can also collect information about World War I, achievements and special hidden items which served special purposes back then. And last but not least: This game can be a real tearjerker at the latest in the final chapter.In a nutshell: I can definitely recommend ""Valiant Hearts"" to about anyone. It was a great experience of a game and I would replay it someday.			"

												Coming off of my playthrough of Child of Light, I was excited to see what this game would bring with its creativity. Valiant Hearts takes the Great War and manages to place it in a narrative that, while not showing the bluntness of the war, still manages to capture the bittersweet emotions and troubling times.The game is a 2D puzzle platformer, and for the most parts puzzles are fairly simple. However, the 2D, while at its strongest due to it's art style, did present drawbacks when it came to puzzles where you initially hide from the enemy. 2D lacks depth, and so the first few times I had to hide, I didn't know I could hide behind walls because there was nothing to separate it from the background dimensionally. There was also one time where I felt it wasn't clear which button to press, but I think that was due to me being tired while playing. For the most part, it'll be a simple game if you are used to puzzle games.Given that, the story and creative design with the game make this shine. Based off of letters sent during the war, you follow five people whose paths cross and friendships are built. It's a touching narrative, and it helps that the background and historical facts they give you help you to immerse yourself in this time period. The art is in a comic book style, with atypical colors for their protagonists - everybody is mostly colored grey or with muted colors (especially as the game goes on), something I find very nice in representing the feelings of WW1. There are also scenes presented like a motion comic book, which I thought made for a great visual presentation. Musically, the score is fantastic as well as melancholic, and I absolutely loved the driving scenes set to the sounds of famous classical pieces.Some may find this game a fluffy version of the war, especially those that are history experts on this time period. While it definitely does not show in explicit detail the suffering of the soldiers and those around them graphically, I think it does a good job in presenting it to an audience that may not know too much about the war in the first place. I think, personally, this would be a great game to play with kids to help educate them about the history of the war. The many historical facts presented help to aide this, and I think the themes it brings up are great themes to discuss with children or teens wanting to learn more about WW1. As the game says, ""We must strive to cherish their memory and never forget."" "

												This is not your regular game, this is an art/emotional puzzle game that does not shine in gameplay, but in the story and the characters. I wouldn't say the puzzles are hard, which they probably aren't supposed to be because they are just there to give you some kind of gameplay element. So yeah, this game is one emotional rollercoaster, but a fantastic one. I highly suggest you bring tissues with you.Amazing game.			"

If you can buy it i would suggest it greatly and do not regret anything. 10/10 We need Ubisoft to make more games like this. "

												Just beat it, and I will say it is a wonderful little game. The art and music are beautiful. The music perfectly captured the somber tone of most of the game, while swelling to cersendos at the most daring moments, while the art was just just cute enough to portray the gruesome nature of the war, while still being beautifully charming. Done by the fine people at UbiArt, same folks who did Rayman Origins and Legends, so expect high quality. Easily one of the strongest suits of the game.The gameplay is puzzle based... and bit nonsequitor with the game, to be honest. The Great War is happening around you, and yet you are turning wheels and throwing bottles. I understand the bind of telling a story ABOUT people DURING the war, and trying to stray away form combat, but is a bit odd. There are a a bit of diversity with some other forms of gameplay and they were a nice change of pace, often highlighting a tense moment. Besides that the puzzles are simple and yet clever. You will more often have trouble executing than figuring out the puzzleStory and chracters are top notch. Despite mostly speaking in Gibberish or short clips of their natuve language, the characters all comminuacate a depth of emotion and feeling. I think that is really sttributed to the art team, once again. The story is truly one of valiant people, and you will be attatched to them and thier struggles and hopes.Finally, there is actually quite a bit of learning here! I've taken AP European History, and there is still a great deal here I didn't learn in my studies. The collection of War Heirlooms fit nicely into the educational bits, and some of the sweeping historical facts give very nice contecxt to a level or area. I really think this information enhances the gameplay and helps you really geta  feel for what our Valiant Hearts are battling through. The collection aspect of it may add on an extra 1.5 hours, so a brief stroll for 100%. I highly reccomend looking for them and reading up, as it is another strong suit of the game. This is edutainment done right.Thing of note: Double DRM with Steam and Uplay. It is a pain to ahve to go thropugh and can be iffy. experienced issues with being unable to open the game, due to their being an instance of then game alredy running, despite Task Manager revelaing this as untrue.Overall it's a nice, small heartfelt game. Any history junky should play and enjoy this. Strong aesthetic aspects from a strong animation department with beautiful music and characters are the backbone for a simplisctic puzzler.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 2D adventure game from Ubisoft Montpellier. It is one of the few games set in World War I and one of the few war games to focus on puzzle solving rather than combat. It's not always consistent in its execution but it gets points for striving for something different. For more, check out the  VIDEO REVIEW.

												Valiant Hearts is an action puzzle game that will never amaze you with its mechanics. What does amaze, is how the gameplay completely makes sense in the game's setting (you're always 'living the character') and this is where the game shines. Valiant Hearts tells a fantastical story in a very factitious setting, and allows the player to look for memorabillias scattered throughout to learn about the reality behind the game that people have lived through, with heartbreaking result.

Right in the feels!!It's rare when a game puts so much effort to immerse you in its world such as what Valiants Hearts does. From the unique art style, in-game facts about WW1 and its music. You actually feel as if you are a part of this world. Beautiful yet horrific, we are thrown into the Great War as several group of characters. Each with their own ambition and goals, they set out on a journey against all odds.StyleEvery thing about this game is perfect (no......not you Uplay. You f*cking suck). The art style is cartoony with a bright color palette. This works well when you aren't put in the actual war itself because it captures the beauty of the early 1900's. During war sequences, the palette becomes more dulled and gritty. There isn't a lot of blood and gore but this game doesn't need it. It has already captured the horrors of war. SoundtrackEasily one of the best this game has to offer. As soon as you boot up the game, you are greeted by a sorrowful melody. It will tug at your heart strings because you know the feels will come. The game features some awesome classic tracks from its era.GameplayThere is no fighting, shooting, or sillyness of any kind. This game is a straight puzzler (with 2 or 3 car chase sections). Now you don't have to be a genius to figure out how to solve these puzzles. They are quite literally easy and smart. If you do get stuck, the game has a hint system. As a 2-D puzzler the game is deep and engaging. There are at least 100 collectibles to find and a ton of facts behind the Great War. This game will not only tear your heart to shreds, but you will become a lot more educated after the game is over. You'll be a crying genius.StoryWow.....The story is engaging and it hooks you immediately. The first five minutes everything is fine and dandy until suddenly sh*t hits the fan and quite a lot of it. You first play as Emile who is a French grandfather. He is pulled into the war by force and learns that his son-in-law Karl (who is German) has also been forced to fight in the war. Emile goes out to search for Karl and makes a lot of friends during his journey. Each character you meet has a backstory and a reason why they joined the war. You care a lot about these characters and each one has their quirks.Verdict10 out of 10. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. Valiant Hearts is a game that only shows the Great War (or any war for that matter) on the surface. It will teach you to appreciate what you have now and what it took to maintain it. You will see the horrors of war unlike any game I have ever seen. But be warned, should you dare buy and play this game, BRING A F*CK TON OF TISSUES!!!			"

												It would be easy to say that 'Valiant Hearts' is a game about the First World War - but that would miss the game's essence, in the same way that saying 'Star Wars' is a movie about space would.  'Valiant Hearts' is about four people forced to live through one of the most tragic and trying eras imaginable.That isn't to say that 'Valiant Hearts' doesn't contain a wealth of information about the First World War.  Through the characters you alternate between controlling - a German soldier, a French conscript, an American volunteer, and a Belgian nurse - you experience different aspects of the war: the initial excitement of the call to battle, the terrors of the trench, the desperate fight to save lives.  Historical facts and objects provide additional real-life context.The gameplay is straightforward.  In between the occasional stealth and driving segments, you'll be pulling levers and solving find-and-fetch puzzles.  The puzzles are neither easy nor especially hard; they feel appropriately sized as a driver for the main narrative.It's this narrative that is the true star of the game.  Backed by a wonderfully melancholy soundtrack (and leavened by moments of odd hilarity), it forces the player to understand history - not as an abstract catalog of dates and facts, but as a story with real human stakes that still relate today.--------------------When the bullet cameI closed my eyes, saw your faceAnd went home at last.

(no more spoilers)Controls 6/10 - Clearly shown at te start however sometimes can get confusing (e.g- do i press a or b)Music 9/10 - Always relates to what is happening in the game, relaxing but tense in specific moments.Overall - This is a game which everyone should have, granted nobody will have 1000+ hours in it, but I think that everyone should have at least played it through once. Buy it, especially if it's on sale. "

												this is my first time ever writing about a game on steam, beacause it is just that good. This game is for those who like- military history- artistic value- a great emotion-filled story- solving puzzles (the one I care about the least, but might appeal to others)Do not mistake the depth of the game because of its comical graphics. It is seriously rich in all the four points above.See my full review on http://southeastasean.blogspot.com/2015/05/review-valiant-heartsthe-great-war.html "

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™I bought this game on almoast 1 year ago and forgott that i bought it, some months later I installed it and wanted to try  it out. I played it for a couple of minutes but then it faded away again back into the masses of games in my steam library.Some days ago I picked up playing it again.I finished it just a couple of minutes ago.The ending sent shivers down my spine, I got goosebumps and I got sad. There's not many games that makes me feel sad, almoast none.This game will play with your feelings without you knowing it, it dosn't have great grapichs, alot of action or killing. You will never even hold a rifle in the game. But it dosn't make this into a bad game, it makes it into a great game. I would even go so far to say that I see this game as a piece of art.You can notice that the developers put a piece of thier hearts and souls in this game, it has a great story, many collectibles and alot of events that will make you feel satisfied. This game requiers a 3rd party software, Uplay. But the game compensates with that just by being a great game. But then I dont realy hate Uplay, I just dont like it. Just like I dont like to walk my dog when it's raining outside.In this game you will follow a couple of persons on their way through the great war.Emile, the french man that will do anythig for his wife and country.Carl, the german that is married to Emile's daughter and have been exiled from france and sent back to germany.Anna the belgian that devotes her heart and soul to save people from dying.Freddie the american that joins the war in the pursue of revenge.Each one of these characters will have a kind of uniqe missions and you will try your best to find all the collectibles and finnish the missions on record time.I love this game, I even think that it has replay value.There's not many games that will teach you history this good. I learnt more from this than from school, I got more of an insight into a soldiers life in the trenches from this game than from any book, movie or other game I've ever seen/read/played.Sometimes i even thought about how I would react if I were there and I ended up thinking that most of the times I wouldnt be able to do the most. It could both depend on my lacking courage or strenght. There were heroes on both sides of the war, it dosn't matter what you were fighting for, Men and women devoted their lifes for their countries, families, thoughts and faith. The war was a waste of huma lifes and resources. To all soldiers and civilians that died in the war, Rest in peace, people from a country but heroes of a world.To end this review and info post I will now give my final verdict.10/10100/1001000/1000I so want to see another game like this about other people in the same war or from another war.This is the game that touched my heartMade me think about how I would react to the events of the warMade me happy But the most important thing is that I had fun.Ever had that feeling that you wish that you can play a game for the first time again? I have that wish right now.Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™Best game ever!			"

												This is a beautiful game. Beautiful art, wonderful (and tragic) story, simple and effective gameplay, with just the right amount of challenging puzzles. Think of a graphic novel about the Great War come to life. It is clear that everyone who worked on this game were passionate about it, and it shows. Playing through the story will stay with me the rest of my life.For the completionists out there, there are lots of things to look for and collect. Every item you collect gives you a little history of the life and horrors of the Great War. I am playing through a third time to get everything.This is the kind of game that deserves strong support from the player community. This is the kind of game that should be the gold standard for a video game as art and entertainment. I had fun, I felt the full gabmit of emotions, and I learned something.Buy. This. Game.

The true essence of warUnlike those badass military-shooters, this game tells what the real consequences of a war are. Not many games have tried this kind of 2D/2.5D-puzzler gameplay and for this, Ubisoft truly deserves an applause. Many people assume that cartoon-ish graphics may make the game unnatural or incomprehensible. Believe me, after completing the story, I doubt any graphics engine could have gone so well with the story and not-to-forget, the voice acting. Moreover, its soundtrack is indubitably one of the best I've heard in a video game. Anyone seeking for a story-rich experience should definitely try this.Overall rating - 8/10 "

												9.5/10 Finished the game in 1 breath! 13 hours playtime (I did not hurry).  The very well excecuted story , the funny voices , the perfect symphony of music and gameplay, the gameplay itself...I got sucked in and did not stop playing untill the story was finished! Drawing style is awesome, historic value is pretty neat. I actually learned something.  Atmosphere is great! Even before I started playing I knew I would like it. But I never expected it to be this awesome.  It's not very easy, but also not very hard.  Perfectly balanced.I think they did a great job in showing the atmosphere of WWI.  A dirty war...I felt like I was right in the middle of it!   This game shows that a game does not always have to be 3d to be excellent. The only reason I do not score it 10/10 is because I had to restart the game 3 times because of a flaw. I got stuck  because the game did not seem to ""read""what should happen next. Result was that I could not get out of a room for instance. Restarting fixed it on all 3 occassions. Apart from that: Perfect game!			"

												""Valiant Hearts"" is an epic game telling the story of an epic conflict. The First World War as seen from the eyes of its individual participants, bound together by fate, is something that will stay with you for a long time even when you finish it.The cartoon-like approach to the game graphics starkly contrasts with the gruesome reality of trench warfare on the Western Front: human wave attacks, incompetence of the leaders, industrialisation of warfare, giving an unforgiven experience to those who decide to follow Emile, Anna, Karl, Freddie and Walt the dog on their journey across the war-torn France.The game plays equally well on a gamepad and the keyboard. The steering on the latter is rather unorthodox, but it's easy to get used to it.The music, both the classical pieces and the one written especially for the game, is catchy and emotional, but fortunately it does not drag the player's attention away from the main events.My one complaint is that because of the mandatory usage of uPlay, there are certain bugs that may hinder or even prevent further progress. For example, when I was playing with a gamepad, certain sections of chase sequences would glitch and repeat forever, making it impossible to beat this fragment. It wasn't until after I unplugged the gamepad and disabled uPlay that I was able to finish it. Also, if you choose ""New Game"", you'll loose access to all the chapters you've already played - in my case, the whole game. If you want to keep them, never use the ""New Game"" options after starting it, always pick them from the ""Chapters"" tab.If you're tired of repetitive, clone-like fpses set during fictious, futuristic conflicts, Valiant Hearts is a good choice. Just prepare some tissues, because feels shall be had.tl;dr version: 19/18 made me cry.			"

												I loved my experience with this game. Admittedly I didn't find the gameplay to be all that thrilling, and at times felt repetitive. However the puzzles are enjoyable nonetheless, as they feel fresh each time. The medical quicktime events were very annoying though. The handrawn artstyle is very nice, and the simple yet immersive backdrops do a great job at making the player really feel the mood and atmosphere. The animations are pleasent , and the music great! But most inportantly, the characters and narrative are the reason to play this title. The developers did a good job at making me feel connected to this characters almost instantly. The story is told from various perspectives, but all comes together, much like Pulp Fiction. The story is deep and emotional rollercoaster. I would like to see this made into a movie.  The $15 price tag is fair, for the experience that I got out of it, but I recommend picking this up on a sale if you can.			"

I believe uPlay has a cloud for your saved games, but really who the hell cares.TLDR; buy it.			"

I speak French too and the way characters mumble words in English and French is just hilarious.4. Story - I am 1/3 of the game so far and the story is heart-warming. The characters are so cute!5. Gameplay - challenging, but not too much, puzzles.6. Fun-facts about WW1.-:1. Uplay - but no biggy.Overall - you enjoy a beautiful, touching and sometimes funny game, develop your problem solving skills and learn a bit about WW1. What's not to like?			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a game that I will never forget and hold dear to my heart. Valiant Hearts follows 3 loving characters named Anna, A medic willing to her father who was captured by the Germans, Freddie, An American who joins the war to seek revenge on a German Warlord, Baron Von Dorf. I saved the best for last, Emile, A man who is drafted into the war and hopes to return to his family. This game's artstyle is what really ""draws"" me in. The game is a puzzle type of game that some people may not enjoy but I must express this ""Play the game!"" Although the game is full of puzzles, the game has a hint system to help you if you're stuck! The game is really well made. The story is quite dark and well strung together. The characters are ones that you will love! Play the game to enjoy a fun, yet gritty and dark story of sadness and death. For Example: On one of the missions, you play through a level in Verdun, A battle that lasted 300 days and had 600,000 casualties. Imagine that. Put it into a game. Amazing! I forgot to add this but throughout the game, on every mission you are presented with amazing facts about WW1. Now time to finish this review! 9/10 (On my scale at least) Make sure you buy this game for the original price and An absolute buy if its on sale!			"

												I had a great time playing it. The graphics are nice, the music is great, and I definitely learned a lot about the 1st World War. I like how they took a different angle and viewpoint with respect to war games. It's a great casual game, especially for those who are interested in military history.			"

												This is a fantastic game to play. I learnt a lot about World War 1 during the game, that I didn't need to pretend I'm a history buff now that Battlefield 1 is out soon, and scour Wiki and act like a 'I know aaaall there is about the weapons'.So, what did I think overall?Well, I love the fact that its a cartoony game, but the characters are very well done, and you actually get immersed in the storyline.The music at the very beginning before you play the game is very nice, and there are all sorts of tracks throughout the game.I also liked the fact that you wern't just playing as character A, then B and so on, but switching around now and then, and in some cases, meeting together.The collectables are good, but for once its not just 'you found a bit of soap' but a little bit of history about it. Plus, apart from the story of the game, there are actual photo's and descriptions that appear that make you realise how crappy the war really was.Some bits that I found infuriating though: being the nurse and using the heart monitor to do first aid. I nearly lost the will towards certain parts. And the digging is a strange one, but once you figure it out its ok.But, if you like 'adventure-type' puzzle games with a great storyline, I recommend this wholeheartedly.Get it, you won't be disappointed.Also, a short game review here, about 6 mins long :)

												What a beautiful game. A truly heart-wrenching story and a perfect sense of atmosphere from a relatively simply-designed game. My only wish is that Ubisoft had made more out of the puzzles. The puzzles are all terribly easy and sometimes just a nuisance getting in the way of the story. I would usually be inclined to not recommend a game for such a shortcoming, but the story of Valiant Hearts is honestly so moving and thrilling that I cannot help but praise it. More than worth the money.			"

												This truely is a piece of art.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a game over different figures who experience war in their own way, all trying to survive, but non of them are soldiers. Volunteers, sure, but not trained killers.StoryThe story is exellent, with an entirely different view on war. Unlike games like Battlefield 1, the characters feel emotions and have their own life. There is no conversation. No words, but some tones is enough.The GraphicsTruely marvelous. The style is quite unique and sometimes morbid. Deaths aren't very often nor very graphic, but at some point in the game you can find a stack of bodies with feet blown off, etc. It is great to look at, the music isn't great, sometimes bland but adds to the atmosphere.The GameplaySome puzzles feel oddly difficult while others are way too easy. The animation doesn't feel fluid at all times. The gameplay often feels bland and boring but gameplay is not too important in comparison (especially with other games).So:+Story+Graphics-GameplayK bye bye m9ts			"

It has it all...joy, heartbreak, love, anger.You can see a lot of thought went into the story and puzzles and I think they got the balance spot on.Buy the game if you want a unique experience and insights on RL history of The Great War.Or buy it just because.

I espeically enjoyed how some scenes had music alligned with the actions the player takes. This game had a fantastic emotional story and I felt that I really did care about the characters. It is also a great historical learning toll as it has alot of background information about World War One. The game is only 6 hours long and has virtually no replay value.

												One of the best games I've played in recent memory. Taking place during WW1, Valiant Hearts: The Great War follows the stories of five tortured souls. Emile, an old and hearty French soldier only trying to get through the war; Freddie, an American volunteer already devastated by the War's effects; Karl, Emile's son-in-law, forced to leave France because of his German roots and immediately forced to fight the country he loves so much; Anna, a war nurse trying to find and save her father; and Walt, a loyal dog following the other four's woeful stories. The game is suprisingly educational, you can tell they really did their research, unlike other War games. Suprisingly, the game actually did a great job of making me want to learn more about WW1. It's very touching and emotional, it made me choke up at several occasions. It even gave me new-found respect for the French. Do yourself a favor, buy this game. Tell other people about it. It's fabulous.			"

Posted: August 9, 2014
												Honestly, I enjoy reading reviews like these when deciding whether to buy a game or not, but I have to confess that I never bothered writing one on my own. Valiant Hearts: The Great War completely changed my mind regarding my laziness. Let me tell you why.Do not let the thought of ""meh, sidescrolling 2D action-advanture"" fool you for one second. This game is a masterpice of art, not trying to convince with an overly complex gameplay or hardcore-realistic graphics. The style of the latter, although not unneccessarily fancy, will grab you instantly and transport not only the setting, but also manages to mimick the atmosphere, from a sophisticated, patriotic and confident public opinion in summer 1914, the sudden realization about the implications of war for the individual, up until the despair when the perversion and intensity of the bloodshed rises, and the senselessness of these massacres becomes obvious. The five intertwined fates caught in this setting will grab you from the very first moment, each in its own way, as the protagonists strive to find their way through this madness in order to keep their loved ones safe and sound. Speaking of sound - the simplified, nonetheless emotional simplification of the different languages absolutely serves its purpose, accompanied by a soundtrack that will literally bring tears to your eyes as the stories draw to their close.Along the story, you will get (optional) background information, always fit to the situation your characters will find themselves in, and also find curious belongings of people whose fate has been decided before yours. Yet another positive aspect is the storytelling itself. The narrative elements are professional, authentic and touching, and not for one second cheesy. You will not be pushed towards picking sides at one point, as Valiant Hearts does not try to draw ""good"" and ""evil"" among the warring factions. What it does, though, is depicting war with all its consequences, not judging guilty and non-guilty, but rather its abnormality and perversion, and the suffering for the people caught in it. And it manages to do so in an astonishing and intelligent way.To sum it up, let me recite my earlier statement: This game is a masterpice of art and definitely worth your attention. If you're tired of the 100th shooter and graphic orgies with cheesy heroism: Do not hesitate a second to buy this true gem and show game developers across the world that we do want more of this kind! I definitely do.			"

												I don't normally write reviews for games I play, but I think this game is really worth an exception.   Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a game that takes you through the historical event 'World War 1', and lets you play as the four characters Karl, Emile, Anna and Freddie.Karl was born on May 6th, 1896, in a village near Strasbourg, Germany. He is a German citizen located in France during the eruption of WW1, and is in the beginning of the game deported to Germany and conscripted into the German army.Profession: unknownEmile is the step father of Karl, and is unlike Karl, nationally French. He was born on March 12th, 1872. Emile faces the same fate as Karl does, but is instead conscripted into France's Military Service.Profession: Emile's unique ability is, since his family has a history in the mining business, to dig gravel and make great tunnels that he can advance through and find secret items with. Anna is a Belgian soon-to-be veterinary, born in Ypres on December 26, 1891, but after a head-on experience with the devastating effects of war, she decides that the human anatomy would be a more fitting profession for her. She becomes a paramedic and later advances to the front to help the ones who are really in need.Profession: paramedicine. Anna's special ability is to heal wounded soldiers, which when performed, puts the player in a quick-time event where you have to push the right arrow keys at the right time.Freddie was born in La Place, Louisiana, on Feberuary 27, 1882.He enlists as an engineer for the French in the beginning of the war in order to get revenge on the Germans who killed his wife, Margaret. Profession: muscle man and 'Barbed Wire Snipper'. Yes, Freddie is the only character to invariably walk around with pliers in his... pockets? Well, this gives him the ability to snip entanglements of barbed wire, set up by the opposing army to slow down your progression.Walt (indirectly playable) is a German shepherd dog trained by the German military to do various task given to him.Although Walt would probably not be considered a 'playable character' by most people, when he is in your prescence in-game, he will help you solve puzzles, fetch items and distract guards whenever you want him to.Just throw an exhortation in his direction and he will comply without hesitation. Such a good dog.Profession: distraction, permeation and fetching. When there is a small space that you can't squeeze through, but there's an important item on the other side of it, Walt is the perfect companion for you.On a normal occation, Walt can distract a guard with his charm, making the guard turn his back towards you. When you have passed the guard, you notice a hole in the wall, and on the other side, there's a stick of dynamite. Tell Walt to squeeze through and fetch it for you, which he does, so you then can light it on fire and throw it at the guard, resulting in a blow that both takes out the guard, and blows away the door he was guarding.And the best thing of them all, he would never desert you. :)Throughout the course of the game, you frequently shift between these four protagonists in order to solve various puzzles, creatively kill German (and sometimes even French) soldiers, dash through early 20th century warfarian terrain with a ""panzerwagen"" invented by a kiddnaped scientist (Anna's father) held prisoner by German officer Baron von Dorf etc.The game features an aesthetically beautiful artwork, collectible items that shows trivia about the item and how it was used during the actual war, facts about different cities' involvation in and management of WW1, personal diaries written by the affected characters in order to get to know them better.And last but absolutely not least, an immensely touching plot that, even if the coding and programming would be♥♥♥♥♥♥ would most likely carry the game anyway.With all that said. Would I recommend the game? Hell yes, I would.Don't ask any questions, just buy it already!			"

												Let me start by saying that even Uplay can't ruin this game.As for a more detailed review:At its core this it is a puzzle-adventure game, however Valiant Hearts is so much more than a game. It is atmospheric story wrapped in real history, love, pain, sorrow, friendship and death.Valiant Hearts has its own style and delivery that will make you connect with main characters and it will unearth your emotions, don't resist it, enjoy it, even though the ending can make you cry. I would advise to buy this game and put everything else aside because the experience and the food for thought that it gives are worth it.P.S.Join my group at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ for more reviews.

												Valiant Hearts tells a beautiful story about a group of people helping each other during the war.  It's a beautiful looking game and has a great soundtrack and interesting characters.  Sometimes the controls can be problematic, but it's a small bump in an otherwise beautiful game through and through.  Some of the puzzles will require you to think more than others, but it's definitely a game that all can enjoy.			"

												This is an amazing game, plain and simple. Everything from the touching stories of the characters, that lure you in with a seemingly ""simple"" art style will present very clearly the horrors of war.  Also the facts the game gives you, the items you find will round off how life was in that horrible period of history. The puzzles are also fun and interesting, and won't bog you down and slow the progress of the story. In short, buy this. You will not regret it.			"

												An excellent little game. Story is beautifully written and the characters, though little dialogue except in letters written between them, are interesting and believable. The game is full of little puzzles with some minor platforming elements. I really enjoyed the puzzles since they are challenging but not to the point that they are frustrating. I really appreciate the fact that the puzzles are not trial and error oriented but actually just require some exploration and logic. I'm not sure how long it took me to finish this game but I played it over several nights so I'd guess about 5-6 hours of content which is pretty good since I bought the game for less than $5. The music is incredible and synched with several parts of the game especially when you are driving the Jeep and dodging enemy attacks! Overall, I'd rate the game a solid 5/5 stars. I can't believe it took me so long to finally play this title and I'm happy to say it's one of my favorite games of 2014 although I played it in 2015.			"

												Valiant Hearts is a beautifully made game. With an intricate story and very well done puzzle-based gameplay, you become part of an intriguing and historically accurate account of the First World War. It doesn't avoid the gruesome aspects of war, but does not glorify them either. It paints an accurate and eye-opening picture of the hell that both civilians and soldiers endured for years, and in the end you are left just as confused about the purpose of the war as the characters are themselves.The actual gameplay ranges from exciting to a little confusing at times, but hints are available for the players that are scrubs (me included). The art style is simple, yet amazing where it needs to be. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nifty puzzle game, a well written story, or is interested in history.			"

												This game deserves to be played, as no other has moved me the way this one did.  It's a simple sidescrolling puzzler with moments of platformer challenges, which by itself might not be a great selling point, but the way it immerses you into the story it's telling is unmatched.  From the detailed background/backdrop pieces that many could overlook, to the running between cover to dodge artillery and machine gun hellfire.  What would normally be just a part of another game is now riveting and intense because you feel for these characters, even the untold number you see around you living out their own hell in the war.  What many FPS war games tried to accomplish, this game here perfected in an unexpected way.  I knew it would be a moving story and historical piece, but looking beyond that, if all the characters were aliens and this was a game set on some planet light years away, I would still be as moved by this game due to the immersiveness that is packed into every detail. Bravo to everyone that worked on this game, truly a masterpiece.			"

												Paulliee TV ReviewValiant Hearts is set in WW1 and without spoilers all i can say it is touching adventure that brings to life what war can be like, The game it's self has one of the best OST around and also put together with beautiful artwork which draws your attention, But what really brings you into the game is the touching warm and welcoming story of four characters that you play as and there trials and struggles in WW1It is a puzzle based game but the puzzles are really easy it is the story that makes this a must play game for me + Superb OST+ good graphics+ Captive story+ Easy but fun puzzles

I espeically enjoyed how some scenes had music alligned with the actions the player takes. This game had a fantastic emotional story and I felt that I really did care about the characters. It is also a great historical learning toll as it has alot of background information about World War One. The game is only 6 hours long and has virtually no replay value. I overall reccomend this game.			"

												When i first bought it i was hesitant to play it cause of the backround of its story (1st WW) but something in the aesthetics of its graphics made me try it out. And im glad i did.The game is a diamond hidden between AAA titles that steal our attention from it with their technical superiority and gameplay mechanics. What i really hope is that other developers take some time to check out this little perfection to understand that a beautiful game does not need extreme graphics and complex mechanics to be good.The story is a journey of a group of characters through the 1st World War. Their intertwined stories create a beautiful plot accompanied with very well made narration and surprisingly good comic strips.Needless to say that by the end of the game i was crying like a baby completely devastated by the logical turn of events. Everyone should take some of their time to play it casually or in one night just to experience this sensation of a game that makes you live its events through the eyes of very likeable characters.10/10 either its on sale or not.

I learnt a lot about World War 1 during the game, that I didn't need to pretend I'm a history buff now that Battlefield 1 is out soon, and scour Wiki and act like a 'I know aaaall there is about the weapons'.So, what did I think overall?Well, I love the fact that its a cartoony game, but the characters are very well done, and you actually get immersed in the storyline.The music at the very beginning before you play the game is very nice, and there are all sorts of tracks throughout the game.I also liked the fact that you wern't just playing as character A, then B and so on, but switching around now and then, and in some cases, meeting together.The collectables are good, but for once its not just 'you found a bit of soap' but a little bit of history about it. Plus, apart from the story of the game, there are actual photo's and descriptions that appear that make you realise how crappy the war really was.Some bits that I found infuriating though: being the nurse and using the heart monitor to do first aid. I nearly lost the will towards certain parts. And the digging is a strange one, but once you figure it out its ok.But, if you like 'adventure-type' puzzle games with a great storyline, I recommend this wholeheartedly.Get it, you won't be disappointed.Also, a short game review here, about 6 mins long :)

												This is a fairly simplistic puzzle game steeped in the hitory of WW1 and its effect on people. I enjoyed the story and most of the puzzles were enjoyable. There were times during trench runs, especially th last one, that really annoyed me. Death of often quick and unexpected and sometimes you can only learn you made a mistake after you are dead. While I expect that was deliberate to give a taste of war, for a game it was frustrating and detracted from the excellent story telling.You won't spend a lot of time on this, I finished it across 7 hours.  All being said, this was worth the money I paid.			"

												What a beautiful game. A truly heart-wrenching story and a perfect sense of atmosphere from a relatively simply-designed game. My only wish is that Ubisoft had made more out of the puzzles. The puzzles are all terribly easy and sometimes just a nuisance getting in the way of the story. I would usually be inclined to not recommend a game for such a shortcoming, but the story of Valiant Hearts is honestly so moving and thrilling that I cannot help but praise it. More than worth the money.			"

												Let me start by saying that even Uplay can't ruin this game.As for a more detailed review:At its core this it is a puzzle-adventure game, however Valiant Hearts is so much more than a game. It is atmospheric story wrapped in real history, love, pain, sorrow, friendship and death.Valiant Hearts has its own style and delivery that will make you connect with main characters and it will unearth your emotions, don't resist it, enjoy it, even though the ending can make you cry. I would advise to buy this game and put everything else aside because the experience and the food for thought that it gives are worth it.P.S.Join my group at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ for more reviews.

												I just finished the game and i gotta admit that the estetic and the story really sits well with me. the artstyle and way the story is unfolded assists in showing the brutality of the war without jading you by showering you in gory effects. This benefits the game greatly in my opinion as you bond with the characters you play and their story unfolds.the gameplay is rather easy with puzzles and some minigames here and there but the meat of the game comes in the narrative when you find hidden collectibles which give you trivia about the various things from the war. I truly enjoyed the game and would say that it is worth the 15€ pricetag but if you find 6 hours of rather easy gameplay to be a bit pricey then wait for a pricedrop and i am sure you wont be dissapointed.

												This game deserves to be played, as no other has moved me the way this one did.  It's a simple sidescrolling puzzler with moments of platformer challenges, which by itself might not be a great selling point, but the way it immerses you into the story it's telling is unmatched.  From the detailed background/backdrop pieces that many could overlook, to the running between cover to dodge artillery and machine gun hellfire.  What would normally be just a part of another game is now riveting and intense because you feel for these characters, even the untold number you see around you living out their own hell in the war.  What many FPS war games tried to accomplish, this game here perfected in an unexpected way.  I knew it would be a moving story and historical piece, but looking beyond that, if all the characters were aliens and this was a game set on some planet light years away, I would still be as moved by this game due to the immersiveness that is packed into every detail. Bravo to everyone that worked on this game, truly a masterpiece.			"

												Let me be clear. I would recommend this game, but sadly.. only just. I have to agree with a lot of negative points raised by other reviews as well. The feel and the music is awesome, but the puzzles and generally the ""logic"" of the game are really ruining the experience for me.. I don't want to be nit-picking as I am not a huge fan of this genre, but... Why on earth would you have supposedly quirky and funny puzzles (that are not really hard even in veteran mode) and real out-of-place ""paraller universe"" inventions (armored car chase anyone?) and factology, when you (quite rightly so) boast about all the cooperation with historians and archives. Also, the story line is interesting but the amount of clichés and overall predictiveness kind of let it down. For example, since the devs already spoiled ""some will not"" in trailer, you can guess who that will be pretty early in the game..These are only my personal let-downs, since I was really looking forward to play this game and it just didn't live up to all the hype and expectation.BUT:The story can be moving,You can learn some new and interesting facts about WW1 even if you are already interested in the topic. It generally raises the awareness about the horrors of the Great war, which is good and long overdue.It is pretty streamlined and already mentioned fell and music of the game are big plus points.Uplay for once worked okay (still annoying though)So just play it and see for yourself.. :)			"

												Rather excellent sidescrolling adventure set in World War I. It's refreshing to see a non-strategy game sticking to the actual facts, locations and events of the Great War instead of attempting to rewrite history. Despite the gorgeous cartoonish style of the game, it handles its heavy subject matter with the weight that it deserves.Gameplay of Valiant Hearts consists mostly of solving various environmental puzzles. There's really no platforming (you cannot jump) or even much killing involved, just exploring and picking up items. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, but allow for surprisingly complex interactions.As the story switches between the four main characters, players get to witness the whole scope of the war from several interesting viewpoints, and there's enough variation for the experience not to start feeling repetitive. While there is no dialogue and the characters speak in gibberish, the point always gets across loud and clear and there's even some genuine drama involved.Ubisoft has been recently showing really good initiative with its small, indie-like releases that dare to take more risks than the bog-standard AAA blockbusters and Valiant Hearts: The Great War is up there with the best games of 2014 so far. Definitely worth a look.			"

												I'd like to give this a sterling review as the premise is great, but as I'm presently stuck on a pretty egregous section where in what was obstensively a puzzle game suddenly transformed into a rhythm game where in one mistake sets you back to the beginning stage of a three tier I'm less inclined to heap praise on it.The narrative albeit a contrivance is well done and it does a good job of conveying the horrors of WWI as well as dropping lots of interesting historical titbits, but it's let down by some dismal game-play sections where in success is achieved solely through climbing over the corpses of past failures.

												I have so much to say about this game, but I'll keep it short. Valiant Hearts is, by far, my most favorite game I have ever played. It has a plot/story that definitely tugs at your heart strings, the animation is wonderous, the characters are so unique! I honestly love Valiant Hearts because I've always adored European history. Even if you don't like history, I'm sure you'll still love this game as much as I do! The only downside is you have to make an account to uPlay, which, in my opinion, is a waste of time. Luckily you don't have to sign in every time, but other than that, this game makes me smile, and I recommend it to everybody. I give this game a 10/10.			"

												In other story based video games like titles such as The Walking Dead or Heavy Rain that had a touching story with a depressing ending, I personally think this game topped that list.The story:For a story, Ubisoft did a FANTASTIC job of making one. It took me around 6-7 hours to finish the story itself and every second was worth listening and paying attention to the story. The idea of it taking place in WW1 was a brilliant idea as I feel no other time period could have nailed the ride feeling. Of course anyone who has played and beat this game would tell you that the ending was devastatingly saddening as it was also a great way to conclude the adventure. I give the story a 10/10 as it will always remain as a favorite game.Gameplay: Just to get this out of the way, my opinion may be a little one sided due to the fact that I have a huge heart for puzzle games. The idea of the story being played out through puzzles that were also intense at times really made me feel likeI needed to keep going and wanted to play more. I mean even the idea of getting hints from the messenger pigeon made me giggle a little and I loved that idea. However I feel as if I had to ask my self many times ""What is going on"". Like however a minecart managed to land on the tip of a tree branch made me kinda question the game. The idea of actualy war facts and info being included in the game made me really interested as I read all if not most of the info on the collectables that you may find during the game. I give the gameplay a 8.5/10 due to the fact that a lot of the time, whatever was happening should not have happened and did not make sense.I recommend this game more for people who have patience and a high tolerance for solving puzzles. Also for those who care for a story more than any other aspect of a game.also... give the old man some damn cloths...			"

												""War makes men mad""Valiant Hearts is a puzzle adventure set in WWI,telling the story of four characters and how their lives were forever changed.Pros:-amazing,touching story that keeps you gripped from start to finish-every character is well done,with an interesting story and credible motivations-top quality soundtrack-nice art style-lots of historical WWI details in the ingame encyclopedia and the collectibles-hint system if you get stuckCons:-some sections can be annoying/slightly frustrating-a couple small graphical glitches-added DRM with UplayOverall,I fully recommend this game,while the gameplay might not be extremely original or challenging Valiant Hearts is mostly interested in telling you a story,and the story is touching and wonderful.

												Valiant Hearts is a fantastic history lesson on WWI.  As a game, it provides some fair puzzles for solving along with a few action segments, but the draw here is placing yourselves in the shoes of several characters in the war.  Along the way you find memorabilia from the time and have the option to read brief articles detailing events of the war.			"

The story flaunders slightly in the first thrid when it focuses on side characters, since it's when they story is around Emile it really shines but the story picks up really strongly on chapter 2 and leaves a lasting impression when you are done with it.

												Rather excellent sidescrolling adventure set in World War I. It's refreshing to see a non-strategy game sticking to the actual facts, locations and events of the Great War instead of attempting to rewrite history. Despite the gorgeous cartoonish style of the game, it handles its heavy subject matter with the weight that it deserves.Gameplay of Valiant Hearts consists mostly of solving various environmental puzzles. There's really no platforming (you cannot jump) or even much killing involved, just exploring and picking up items. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, but allow for surprisingly complex interactions.As the story switches between the four main characters, players get to witness the whole scope of the war from several interesting viewpoints, and there's enough variation for the experience not to start feeling repetitive. While there is no dialogue and the characters speak in gibberish, the point always gets across loud and clear and there's even some genuine drama involved.Ubisoft has been recently showing really good initiative with its small, indie-like releases that dare to take more risks than the bog-standard AAA blockbusters and Valiant Hearts: The Great War is up there with the best games of 2014 so far. Definitely worth a look.			"

												This is basically a jump-and-run game set in WWI. Technically, you play four different heroes and solve puzzles while the story pushes you from one setting to the next. The story is linear, without deviations, and divided into four chapters.Within this technical setting of the game, it achieves quite a lot. The game focuses on some part of the Western front only from Ypres to Verdun. It tells the story of an American soldier, a French farmer, a German father and a Belgian nurse in the timespan from 1914 to 1917. It is all cartoon-style and this is reflected in the way the story is told. Many aspects are not realistic and widely exaggerated, but this is due to the cartoon-style, you shouldn't measure everything by real history. Just picking one example, take the taxi rides to ""Flight of the bumblebee"" while you throw explosives and try to evade bombs fired to the rhythm of the music. This is just a fun-mini-game and made me laugh (there's more of that in the game).The game is not difficult. You can try every challange over and over again without any negative effects. You will ""die"" quite a lot of times before you pick up every riddle, but that doesn't matter. The riddles themselves may sometimes be a bit too difficult, meaning that after two minutes of running around you just don't know how to solve it. But there are hints to every puzzle that will lead you to the right path. I used them a couple of times in order not to interrupt the game flow.As I said, the story is not quite realistic, but immersion into the game is definitely there. As you charge the enemy front line evading bombs, aircraft and enemy fire you really feel some of the danger these men must have felt. It actually helps here that it is a cartoon, since most of the action then happens in your head. When you go and have to save your friends, it got really exciting for me. The evil guy Baron von Dorf tries to ram down a steel door with his flamethrower tank and kill Freddie, the American soldier, while you as Emile try to stop from doing that by throwing a TNT bar into his face. If you're not fast enough, he'll get your friends and you lose. There are some situations like this, and although most of the times you don't actually have to run and be as fast as possible, it helps the immersion.The game develops as did the war. The first missions are still quite nice and fancy, but as the game progresses, the missions become more violent and bloody.The game gets a more serious touch by many small items that are spread over the game. You need to go some extra paths to get them, and the game rewards you with some honor medals when you manage to find all of them in one ""level"". They're items used in the war, from helmets to identification marks or biscuit cans. They come with a small description of their use and function, historically. Whenever some new episode begins like the gas war in Ypres, a small icon tells you that new historical information is available. You don't need to read this, but it helps to understand a lot of what was the historical background of that particular mission.Pros:- I really liked the historical immersion. The cartoon style fits quite nicely and the historical information is accurate and well written.- For a telltale game, 10 hours are quite a good playing time.- Some missions are really fun. I liked the taxi rides and the tank battle best- Walt, the dog- It is an exciting game. I wanted to play to see how it ends.Contra:- This Baron von Dorf is really quite silly. It helps the story line that there is some evil guy, though. Still, the bad guys are always the Germans- The puzzles may get a bit repetitive in the end.The game covers none of the other theatres of war, so nothing from the Eastern front or anything else that happened. I guess we need some more games covering those aspects.I recommend it to anyone interested in the period and looking for a light game and an entertaining story. I would buy it again.			"

												As a war-game fanatic and the typical war-movie-junkie, I'll write this review coming from that perspective, so bear that in mind when reading the belowmentioned review. Where to start? From the sudden E3 presentation and being released quickly thereafter, Ubisoft sure didn't have their usual delays as they unfortunately have done with Assassin's Creed series, Far Cry etc. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant surprise, not to mention a cheap on as well! The game starts right off with a well-crafted presentation of the charachters shown in the trailer (without giving away too much spoilers) and gives us the player a chance to adjust to their respective charachter development. This results in more or less a emotional roller-coaster, something that is really on of the phenomenal points about this game. It never fails to balance out the time playing as each charachter, never sacrificing anothers charachters story for another, something that is frankly rare to see in Ubisoft games (with exceptions like AC2, AC4 etc.) and games overall. Though this also goes hand-in-hand with HOW the game is presented. One of the reasons for example AC3 was considered a big failure was how it was presented: a well-crafted mess where it seemed like even the developers at Montreal didn't know HOW to present the story, what they wanted the players to experience etc. This is NOT the case with Valiant Hearts. Instead we are given a charming graphic engine (identical to the one in the higly praised Rayman games), a set of brave charachters, each with their own deep personalities and backgrounds, all intertwined masterfully without any form of sacrifice at the expense story-telling. Simply put, there is no confusion, no confusing story-gaps. Just one fluid experience. The only ""downside"" I can possibly think of after playing the game, is the somtimes complicated puzzles that that might be somewhat annoying to figure out, though even then you have your trustworthy war-pidgeon for help. Another one is the classic Uplay-annoyance we're all so familiar with. Fortunetely I didn't bump into any problems like the AC and Splinter Cell games. All in all, this game, given its low price is a MUST buy for any war-gamer out there. It might not be the next Call of Duty or MoH: Allied Assault that we all used to play. But it shows an entirely new theather of war: The First world war. Which honestly hasn't been really explained or shown in video-game form. As a history-nerd and an avid war-gamer, this is a great opportunity to throw yourself in the mustard-gas infested foxholes and trenches at the humble price of two Burger King menus in your local downtown. I'll give this game 5 delicious Sauerkrauten out of 5 possible!			"

												I highly recommend this game to anyone this game was just amazing! It of course is a puzzle game but the puzzles never really got very complicated but still feel rewarding when you complete them, but the main reason you should buy this game is for the story, it's based off stories from World War 1 and tells a story of love, loss, vengence, and companionship with 5 main characters (my favorite being the dog Walt) all just trying to survive the horrors of war and maintain their humanity. The story was absolutley amazing and I thought the art style was great. This isn't a game where you kill every enemy you see and feel like the ultimate badass you actually rarely ever have to harm the enemies. The characters become personal to you and you really want the best for them. The game teaches you that war is hell and that we should never forget the ones that have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The game's story is about 6 hours to beat so if you are looking for a great game with great characters, fun and rewarding puzzels and gameplay, great soundtrack, a nice art style, and a fantastic story with tear-jerking moments then I highly recommend Valient Hearts: The Great War. 9/10			"

												This game was interesting. While overall I thought the games storyline and art style were fantasic, I also was a bit surprised by the gameplay.  I had been expecting a more traditional war game experience and was shocked to find myself solving puzzles throughout the majority of the game and literaly not firing a single bullet or ever even using a gun at all throughout an entire game about WW1! The story itself was good though it had distinctive ""PG"" vibe to it that felt a bit out of place in all honesty there were many times where it felt like were aimed at a child audience. Not that there's anything wrong with that but it does seem a bit out of place in a game about one of the most violent conflicts in the history of the human race. The gameplay is also clearly meant for an older crowd (I would never have been able to solve most of the some of the more complicated puzzles when I was a kid!) The art style is the real star of the show here though something about the art, music and narration just go together so beautifuly and created a truly unique atmostphere.All that aside though if you want a rather light hearted puzzles solving game that will teach you plenty of less gritty historical facts about WW1 as well as having one of the best looking art styles in a game that I have seen in quite awhile. Then this game is for you. I just want people to know what they are buying before they buy it and find out it is completely different  from what they were expecting like I did. Nothing wrong with that as it is good at what it was trying to convey though i still think this game could have benefitted from an even slightly more of a mature tone to match the horror of the setting.

												The cartoon style art is beautiful, the atmosphere is great and the music is amazing. The story is a touching one, and it is very well done with the small exception of a cheesy villain. He is a small part of it though, so that minor flaw is easily overlooked. It is mostly told in a silent manner like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons with the exception of a narrator in between sub-chapters.  The gameplay so far is mostly fairly simple puzzels, a bit of basic combat and old school dodge the objects mechanics timed on the beautiful background music. At first I was sceptical about the gamplay and I thought it would put me off, but luckly this is not the case. It doesn't have groundbraking mechanics though, so don't expect too much from that.I already know this isn't a game for the average gamer or for the masses, but for the gamer that wants a story experience in a World War 1 setting with amazing art and music.Are you looking for a platform and/or action game? Look elsewhere, this is not it.You want an adventure game with a story between a father and a daughter and two lovers torn apart by a horrible war? This is for you.			"

												I played through the gameplay, but I was with the story. I liked these toons, though; I seem to respect them. I felt the atmosphere and details built up my sympathy well and the combination of the dog, the dramatic narration, the sometimes slightly over the top characters sometimes, the dog, and the realistic historical pathos blended fine, and the dog. I consistently enjoyed my little joke that the war was won by the solitary human who understood wirecutters. It went down smooth.Also, my girlfriend at the time liked it (see ""the dog""). She doesn't get through very many games, but at least last I knew this is her favorite.What I liked best overall was that in the end I *felt* I knew just what to do immediately and I did it. Intellectually, I was a little bit impressed that I did feel I had reacted as I would and not satisfying a mechanical prompt like when I recognized a lever to pull. I watched the ending and I felt like Emile felt like I felt. I appreciated the War and game endings in a different way. I had completed the journey rather than just played one.			"

												Valiant Hearts is the most touching game i have ever played. The narration is amazing along with the music. The characters  have so much emotion that it makes you feel like you where in that place. The game itself is teaches you about the Great War and gives you tons of info on it. While playing you can find ""things"" which you then can learn a little about. But to sum it up, this game will change you. You will never look at life again after playing this game. So please get over the Uplay stuff. Just buy the game. The game will stick with you for the rest of your life.			"

												It's been a really long time since I last played a game as wonderful as Valiant Hearts. Very few games these days grab a hold of your emotions and pull you in but this game does so and right from the start. I'm writing this at roughly two hours into the game (at the start of Chapter 2 in fact) and I have to say I'm impressed with what this game is already offering. The characters, stoic and of very few words they may be, are lovable and draw you straight into whats going on from the farmer turned reluctant soldier to the veternarian turned field medic. Honestly I could go on forever talking about what I've already experienced in this fantastic game so I won't bore you. All I'll say is buy it if you have any interest in it. It's definitely worth the $15 you'll spend.Like most other reviews I'll warn you this required Uplay to play so make sure you have it downloaded onto your computer (though I'm sure it'll force itself on you anyways).Edit: It's been awhile since I finally finished the game (well over 2 years I believe) but I felt I needed to update this review (after having played through it again on my PS4). Having gotten to the end of this wonderful game and having experienced the heartfelt emotions this game throws at you (those who have beaten it will know what I'm talking about, this is one of those few games where I have actually cried at the end) I can't recommend this game enough. This is a must play for anyone who says they love character driven games and for those wishing to play an extremely heartfelt narrative.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. The story is amazing, the puzzles are short and sweet with simple gameplay, and I got attached to all of the characters. I wish I could forget about this game and play it again. There is nothing more to be said. Sit back and enjoy the game.No jump scares, but really who expected there to be any.			"

												As a war-game fanatic and the typical war-movie-junkie, I'll write this review coming from that perspective, so bear that in mind when reading the belowmentioned review. Where to start? From the sudden E3 presentation and being released quickly thereafter, Ubisoft sure didn't have their usual delays as they unfortunately have done with Assassin's Creed series, Far Cry etc. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant surprise, not to mention a cheap on as well! The game starts right off with a well-crafted presentation of the charachters shown in the trailer (without giving away too much spoilers) and gives us the player a chance to adjust to their respective charachter development. This results in more or less a emotional roller-coaster, something that is really on of the phenomenal points about this game. It never fails to balance out the time playing as each charachter, never sacrificing anothers charachters story for another, something that is frankly rare to see in Ubisoft games (with exceptions like AC2, AC4 etc.) and games overall. Though this also goes hand-in-hand with HOW the game is presented. One of the reasons for example AC3 was considered a big failure was how it was presented: a well-crafted mess where it seemed like even the developers at Montreal didn't know HOW to present the story, what they wanted the players to experience etc. This is NOT the case with Valiant Hearts. Instead we are given a charming graphic engine (identical to the one in the higly praised Rayman games), a set of brave charachters, each with their own deep personalities and backgrounds, all intertwined masterfully without any form of sacrifice at the expense story-telling. Simply put, there is no confusion, no confusing story-gaps. Just one fluid experience. The only ""downside"" I can possibly think of after playing the game, is the somtimes complicated puzzles that that might be somewhat annoying to figure out, though even then you have your trustworthy war-pidgeon for help. Another one is the classic Uplay-annoyance we're all so familiar with. Fortunetely I didn't bump into any problems like the AC and Splinter Cell games. All in all, this game, given its low price is a MUST buy for any war-gamer out there. It might not be the next Call of Duty or MoH: Allied Assault that we all used to play. But it shows an entirely new theather of war: The First world war. Which honestly hasn't been really explained or shown in video-game form. As a history-nerd and an avid war-gamer, this is a great opportunity to throw yourself in the mustard-gas infested foxholes and trenches at the humble price of two Burger King menus in your local downtown. I'll give this game 5 delicious Sauerkrauten out of 5 possible!			"

												This game is not like any ordinary game. This game is not anything, like you have ever seen before. Is a game that takes you to a journey of how horror war can be; how much impact each soldier can affect his or her life in an instant. Of how a person feels for the first time ever of what it is to be afraid-this-is hell.HISTORY AND PLOTThe game was developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, inspired by letters from the Great War. This is a puzzle-adventure game where you played as four fictional characters. The very main character in the middle is Emile, a French farmer who lives in Saulcy-sur-Meurthe from when the war starts he was forced into becoming a French soldier and have to leave his daughter and grandson behind. On the left is Karl, a German farmhand who married Emile’s daughter and have a son, he was also forced to serve in the war but have to move to Germany to become a German soldier. In the far left is Anna an independent woman who is searching for her father and doing service with the French military as a medic. On your right is Freddie, an American soldier who volunteers in the French military for a vengeful purpose. There was going to be a fifth character to played as George (far right) the British pilot but it was cut off due to the character’s “personality” as humor and the company didn’t want it on a beautifully-sad atmospheric game. So you can only see him in one level of the game. Now I don’t understand why they could have just changed some of the writing to make the character a bit serious, but that is Ubisoft’s problem.  I’m so glad that they set on the First World War and not the usual big 2. I keep seeing the second war topic over and over in games, documents, and museums and I’m tired of it. Now it doesn’t mean I hate hearing more World War 2, I always like learning new information and secrets to the Nazis. Is just that is weird that they don’t put as much of an impact to the Great War as the other. Sure the second war is much worse on the death toll and made a lot of psychological impact on many people that made hard decisions to the world leaders. But you have to remember how it all started the second war and how technology has change drastically in the first war. How did people react to the Great War? How did soldiers react to the first gas attack in the battle of Ypres. How did the politicians handle the situation? All these are as much important to learn as it is WW2. Maybe because the first war doesn’t have a lot of information due to lack of recording systems at the time, but it’s still can make a great story to it. Yes, you can find documents and videos about WW1 in YouTube or in Google but sometimes for me I can’t understand in some areas of that topic or any fun little facts about them (although sometimes I’m a bit lazy at researching it.) REACTION AND GAMEPLAYSince this is a puzzle-adventure game you will be solving some puzzles and I’m glad is not another shooting genre, please no more Call of Duty! Sometimes you will fight some enemies by sneaking at their backside and whack them; you will be accompanying your dog Walt to help you reach hard places and help you on certain puzzles. If it’s too easy for you because of the hint system or highlighted areas just turn them off by turning on Veteran mode.The story is one of the most beautifully written I have ever played. It focuses a lot on the characters and the situation around the soldiers in the war. Not a single side character is unimportant or poorly use in the game, same goes to the background characters. Each one reacts as a real person would feel; hungry, sad, pain, homesick, and hopeless. Then when you saw a soldier get shot you feel a little pain for the person to die and have to move on because it is your duty as a soldier to move forth into battle. Even the Germans feels exactly like their enemies are suffering. Is not like in any FPS (First person shooters) that you just shoot some enemies you don’t know of and move on or your comrades that you barely even knew dies and just keep going from point A to B. Hell sometimes you don’t even know who you’re playing as because you’re in first person view! The background is gorgeous with detail of what’s going on in the battlefield. One minute the land is peaceful the next is smoke clouds, rubble buildings and muddy grounds. In some levels you see on the background corpses everywhere and soldiers screaming in agony! Ubisoft aren’t afraid to show it and they nailed it! The music is also really nice with classical pieces from famous songs, sets the atmosphere flowing.There are collectables to find such as historical items that tells you fun facts about the war. In each level it tells you in the history facts menu about the war with pictures and documents, all thanks to Apocalypse World War 1 and 14 missions 18 Centenaire, who partnered up with Ubisoft. This is the only game in a long while since I completed a game with 100% all collectables; it was so much fun and interesting to learn new things! I’m not much of a completionist and getting all the historical items only gets you an achievement, but if you like fun facts like me collect them all!CONCLUSSIONYou probably can finish in nine hours and maybe an additional hour or two to collect all the historical items, so that’s eleven hours in total, that is an average good play through. The puzzles are decent, not too challenging but it is a perfect balance. This game gets a 10/10 a masterpiece collection and another perfect example of how games can teach us something and not always violence and corrupt us. If you can handle the issues it has that’s good, but it is so worth the effort to play, you won’t regretted. I “think” it has less restriction now so I’m glad is less of a hassle. Is also rated T for teen but I think preteens can experience and enjoy the beauty and horror of the Great War. Hope they keep making games like this; it is a breath of fresh air and I hope they make another game like it but in a different war setting.			"

												In Valiant Hearts you play as four members of the Great War, namely war doctor Anna who is apparently the only person in the world with a driver's license, captured German POW Karl, Shovel Knight's great great great great grandson Emile and Professional Angry Black Man Freddie.I guess there's also a dog too but he's more there to be awed at by his invulnerability towards mustard gas and artillery shells than anything else.The story is nice and about as long as this sort of game should be, even if it does hold a couple ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways to make you feel bad before they tug it away a few minutes later saying ""haha I bet you thought he was really dead!""Overall I'd recommend getting it even before a price drop.No but seriously Freddie is rad and ripped as hell look at this man http://i.imgur.com/OLUFgzW.png http://i.imgur.com/KX3jRSj.png http://i.imgur.com/FUlgJhr.png http://i.imgur.com/0fL07cc.pngUbisoft please create a Lucky Freddie Appreciation Station because he's the best.

												This is basically a jump-and-run game set in WWI. Technically, you play four different heroes and solve puzzles while the story pushes you from one setting to the next. The story is linear, without deviations, and divided into four chapters.Within this technical setting of the game, it achieves quite a lot. The game focuses on some part of the Western front only from Ypres to Verdun. It tells the story of an American soldier, a French farmer, a German father and a Belgian nurse in the timespan from 1914 to 1917. It is all cartoon-style and this is reflected in the way the story is told. Many aspects are not realistic and widely exaggerated, but this is due to the cartoon-style, you shouldn't measure everything by real history. Just picking one example, take the taxi rides to ""Flight of the bumblebee"" while you throw explosives and try to evade bombs fired to the rhythm of the music. This is just a fun-mini-game and made me laugh (there's more of that in the game).The game is not difficult. You can try every challange over and over again without any negative effects. You will ""die"" quite a lot of times before you pick up every riddle, but that doesn't matter. The riddles themselves may sometimes be a bit too difficult, meaning that after two minutes of running around you just don't know how to solve it. But there are hints to every puzzle that will lead you to the right path. I used them a couple of times in order not to interrupt the game flow.As I said, the story is not quite realistic, but immersion into the game is definitely there. As you charge the enemy front line evading bombs, aircraft and enemy fire you really feel some of the danger these men must have felt. It actually helps here that it is a cartoon, since most of the action then happens in your head. When you go and have to save your friends, it got really exciting for me. The evil guy Baron von Dorf tries to ram down a steel door with his flamethrower tank and kill Freddie, the American soldier, while you as Emile try to stop from doing that by throwing a TNT bar into his face. If you're not fast enough, he'll get your friends and you lose. There are some situations like this, and although most of the times you don't actually have to run and be as fast as possible, it helps the immersion.The game develops as did the war. The first missions are still quite nice and fancy, but as the game progresses, the missions become more violent and bloody.The game gets a more serious touch by many small items that are spread over the game. You need to go some extra paths to get them, and the game rewards you with some honor medals when you manage to find all of them in one ""level"". They're items used in the war, from helmets to identification marks or biscuit cans. They come with a small description of their use and function, historically. Whenever some new episode begins like the gas war in Ypres, a small icon tells you that new historical information is available. You don't need to read this, but it helps to understand a lot of what was the historical background of that particular mission.Pros:- I really liked the historical immersion. The cartoon style fits quite nicely and the historical information is accurate and well written.- For a telltale game, 10 hours are quite a good playing time.- Some missions are really fun. I liked the taxi rides and the tank battle best- Walt, the dog- It is an exciting game. I wanted to play to see how it ends.Contra:- This Baron von Dorf is really quite silly. It helps the story line that there is some evil guy, though. Still, the bad guys are always the Germans- The puzzles may get a bit repetitive in the end.The game covers none of the other theatres of war, so nothing from the Eastern front or anything else that happened. I guess we need some more games covering those aspects.I recommend it to anyone interested in the period and looking for a light game and an entertaining story. I would buy it again.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game.I've yet to finish it but what I've played so far was very touching and story rich that accuratly captures the harsh reality of Warfare during World War I. The game covers the stories of 4 (from what I've seen, there may be more playable!) characters and a Dog companion across the entire duration of the War itself. Each character has their own identity and jobs that effectively show off the war from their own different perspectives. One minute you'll be charging into battle as Freddie and then tending to the wounded as Ana. It's also worth mentioning the game has a rather large educational part to it as well, as there are items scattered about that you can pick up such as letters and objects commonly used during the war that give you a history lesson about what they were used for.The artstyle is very pleasant and pleasing to look at, it's friendly enough to be attractive to every audience and depressing enough to please those looking for an sad emotional trip.All in all, buy the thing. It's worth it.			"

												The cartoon style art is beautiful, the atmosphere is great and the music is amazing. The story is a touching one, and it is very well done with the small exception of a cheesy villain. He is a small part of it though, so that minor flaw is easily overlooked. It is mostly told in a silent manner like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons with the exception of a narrator in between sub-chapters.  The gameplay so far is mostly fairly simple puzzels, a bit of basic combat and old school dodge the objects mechanics timed on the beautiful background music. At first I was sceptical about the gamplay and I thought it would put me off, but luckly this is not the case. It doesn't have groundbraking mechanics though, so don't expect too much from that.I already know this isn't a game for the average gamer or for the masses, but for the gamer that wants a story experience in a World War 1 setting with amazing art and music.Are you looking for a platform and/or action game? Look elsewhere, this is not it.You want an adventure game with a story between a father and a daughter and two lovers torn apart by a horrible war? This is for you.			"

												I played through the gameplay, but I was with the story. I liked these toons, though; I seem to respect them. I felt the atmosphere and details built up my sympathy well and the combination of the dog, the dramatic narration, the sometimes slightly over the top characters sometimes, the dog, and the realistic historical pathos blended fine, and the dog. I consistently enjoyed my little joke that the war was won by the solitary human who understood wirecutters. It went down smooth.Also, my girlfriend at the time liked it (see ""the dog""). She doesn't get through very many games, but at least last I knew this is her favorite.What I liked best overall was that in the end I *felt* I knew just what to do immediately and I did it. Intellectually, I was a little bit impressed that I did feel I had reacted as I would and not satisfying a mechanical prompt like when I recognized a lever to pull. I watched the ending and I felt like Emile felt like I felt. I appreciated the War and game endings in a different way. I had completed the journey rather than just played one.			"

												7/10 (tl;dr at bottom)Welcome aboard the feels train.Altogether the game took me around 6.5 hours to complete. I took my time, got stuck on more than a few puzzles, and collected about 3/4 of the hidden items. This also takes into account the time taken to read all the Facts and Diaries. If you do go back and collect everything, you are looking at 7 hours - 8 if you're lucky. This might make some of you skeptical, considering the $15 price tag. Fortunately, the quality of the content in that short amount of time makes up for *some* of that.- Pros -1. As you can imagine, the game's strongest selling-point is the story (no spoilers here, don't worry). There are four intertwining arcs going on simultaneously, and they are easy to keep up with while not being too simplistic. It does a great job of focusing on the horrors and historical facts of the war, avoiding taking sides. Everything is shown in an unbiased light, as it should be. There were a few heart-breaking moments that had me and many others teary eyed. At times it could get a little... over-the-top? But it seemed to have a purpose and was necessary to progress the plot.Another thing worth mentioning is the Historical Facts. There is a lot of good information to read about The Great War which can be accessed during the game by pressing Tab. These are entries seperate from the hidden items (which I will talk about later). I learned a thing or two from these, and the pictures from the war make it all very interesting and a nice addition to the game.2. The puzzle gameplay is right at home here. A perfect balance of simplicity and complexity. Sometimes you will find yourself stuck, but in nearly all circumstances you can take your time to try and figure it out. If you need help, the game actually gives you Hints periodically. Most puzzles will require you to work with your side-kick, the medic dog Walt, and the mechanics for this work well. There also wasn't really a time where I felt bored or - even worse - annoyed by them, because they change it up throughout the game. They do seem to get a little more difficult toward the end too.3. I think that the art does the game justice. It isn't distracting, adds to the immersion.4. A very small part of the game is the collectibles, but it definitely is a pro worth considering. This is pretty much all of the game's replay value right here; it is easy to go back into previous Chapters of the story and find all the hidden items. I will not be doing that (Assassin's Creed was enough), but plenty of guides are available on Steam and the internet. The purpose for these is to give little facts about the era or the war specifically, and it's pretty educational. They also aren't very long reads, so it won't take away from immersion.- Cons - 1. For the story being the main-selling point (and the strongest aspect of the game with the puzzles), the characters in my opinion were pretty flat. Part of this could be due to the lack of voice acting, which is a shame, because the voice acting that IS in the game is decent. Also, this weakness can be attributed to the story being told more through moments and actions. This is not to say you won't feel anything for the characters, but I feel this certainly could have been stronger. And the Diaries were a wasted opportunity to fix this. They all write the same, and feel more like a way for the game to help the player keep track of what is going on. In the end, my favorite was the dog. Walt's just such a cute badass mofo.2. I'm tired of games needing several third-party platforms. If you're going to buy this game, just get it on U-Play and avoid the hassle.3. Despite how superb the content is, the game definitely should be at least a few dollars cheaper than it is. I recommend waiting for it to go on sale before buying it. A fine game, but I don't think what it has to offer equates to the current price *unless* you're a hardcore fan of the genre.---tl;dr While the story was a little short and could have been even better with more character development, mixed with the  balanced puzzle gameplay it is the best aspect of the game. Mechanics all work smoothly, no glitches during my playthrough, and the hidden items are fun to find. When the game gives you a moment to take it all in, TAKE IT ALL IN. The art style is charming and fitting for an indie game. It's portrayal of World War 1 is not only accurate on a historical level but also on a deeper level. However, unless you're a fan of these types of games, wait for a sale.I won't forget the story, or the feels it brought me, for a long time to come. And I <3 Walt.			"

												What can I say about Valiant Hearts: The Great War? The storyline is fab, the artwork is beautiful and it reduced me to tears. I love the facts that appear in game which makes the player aware that it is based on real life events. However, some of the puzzles I did struggle with but that's possibly just me being a silly billy. One of the features that I did not like at all was the digging but everything else in the game helps overlook that.Overall a fab game, one I would highly recommend. Just make sure you have your tissues!			"

												Valiant Hearts is  a great game. It's rich in story, historically accurate in its design and just fun to play. The puzzles are endearing and the characters voices can range from cute to hilarious. I love the soundtrack and that's probably the part that sells it the most. WW1 needs more games to show the horror of the ""War to end all wars"" (despite us having a second one) Good job to Ubisoft for that. Their new engine for running such artistic 2D games is something I hope to see developed more and have more games made with it. That being said... that ♥♥♥♥ing Dog.Every human being has one sound that will enrage them or anger them. Mine is the sound of whimpering and barking dogs. The dog in this game will not. shut. the. ♥♥♥♥. up. It's Fable 3 levels of agonizing when it will take any chance it gets to point out puzzle solutions by, you guessed it, barking at me and whimpering. I do not need hints, game. I am a grown man and I can take visual hints without a dog trying to help.			"

The art style and music are gorgeous, and the narration is brilliant. The story is heartwrenching at times, and the whole game is beautiful. If your mind is clouded when it comes to the topic of World War One, this game will get you through some tough trivia games at Larry's on Saturday nights. Spend the fifteen bucks.

												7/10 (tl;dr at bottom)Welcome aboard the feels train.Altogether the game took me around 6.5 hours to complete. I took my time, got stuck on more than a few puzzles, and collected about 3/4 of the hidden items. This also takes into account the time taken to read all the Facts and Diaries. If you do go back and collect everything, you are looking at 7 hours - 8 if you're lucky. This might make some of you skeptical, considering the $15 price tag. Fortunately, the quality of the content in that short amount of time makes up for *some* of that.- Pros -1. As you can imagine, the game's strongest selling-point is the story (no spoilers here, don't worry). There are four intertwining arcs going on simultaneously, and they are easy to keep up with while not being too simplistic. It does a great job of focusing on the horrors and historical facts of the war, avoiding taking sides. Everything is shown in an unbiased light, as it should be. There were a few heart-breaking moments that had me and many others teary eyed. At times it could get a little... over-the-top? But it seemed to have a purpose and was necessary to progress the plot.Another thing worth mentioning is the Historical Facts. There is a lot of good information to read about The Great War which can be accessed during the game by pressing Tab. These are entries seperate from the hidden items (which I will talk about later). I learned a thing or two from these, and the pictures from the war make it all very interesting and a nice addition to the game.2. The puzzle gameplay is right at home here. A perfect balance of simplicity and complexity. Sometimes you will find yourself stuck, but in nearly all circumstances you can take your time to try and figure it out. If you need help, the game actually gives you Hints periodically. Most puzzles will require you to work with your side-kick, the medic dog Walt, and the mechanics for this work well. There also wasn't really a time where I felt bored or - even worse - annoyed by them, because they change it up throughout the game. They do seem to get a little more difficult toward the end too.3. I think that the art does the game justice. It isn't distracting, adds to the immersion.4. A very small part of the game is the collectibles, but it definitely is a pro worth considering. This is pretty much all of the game's replay value right here; it is easy to go back into previous Chapters of the story and find all the hidden items. I will not be doing that (Assassin's Creed was enough), but plenty of guides are available on Steam and the internet. The purpose for these is to give little facts about the era or the war specifically, and it's pretty educational. They also aren't very long reads, so it won't take away from immersion.- Cons - 1. For the story being the main-selling point (and the strongest aspect of the game with the puzzles), the characters in my opinion were pretty flat. Part of this could be due to the lack of voice acting, which is a shame, because the voice acting that IS in the game is decent. Also, this weakness can be attributed to the story being told more through moments and actions. This is not to say you won't feel anything for the characters, but I feel this certainly could have been stronger. And the Diaries were a wasted opportunity to fix this. They all write the same, and feel more like a way for the game to help the player keep track of what is going on. In the end, my favorite was the dog. Walt's just such a cute badass mofo.2. I'm tired of games needing several third-party platforms. If you're going to buy this game, just get it on U-Play and avoid the hassle.3. Despite how superb the content is, the game definitely should be at least a few dollars cheaper than it is. I recommend waiting for it to go on sale before buying it. A fine game, but I don't think what it has to offer equates to the current price *unless* you're a hardcore fan of the genre.---tl;dr While the story was a little short and could have been even better with more character development, mixed with the  balanced puzzle gameplay it is the best aspect of the game. Mechanics all work smoothly, no glitches during my playthrough, and the hidden items are fun to find. When the game gives you a moment to take it all in, TAKE IT ALL IN. The art style is charming and fitting for an indie game. It's portrayal of World War 1 is not only accurate on a historical level but also on a deeper level. However, unless you're a fan of these types of games, wait for a sale.I won't forget the story, or the feels it brought me, for a long time to come. And I <3 Walt.			"

Light puzzle game that doesn't shy away from the nature of war.First of all the game has an awesome art style, and both characters and environments look great. The puzzles are simple and the gameplay itself not very challenging, but a nice touch was the historical information provided for different chapters and items. The story felt rather weak until mid game but got significantly better late game and finished strong. I'm glad it took on the grim nature of war, and as a result some scenes were extremely dark. Enjoyed it.			"

												Valiant hearts is a very interesting and unique game because it depicts the First World War in a handdrawn art style. The game somehow manages to be both very silly and grounded in reality at the same time which is quite an accomplishment. It has characters that you care for and want to see them pull through. This game is a great history lesson for people who don’t know much about the first World War as the game depicts most of the events that happened during the war with the characters themselves experiencing it firsthand. As for the gameplay itself its very simplistic, I wasn’t a fan of the puzzles because they do bring the story to a halt and it forces you to get past a few obstacles before you continue on with the story. It can get frustrating at times when you are looking for a specific Item that you have missed in the area that you need to progress and it kind ruins the whole pacing of the game. It’s not necessarily a very fun game to play because the gameplay is very hit and miss and it’s not compelling in any way because it’s so simple but the story and characters pull you through until the end very easily.8/10 (Great)			"

												The Great War was quite possibly the most tragic and futile war in human history due to antiquated and barbaric imperial mindsets converging with modern warfare which resulted in an incredibly brutal conflict leaving tens of millions people dead or crippled. All sides in the war had very little regard to human lives consistently sending tens of thousands soldiers to their death for literally nothing. British comedy show Blackadder satirically stated that Britain would have been better off if they had just stayed home and shot 50,000 of their own men every day. It’s a grim thought, yet also a tragically fair point.Despite its deceptively cartoonish presentation, Valiant Hearts doesn’t shy away from accurately depicting the extent of tragedy seen in The Great War. Ubisoft Montpellier collaborated with the brilliant Apocalypse documentary series (which I wholeheartedly recommend if you want to learn more about this awful period of our history) in order to depict both the horror and humanity of the conflict. You will see the war from multiple sides including solders and civilians, French and German, but a singular constant remains throughout – seeing the war from the viewpoint of ordinary people.You aren’t playing as a nameless soldier on his bloody path to kill a million Germans, you’re playing as a person who has a family, hopes and dreams and just wants to make it out alive. The four playable characters include Anna; a Belgian nurse, Karl; a German deported from France forcibly leaving his French wife and son and being conscripted in the German army, Emile; Karl’s father-in-law conscripted in the French army, and an American volunteer Freddy. All four characters are brought together at times thanks to Walt; a conscripted German military rescue dog. The game takes place on the Western Front in parts of France and Belgium and involves iconic battles at Ypres, Verdun and the Somme.The gameplay mostly revolves around solving rather simple puzzles involving levers, finding and combining necessary items, but there are also some light action elements such as stealth segments, a few boss fights and even driving segments. Strictly mechanically speaking, the design is a bit repetitive, more effort could have been put into it, the puzzle design in particular. Contextually, however, the game is extremely varied and ranges from charging at the enemy, everyday life in the trenches, healing and even amputating soldiers, breaking out from a POW camp, driving a car and a tank, firing from a cannon and loads of other interesting things that so truthfully depict the war. There are a few segments which involve non-existing armored-type vehicles that act as boss battles, but they’re not overly jarring as they look as if they belong in the overall style and setting.The only truly bad part of the game is its use of Uplay. I’ve had plenty of problems with Ubisoft’s DRM dating back to StarForce and unfortunately, the publisher still hasn’t gotten its act together. Upon starting the game through Steam, nothing happened even though Steam indicated that I was running the game. The game wouldn’t start up, I couldn’t quit the game, I couldn’t exit Steam. I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL, then go to Start Task Manager – Processes in order to end the process (it wasn’t shown under running applications) and only then would Uplay and the game actually start up. I had to do this every time I started the game.Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a respectful tribute to all the peoples caught up in the futile affair, victims of their own rulers and callous, oftentimes quite insane High Command. It is also a truly great game that should be played not only for its engaging and varied design and appealing presentation, but also for its cultural value.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"

												On occasion of the 100th anniversary of World War One's breakout, UbiSoft Montpellier (better known for their less serious Rayman Rabbids titles) released Valiant Hearts for consoles and PC. With this long-awaited title the studio tries to make players aware of the horrible events that went on through these 4 years of carnage. However I consider Valiant Hearts more as a family-friendly sidescroller without too much detail on realism or gore (except for the excellent chapter about the Chemin des Dames Offensive). You rather get a graphic adventure garnished with some simple puzzles and an emotional background story revolving 4 characters that couldn't be much different from each other. The storyline ends in the year 1917 and it suggests that there is an addon or sequel coming, including Freddie's brother. Couldn't they finish the game on time? Nevertheless, I really praise the developer team for shaking up the WWI setting a bit and to make it more interesting for the current generation. There really should be more games set in this fascinating scenario.However, as long time follower of WWI history I got a bit dissapointed by the portrayal of the German view on the war. Although you follow the interesting sidestory of Karl, I still think that the narration of the German story is a tad biased. Throughout the game it seems that the evil Prussians always seemed to be the first to use atrocities. I think the developers, in their thoughts of making a reconciliatory game, should have known better that history isn't always black and white...But what really grinds my gears is that it is required to install UPlay and to create an unnessecary account in order to play Valiant Hearts. I'm already sick and tired of all that DRM stuff.The Good:+ Excellent hand-drawn 2D graphics+ Especially the later parts in the game catch perfectly the atmosphere of brutal trench warfare+ Simple but heartbreaking story+ Bombastic sound and music too+ Different approaches to teach player about history (although not taken too seriously sometimes)The Bad:- Some story twists are a bit silly and can't be taken serious, if you ask me. It's partly not too realistic. Seriously, A7V tanks in 1916? The evil Baron Von Dorf in his Zeppelin?- A bit biased portrayal of the German side of war- The year 1918 is not covered in this game. Maybe an addon or sequel is coming?The Ugly:-- Forced DRM through Ubisoft's UPlay. Simply an impudence.To make it short, I still recommend this game despite its really minor flaws. It's an unbelievably beautiful game and a shining example that video games nowadays don't necessarily need complex 3D engines to make an unforgettable experience. Get it during the sales and you'll be perfectly entertained for about 7 hours.7.5/10 "

												:'(Dearest Marie:As the war ends for me,i have no regrets,I’ve seen too much horrorI hope fate has been more merciful to you.Our time on Earth is brief,and mine has been filled with so much joy,that i can only be thankful forhow much i’ve been blessed,most specially for the wonderyou brought into my life.This letter is my last,I’ve been found guilty by a military courtfor the death of an officer.It was not my intention to kill him.War makes men mad.Though i failed Karl,i know my sacrifice has not been in vain.I fought for my country and my liberty,my honour is assured.Since it is the will of God to separate us on Earth,i hope we’ll meet again in heaven.Keep me in your prayers.Your loving papa,Always.

Valiant Hearts: The Great War™ / Soldats Inconnus : Mémoires de la Grande Guerre™Throw your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooters away cod and cs:go players! I know its hard but just do it for a few hours and start playing this game and sooner or later you will realise, what a MASTERPIECE this game is!First i was really skeptical about the game, because uPlay made it and it is a 2D game. I watched Frankieonpc`s review on it and felt it like i HAVE TO BUY IT. I ended up buying it from a 3rd party and i have to say, these were probably the BEST 8 EUROS I HAVE EVER SPENT ON A VIDEO GAME!I totally agree with IGN that this game is: “A GORGEOUS AND EMOTIONAL JOURNEY”. The STORY, the PUZZLES and the MUSIC make this game to a game, that you will never forget and always remember!This game perfectly reflects the First World War (1914-1918) and the soldiers, that were fighting on the fronts and dying for their countries and families!I really hope this review helped you at decideing about your purchase! If it did, please leave a thumbs up! "

												Valiant Hearts is a powerful story about how four peoples' lives are affected by The Great War. It is so rare to see coverage of the First World War, and it is especially appropriate given that nearly 100 years ago, the war was started.First, some nuts-and-bolts: the game uses Uplay. I am sorry if this is a negative to you, but it is how it works. The game also have full controller support (at least for the XBox360 controller), which doesn't seem to be listed anywhere. The prompts are also in XBox360.The characters are all fairly likeable, omitting some spoilers. Emile, an older gentlemen pressed into service, is most certainly NOT a soldier at the beginning of the game - and it shows. Freddie seems to be the game's action hero, who is getting called into battle and ""saves the day"" for however long the war will let him. Anna is a nurse who seems to be able to solve any problem, no matter the cost. Karl is the unfortunate resident drafted by the German army, interrupting his family life. Finally, there is Walt, who you discover shortly into the game and will help you solve many puzzles - and loves to be petted!Freddie seems to be a little on the weak side out of the cast. His story makes sense, but the game doesn't go into much detail on the reasons he's in the war. A lot of the focus is (rightfully) given on Karl's problem, to make the war seem real. Anna and Emile definitely round out the main cast extremely well, and I definitely appreciated the little animations when Anna does her thing on the battlefield. Walt, the dog, is understandably thin on character. He's mostly there to drive the game along, because many puzzles require his use. He does get a moment or two very late in the game, however.Mechanically, the game is very fluid. I encountered no bugs nor crashes. ""War"" scenes play out similarly to a side-scroller, dodging machine gun fire and bombs/mortars. ""Puzzle"" scenes take place in a limited area, where you have to manipulate the environment using levers, wheels, platforms, or throw items to activate things. The ""war"" scenes definitely fit in with the plot, as the first few I was thinking ""Wow, this is war"" to ""Wow, this is horrible!"" along with the plot. There are a couple of ""Boss"" fights as well, with a villain created for the story. These scenes are timed and play out like a ""puzzle"" scene. Dying at any point in the game, whether on the field, to a boss, or failing a puzzle, just respawns you at the previous checkpoint. It does break immersion somewhat, however it minimizes the frustration, as you don't tend to respawn all that far from whatever killed you. The one thing that kept annoying me was having to hold the button to activate wheels and levers, and sometimes the wheel turning was a little slower than I anticipated.Graphically, the game is fantastic, looking much like a comic strip using UbiArt. You can see other soldiers racing into battle during the ""war"" scenes behind the main line and their untimely fates... Sometimes objects required for puzzles DO get hidden, like background objects, but there is always a way to solve the puzzle by experimenting. The music and the sound were also great, never taking away from the feel of the game.Difficulty-wise, the game isn't too hard. Death is resolved by the nearest checkpoint, and some puzzles do allow some room for error. Each character has different puzzle types, with Emile digging, Anna saving people, and Karl doing some trading. There are also a couple of scenes of your car dodging incoming (and oncoming!) obstacles. Anna's puzzles are mostly rhythm-based, and are pretty forgiving with their button prompts. It is unfortunate that your attention is at the top of the screen, rather than on the actions she's taking. A couple of puzzles were tricky, but like all good adventure games, you tend to go ""Ah, I should have though of that!"". Hints are available, 1 minute at a time, however I only had to use hints two or three times at all.There isn't that much replay, unfortunately. There are 100 collectibles to find throughout the chapters, but each collectible has a bit of a historical remark, such as soldier Dog Tags or Gas Masks. There are also some historical notes on events, such as POW Camps and important battles, along with links to MISSION CENTENAIRE 14-18 and Apocalypse: 10 Lives (both what I assume to be coverage of World War 1). The game does flow with the events of World War 1 for the most part, however it does not show the war's resolution (which is probably outside the scope of the game?). But I definitely got a sense of the impact of the war, even if it is only limited to the France-Germany border.Overall, the game is beautifully done and I WANTED to finish it and resolve the story. My playtime is about 6 hours for a first playthrough, without finding all the collectibles (maybe around 70% found). The message at the end is very powerful and shows, with great respect, the impact of the people of the war. It is a bittersweet game, where you will laugh at the silly stuff but MAYBE cry at the sad things (the ending was what really got me). I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game.			"

												Valiant Hearts is an incredible tale about 5 souls, and how bad WW1 was. You start the game off with Karl a German citizen living in France gets sent back to Germany to fight in the war. His father in law Emile also gets recruited in the french army. You are trained which the the tutorial. Then your sent off to fight but first you encounter Freddie. Freddie is a American who came over to France for revenge. You do your first puzzle and he becomes you friend. Once your in battle as Emile you charge and dodge shells. But you get shot and is taken capture but Karl see's you. Then you play as Freddie who is hunting down the baron that took Emile. This is when you see different game play.Emile can dig but is older and has to give more effort to get over ledgesFreddie can cut barb-wire, and is strong.Anna who you play as later on can heal people in a rhythm game.Walt who is a dog can distract enemy's and get items and can go under gas and smoke since he is smaller.Karl plays a basic person and I wont spoil why. But he gets a gas mask and stealth's.It also's give facts about the war which is a nice history lesson but not needed to enjoy the game.The only down fall is that the puzzles arent that hard until a event happens. But it leads a nice trail of bread crumbs.This game is not about killing. But about the Horrors and Surviving it.Also the this is a sad game people don't come back to life. One last thing the art is perfect for this game.I give this game a 10 out of 10			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War allows you to follow along the side of numerous different characters. The storyline is very well written considering none of the characters through the whole game say a single word. This game relies on its beautiful art style, its carefully chosen soundtrack, and its educational cut scenes to tell its story.The game is inspired by letters that were written during World War I. You will have the opportunity to be 4 different characters as you aid a German through his journey through the war. This story is about friendships, sacrifice, survival and true dedication. The story will tug at your heartstrings at times, since it does often focus on how the war would tear families apart. However you will also be moved by the acts of heroism from complete strangers that become unlikely allies on your journey.This game was developed for all sorts of players. Gameplay can be difficult at times since this game is a puzzle solving game. Not all the puzzles are too difficult, but they do offer somewhat of a challenge. I did find myself asking for help on a few occasions due to the level of detail some of these levels have to them. Aside from the difficulty of a select few levels, you will really come to appreciate the creativeness and beautiful scenery illustrated in the story. As you complete the various levels in the game, you are presented with boxes that contain historical information that is optional for players to read further if the topics are of interest.Overall this is a great game that ties in many different components to attract all sorts of different audiences. The story does not overwhelm you with violence, but a story that allows you to hold onto things such as hope and heroism.  You will have more of a focus on the characters and their experiences rather than the violence associated with the time period, which makes the game suitable for all ages. This game is definitely worth giving it a try. It is most likely not like other games you have experienced before.			"

												Story based puzzle games are my favorite style of game. That's the style this game is going for and I had high hopes for this one. However it hasn't really met my expectations. The setting is fascinating learning more about World War I history and the people involved was the main allure of this game. In fact it started off that way tThe biggest problem I found was that it began to stray too far from it's historical setting that it's advertised. There's a cliche, cartoony villian that takes this game from an interesting and emotional look into the horrors of the firt world war into a boring cliche. The puzzles are very easy so there wasn't even the challenge of a difficult puzzle to keep me going. I believe this would work well as a family game with children, since the violence is never very graphic, and overall is kept fairliy minimal considering the horrors of this war. As the protogonist you don't tend to inflict much violence except for knocking out a soldier every now and then and the occasional howitzer shot.Overall I'd say it's not for me but I could see it being a good family game and an educational tool			"

I thought the setting was really interesting and fresh! The naration was great but maybe i would have better or early'er connected with the characters if they had real VO and not just ""Gibberish voices"".It took me six hours to finish the game.			"

												The game, which is fairly simple, is a 2 dimensional sidescrolling action/puzzle adventure. You interact with the world as four characters whose destiny's cross in an unexpected way.The gameplay itself is simple yet engaging and the puzzle system is easy to figure out. Some people may say it's too easy but this game seems to be more story driven than anything else. If a solution happens to prove too difficult at first just wait for a hint. They pop up every so often. Valiant Hearts has a very intriguing art style. I initially bought this game because the story seemed interesting but the art style in each new scene goes a long way to set the mood for that moment. In a story driven game those choices can make or break a game and in this game it's done very well. The sound track as well sets the mood very well and the musical choices work with the overall theme of the game.Overall, I'd say Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a great game but is not for everyone for the following reasons:1: Slow Pace - Most people these days want fast paced action. Though there are a few scenes where the action picks up, this is not the case for most of the game. The action is rather subdued and is usually polite enough to wait for you to solve the puzzles before it progresses the story.2: The story - The story is a touching historical drama set in a chaotic time in Europe during the Great War. Though it is written well, narrated well and plays out well on the screen I can see how some people may be disappointed with it. In short, if you are reluctant to buy this at full price, wait to buy it until on sale. If you like story driven games and don't mind a slower pace then $15.00 is a decent price.3: Lack of re playability - I enjoyed this game very much. The art, sound track and story kept me playing until the very end but I can't see myself playing this game over and over again and with roughly 7hrs of gameplay, more if you read all the historical facts, it's not a very long game. I may go back to attempt getting 100% completion but after that I may not even look at it until a touch nostalgia strikes.4: Uplay - You need a Uplay account and Uplay software installed on your PC to play this game. Most people don't like this fact but the story alone is worth the minor hassle and lets face it there are some good games from Ubisoft so you should already have an account by now anyway.5: Linear - The game's story is viewed from four different perspectives but follows a very linear path. There are no choices to make and all the action is predetermined. These day's most people like a little more variety in their Video Game choices. This is NOT a good choice for these types of people.For me this game was worth the purchase. If this game was a movie I'd tell people it was a must see. The scenes are well designed, the soundtrack is well placed and the top notch narration helps keep the story flowing. This game is an artistic masterpiece and for me is the best game I've bought this year. It's a refreshing change from the so called triple A titles that never seem to change and keep coming year after year.			"

												Valiant Hearts is one of the most engrossing games I’ve played; following the stories of 4 individuals in the Great War is remarkable. The story is great and the information you get from picking up collectables is interesting enough to encourage you to collect them all. On the downside though that you are forced to use uplay, there is no way around it, though this is only a minor inconvenienceBut other than that id place it up there with my favourite game this year so far; though simple down a bit for the younger audience it is still interesting enough to play if you wish to know more about the Great War. The puzzles in the game are good and can lead you astray if you don’t pay enough attention.I’d give it 4.5/5(Only due to being forced to use Uplay it gets a -0.5) "

												TL;DRMagnificent Art StyleWell crafted puzzlesEmotional rollercoaster of a storyMusic with emotional depth to precisely fit the moodFULLY RECOMMEND AS MUST PLAY-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nothing short of a masterpiece. I am not a fan of puzzle games, nor am I a fan of 2D games. Yet, this game made me enjoy these two aspects far more than many 3D open world games have made me enjoy theirs in the past year or two. The story is possibly one of the most well crafted in recent memory, with the game being able to create a set of standard characters that never speak a word of English, that bumble their way about the Western Front and somehow invest you in their well being and survival. The war, far from being a glorious crusade against the great evil, is a colossally barbaric bloodletting of innocent souls. The game can be as dark as the darkest images of war.But that is not to say there is no joy to be had in playing it. Escaping from the German Air force while the game blasts Hungarian Dance No.3 out of your speakers was hilariously good fun, and only got better when I was interoduced to the Can Can on the Champs-Élysées. There are many merry dances of various kinds in the game to match the depravity of the war.The puzzles are very well designed, although do occasionally seem rather unintuitive on rare occasions (about 3 times in the entire game). As the main meat of what you will be doing, they serve very well. They seemed difficult enough to require some thought, but not so difficult as to require a guide. They can be quite satisfying and enjoyable.Finally, there is the magnificent art style. As I say, I am not a fan of 2D games because of their tendency to go for bland retro or boring flash game styles, but this game goes in a different direction. It has moments where you will be running along and not even notice the subtle shifts in art direction as the game shifts tone until you're in the thick it, hiding from withering machine gun fire only to see that you are hiding behind a dead body, that you are standing in a river of blood and on a mountain of corpses. There will be times when starting out, that the world is rosy and colourful but by the end is bleak and bloody. There will be times when you will be behind enemy lines, running through fields at night, that the ground gets progressively darker until only the sky is a shade of dark blue and the ground is black and a flare flies up, lighting the way and the danger for only a moment. The art style is aware of it's ability and it uses that ability to the fullest extent that it can. The music only serves to amplify this.It made me feel strong emotions of happiness and sadness, of despair and joy. It is to be commended, it's rare that a game me feel anything strongly. It requires a great deal of skill to achieve such a feat and for that I can give it no less than my total recommendation as a must play.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War, the game I had been waiting for for a long time now. A world war one game that's not all about 'slaughtering Germans' or anything of the sort. Finally a game depicting the first World War as it truly was. The gameplay was enjoyable, puzzles that people from any age can enjoy and solve. Rythm sequences that could get rather hard (Or I just sucked at them), but overall very enjoyable, despite the short length of the game. However don't let that disappoint because the music and sound were absolutely amazing, every song from the intro to the credits was good, enjoyable and only made the story and the game that much more enjoyable. The story itself was, in my humble opinion, the best storyline ever in any game. It was touching, it could make anyones hair stand on end, and even make you cry. The way they picked the characters and made their stories intertwine, and show each aspect of the war, was well thought through, and even better executed. American, French, Belgian, British and German. Nurse or soldier. It showed the horror of each and every one of these individuals. I could not have asked for a better story to depict The Great War. Other then the story there is also tons and tons of information, both in form of background information to the current chapter in the game, or just in general more information about items used during the war, in form of collectibles. Truly amazing and interesting to anyone. Overall, this game was a true masterpiece made by Ubisoft and thanks to the help of organisations that, to this day, make sure that all those lost in the war, will never be forgotten. This game will make sure more people remember, and never forget the gruesome four years of war, and those who fought in it.			"

												**NO SPOILERS**Valiant Hearts ws just terrific! Was amazed by the creativity, and especially the story telling that this side scroller could deliver. A nice change from the shoot'em up historical war style games the industry has come to expect. Every puzzle over the length of the game was masterfully thought out, with very few exceptions. Characters were extremely likable and grew on you making the emotion of this game to bb intense. You really felt for the characters. Pros and Cons are listed below.Pros:-Storyline, and human emotion element-Puzzles well thoughtout and challenging without being to ridiculous and unsolvable.-Artwork was unique, giving a fresh feeling-Worth the $15 starting price, did purchase on sale for $7.50Cons:-Emilie's digging controls			"

												Despite being about World War One, this game is actually not a shooter but a puzzle game. In fact, it has quite a lot in common with Telltale's The Walking Dead, up to and including a small sidekick to help with puzzles, and a serious downer ending.This game follows four characters from different backgrounds, and explores how their friendships are created or destroyed by the fire of the war. Truth be told, this game is one of the few I've played that actually made me come close to tearing up (although, as an Australian, I am physically unable to cry). If there's one thing that this game excels in, it's in creating atmosphere. The designers knew which visuals, effects and music choices can be combined to create certain feelings in the player, and so the story can transition from war-torn trenches to a calm countryside very smoothly. One scene near the opening was so effective in creating a fat-paced, terrified mood in me that I had to pause the game for a minute and make sure that I wasn't actually having a heart attack.If this game does falter in one respect, it's in how it sometimes overestimates the abilities of the player. Quite a few times within the game, I found myself thinking 'How the hell was I supposed to figure that out?', and one particular section sent me into ragequit mode multiple times. I swear, if I ever hear that music again...Overall, though, this is an amazing game. Buy it, and you won't ever be sorry.			"

And most of the games nowadays, fail miserably at it...Who cares about ""Cool Guns""?Guns don't make the soldiers. Men make them.You MUST buy this game.If there was a button for ""Obligation"", I'd press it.But for now. I just can recommend it... "

												Story based puzzle games are my favorite style of game. That's the style this game is going for and I had high hopes for this one. However it hasn't really met my expectations. The setting is fascinating learning more about World War I history and the people involved was the main allure of this game. In fact it started off that way tThe biggest problem I found was that it began to stray too far from it's historical setting that it's advertised. There's a cliche, cartoony villian that takes this game from an interesting and emotional look into the horrors of the firt world war into a boring cliche. The puzzles are very easy so there wasn't even the challenge of a difficult puzzle to keep me going. I believe this would work well as a family game with children, since the violence is never very graphic, and overall is kept fairliy minimal considering the horrors of this war. As the protogonist you don't tend to inflict much violence except for knocking out a soldier every now and then and the occasional howitzer shot.Overall I'd say it's not for me but I could see it being a good family game and an educational tool			"

Game looks great! Music is good but limited. Game ran great for me.The bad:Story did not grab me until close to the end.Gameplay was too easy, and boring.It had a few ""puzzles"" that frustrated me, but not many at all were difficult.In summery:I have a hard time judging this game because the story did affect me in the end but i found the gameplay slow and a bit lacking. I thought the setting was really interesting and fresh! The naration was great but maybe i would have better or early'er connected with the characters if they had real VO and not just ""Gibberish voices"".It took me six hours to finish the game.			"

												When was the last time you played an emotionally engaging game about war? If you have recently played Spec Ops: The line please disregard the previous question. Valiant Hearts is a game set in the first world war, which is actually very rare for video games. It was created by Ubisoft so, yes you do need U-Play. This is a puzzle/Adventure game when you'll mostly be picking up items and using them on certain things to preogress the story. The story is about 4 people who are forced to participate in the first world war and they're all connected to one another. The thing thats really interesting is that this game doesnt have any main villain or antagonist of any sort. The villain/antagonist in this game is more or less the war itself. You play as characters from both sides who would really prefer not illing each other and just going home to their families, which is very intriguing. The ending will also bring a tear to your eye unless you are a robot. I highly suggest you buy this game, even if its not on sale It's very much worth it.			"

												Valiant Hearts is a great-looking game with an emphasis on simple puzzling and the occasional light action sequences.  The visuals are top-notch and look even better in motion and the sound design is quite good at times.  The story is solid and well-told and delivered in a mostly understated manner outside of an antagonist character that seems completely out of place compared to the rest of the game.It's an Ubisoft game so that means UPlay and item collecting.  UPlay updated their UI recently and seems less intrusive than it has in the past, but it still sucks to have launch another program from a program to play a game.  As for the item collecting, it's actually cool, informative, and non-intrusive in VH.  Most of the stuff you'll just find along the way and they all provide some interesting tidbits about the war effort.  There are also some short articles for each chapter about the current location/battle/arms, and these are cool too, but a couple of them are very graphic, including one about facial disfigurement that I can't believe they included without some type of warning.  It's kind of jarring to go to the pause screen and see some dude's chewed-up face out of nowhere.The gameplay is kind of a bore.  Each of the playable characters has their own little thing, but none of them are particularly fun to play as.  Puzzles are mostly simple and repetitive.  Checkpoints are well-placed so you won't lose much progress if you mess up a certain part.In short, an impressive looking game with light gameplay elements that'll take you around 8-10 hours to see everything.  Definitely recommended if you're into war stuff or games that emphasize atmosphere/story over gameplay.			"

												Surprised.Though the game wasn't exactly what I hoped, it ended up exceeding my expectations of it.    Graphically it feels like a well product ""Flash"" game.  Despite it's cartoonish look, it is beautiful to play, charming at it's best, yet still has a touch of serious tone to the toons and world surrounding them.  Though I wasn't a hug fan of the direction the story took at times, I can not say it made it bad.  In fact the story was very thoughtful, and other times utterly heart breaking, it is well enough that I can say it would make an excellent movie let alone existing in a video game.  We have expected in life to see few games based around The Great War of 1914-1918.  But being one of my favorite historical subjects I could not help but adore it while playing it.  It is colorful, charming, yet down right brilliant.  At times I smiled, I laughed and I cried.  Valiant Hearts easily belongs on the list of Great War games.The only thing I could possibily complain about the game was the controls.  But it wasn't enough to hurt the over all package, and I would recommend this game literally for anyone.  It is unique and far different from other war games.   I promise anyone who comes into this game will be as surprised as I was.			"

												One of the greatest games I have played recently. Its incredible story, amazing soundtrack and use of music, and the general feeling of a well designed game is here. The environment of the game is astonishing due to it's very nice artwork and simple gameplay feautures. Although some historical facts could be seen as incorrect (the game offered the idea that the first World War started due to the assassination of the Franz Ferdinand, which caused German empire declare war on Russia. This is not entirely correct, as Austro Hungarian empire was the first that declared war on Serbia, which lead to a chain of countries declaring wars) but that is of small matter.I definetly recommend this game to anyone, who is looking for a game that offers a lot unfolding of historical events and a closer look to the lifestyle of soldiers in the WW1, a game that is simple and can make you stop and think for a second, or if you are just looking for a break from your average shooters, moba's, etc. Well done!

A nice change from the shoot'em up historical war style games the industry has come to expect. Every puzzle over the length of the game was masterfully thought out, with very few exceptions. Characters were extremely likable and grew on you making the emotion of this game to bb intense. You really felt for the characters. Pros and Cons are listed below.Pros:-Storyline, and human emotion element-Puzzles well thoughtout and challenging without being to ridiculous and unsolvable.-Artwork was unique, giving a fresh feeling-Worth the $15 starting price, did purchase on sale for $7.50Cons:-Emilie's digging controls			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War, the game I had been waiting for for a long time now. A world war one game that's not all about 'slaughtering Germans' or anything of the sort. Finally a game depicting the first World War as it truly was. The gameplay was enjoyable, puzzles that people from any age can enjoy and solve. Rythm sequences that could get rather hard (Or I just sucked at them), but overall very enjoyable, despite the short length of the game. However don't let that disappoint because the music and sound were absolutely amazing, every song from the intro to the credits was good, enjoyable and only made the story and the game that much more enjoyable. The story itself was, in my humble opinion, the best storyline ever in any game. It was touching, it could make anyones hair stand on end, and even make you cry. The way they picked the characters and made their stories intertwine, and show each aspect of the war, was well thought through, and even better executed. American, French, Belgian, British and German. Nurse or soldier. It showed the horror of each and every one of these individuals. I could not have asked for a better story to depict The Great War. Other then the story there is also tons and tons of information, both in form of background information to the current chapter in the game, or just in general more information about items used during the war, in form of collectibles. Truly amazing and interesting to anyone. Overall, this game was a true masterpiece made by Ubisoft and thanks to the help of organisations that, to this day, make sure that all those lost in the war, will never be forgotten. This game will make sure more people remember, and never forget the gruesome four years of war, and those who fought in it.			"

												Despite being about World War One, this game is actually not a shooter but a puzzle game. In fact, it has quite a lot in common with Telltale's The Walking Dead, up to and including a small sidekick to help with puzzles, and a serious downer ending.This game follows four characters from different backgrounds, and explores how their friendships are created or destroyed by the fire of the war. Truth be told, this game is one of the few I've played that actually made me come close to tearing up (although, as an Australian, I am physically unable to cry). If there's one thing that this game excels in, it's in creating atmosphere. The designers knew which visuals, effects and music choices can be combined to create certain feelings in the player, and so the story can transition from war-torn trenches to a calm countryside very smoothly. One scene near the opening was so effective in creating a fat-paced, terrified mood in me that I had to pause the game for a minute and make sure that I wasn't actually having a heart attack.If this game does falter in one respect, it's in how it sometimes overestimates the abilities of the player. Quite a few times within the game, I found myself thinking 'How the hell was I supposed to figure that out?', and one particular section sent me into ragequit mode multiple times. I swear, if I ever hear that music again...Overall, though, this is an amazing game. Buy it, and you won't ever be sorry.			"

												TL;DRMagnificent Art StyleWell crafted puzzlesEmotional rollercoaster of a storyMusic with emotional depth to precisely fit the moodFULLY RECOMMEND AS MUST PLAY-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nothing short of a masterpiece. I am not a fan of puzzle games, nor am I a fan of 2D games. Yet, this game made me enjoy these two aspects far more than many 3D open world games have made me enjoy theirs in the past year or two. The story is possibly one of the most well crafted in recent memory, with the game being able to create a set of standard characters that never speak a word of English, that bumble their way about the Western Front and somehow invest you in their well being and survival. The war, far from being a glorious crusade against the great evil, is a colossally barbaric bloodletting of innocent souls. The game can be as dark as the darkest images of war.But that is not to say there is no joy to be had in playing it. Escaping from the German Air force while the game blasts Hungarian Dance No.3 out of your speakers was hilariously good fun, and only got better when I was interoduced to the Can Can on the Champs-Élysées. There are many merry dances of various kinds in the game to match the depravity of the war.The puzzles are very well designed, although do occasionally seem rather unintuitive on rare occasions (about 3 times in the entire game). As the main meat of what you will be doing, they serve very well. They seemed difficult enough to require some thought, but not so difficult as to require a guide. They can be quite satisfying and enjoyable.Finally, there is the magnificent art style. As I say, I am not a fan of 2D games because of their tendency to go for bland retro or boring flash game styles, but this game goes in a different direction. It has moments where you will be running along and not even notice the subtle shifts in art direction as the game shifts tone until you're in the thick it, hiding from withering machine gun fire only to see that you are hiding behind a dead body, that you are standing in a river of blood and on a mountain of corpses. There will be times when starting out, that the world is rosy and colourful but by the end is bleak and bloody. There will be times when you will be behind enemy lines, running through fields at night, that the ground gets progressively darker until only the sky is a shade of dark blue and the ground is black and a flare flies up, lighting the way and the danger for only a moment. The art style is aware of it's ability and it uses that ability to the fullest extent that it can. The music only serves to amplify this.It made me feel strong emotions of happiness and sadness, of despair and joy. It is to be commended, it's rare that a game me feel anything strongly. It requires a great deal of skill to achieve such a feat and for that I can give it no less than my total recommendation as a must play.			"

												It's the most touching game I ever played in my life, with the most outstanding end ever. The game focus on show you what is the war, the sacrifice, the pain and the terrible things the war brings. This game which I bet was in honour to the 100th anniversary of The Great War wish to show you the valiant hearts which dug deep into mud, fought fearless for what they thought was right, and even though their bodies are now only ashes, their sacrifices still lives on.The game will show you how those Valiant Hearts gave their best for others without firing a shot, giving you the human vision of the war which places like Hollywood for long haven't showed.It will give you the story of:-Emile, a french man which was forced into a war he never wished. Entered the war to fight for his country and by that he was separated from his family, nothing will stop his Valiant Heart to do what is right.-Freddie, an american volunteer whom the war stole everything he most loved and now seeks for revenge, but who said that revenge will bring happiness? Nothing will stop his valiant heart to avenge his losses.-Karl, a german which had his love a french woman, forced out of France and forced into the german army, a war away from his true love, nothing will stop his Valiant Heart to go back to his family.-Anna, a balgian girl which saved everyone she could at the war, saving mountains of wounded, nothing will stop her Valiant Heart to save people.-Walt, the loyalest dog I have ever seen, which would struggle till the end of times for his new owner Emile. His Valiant HEart would never let him stop and always make him fight for his dear friends.I really recommend this game.			"

												I have to admit, Ubisoft surprised me with this as it's been a while since we've seen anything unique from them besides another AC or Far Cry. The story of the game is also a rare one too as it focuses on World War 1 where the war has torn familys apart and caused havok for everyone.The message at the end is a strange and emotional message that is pretty timeless. Do not forget.This is especialy kinda of coincidental that I end up finishing this game close to poppy day here in the UK where we remember those who died so we could live the way we do today. Ontop of that, this story does tug at your heart strings, somehow making far more interesting and complex characters without them uttering a word and having it only narrated, which reminds me a bit of Bastion in the story-telling department.I highly recommend this game and it is a lot of fun too.

												This is a great ubisoft game not like The Division and Rainbow Six Siege this one is the best. This game features puzzles,interesting characters,great art,etc. The game is maybe the best game I ever played but maybe not. Ok too the details the game is set in World War 1 which is a interesting era because it was the bloodiest war conflict and its better then say futuristic COD now i know why everyone hates infinite warfare but anyways WW1 was the era of almost technology we got better weapons and vehicles. We had fully automatic weapons such as the Lewis gun and vehicles such as cars,and tanks the cars was made by Henry Ford before WW1. Now the things i hate theres nothing i hate the graphics are nice the gameplay is great the characters good well designed like World War 1 uniforms. Now one thing everyone looks the same kinda also they have no emotions because i hear them talking and screaming and they have not moved their mouths. I would recommend this game to anyone with $15 the game is also 4-5 hours long but i totally respect that because this does not look like a game that will last long so i recommend this.Game Rating=10/10			"

												As a few have said, I feel like this game doesn't know what it wants to be. It jumps from zany, rhythm based sequences to dark, emotionally jarring moments. The cartoonish visuals also don't mesh with the sometimes heavy themes. I personally feel like I'm reading a children's book with mature themes, it doesn't really work for me.I'm obviously in the minority, but as a man approaching 30 years old, this game just feels a little silly and disjointed. The puzzles aren't very engaging for the most part, and I often find myself just wanting to get to the next plot point.			"

												Valiant Hearts:The Great War is pretty cool, I guess. Valiant Hearts is a game that takes place during the Great Scuffle of 1914 to 1918, the less popular older sister to her much prettier younger sister: Hitler's Invasion of Poland. You take the roll of several different characters from different backgrounds, or as I like to call them: The diversity squad, as they attempt to survive one of the most horrific slap fights of the 20th century. You take the role of characters such as: Emile the Frenchmen, Karl the German, Anne the Belgian Nurse, Freddie the American volunteer, and Bobo the lovable and wise cracking mascot monkey character.I lied about the last one, I fooled you. I bet you feel really silly. Much like my life, Valiant Hearts is a linear side scroller that leads to tragedy and sadness at every turn. Though there are some puzzle moments where you can freely move left and right, much of the game is spent moving forward. As a war game, it stands out as being rather pacifist in it's approach to conflict. Although it looks like a character may have killed someone through explosive means, it's always implied that they're either simply knocked out or escaped in some way, making the four lead characters the world's first Batmen.  The puzzles are rather simple, and there's a hint system in place in case you do manage to get stuck. I mean, you COULD use it. If you're a big baby.  Although they seem to just be there to give the game something to do other than run, hide, and bonk people on the noggin, they're simple and fast enough that they give the game just enough flavor to keep it from getting boring. Not only that, but there are collectibles hidden throughout the game that tell stories and give more info about the world's most horrible game of Red Rover. You also have a dog companion, who goes about finding hidden objects for you and other actions like pulling switches and getting belly rubs.Not only does the game go about telling a narrative, but it also goes out of it's way to educate. The characters are mostly silent outside of a few gibberish phrases uttered in their native tongue, but they still manage to get objectives and goals across with the use of speech bubbles with objects and arrows inside them. What dialogue you DO have comes in the form of a narrator who serves as both a history teach and a story teller, explaining the events of both the war and the characters involved. Every stage also gives you a short glossary of events, actions, and cultures important to what was happening at the time. It gives the game an anchor in a real world war and keeps the cartoony animations from pulling you away like police pull me away from Victoria Secret. But should you play Stedfast Kidneys: The Okay Fist Fight? See, this is where things get iffy. The game itself is good, don't get me wrong. But the way Ubisoft goes about things may be the deal breaker for you. The game uses Uplay: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Child of Ubisoft and Satan. It was a struggle to get into the game at first because of it, Uplay refused to load Valiant Hearts and instead pushed me into Splinter Cell: Black List, another game set to damnation in the eternal hell fire that is bad corporate decisions. So not only do you need to load up a second client to play Valiant Hearts, but most of the things attached to the game are through Uplay. There are achievements for the game, but none of them mean anything because it's through the Uplay client and not your Steam account. Why would I want that, Ubisoft? Why would you think this is a good idea? I give you gold and you crap bronze. But by the time I write this review with the use of a lap top attached to a small windmill generator, Valiant Hearts is about $3.74 CAD. Is the price worth Uplay? That's up to you. I, however have no self respect and am known to eat garbage, so take that into consideration. If you can find someway to perhaps step over Uplay, then I say go for it. But 3.74 isn't a bad deal for slow, tender tongue kissing with the devil. Valiant Hearts: The Great Disagreement gets 3 sad war-time piano pieces out of 5.Pink was originally a masculine color. The Curator, a place where I go to weep bitterly: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												It's not a bad game. It has its moments. But game developers have made some poor choices while designing this game. It starts out as a pretty fun game. But there are bugs that ruins the mood at times. It's been 2 years since the game came out and the developers still didn't care to fix them. The problem is, you wouldn't know they are bugs. You would think you have to do something, like solve a puzzle in order to advance. After trying for hours when you give up and then later on come back and play again you won't encounter the bug again because they occur only intermittently. Then you realize you just wasted hours trying to solve a puzzle that didn't exist. Speaking of puzzles, I love them and this game has plenty. Many of them are quit intersting. If the game contained only puzzles I would have loved it. However, there are a lot of pointless quicktime events that are excruciating. I like playing games that needs skills. If the quicktime events tested your response time, it would be fun. But that's not what they test! The quicktime events are so poorly designed, especially in the latter half of the game, that the only way to get through them is to try them again and again till the point you remember every move. That's incredibly poor design. Quicktime events can be fun if it tests your response time. In fact they should be randomized every time so that you cannot rely on your memory. That's the correct way to incorporate quick time events in your game. But they become a chore when you have to memorize them. I reached a point where I stopped caring about some of the characters in the game because the qt events were so pointlessly hard. I was like, ""Fine let him just die. I don't care anymore."" Another poor game design is that it doesn't save on all the checkpoints, only some of them. When you're playing and you die, it will start from the previous checkpoint. But if you quit and come back, it may or may not start from that checkpoint. Many times it will start a couple of checkpoitns before. Which means you have to replay levels you have already played before. And there is no way of knowing which checkpoints are saved and which aren't. I have found myself repeating so many parts because the game didn't save. The reason it is getting such rave reviews is that because it's a WWI story and people romanticize it. And the story is pretty sentimental and most people are suckers for romanticized, sentimental war stories. Otherwise the game is like 5 on a scale of 10. I would higly recommend you wait for a 75% off or higher sale. It's not worth the price. I regret buying it.			"

Even though I only played 3 hours, I can already tell that this game is gonna give me even more awesome experiences and some decent knowledge about the ""Great War"" history. Here are some negative facts and some positive facts about this great game.{N} = More in the Negative facts.PositiveSoundtracks are always funny or sad, even emotional depending on the situation, wich is a realy nice addition to the game.Soundtracks are sometimes synchronized with some situations. (EX: The Car Bombing)Graphics are awesome, the cartoon effect makes the game really enjoyable. {N}Characters are really well thought and their story as well.The fact that you can find some hidden items while playing is awesome, it makes the player want to play more.The controls are good for a ""2D"" game.NegativeI don't know if this only happens to me, but sometimes, when the image is really zoomed in, it gets a little pixelated.Some object movements bugs still occur. (Small ""teleportations"")Sometimes, you don't really know what the game wants you to do or find but within 3 hours of gameplay, I only experienced it once. This is not a big deal.I won't spoil more than that.I would definitely recommand this game to everyone who likes historical games based on World Wars.This brings the game to a nice and deserved 10 / 10.

												This is a great game overall. The art in it is great, the puzzles are fun and challenging, but not to the point of frustration and rage quitting. And the story is just so great. If you do buy this game, which it is recommended you do, be prepared for some real sad moments, and probably one of the saddest endings to a game ever. This shows what most World War games lack, the decency of a good storyline. Also my play time is misleading, the game is about 8 hours of gameplay, I left my computer on by accident. But if you go back and collect everything, the game should be anywhere from about 10-12 hours of gameplay if you watch all the cutscenes and don't use guides.

												Great game, full of puzzles that are surprisingly not that annoying... The story is odd, and the American, Freddy, is ignored for the most part. Not worth the 10 dollars I spent, I wish I had bought it when it was like 90% on sale. It is quite short and not replayable. Think of it as a beautiful and long flash game that you would encounter on some virus filled freegamestoplayatwork.com sort of website.			"

Can you please come to an agreement that allows me to play Ubisoft games through Steam without also having to load Uplay?			"

Where to begin...This game delivers so much.  If you are a history buff like I am, you will enjoy Valiant Hearts due to its numerous historical references and collectibles.  If you like stories, this game has had the most real-to-life story in a video game I have ever seen.  The characters are real, the situations are real, and you get to see the horrific lives  of WW1 troops.   Pros: Soundtrack - excellent original score and I liked the inclusion of German and French folk songs that were sneaked into the background.  The music also changes as you unlock a piece of the puzzle.Art  Design - unique, yet so interesting.  Everything is very detailed.Story - see aboveVoice Acting - While there isn't much, the voice acting in this game is perfect. 10/10Cons:I had to resart a couple of levels at one point to get the puzzle to work (mostly with items involving the dog)uPlay Chapter 4's smoke wasn't working quite rightOverall: 10/10 "

												After playing this game I can easily say that this is one of the most emotional things I have experiened in all of media. Game, movie, or books. The gameplay is creative and fun, the artstyle is pretty, the reasearch going into it for World War 1 was solid, and I found myself caring more for these characters who spoke very silly, as opposed to some games that try to sell you their characters through deep dialouge.  The soundtrack is also amazing and I plan on buying it to show my support. If you want something creative, fun, emotionally gripping, and want to learn a bit more history and see it fleshed out a bit more, then this game is for you. Don't pass it up because not many games I feel capture everything in one game like this one.			"

												I haven't finished this game yet and want to take my time going through it. This game isn't about being difficult or offering a challenge. The core of this game is story. Although I dabble in puzzle games like Limbo and Portal you can figure out a puzzle in around 15 minutes of just tinkering.When you hear about war and games you expect to be mowing down hordes of enemies or battling players online. The emotions of most war games are saved for trailers.This game is the tale of different characters from different locations around the world and even tangles with one of the characters being forced on to the opposing side. A civilain called to war. I don't know if this comes into play yet and we be a major part of the story. But I am looking forward to finding out what happens to everyone.Looking at the game at first glance you would think it was a game for children. But the stories of these characters are quite inspiring for people of all ages. It is some of the  stories that are lost at war everyday. "

												This is a great game overall. The art in it is great, the puzzles are fun and challenging, but not to the point of frustration and rage quitting. And the story is just so great. If you do buy this game, which it is recommended you do, be prepared for some real sad moments, and probably one of the saddest endings to a game ever. This shows what most World War games lack, the decency of a good storyline. Also my play time is misleading, the game is about 8 hours of gameplay, I left my computer on by accident. But if you go back and collect everything, the game should be anywhere from about 10-12 hours of gameplay if you watch all the cutscenes and don't use guides. Have fun and never forget those who served for us all and the madness of war.			"

												""Overall, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is an interesting little platformer filled with enough charm to keep it in your memories for a long time.  It might not be the hardest game to play, nor is it the longest, but what Valiant Hearts lacks in lasting power makes up for in personality, and it succeeds in giving the first world war the attention it long deserved from the gaming community.  If you’re a history buff I highly suggest checking this game out.  It might be one of the only times you’ll get to see a glimpse of WW1 in video game format, and one of the only times it’s actually done in a respectful and entertaining manner.""For my Video Review of this game, check it out here:

At times, it is both funny and tragic but it never wavered in its attempt to tell a great story of four people lives against the backdrop of World War One.

The emotions of most war games are saved for trailers.This game is the tale of different characters from different locations around the world and even tangles with one of the characters being forced on to the opposing side. A civilain called to war. I don't know if this comes into play yet and we be a major part of the story. But I am looking forward to finding out what happens to everyone.Looking at the game at first glance you would think it was a game for children. But the stories of these characters are quite inspiring for people of all ages. It is some of the  stories that are lost at war everyday. "

Where to begin...This game delivers so much.  If you are a history buff like I am, you will enjoy Valiant Hearts due to its numerous historical references and collectibles.  If you like stories, this game has had the most real-to-life story in a video game I have ever seen.  The characters are real, the situations are real, and you get to see the horrific lives  of WW1 troops.   Pros: Soundtrack - excellent original score and I liked the inclusion of German and French folk songs that were sneaked into the background.  The music also changes as you unlock a piece of the puzzle.Art  Design - unique, yet so interesting.  Everything is very detailed.Story - see aboveVoice Acting - While there isn't much, the voice acting in this game is perfect. 10/10Cons:I had to resart a couple of levels at one point to get the puzzle to work (mostly with items involving the dog)uPlay Chapter 4's smoke wasn't working quite rightOverall: 10/10 "

												The stoy is fantastic and the game overall is very informative; I learned a lot about WWI. The gameplay is varied and the art style is very cool. I'd compare this game's tone to the Grand Budapest hotel, it takes on serious dark topics but manages to have a playful tone that is never disprespectful. The only con I can think of is a couple of the chapters had some annoying parts that required trial and error. Overall definitey a must play.			"

												In all my time of playing video games, there have been very little times that I've actually cried. Playing this game, is several of those times. Too many games don't do World War 1 justice, only capturing the fighting, and not the emotions behind the war, this game, is not one of those games. It captures the emotions flawlessly, and makes me remember the sacrifices everyone who was in the war had to make. 10/10.			"

It is a very emotional game that is able to deflect the horror of its content (the nightmare that was World Ward 1) with a wonderful soundtrack and a cartoon-like asthetic that works on more levels than one.

												Excellent, one of the most effective and moving games I've played (with Brothers and Papo y Yo). Done in animated comic book style, Valiant Hearts follows five players caught up in the tide of destruction that was World War I. Telling stories and showing scenes that often get overlooked in American obsession with its more glamorized successor (WWII), VH shows how effective videogames can be in presenting history, uniquely among the various new media in giving an opportunity for players not only to visualize but also to interact and experience the situations of trench warfare, mustard gas, and war on the homefront. I have no objections to its gameplay: the puzzles are on the whole a bit easy, but that's as it should be. The gem of this game is the narrative, and the puzzles and visual style are appropriate vehicles to that end. One of my new favorites: 9.5/10			"

												Even though some would avoid this game because of uPlay or whatever, I believe they are truly missing out. But there are some imperfections to Valiant Hearts. This game is on the shorter end; it would be about 6 hours to someone who isn't stupid like me. The antagonist is a little outlandish and fantastical, but it is okay I suppose. But there, the bad ends. The puzzles are fun and they integrate historical terrors like flamethrowers, tanks, and chemical weapons as new, interesting mechanics. There are facts and even the collectables have intersting information to anyone who wants to know about the time. It is also cool that Ubisoft decided to release this game for the centenial, and being a French company, they naturally focused on the Western Front. I, as an American, rarely hear about WW1, as WW2 is our 'national war' for us, where we came out on top of the world (with the USSR). So to experience a French point of view on their national war is very interesting in and of itself. The game truly shines though, in the story, as we learn the terror, hope, and evil resulting from war. Many moments in this game gave me chills, and the art style even though a cartoon, still leaves a massive impression. If anything, I was in tears at the end of the game, and I have only done that for super tragic books and maybe the end of LOTR.Probably one of the best games I have played in a long time, if not, ever.

The story is superb and is that of a war movie. While the story and the history in this game is unmatched the gameplay is comparable to a point and click. Some people might be deterred by the gameplay mechanics but i would still recommend it. Also there is Uplay on this game, ♥♥♥♥ Uplay but play this god damn game already.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War Review.Introduction:Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 2D adventure/puzzle game by Ubisoft. The game is inspired by letters written during the great war and follows four characters journey through the battlefield. Each character has there own unique reason for being involved, but their story’s soon become intertwined.Story: The story is well written and clever in the way it brings our heros together. As you progress through the game you will unlock journal entries explaining why things are happening or what things are. Andthese entries aren’t works of fiction ether, they are all based on fact. All through the game you will be unlocking more and more of these, until you have almost a text book if historical information on the great war. Now I covered World War 1 at school, so a lot of these weren’t that interesting to me. But I like the fact Ubisoft has tried to not only make a game but educate the user too, that’s not to say the user need educating but its there for them anyway. It seems a shame with Ubisoft taking this much time to get there facts correct, that they have chosen to use a completely fictions story. There are so many true stories that could have been just as heartfelt and at times tragic as this one, but maybe they were trying to avoid offending living relatives. I’m unsure of there motives, but feel the game suffers a little for this and that a true story would have inspired real emotion from the player.Gameplay: The controls are a fairly simple affair using the WASD and a few other buttons when needed. But as the game has no real twitch elements you never find yourself overwhelmed or out of your depth. There is the odd in mini game that requires timing, but its nothing too taxing and check points are mercifully regular if you do get it wrong. You will spend much of the game going back and forward, slowly progressing as you solve puzzles. The puzzles aren’t that taxing ether, normally requiring you to find a key or gear for a bell tower. Its generally pretty clear what you have to do and that is the games biggest downfall, the puzzles are so liner that the challenge is somewhat lost. That’s not to say its bad, but it does get a little monotonous running back and forth for the fifth time, or finding the handle for a leaver the tenth time.Presentation: The game has a pleasant style, with the art resembling that of Castle Crashers. The down side being that where Castle Crashers sprites are bright and colorful, these are a far more dull affair with grey and greens being the order of the day. Of course this fits far better with the theme of the great war, but can be a little bland. The animation is good but basic, these 2D characters don’t have a massive array of movement at their disposal. But to be fair they don’t require it and what they do have is great. There’s nothing to blow you away here, but there’s nothing to hate ether. In fact I enjoyed the style very much.Conclusion: It may sound like I hate this game, but I really don’t. I like the game, but I don’t love it. I feel Ubisoft has taken a very hard subject and tried to make something not only touching but educational as well, in this goal I think they have only partially succeeded. Those who could probably do with learning from this game will most likely not bother reading the facts given, and those who have some knowledge will find them an annoyance. It really is a valiant effort by Ubisoft and the game is good, but I very much doubt you will want to play it for much more than an afternoon.For more of my reviews see Cyberus UK[www.cyberusuk.com] "

												 Very thouhgtfull and historical game you don't need a very detailed review for this game, it's fautless shuld be considered for using in schools and the education systems to teach young people in a fun way how important the great war was and the terrific loss of life for so many and the ways it changed the future of our world today.  Again very well produced and a must buy, for anyone at that price or more trust me.MickUK			"

												Having just completed this game im now going to write a review of my honest opinion of the game and everything about it. Firstly let me say the this game is amazing especially for people who are fans of things like history or the army.It is very interesting educational and emotional.The plot:Without spoiling to much the game is set in ww1 and has you controlling 4 people and thier story through out ww1.Gameplay:The game comprises of 2D plat forms and the cutscenes are in sort of a comic book style that im a BIG fan off. It is essentially a puzzle game with collectables. With each collectable you find it gives you information about it. Final verdic 8/10			"

												Ok this game was amazing id have to rate it 10/10The story was heart breaking and it was a truely emotional journey. Before I go any further you have to relise that this is a 2d puzzle platformer which is not really my game but Valiant Hearts opened my gaming Horizons, I bought this game thinking it would be alright and boring. i would have payed doubl this games price just t5o expirence it all over again for the first time.Valiant Hearts takes you on a animated journey of the Great War or better known as World War 1.The Game has Brilliant Art Work and in a very unusual way it captures the horror of these evens perfectlyThe Sound Track was Also Great having those awesome songs while playing this game made the expirence even better.I HAVE NO FAULTS WITH THIS GAME JUST GO AND BUY IT PLAY IT AND LIVE THE JOURNEY, I GARUNTEE YOU WILL LOVE IT.

												The subject matter is quite heavy, revolving around the Great War and its tragedies. Initially it doesn't feel like the arts-tyle and light hearted voice-overs add to its atmosphere, often distracting and clashing with the serious tone it should be conveying instead. However, by the end it does a convincing enough job of relating over the horrors of that war (and wars in general) especially with the final chapter and the consequences of the entire narrative. The art is very pretty, which should be expected with Ubisoft's UbiArt Framework engine. The story is entirely fictional but uses letters and historical facts from the Great War as source material for the inspiration to the game's characters, environments and other aspects.It's a reasonably short game easily completable in one sit-through and worth playing through at least once.

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War Review.Introduction:Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a 2D adventure/puzzle game by Ubisoft. The game is inspired by letters written during the great war and follows four characters journey through the battlefield. Each character has there own unique reason for being involved, but their story’s soon become intertwined.Story: The story is well written and clever in the way it brings our heros together. As you progress through the game you will unlock journal entries explaining why things are happening or what things are. Andthese entries aren’t works of fiction ether, they are all based on fact. All through the game you will be unlocking more and more of these, until you have almost a text book if historical information on the great war. Now I covered World War 1 at school, so a lot of these weren’t that interesting to me. But I like the fact Ubisoft has tried to not only make a game but educate the user too, that’s not to say the user need educating but its there for them anyway. It seems a shame with Ubisoft taking this much time to get there facts correct, that they have chosen to use a completely fictions story. There are so many true stories that could have been just as heartfelt and at times tragic as this one, but maybe they were trying to avoid offending living relatives. I’m unsure of there motives, but feel the game suffers a little for this and that a true story would have inspired real emotion from the player.Gameplay: The controls are a fairly simple affair using the WASD and a few other buttons when needed. But as the game has no real twitch elements you never find yourself overwhelmed or out of your depth. There is the odd in mini game that requires timing, but its nothing too taxing and check points are mercifully regular if you do get it wrong. You will spend much of the game going back and forward, slowly progressing as you solve puzzles. The puzzles aren’t that taxing ether, normally requiring you to find a key or gear for a bell tower. Its generally pretty clear what you have to do and that is the games biggest downfall, the puzzles are so liner that the challenge is somewhat lost. That’s not to say its bad, but it does get a little monotonous running back and forth for the fifth time, or finding the handle for a leaver the tenth time.Presentation: The game has a pleasant style, with the art resembling that of Castle Crashers. The down side being that where Castle Crashers sprites are bright and colorful, these are a far more dull affair with grey and greens being the order of the day. Of course this fits far better with the theme of the great war, but can be a little bland. The animation is good but basic, these 2D characters don’t have a massive array of movement at their disposal. But to be fair they don’t require it and what they do have is great. There’s nothing to blow you away here, but there’s nothing to hate ether. In fact I enjoyed the style very much.Conclusion: It may sound like I hate this game, but I really don’t. I like the game, but I don’t love it. I feel Ubisoft has taken a very hard subject and tried to make something not only touching but educational as well, in this goal I think they have only partially succeeded. Those who could probably do with learning from this game will most likely not bother reading the facts given, and those who have some knowledge will find them an annoyance. It really is a valiant effort by Ubisoft and the game is good, but I very much doubt you will want to play it for much more than an afternoon.For more of my reviews see Cyberus UK[www.cyberusuk.com] "

												i really tried to like this game, and i can say the art style is very nice.i see how they try to tell you about the background and the ongoings of wwi while playing, but the whole game does feel quite french sided. not really surprising since the frenche were attacked by the germans and this game is made by ubisoft but the general tone did always feel like the germans were definately the bad guys.i would have liked to have seen more stories from both sides, though i haven't finished the game, so maybe it gets better in that regard.that brings me to my next point:it's just not fun.none of the mechanics were interesting at all, either they were way too easy and requirde no thougt or were just plain trial and error. i was quite interested in how the story of each character played out but he gameplay was just so tedious that i have stopped playing. i think i would prefer this game as a cartoon short film.if you like contrived puzzles that don't require thinking to solve, but rather have you running around the map looking for an item you might have missed, and like playing a really simplyfied version of guitar hero to heal people, and are interested in wwi, this game is for you			"

												Brilliant gameBeautiful art style, interesting plot and emotional characters. It's not very often we see stories, never mind video games touching this subject matter - the non-combatants, deserters and the lost of World War One - and I personally was very happy for Ubisoft to be brave enough to do this.And I am going to be honest here... I cried at the ending... it is an incredibly emotional game			"

												This is a tough game to assign a binary good or bad value to. On the one hand, the setting is unique and fresh, the story and characters are emotional and engaging, and the snippets of history lessons are interesting. But on the other hand, the gameplay is dull and tenious, and the puzzles are downright annoying. Oftentimes I would die due to moving just an inch too close to some gas or I'd poke my head out to a hail of bullets (when two minutes prior I was able to run right through the gunfire). It's a short 5 hour game, yet it still managed to drag on, leaving me wondering on several occasions when it would finally end.If you can deal with the mindnumbingly dull gameplay, then there's a good chance you'll enjoy the story. I could not however, and thus, I highly suggest watching a Let's Play of it instead.			"

												This game is terribly dull - not a single puzzle can be considered fun and some like the button QTEs are overly simplistic and annoying. The puzzles are very, very brainless, consisting of mostly QTEs, fetch quests, and reaction puzzles. Any puzzle you are unable to solve is probably due to bad game design; for instance, there was one puzzle in Chapter 3 where you needed to create a diamond shaped object, I handed in a square and was denied, and only the diamond is accepted. The characters' individual 'powers' make little sense, because apparently only the old grandpa with the big ladle can dig through mud but the muscular soldier cannot pick up a shovel and do the same, or why does one character has a pair of pliers that never breaks while all the others can only pick up one use pliers to force the problems unto the player instead of presenting interesting puzzles. This necessity for detailed solutions shows how lack of attention to details game designers gave it. Thankfully the game is very forgiving with checkpoints, and frequent deaths due to unfair situations can be forgiven. Simple and forgiving however, makes a good game for children. The collectibles contribute absolutely nothing to the story, and I feel they are just added to pretend that there is a replay element when there really is not. If you need a game that has a lot of padding to distract your children, tell them they have to collect all the collectibles and remember some of the factoids to get a present. Sometimes, these trinkets you collect are immersion breaking too - why would you bend down and collect a small trinket amidst gunfire, or running to save someone crying for help? For a 'completionist' run one would have to ignore all logic in situation and try to search for places that these meaningless items are hidden, why such an option is added is puzzling. All it is, I think, is useless padding to make the game seem longer.The story, love it or hate it, is completely devastated by poor game design. Emotions sessions are padded with boring puzzles that breaks up continuity, and doing the same old chores simply makes one feel frustrated, but not frustrated in the way the story wants you to feel. Bugs and the distraction of collectibles aside, the lack of attention to scenes, characters and puzzle design is especially disruptive to immersion because that makes up the bulk of the game. There is a part where your character is supposed to pick up the pliers from the floor at the midst of battle, if you press the action button but miss the sweet-spot you have to stand on to prompt the action, your character will scratch his chin and think - all in the midst of heavy gunfire - like he does during other puzzling moments. Why was this overlooked? How could this have been overlooked? This constant immersion breaking experience is probably the worst sin this game has committed. I tried killing the dog, throwing grenade at people, but the world seems to ignore it and never had I gotten a gameover screen other than getting the character you control killed. You can't kill anything in this game. Drive the tank in chapter 3 and do the logical thing and fire the cannon at the German soldiers - guess what - nothing happens. Good games send anti-war messages by forcing the player to make painful decisions that would not have been necessary if it was not because of war, and make players regret the decisions they make, make them feel pain for the people they killed and the buildings they destroyed. Turning everyone invincible to the devastating elements of war and battle, or making the characters unable to pick up weapons and gun down enemies to save their own lives when it makes perfect sense to do so, is not the way to deliver the message. The narrative in this game is so atrocious that the game feels like an afterthought than an integral part of the plot. It seems like the developers were thinking, how do we make this game an arbitrary length long so that it can justify the price tag, instead of thinking of how the game-play can help to complement the story. There is so much wrong with the narrative that I don't think the game should have been made in the first place. It was a very disturbing experience for me, but probably not in the way the developers wanted. I wrote this review concurrently while playing the game, not because I wanted to write a review, but I felt the need for a rant every time the game breaks me out of the immersion. As for the story, I think it is good, the message is good, but it is honestly nothing exceptional and I would have rewritten some parts of the ending just to knit together some game-play elements and the story to better create that devastating sensation felt from the quote uttered at the end ""War makes men mad"". The game has a message, but it is as though the developers did not understand that message themselves at all. Chapter 4 is probably the best chapter, but the whole game could have been condensed into a much shorter experience to make Chapter 4 feel more impactful - because a bored man can't feel any other emotions, he just feels bored.I applaud the team for trying to do a non-FPS war game, but as the game stands now it should have just been at most a graphic novel and not a stealth-puzzle game. The puzzle style can work, because there are parts where the interactive elements of the game actually contributes to the narrative, such as the final battle in Chapter 4. Having a good plot is important, but having little to no game-play elements to support that plot almost makes this title a non-game. The experience feels toned down and censored, prepared for mass consumption but cannot be considered a breakthrough because of the extremely poor narrative. Valiant effort, but still not enough effort.			"

												I bought the game expecting to be immersed in a variety of characters with the storied hardships of a WW1 setting. The game however, is just a series of puzzles that happened to be placed in a WW1 setting. You don't really get a sense of the world as you get frustrated trying to figure out where to throw a stick of dynamite or rock in the 3-4 different rooms. The factoids thrown in at each level are the only thing really related to the great war.The very beginning and very last mission are the only strong points that make you actually care about the characters and what's going on. Everything in between is just puzzles and weak dialogue-- there is no spoken dialogue as the characters only commuicate with pictures and pointing.			"

												Valiant Hearts does what few games dare to do.Valiant hearts connects you with people from 100 years ago who served in world war 1, and to the wife of a soldier with his life on the line, his baby boy not even taking his first steps when the orders to serve come in.Brilliant story telling, amazing gameplay can make you feel the agony of defeat, the sorrow of losing friends and fellow soldiers fighting beside you, and a glimpse of the pain that comes with missing loved ones back home.A triumph in game development, a story full of heart, and a rare gem in the game market.You don't need to know or even desire to know about the first world war to appreciate this game.  This game will make you understand our history better and appreciate the sacrifices made as well as the hardships endured.  Phenomenal.I cursed the war.  I screamed at my monitor.  I laughed with joy.  - And I wept....To call me a fanboy of this game after playing it would be an understatement as massive as the first world war itself.			"

												Played for a couple of hours, but was not drawn back. Despite the story and personality this game has, the gameplay is bland. The puzzles are essentially pictures in bubbles showing you what to do next. The end result is that I felt as if I was just going through the paces to get to the next bit of story. Its hard to recommend a game when the game portion is so underwhelming. It's very short apparently, so if you feel like trudging through the interruptions to the story, you are not investing much.

												[SPOILER ALERT]This game was recommended to me by a friend, and although I am not much for either puzzle games or side-scrollers, I figured, why not. After I installed and started to play the game, I got to a spot where I couldn't continue due to some sort of bug: the first taxi ride in which you evade the bombs and machine guns of the Zep, during Chapter 1.Eventually I came back to the game and the bug had been fixed. So I played it through almost to completion. But I will probably never finish the game, sadly.As the game progresses, the puzzles get trickier, which is OK, I guess. But the problem for me is that the game also keeps turning up the gain on the hand-eye coordination puzzles: I was particularly frustrated by the final assault where you have to dig your way past all those unexploded bombs, and God forbid you should hesitate or the roof will literally fall in.But I did get past that, only to be ultimately denied an ending by the last ""Heal Karl"" episode. I'm sorry, but at the age of 57--and as one who was never that gifted in the hand-eye department anyhow--I'm just not good enough to make it through the ""hit-the-right-button-at-the-right-instant"" part. I got close a couple times, but by then I was so annoyed, frustrated, and exhausted that I wasn't able to do it and in fact just got worse.You would think that since there were three separate bits, they'd give you credit for each one as you complete it, but no...if you fail at any point, it's back to zero for you. I don't quite understand this, especially as the game is much more forgiving in most of the other parts.And this, finally, brings me to why, after all is weighed in the balance, the game doesn't work for me. It's advertised as this great emotional experience, and that part is entirely correct...just as long as you don't hit the wall. The minute you find yourself stymied by a puzzle, or unable to make it past a hand-eye moment...the emotional content drains away as if you'd pulled the stopper in your sink.The artwork is charming, the characters tolerably endearing...though it tells you something that the most attaching one is the dog. The plot makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but I'll let that one go. And I'm not altogether happy with the narrative having to be carried by a voice-over in the style of Ken Burns' Civil War series: the first rule of a visual medium is, after all, show, don't tell. If I had the skills to do the transitions, I could do pretty much every voiceover in graphical form, and surely they would be more powerful that way.The game may be more appealing if you really, really like puzzle-game side-scrollers that require substantial amounts of hand-eye coordination. I am not that person. So it is with some reluctance, but no hesitation, that I conclude ""Not Recommended.""			"

												I decided to buy this game because of the artstyle and, of course, the rating. Most people seem to praise this game for his great story and creativity, which i agree in a certain way.Before reviewing this game i just wanna thank the developer and ubisoft for trying something different, this isnt the game  that they got right but it might set the path for a greater one.Lets start with the graphics, which is , in my opinion the best part . Games these days try to make everything very realistic and that might look good on release but years after it will already be very dated. Meanwhile ,games with a less serious art style like the wind waker (that already has 14 years) will never get old with time, the same happens with valiant hearts with a very cartoony style. Unfortunaly with such a cartoony style, the story will probably get taken less seriously , i dont know if this was the developers intention, but i dont believe it was the right choice with a game that is so much story driven.Sadly, that and the history facts were the only interesting parts for me.The worst part about this game were definitly the puzzles they werent just bad, they were very repitive. Valiant Hearts includes, for the most part, puzzles that you have to try one more time, which is always a big turnoff for me. Who doesnt feel great completing a puzzle on the first try?You will not find that in this game.Being so repetitive ,I wish this game was shorter ,there are some unnecessary parts that could have been easily skipped.Finally the story, nothing special but it wasnt that bad either.The ending was good but predictable.Do i recommend this game?No, by any means. I really like history and yet, i still cant recommend this game to anyone. Very repetitive even for a 6 hour long game. 5/10			"

												Couldn't even play it. I have a UPLAY account on xbox, for assassin's creed. Couldn't remember the password right away, took me a few tries. It said my account is suspended because of too many login attempts. Fine. I made another stupid UPLAY account, set it all up, it said my account has been suspended because of too many login attempts. So I just can't play the game. I actually am officially done with Ubisoft. This disgusts me, and I'm not going to be buying anything else from them until UPLAY is gone. I saw the outrage at UPLAY, and honestly didn't understand what the big deal was. Well now I curse them. I curse their children. I hope they go bankrupt, and the idiot who pitched the UPLAY idea is forced to live in a dumpster behind a chik fil a. Seriously, don't waste your money. There are far better companies producing comparable games. I hear this game is decent, but that's almost irrelevant at this point. It's like if there was a beautiful painting, but you later found out the painter used baby blood to make it. You couldn't very well recommend that painting to your fellow art appreciators could you? No.Edit: Alright. I do recommend the game. I thought I should leave my initial review, though, as it conveys accurately how frustrated I was. But the game is excellent. The music is beautiful, the artwork is interesting, the story itself is thought provoking and well executed. I grudgingly feel that I must recommend the game, though UPLAY is still on my salty list.Second Edit: This game is a masterpiece. Beautiful.			"

												This was a hard choice whether or not I should recommend it. The game is very short and very straight forward and simple. However, besides the story (which wasn't that bad, though one character confused me whether or not he was black) it's very educational for everyone about the first world war and life in the trenches. I don't think it's worth the full price, so if you want to get it, then get it when it's on a discount. Requires Uplay, doesn't bother me, but some have issues with it.The sound is good, the graphics very simple, but pleasent to the eye. The replayability is.. a bit iffy, if you only care for the story there is none. If you're a collector achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, you can replay it maybe one or two times at best.			"

												A great game over all, only problem is that you are forced to install Uplay in order to play the game. Other wise it's a good game with a amazing story that gives you some knowledge of the Great War(WW1) with many interesting unique puzzles that you either overthink it, or actually have to use the hints because of how hard they are. After playing it for a while you become attached to the characters and their story.  The art style is really well made; like no other game I have ever played. If you really enjoy history, puzzles, and/or stories that you always want to know what will happen, then this is the game for you.			"

												Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a tragic tale of five characters that are drawn together during the First World War. The game is a 2D side-scrolling platform title set on a stunning artistic backdrop comprising of puzzles and a powerful narrative throughout. It is a truly special title that not only succeeds as a great game; but provides a deep insight into the historical events of 1914-18 which educates and informs the user in an engaging way.Your journey sees you undertaking the role of four playable characters; Emile, Freddie, Anna and Karl - each with their own story that intertwines into an absorbing tale. They are also accompanied by a faithful companion; Walt, who is a dog that helps along the way. The superb writing really makes you care about the characters and their experiences. Valiant Hearts's stand-out gameplay aspect is puzzles - most of which are fairly basic but are all varied and great fun to complete. Despite the simplicity of many; they are superbly orchestrated. The general mechanics are easy to pick up and the controls are simple which make the experience a joy throughout. There are a wealth of collectables and achievements that ensure you explore every nook and cranny of each location plus many historical prompts which offer a deep insight into the real events of the war away from the game. These also contain real pictures and intriguing information that brings the colourful aspects of the game into a harsh reality of the tragedy.  Overall, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a wonderfully presented product with a powerful story, excellent gameplay mechanics and impeccable visuals. Not only is it a fantastic videogame in its own right; it's a learning tool that keeps players engrossed in the 8 or so hours of play time available. It is a title that can be played and enjoyed by everybody.  *Note: uPlay is a requirement - I experienced zero issues using this DRM service on this game.			"

												I might end up one of the few people giving this a ""not recommended"" while not at all bothered by the uplay aspect.  I won't be saying it was a bad game but one that did not meet expectations.In brief I would describe this game as a somewhat moving World War I story spoiled by tedious puzzle sequences.  Some of the puzzles are fine but others you'll likely be looking up walkthroughs for the solutions.The story is told through a number of different characters, with voiced narration breaking up each segment with a historical overview of the events as they happened.  The characters once in game speak barely a word of any language, using pictures in speech bubbles to convey their messages.  Occasionally this lessened the atmosphere; real language (as dialogue) could have increased the emotional impact on the player, and characters would not have had to communicate in such simplified messages.While it was disappointing that some of the enemies were overly stereotyped and one-dimensional, the devs did a good job of showing the humanity on both sides of the conflict.  Many of the people in this war did not want to go out and kill others but the circumstances of their time forced them to.  You see this in characters helping out others in need when they could, like a nurse giving aid to a fallen enemy.Probably the most appealing part of this game is its art, in graphic and sound design.  The background of machine gun fire and artillery bombardment give you a sense of the pure dread these people went through.  You will experience the Great War as a muddy and bloody mess.  At one stage I had to take cover from machine gun fire behind a pile of dead soldiers!In the end, I feel the story was able to draw some emotions from me but the sometimes frustrating puzzles dampened the experience too much.  I expected a bit more depth overall given how highly it had been rated by critics.			"

												It's not the sort of artistic, emotional game that you imagine it to be, considering it's rated as ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" on Steam.It isn't that artistic, historically accurate, nor is it realistic when it needs to be, as a result it fails to be that emotional. The start was great, I wont spoil it so others may have the chance to try it. But it got more and more childish, and the puzzles became these chores with the sole purpose of moving the story forward.  They became more and more silly, usless, and ridiculous as the story goes on. It felt like they did that to only lengthen the time required to finish the game.The game is also subject to glitches and bugs, getting stuck, death, etc.As a concept, this game is pretty good, but when applied it's not as great as it could have been.Consider this as a children's game 9+, it's still playable but not really as breathtaking as the positive reviews make it.I honestly wonder the type of people that have loved this game so much.The only thing that I can say is consistently of good value, is the side aspect of the pacifist ideal in the game. You cannot kill anyone, you may only knock them out.I tried to delay deciding about this game for later, since there are so many positive views. But I haven't changed my mind, this game genuinely isn't as brilliant as they claim it to be.I won't go into the long rants of the wide range of problems both technical and plot design, like going to save your friend by rushing to the enemy camp and getting first aid kit, but it takes you this... ridiculous long journey through the camp, with all these ups and downs, and you keep going deeper and deeper into the enemy base to get a first aid kit. By the time you're back, your friend will be dead, that is if you survive the ridiculous journey. Characters move back and forth across the frontline like they're trailing through the woods. The game gets pretty dark at times for such a silly game, and then you face this silly, perfect antagonization of a German commander, cause you know.. Germans are the ultimate evil, they caused both World Wars (not exactly). And oh my god the glitches. I admit there were cute moments, but they got less frequent as the game continued and you will have to tolerate more and more terrible plot writing, accompanied by equally ridiculous gameplay.Play the game if you have the time and money to waste, that is if you either have the low enough standards to enjoy such a thing, or your life is occupied by nothing else to do that is more fullfilling or valuable. But if value both, your money and time, and expect something of worth in return, then don't consider this game.			"

												I don't quite understand all the positive reviews.As a WW1 game, it's only the time zone and the setting itself that's about WW1. Could be basically anywhere.After 2 hours, I've followed a fairly mediocre story.I've got a guy running around using a spoon to knock out people instead of a rifle, despite being free from the prison camp several chapters ago. Noone's got a rifle actually. Other guy has a bolt cutter as his main ""weapon"". Occasionally you get to shoot an artillery piece which is kinda fun. The girl does medical work with an uninspired and irrelevant mechanic that consists of pushing up/down and occasionally TWO buttons at the same time when there is a pulse coming across a marked line. Kind of like guitar hero. I think the game could have been without that mechanic and I wouldn't have missed it.The puzzles, which I suppose are the games main focus are not really interesting and often tedious rather than requiring thought to figure out.Maybe I'm just grumpy and all the positive reviews found something in there I have not after these two hours spent in there.

												U-play, the single most irritating thing, I have ever encountered. Y U no want me to play the game that I payed for. This is my review, I have no idea how this game is because I cannot crack the U-play code necessary to even launch it. I am super♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ >.<*update: I drew a turtle in the sand, and danced around it, only then would U-play allow me entrance to their special club. Once in, I discovered that the game is very nice to look at, puzzles are challenging, but not crazy. The stiff game mechanics can be a drag when everything has to be positioned ""just so"" and your toon is on the wrong side of the valve, and refuses to return to the proper side. Occasionally, I got a feeling of ""not this again"" regarding the repetition of a few actions, that were super fun at first, and then became ""meh"". Unfortunately, I still cannot rate this game up due to the U-play shenanigans. I have to pull up my task manager, and rapid fire end valiant heart tasks until the game decides to load, which is completely made of fail. Once I finish this game, I forever say F-U-play.			"

												Before I move on to the review, I'd like to state that it was actually quite difficult to decide between recommending this game or not. The music and artwork are so masterfully pulled together that it is able to create such a beautiful and tragic portrayal of World War I. It further manages to educate the player over the length of the story and gives more nuanced facts through the discovery of collectibles.Unfortunately, at the end of the day, this is a game and where this game ultimately fails in the gameplay. The ""puzzles"" the game presents to the player are at best easy and uninspired and at worst simply tedious. Ultimately, the gameplay felt like it simply got in the way of what could have simply been a very intriguing story. To be concise, I can certainly recommend what I think is a very good story (minus the stereotypical German badguy that I could have simply done without) but I can't recommend what is simply an amalgamation of very annoying, distracting minigames that detract from the experience more than anything else.

												Although a very simple game. I loved how the characters stories interlaced with each other, but even more than that, in its own way it shows how cruel life can be. How life and our duty towards society can pull us in different directions. The bitterness that comes along and the beauty that may be found on those ephemeral moments in between. And in the end.. Life goes on.Although I loved the game. I bought it from Steam and expected to play it through their console. Not through UPLAY or having the need to create an account (of course I made up an account and _____ them). Had I know Uplay was needed (which I may not have read on the description), I wouldn't had bought it in the first place. This is my reason for not recommending the game.***This game REQUIRES to install UPLAY and REGISTER on UPLAY******NO STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS.

												It starts pretty good, but overall it's a dull, simplistic and shallow game, which is from some point even painful to play (I was forcing myself to finish it). Thankfully it's a pretty short story and I bought it for spare change. Totally overrated, and ""dem feelz"" that supposedely made this game worth playing are almost non-existent except sad ending - basically the plot is far-fetched and childish. Giving it a second thought - it's not a bad game per se, just a big disappointment.I liked the art style and the music though.			"

												A nice game. I like to play it, beside...Its very straight and a lil bit glitchy. ...and we dont even wanna talk about the dogs wayfinding intelligence. What bugs me most, is the bug, that I have collected 23 out of 22 in the last level (yea, right - its not even counted propper) and did not even get a fukkin Medal.Since the grafx are nice, its not really difficult and you can learn a lot of interesting fact if you want, I would really like to give this game a thumb upwards. Too bad its Ubisoft and has build in thumb down!  :P			"

												The game Valiant Hearts: The Great War game was about war that barley began and Karl and Emile are drafted to the war. As you go one the player have to find mini hidden clues to go on the next levels. This game was ok but I expected more from this game. For example I expected being able to shoot the gun and hoping blood would be very where but it was not. The only time the player gets to kill someone was hitting them with a shovel. I was expecting seeing blood shed going on but blood was never splattered. I did not like the game because the story was kind of switching up a little because players are able to alternate with each other. The only good part was trying to figure out how to reach the next level. I also like the ending of this game. I also liked the player has to think critically when you have to reach a point that seems impossible but it is not you just have really think about it.			"

												I agree that Valiant Hearts is a unique game.But I don't think it is that good.In these days game developers tend to create games with charming artwork and touchy storylines. Like flash platform games about trying to reach your lover; which includes reading 524 line of love story. But is these really enough to make a game good? Is gameplay is that unimportant ?After 4-5 hours, I stopped playing it. It was in my pc for a long time but I just didn't want to continue. Most games of this genre makes me want to spend more time, solve one more puzzle, save one more person. But in Valiant Hearts I; really didn't care.Most of the puzzles in the game are childish and easy. Levels are designed like you can run around in enemylines and active battlefields. Game (in its story) tells you that war is terrible and really hard to get through. But in the action; you can just send your dog to that lever and you are done.Try this game, but do not expect too much.			"

I couldn't force myself to play after finishing chapter 2 (there are 4 chapters) because every element of the gameplay is so recycled, you feel like you've seen it all thousand times by now, and that's from a guy who doesn't usually play puzzle-platformers. The story doesn't help much either, it's just as cheesy as it gets, like if someone made a Dysney cartoon inside a Dysney cartoon. And of course you have to install U-don't-play... ugh... Avoid this game, go play Machinarium, Botanicula, Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons or Harvester.			"

													Valiant Hearts is an adventure game which takes place during World War I. Intended to illustrate the horror and heroism of the war, the player never gets to shoot a single enemy soldier with a gun throughout the course of the game. Instead, the player takes the role of four characters – an American intent on avenging the death of his fiancé, a German soldier intent on getting home to France, the German’s French father-in-law, and a Belgian combat medic. While the American’s story is a component of the campaign, in reality it primarily focuses on the French family and the Belgian combat medic’s work to keep them safe.	As an adventure game, the game relies heavily on “puzzles”, but in reality, the puzzles are almost all of the variety of “find item A and bring it to spot B”. There are very few real puzzles, and the few “true” puzzles you find over the course of the game feel out of place in the world of World War I – who would write hints to a safe code on a window that points to letters on a German battle flag? It just doesn’t make sense.	As a result, the game isn’t really much of a “game” at all – rather, it is more of an interactive work of historical fiction with various puzzles thrown in to… make it feel more gamey, I guess? There are a few more traditionally video-game-like sequences, such as navigating through artillery barrages and dodging tanks and barriers in a racing car, as well as the healing minigame which is just “press the right buttons in sequence” (AKA a quick-time event of sorts), but while these sequences are at times fun, at other times they feel somewhat tedious – while the taxi sequences were reasonably challenging, the “dodge the artillery barrage and machine gun fire” sequences, when done too much in one level, began to feel fairly samey. While they did create some tension, it wasn’t really fun gameplay, as it was mostly just waiting for stuff to open up so you could progress, and “stay out of the bad”. Likewise, the collection minigame – which opened up bits of lore for you to read about – was mostly just tedious and “spot the object lying on the ground” (or, more often, just press A everywhere as you move around to make sure you don’t accidentally run past something).	The game does do its job reasonably well – you do want everyone to live and get back to their families (other than the American, who I never really connected with emotionally, and whose story felt kind of disconnected from the rest of the game), but it is fairly transparent in its tugging of the heartstrings. The flavor of the world is pretty good, though, and the animation throughout the game is decent enough in its simplistic nature, making you feel sorry for a few characters who have unique models only to kill several of them off.	Unfortunately, when the game isn’t at its best, it can be kind of confusing. An aviator named George is introduced for a single part of a single mission, calling in artillery shots, and he seemed to have no real relevance to the rest of the game – why is he named George? What is his significance? It stuck out to me as being very random. Likewise, Baron Von Dorf, the villain that the American spends most of the game pursuing, feels cartoonishly out of place – while his boss battles are okay gameplay wise, they feel very strange in the context of an otherwise realistic game about the horrors of World War I.	Consequently, the game is far from perfect. As a game, it isn’t that great, and as a story, while it can be strong, it can also have sections that just feel kind of there. Overall, the experience was decent enough, and the game isn’t overly long, but there’s not a whole lot of substance – World War I sucked, everyone knows it sucked, and I’m not sure that this game really had a whole lot to add to that message. There is emotional resonance, though, and you do feel sorry for the family torn apart by the war, so it isn’t a total failure in terms of impact – but in the end, I feel like I would have rather watched a movie about the same subject matter.

Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a game that left me wanting - not wanting for more, but wanting after what it could have been. As a fan of story-driven games and the emotional engagement the medium can provide, I was excited for this game. It promised an emotional story of the normal human lives caught up in one of the most horrific tragedies in human history. Also, it is rare to see a game set in the first World War and I wanted to see if Ubisoft could do the period justice. Sadly, this game failed on both of these counts.Valiant Hearts is full of conflicting ideas and design decisions that undermine its message and squander the potential of its setting. The puzzles (the game's core mechanic) are often obtuse and silly, frequently breaking the pacing of the game's storytelling and trivializing the gravitas of the surrounding events. The art direction, while enjoyable in its own right, feels as if it reduces the expressiveness of its characters (who only talk in mumbles instead of real words) and the potential emotional impact of its narrative. As far as the narrative itself goes, the plot acts a WWI sightseeing tour, trying to cram in as many locations and battles as it can while rarely settling on each long enough to give them context or meaning. I quite appreciated that the game goes to great efforts to show the contributions of all the countries and people groups that participated in the war, including some I learned about for the first time. It features characters from many different nationalities, including a German immigrant in what appeared to be an attempt to humanize the German side of the conflict. This becomes instantly undermined, however, when the game chooses to create a cartoonishly evil German villain of ridiculous propportions. When the game could have easily used the conflict itself as an antagonistic force and a means of driving its plot, it instead resorts to cliches and lazy writing, painting the Great War as a battle between good and evil. Despite its many flaws, there were a few things I found enjoyable about the game. Valiant Hearts provides a lot of historical facts and trivia through its collectible system and in-game menus. A lot of this information was interesting and helped contextualize what was happening in the game. There are some rather charming sequences where you are forced drive vehicles while avoiding obstacles in time to classical music. While the game ended well and had a couple of final levels  that were effective at depicting the horrors and tragedy of war, it was largely too little, too late to make up for the rest of the experience.If you're really intent on playing this game, be warned that it requires you to install Uplay. I would also recommend playing with a controller. I started playing on my PC with a keyboard and mouse, but the controls felt somewhat awkward, so I completed the game on my Xbox One (hence my low play time). Valiant Hearts is by no means a terrible game; it's just a game that could have been so much more.			"

But this is a game developed by ubisoft and this software house it's not the best speaking about a lot of stuffs like, plot, endless torture from assassin's creed, bureaucratic stuffs and of course drm (don't forget anno series tho). So here it is how they mock you.You're forced to install uplay platform, copy/paste your serial number inside the new platform and click play here on steam while you've two overlay systems that steal your ram because both platforms are running on the same game. Furthermore, the best is that YOU CAN'T SAVE anything. You'll get a nice message before you start that warns you about the fact that auto save isn't working. So if you want to play this, buy it for console. You'll not regret the choice.			"

												The story of this game is good in the sense that respect well enough the events of the first great war. The art used for representing the conflict is also good. The puzzles are good, intuitive without strange logic and there are some mini games that give variety.  But there are two negative factors: 1) You waste time creating ANOTHER account for ubisoft  system (Though this is a big warning from the store). And of course, is not possible to use AuthID or something to avoid to generate another password. 2) Anne mini games. They are rhythm games.  And frankly, they made me hate this game. I even didn't bother to finish the game. Why I hate the game? Because there is no sense in that mini game. The ""miss"" range is never the same and you are forced to start again the mini game. At the end, there are even ""boss"" mini games as you begin without the chance of errors.  Ok. Maybe, this is only affecting me, there is a reason I don't bother getting games with this mechanic BUT this game didn't put a warning that this type of game would get so much prominence that I'll be stuck until I passed them.

												War doesn't make men mad. Key button combos make men mad.At first, there is enough artistic graphics, story, silent but fun communication, and puzzles.  But then it wears off with find this, find that type of puzzles, which are simple but tedious.  Even for a game of around 8 hrs play time, I just wanted it to end.  The last chapter was dragging on and on, especially with the last two sections.  The fake suspense, repetitive tasks.  And there is this heroic but sentimental thing going on, which is ... French.  Yes it is French.  Only French would have this French way of celebrating themselves.  For the rest of the world- oh well.I guess it is good for a 10 year old boy to learn a bit about war, which the game is informatory with.  But some variety or at least shorter tasks could be more fun.  The first aid parts just killed me.  The guy is battling for his life and I am pushing arrow buttons to help him -punctually.Anyway, it is not bad but not worth much.			"

												This game doesn't know what kind of message it's trying to convey at all. I can in no way recommend this game and I'm honestly both digusted and ashamed that I purchased it. But let me clarify. If this were just a fun little adventure/puzzle game I'd have really truly enjoyed it. The choreographed chase scenes set to classical music, the fun puzzles jumping between characters with the dog is great. I had a wonderful time.That is, until I continually found one of the ""over 100"" collectables that are littered throughout the game. Each one complete with its own factoid about the Great War and the people who lived through it. Just finish an exhilerating chase through occupied France to the tune of (I think) Farandole? Great! Did you know Canadian soldiers plastered urine soaked rags onto their faces to avoid having their insides chemically burned by German gas? I do now!Don't get me wrong, I finished it. I enjoyed every moment of the gameplay. What got me was how little the narrative they were trying to present actually meshed with any of what they presented in any other aspect. Without spoiling anything, Ubisoft has managed to push some of the most atrocious war crimes into a cartoony game with a cartoony feel but slam you with heavy handed messages of reality and rememberance every chance they get. Even the ending is overly dramatic, Spielbergian, heart-string pulling, mess. Even more egregious than the achievements that pop up periodically informing you of your accomplishments throughout one of the most horrific events in human history, Ubisoft decided to hamfistedly pull you into feeling regret and sorrow before rolling the credits over the somber piano score.And then cut back to another primary character, hinting that there WILL be DLC because the game ends before the war actually finishes. So what is this, Ubi? An art game with a message or a cash grab? Is it just coincidence that this came out basically during E3 so it got little attention? What about the fact that this is the 100 year anniversary of the start of the war?The crassness and plain obvious nature of this alone is upsetting. And that's before the dissonant chord struck by the gameplay and hackneyed narrative. Character development is next to nil in a game focused on four potentially strong primary characters and their own arcs really only move forward when you take yourself out of the game, navigate a menu, open their diaries and wrestle the controls to allow you to read them in the correct order. For the record, I'm the kinda guy who likes Louis C.K. and relishes in lowbrow humor. But this? This is distasteful. And shameful. I cannot in recommend Valiant Hearts: The Great War at all. For shame, Ubisoft. For shame.			"

												Awful, AWFUL aquisition. The game itself is probably awesome, mind you, but THANK GOD for Steam Refund. Being published by Ubisoft, this is already up for a bad start since it need you to install that awful uPlay crap, that by itself should grant this a negative review. Then, by some mysterious reason, the game doesn't recognize my controller, or my ♥♥♥♥ing KEYBOARD for that matter, and thus cannot be played. Funny thing is, both those things work fine on the menus, but when the game actualy starts, I can't ♥♥♥♥ing move or do anything else. Since I obviously couldn't play the game so I could review it, I will tell you my experience with this purchase.Let me tell you one thing. Digital games are a commodity. I pay for the comfort, for being able to just download the game, click on it and play the damn thing. If a game that I PAID for doesn't give me this conmfort, then why the ♥♥♥♥ should I pay? But ok, I really wanted to play this awesome looking game, so I was willing to search the web for some way to fix this trainwreck. Turns out it didn't have any. Uninstalled the game, installed again. Nothing. Uninstalled a lot of softwares that some guides recommended and nothing made the game work. Then I contacted the Ubisoft customer support. Then they pulled the old ""I.T. guy"" on me and said only ""did you try uninstalling and installing again?""Well, I tried a refund. It worked.0/10 wouldn't buy any ubicrap again			"

												While each aspect of the game is done well, none of them fit together. It has a beautiful and charming artsyle that fails to convey the horrors of war. It has a story about a group of people caught up in a conflict that none of them wanted, but refuses to devlop these characters or even have them say more than a few mumbled words at a time. Each character has different motivations, but all them play the same puzzle based gameplay. This means that the american out for revenge is just as much of a pacifist as the field medic trying to save her father. The disconnects are too big for me to get over, and the gameplay just isn't satisfying. It's a shame too. There is a lot of good stuff here, but none of it matches up.Except the field medic and the dog, those two work fine.			"

												BUYER BEWARE: Your first experience ""playing"" this game will involve installing 3rd party bloatware/DRM called UPlay.  If at any time the UPlay servers are down, you will be unable to login and unable to play the actual game.  If any anytime you are offline, you will be unable to be logged in to UPlay, and you will be unable to play the game.  Ubisoft sells the email addresses it collects from UPlay account creation.  UPlay has been linked to save file corruption on multiple occasions.  The good news is that there are versions of this game that are available DRM free.  Unfortunately the Steam version is not one of them.  If you are ok with all of the above, by all means proceed with your purchase.  Otherwise, look to enjoy this title elsewhere.			"

												The game not only refused to run but installed a program from Ubisoft that not only has no purpose at this point due to changes within the companies gaming structure, but the act of uninstalling caused my Window 7 PC to crash on multiple occasions. I had to literally go into my registry and delete all pathings related to this program BEFORE I could safely remove it (and the game) for good.  Unfortunately for me, this means this review is not about a game I looked forward to, but rather Ubisoft's inadequacies once again when putting games on this platform. If you are willing to take the risks for a potentially awesome storytelling experience, go right ahead. If however you were worried about it's potential downsides, be aware that significant risks are included with this product. I currently have used the refund tool, and would suggest any would-be ownership to play it within the times listed by Steam and companies as appropriate for the option to do so yourself if given the same situation.

												I wanted to like this; I really did.  It's rare for games (or most other forms of entertainment) to address the period, and how each character's story intersects with the others is interesting.   That a Frenchman by accident of birth on opposite side of the war as his son-in-law, or that said Frenchman at one point teams up with an anonymous German soldier in dire straits so both can escape a series of tunnels, or that when you're controlling a Belgian woman with medical skills you treat both French and Germans with mercy -- impressive. However, frankly, I'm not terribly interested in repetitive arcade-style memorize-the-boss-attack-pattern-and-dodge-repeatedly-until-a-vulnerability-shows games, or rhythm games (which are, essentially, glorified QTEs... and also, in an extremely linear game with relatively few interactable items or characters there's not much excuse for a checkpoint save system, either.  The non-QTE-style puzzles aren't sufficiently challenging or clever to make up for the arcade sequences.Overall, the story lines are neat, but the gameplay doesn't live up to it.			"

												Valiant Hearts is a puzzel game, with a story inspired by World War 1 events.Puzzel elements are pretty average, ranging to needing an item for this thingie toDDR arrow quicktimes,Strentght of the game is it´s story and art style,telling a story of 4 individuals (and a doggy. :3), whose fate is tied together by theevents of the bloody confligts of the First World War.Story is well crafted, giving a good narrative experience aswell memorable characters that felt like actual characters.It may have borrowed some cliche elements from similar types of story, but it works on it´s own merits.Art style, while unique and enjoyable, felt at times rather disjointed from the story and events that we´re happeningduring the gameplay, but works well to complement the story telling and art-style of 1910.Music is lovely, most tracks used are actuall musics from 1900-century and before,but the OST made for this game are well crafted and suitable for the games theme.Gameplay may leave some players left rather bummed out,but the story and collectible tin-bitz of WW1 records easily makes the game an experience that should be tried atleastonce, either yourself or an Let´s Play.5/10			"

 Serious or silly, make up your mind I wanted to like this game, but the much praised story, IMO ended up all over the place, at times it tried to convene the horrors of war and the madness of the period, but far too often there were lapses of silliness (armoured car chase for example) that ruined the whole atmosphere. Now, I guess some might feel, perhaps the developers included, that the subject matter needs some glimpses of humour to lighten the mood, but for me it didn't work.This however, is not my biggest beef with the game, there are three other serious flaws:like some reviewers has pointed out before, the puzzles quickly become tedious (enough allready with the cogs and levers!) and end up as obstacles in the way of the story telling, I realize we as players needs to do  something  in order to ""deserve"" the end, but more variety or better yet, less puzzles, would have been nice.2nd beef; bloody Uplay! Even if you bought and installed the game through Steam, you are still forced to install and use Uplay in order to play the game... totally unnecessary and will probably lead me to avoid Ubisoft games in the future.And lastly, its a very linear game, and offers very little incentive for multiple playthroughs (other than collecting all the ""items"", should you have missed some).TLDR?Well, IMO a rather overrated game, tedious puzzles, a strange mixture of serious and silliness and the story didn't really make any impression on me.Want a shocking WWI story? Watch ""Paths of Glory"" instead.BUT, Steam is either ""blue/red"", some middle ground would be nice, since there are far worse game than this out there, but if I have to choose between the two, I'm ending up on the side of ""not recommended"".

												I'd really, really like to recommend this game. It looks great, the story is engaging, the whole game is a learning experience about the first World War AND a good game at the same time,  something that is very, very rare.Some puzzles are just try&error, where error equals instant death, which is annoying but usually it isn't too bad.But... goddammit, Ubisoft. Why oh why can't you ever release a game that isn't buggy?The characters tend to move very slow but that might be connected to the repeated slowdowns in graphics. Also sound and visuals constantly get desynched, especially in the driving sections. Or the sound just drops completely. It's really disrupting any immersion. A problem that allegedly Child of Light had as well. And that wasn't fixed.Also, Uplay is required. Meh.My recommendation: If you want to experience the story, just watch a Let's Play and if you want the puzzling get this only if the bugs are fixed or on a discount.			"

												This is essentially a zany action arcade puzzle platformer that feels like it's intended to be edutainment for children. Effective, probably, for gently engaging and introducing an infant to the subject and history of WW1. Don't expect anything special if you're getting this for yourself, especially if you're even slightly versed on the subject of the War. In fact, the more of a history buff you are, the less you'll wind up enjoying the game. Good chance you'll hate it. From a mature adult perspective, much of the game is in horrendous taste.As for the content and gameplay, some parts are polished with solid direction, conveyance, and quality control. Other aspects feel unfinished and detract from the overall immersion and narrative. Awkward design choices abound at the worst possible times. None of the puzzles are especially challenging, which is fine, but some come across as cheap or forced and will draw you out of the game at their silliness. Historical wiki snippets, collectibles, and diary entries accessed during core-gamplay are additional distractions that, though well intentioned, kill the immersion. By the end we found ourselves pretty removed from the experience, uninpressed with the predictable Hollywood conclusion, and happy to be done the game with no desire to ever play it again. It didn't deliver even a fraction of the feels one would expect prior to playing it if you've seen the trailer. It's a nice game for giving people a general history lesson about WWI but the cartoonishness extends beyond the visual design and into aspects of the gameplay and plot. Arcade and rhythm action sequences are out of place and non-sensical. From a QA standpoint, it feels unfinished.The music was excellent throughout and the visual style would be appealing if not for the ridiculous, occasionally tasteless action sequences and 'boss' designs.

As far as gameplay is concerned, this is just a glorified puzzle game. It plays more like a visual novel. If you want an emotional story, go for it. If you want to play a game, grab something else.

												是的，你没有看错，我要给这个“公认”的“神作” 一个大大的差评。很多人被这游戏的剧情感动到，不过没有打动到我。故事本身是个好素材，但整体节奏没把握好，如果没有人剧透，我都完全感觉不到这故事到最后会是个大大的悲剧，因为前半段气氛还十分欢乐，以至于我还在慢吞吞的吃着零食看着过场动画回味之前的故事章节时，根本没有料到主人公的最终命运就这么突然来了。最后用那么寥寥几句阐释了战争的残酷疯狂，未免显得草率而又缺失深度。更大的问题是，这是个游戏，不是电影。靠剧情，撑不起游戏的“游戏性”。整个游戏的玩法基本是个2D解密+一些qte，十分复古。这也许可以讨好一批老玩家，却也意味着丝毫没有创新可言。如果说前半段的解谜还算比较有意思的话，那后半段越来越多的qte桥段简直让人抓狂。尤其是最后主人公挖地道躲子弹那段玩得我险些想摔手柄。或许正是这些东西，极大的破坏了看结尾的心情。更让人不爽的是这游戏的手感。是的，即使是这样一个2D游戏，育碧也把手感设计得和刺客信条一样，笨重而又迟缓。大部分场景中的突发事件，你根本无法躲避，因为即使你反应过来了，游戏中的人比你的操作还慢上半拍。这种只能靠背版才能过的游戏，却偏偏用在了重玩价值最差的解谜游戏上，而唯一能驱使你再玩的动力恐怕只是为了收集隐藏物品。不过我是完全没有兴趣再玩一遍了，我宁可继续游戏荒。至于其他需要喷的还有个别场景的空气墙bug以及大多数玩家已经懒得再说的uplay，这里不再多提。值得称道是音乐和美工，但问题是育碧的工作室现在到底是游戏工作室还是艺术工作室？傻傻分不清。总结：不是很推荐，尤其是全价的时候完全不推荐买。要玩解谜可以选择Amanita Design风格的作品，要看剧情可以直接去看《辛德勒名单》之类的电影，要玩QTE，请选择Capcom，要听音乐，请直接下OST。			"

												Alright, I really wanted to like this game. I was even considering a recommendation due to the awesome music and decent graphics. However, after giving it a few chances, I found that it really had nothing more to offer. It's an immature game. Its approach to war is comical and melodramatic. The villain is a walking cliche, complete with an evil laugh. The characters are flat and uninteresting (I felt as though I was controlling a lunky robot). The story is predictable and frankly made me feel nothing. Then, does the gameplay redeem it? No. It's a tedious back and forth, running from point A to point B to deliver an obvious solution to an obvious puzzle. It's like playing an educational children's game. In addition to this. graphically, the puzzles were convoluted, ridiculous, and out of place. Rearranging Goldberg-like pipes to redirect chlorine gas is not exactly being faithful to the content they are portraying. If the puzzles had been taken more seriously, the atmosphere would not have been as weak as it was.This game is trying so hard to show what can happen to ordinary people when a war hits, while simultaneously creating characters that accomplish incredible feats and cheat death countless times. I felt invincible as I played these characters. I didn't even have to kill anyone directly. This game filtered every bit of brutality and turned it into a silly minigame. It had its moments, though. Sometimes, you actually do get to see the human side of ""the enemy,"" but not as much as I would have liked to. Sometimes you do encounter death and destruction, but when you do, it's comical and Hollywood-like. Sometimes you do become immersed in the atmosphere, but these moments are few and far between. TL;DRPros:+great music+decent standalone art+visual cues that facilitate solving puzzlesCons:-melodramatic, empty atmosphere (but SOMETIMES the atmosphere really shines through. There was so much potential.)-poor use of art style-repetitive, unfulfilling gameplay -flat, cliche characters -does not take war seriously (though it claims to)-there are no feels. None.For alternate recommendations, I point you towards Child of Light, another game from Ubisoft, but with an incredible atmosphere, likeable characters, godly art, and awesome gameplay.  "

												This game is not bad. However, it is kind of overrated. The storyline is built on WWI, narrating from the perspective of different people involved in this traumatic war. It offers extensive knowledge through ""historical facts"" and collectable items, which is pretty good. So it is kind of moving and informative. However, it is not so good as a puzzle game. The puzzles contain lots of repetitive solvings and basically do not require thinking. And they are poorly related to storyline. Sometimes you just feel that you really want to skip the puzzles and look at the story. Hope this comment offers you some useful information if you are considering buying it.			"

												I hear a lot about WWII and the horrors associated with it, but we don't hear as much about the first WW.The story is fairly touching, and helps to highlight the brutality and cost of war. However, much of the message, as well as the game overall, is held back by inane game design and some situations that are there just to have some of the most contrived excuses to jam in a game.The worst example I can think of is being conscripted by the German army, but you need to get your helmet, uniform, and equipment from the local army encampment. Only they won't actually give them to you. The soldiers and officers seem to do their utmost effort to prevent you from getting what they're demanding from you at the same time before they can send you to war. You're forced to do some bizzarre puzzle to figure out the combination to a door-safe to grab what you actually need.If anything, Valiant Hearts is a good example of a game actually getting in the way of it really being great. Not because having a game is a bad idea, but just because it was so poorly executed.			"

												I'm sorry, but the warped historical bias of this game is rediculous. To those who utterly lack any regard for historical accuracy, this game is passible enough. Im so utterly sick of media making the Germans into cartoonishly villanous metaphors.Firstly, Germany declared war only when Russia refused to stop mobilization. Secondly, Germany only attacked France because France passively mentioned it would probably invade Germany later in the war should it prove profitable. If it wasnt for that, the Germans would have never set foot in Belgium to get to Paris. Germany only acted in defense of Austria from the getgo. FURTHERMORE, it was FRANCE that FIRST used gas warfare in 1914. And THEN they twisted the knife after the war was over with the completely irresponsible Treaty of Versailles, which firmly created the perfect environ for the rise of fascism. France had acted like this ever since the very conception of Germany as a nation because its mere presence upset their monopoly on mainland supremacy. Basically the French were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and they were always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Please learn some frikkan history and stop humping flags that you were taught to hump for no other reason than tradition./End rant.

												The first world war is not a subject that can be simplified and turned into a cartoon, and that is exactly what happened here. All the characters are caricatures, the story just seems... off and the entire thing simply is in bad taste. It might seem majestic, and it might seem hard-hitting, but when the people I was supposed to care about made me laugh I completely lost touch.I am always a big advocate of accuracy when depicting events of this magnitude, this is simply a shame			"

												This is a stroll through the history of World War 1, and clearly more aimed at the younger generation. It may very well be an emotional story and the history itself of some interest, information already readily found all over the net. The actual gameplay itself is what I found very pedestrian, and somewhat boring. Normally I'd give a game a bit of a chance, but it still wasn't bringing me into it. Basic puzzles with limited interaction options leads me to believe it's meant for children aged 7 and younger. My son may enjoy it.Does not live up to the endless accolades I've read about this game.			"

												Dodging bombs with a car resembled to Earthworm Jim's struggle to catch puppies with a giant marshmallow. Earthworm Jim was a great game, but it did not try to tell a story about war.I've no doubt they attempted to write a touching story about love, friendship, humanity in dispite of the cruelties of war. Yet it ended up as an inappropriate light-hearted comic with lever puzzles and (easy) arcade. Not a bad game at all, but not what I was expecting either.With the fact in mind that it requires uPlay:  not recommended.			"

Posted: December 14, 2014
												I have to give this game a negative reivew, based on my expectations of what I was getting going into the experience.  My gripes stem from the fact that I found the narrative of the game to be one of its weakest aspects and some facets of the game to be a farcical deviation from the true nature of war, the exploration of which is something that this game advertises and uses to sell itself.  I find the narrative especially disappointing considering the intensity of the hype surrounding this game's narrative from critics and users alike.  First, the fictitious aspects of the narrative that focus on the in-game characters suffer from some of the developer's design choices.  Throughout the game, characters speak in muted volumes and the player isn't really privy to their speech and attitudes first-hand.  This left me feeling like the characters themselves lack personality and are simply cardboard cut-outs onto which the narrator pastes a story.  Nearly all of the character development in this game, something that I thought would be its strong-suit, is handled by the omniscient narrator, rather than the characters themselves. Again, this design choice leaves the characters a little bland, in my opinion. To make the rather bland character development worse, I find it extremely disappointing how much content there is in this game that serves to remove the player from immersion.  The bosses and puzzles in the game are the two of the worst offenders (see comments on silliness below).  However, there are many others and by the time I got to the end of this game I was rather less invested in the story and characters than I thought I would be and I found myself fairly blase about their fate.  What I found most disappointing, however, was how the little bit of drama to be had in the story is ruined by the total silliness of much of the game.  I was led to believe by nearly every article, interview, etc surrounding this game that it would be an honest look at the drama of WWI, the game's cartoonish art notwithstanding.  Instead, the developers seemed to take many opportunities to undermine the seriousness of the subject they're covering.  The shock and drama of families torn apart by war, death, and destruction is completely neutralized by Snidley Whiplash-esque villains, ridiculously out-of-place Rube Goldberg machines/puzzles in the middle of the gaming world, asininely stupid NPC's, main characters as soldiers that run around the front-lines of WWI w/ soup ladles and bare fists rather than rifles or pistols, and a hundred other silly breaks from the reality of the events of WWI.  It isn't the fact that this game isn't 100% true to reality that bothers me; it's the fact that instead of adding to the drama of the story, many parts of the game detract from the drama b/c of their silliness.    All of this is capped by an ending that I won't spoil for anyone reading this, but I will content myself with saying that it is not true to the horror of WWI, as the scenario is presented in the game.  At the last minute, the devs decide to pull their punches even more than in the rest of the game in order to provide a more palatable ending.			"

 I wanted to like this game, but... EDIT: Watching someone else's playthrough on Youtube, I changed my mind about this game.Now, I feel compelled to weigh in on this game and be one of the voices of dissent. Just because I respect where this game is coming from, doesn't mean I'm obligated to say this game is good. TL;DR:  Here's my argument in a nutshell: Yes, the game has good presentation. However, why should I be emotionally invested in the game's characters, when what we know about them as people (i.e. their personality) is about the same as nearly every other soldier in the war? Also, the story just comes off as plot convenience and deus ex machina. The game play can be exciting and tense, but also nonsensical. Anybody reading this who liked this game, calm down! Stop foaming at the mouth. I'm not heartless, I understand what the game was trying to do. I'm not outright condemning this game, it has its positives. Let me start with the synopsis first.Valiant Hearts is a game about World War I, and it follows 4 people (technically 5, but she hardly makes an impact on the story other than a motivation for two other characters) and their intertwining stories. The story follows Emile, father-in-law to Karl, who are both drafted into the war, leaving behind Karl's wife and child. Since Emile is French and Karl is German, they enter the war on opposing sides. Emile wants to find Karl and both he and Karl want to reunite with Emile's daughter and grandson. Emile becomes friends with Freddie, an American who volunteers for the French army for revenge. Lastly, there is Anna, a Belgian studying in Paris, who joins the war as a doctor/nurse and literally collides with Emile and Freddie in a chance encounter. She, like Emile, is looking for someone. They join forces and endure the war together, although they are often separated. Oh, and how could I forget the adorable dog who is of great assistance for the characters throughout the game? Its biggest strength is the presentation: the music always appropriate for the scene, the art style is interesting, the narration and voiceover always keeps the narrative at a consistent pace, the emphasis on putting the story in a detailed historical context. The graphics are pseudo-3D, and comic book-ish, which, in my opinion, gives the setting more character than if it was realistic 3D. The soundtrack is exciting and bombastic, lively and cheerful, somber and solemn, in the right places. It features some famous themes that further contributed to my enjoyment of the game (Night on Bald Mountain FTW). Both add significantly to the story's atomsphere and mood. Its biggest negative, however, is the one thing that it was trying emphasize: the story and characters.""HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT! THAT WAS ITS BIGGEST STRENGTH!"" you might be yelling at me. But think about it: what do we know about the characters? Other than a shallow background, nothing. The diary entries don't add anything that ever other soldier is feeling. The only emotional investment I had in these characters was via the hardships they faced, but all the other soldiers faced similar hardships, so why should I care about the characters' hardships?Take Karl for example: he's a German who married and settled down with a French woman and lived with them and her father on a farm. Ok, what do we know about him as a person other than he's a loving father and husband? ......Sounds pretty generic. What about how he and Marie met, why they fell in love? His relationship with Emile, the father-in-law? Did we really learn anything about his personality?What about Emile? Why does he live on the farm and not the city? What kind of relationship does he have with Marie and Karl? It would have helped if there were full cutscenes with complete voice acting, not the occasional voiceover. More backstory, please.Freddie and Anna had a bit more personality, to the game's credit. She drove a taxi (the whole factoid about the taxis was interesting) to the front, she feels compelled to help any wounded soldier, no matter who it was. While cliche, it's at least commendable. Although, I would like to have known her relationship with the father, the governess.Freddie: I'd say it's interesting that he went overseas to do something that was so frowned upon in America, it was practically illegal: interracial marriage. However, this is the same as Karl: what relationship did Freddie have with his wife?Honestly, the most memorable character in the game is Walt the dog.Nothing much to say about the story other than: I would've accepted it if it was a true story. But it isn't, so the fact that the characters' paths conveniently crossed so many times that the plot came off to me as contrived.The gameplay is basic puzzle solving mixed in with fetch quests, QTE's, stealth sections, vehicle dodging sections, and a couple tank shooter sections. One important game mechanic is precise throwing, where you have to throw various objects in arched trajectory in order to progress. Rudimentary stuff, but it is excusable, since it's clear that the game is emphasizing its story more than anything else. Honestly, some of the game mechanics do make for some tense/exciting moments. The puzzle solving / fetch quests allows for the exploration of the setting and the historical context of the game, including major battles and soldiers' living conditions at the war front. I would recommend taking the occasional break and reading the historical facts and collectibles as they come along. However, this game sometimes defies logic and common sense, and wants you to solve a puzzle in a specific way, though I might see a more sensible way of solving it. In the stealth and dodging sections, there are parts where I had to suspend disbelief at the fact soldiers in some parts of the game couldn't see me, though a real person would have. To name some examples, Emile had control of an artillery shell cannon in one part, but he could have shot down the Baron's blimp instead of the house. Another example: am I supposed to believe Karl knocked down those golden apples, and the soldiers didn't think to look up? Or that he was able to get past a couple of soldiers with a scarecrow? What, they didn't notice that it moved every time they flashed their lights on it?I wanted to like this game, I really wanted to, for its premise and its presentation, but it shot itself in the foot with everything else (story, character, gameplay).

But the gameplay itself is simple and not that fun.Probably most people will try to sell you on the story, but the narrative is heavy-handed from the start. Literally, the first thing that happens is Karl is separated from his baby. Who's Karl and why should I care? Those types of questions are given no thought while instead you're bludgeoned with an emotive score and disheartening imagery.I'd skip this one unless you are really into war trivia but can't be bothered to watch a documentary.

												This is a truly awful game.  It has a good story line. At the end of the journey,however,is inescapable failure. However poignant the story may be there is (at the end ironically) an arcade-like healing push keys on the keyboard stint which is ruinous.It is virtually impossible to complete because of the speed of the pulses. It hearkens to the the days of County Fair shooting ducks to win prizes from a stand. One in five hundred will succeed. One does does not proceed further in this game without completing this rubbish successfully. It ruins what would have been a beautiful game experience. This ""pushing the keys on the keyboard"" has no business being in this game. It is literally impossible to do. There are no saves or bypasses available...believe me I have tried. What was a beautiful game turns into a complete waste of money and time.. What a Shame!			"

												Great game, ruined by Uplay and Ubisoft's developer's stupidity. I should not have to launch a third party application to verify that this game is genuine and allow it to update, as I purchased this game through Steam. Secondly, I should not have to unplug every other prephrial, minus my xbox controller, in order for Uplay to recognize it as the sole gamepad input. I cannot get past the 1st chapter, as there is a point where you need to ""aim"" in order to pass that point, and I am unable to aim as Ubisoft cannot understand device preferences for gamepad control. Otherwise, this is a great game, and I would recommend it to you if you are able to coexist with Uplay, and never get past the first chapter on a gamepad controller. Also, change your save format to local and not to the cloud, as Uplay constatly looses the save data.			"

												For a game which main plot is palced in one of the most documented event of our history (and which has way less controversy behind it) it somehow still required to go complete bullsh to make this plot doable. For my point of view its comlete disrespect to people who participated in that great war to make a game wich pretends to be historicly accurate when its not. It is so bad that i couldn't even finish because i couldn't stand it. Here are examples of my small gameplay time. -German CAVALRY(his uniform) general in command of infantry regiment.-This exact General commands a Zeppelin which being an advanced german technology freely flying in deep of front lines avoiding all French Air forces.-During Game we see how our friends and just countrymans dying in front lines, civilian in bombardments, which still not enought for our protagonists to do smth harder to our foe than knock them off. Because the germans after waking up gonna be different people and wont shoot or wield arterly or machine guns at all, They will just flee home.-And last but not least, Back to historical innacuracy! I know you missed it. You remeber our fella General the Antogonist? So when you finally confort him, the CAVALRY General who basicly was in his Stealth Zepellin during whole conflict did not had neither his Revolver nor his Sabre. Just granades. You wanna know why? Because reasons offcourse. Because the person or people who called themselves a script writers DID NOT CARE about first world war nor you who bought this game.			"

												Do you like puzzle games where the answer is obvious but you have to, say, throw a grenade within a fraction of a millimetre between machine gun bursts to progress? Me neither. Just wasted $5 and half an hour of my life trying to make it past a point which had an obvious solution, with a ridiculously easy yet frustratingly executed requirement.  If youre wondering if i was somehow mistaken in what the solution was, no, i am only 10 minutes into the game, the solution was basically a tutorial.  I now have a headache.			"

												Update: My originial review was rated as ""unhelpful"" so I decided to expound on it in an effort to provide more information to potential purchasers of the game. At its core Valiant Hearts is a side-scrolling action/ adventure/ platforming game that includes some semblance of puzzles to help alleviate the linearity that is intrinsic to its game design. The story, which is the essential anchor of the game, takes place during WWI, and sees the player switching roles between various characters who are affected by the war in one way or another. The gameplay is not derived from shooting mechanics, but rather from following a strict path that mostly avoids combat. My main gripe with the game stems from the fact that it feels more like an interactive story than an actual game. The puzzles that I previously referenced require next to zero thought to compete, and typically revovle around using the only item(s) in the immediate enviorment on the only object(s) that are able to be interacted with. This, coupled with the side-scrolling design, ensures that there is next to zero player agency present in the game. You will walk to the right side of the screen, complete the very simple tasks that are set out for you in glowing neon lights, and progress to the next level. Any challenge derived from the game comes from the timing of certain sequences, which can be unforgiving trial-and-error procedures. In short, Valiant Hearts tells a wonderful story based on historical events, and has a lovely graphical style that I admire very much. It just isn't any fun to play, and I grew bored with it much more quickly than I was initially anticipating. I found Gone Home, for example, much more engrossing, and that title is often disparigingly referred to as a ""walking simulator"". Valiant Hearts is the side-scrolling equivalent of a walking simulator, minus the ambience and sense of mystery that makes titles like Gone Home and Dear Esther worth playing. Would I recommend Valiant Hearts? No, no I would not. Not because it's a bad game, but becuase it bored me to tears with its uneventful and linear gameplay. Plus Uplay. Screw Uplay.			"

												I had a long struggle with myself if I should recommend this game or not, but I came to the conclusion that this review might be helpful for people who are still on the fence. The first and biggest issue I have with this game is Uplay. This small game takes too much time to start because Uplay takes ages to boot up. If I buy the game on Steam, I don't want to be forced to use another DRM software.Also I can't help the fact that this game doesn't feel like an artistic interpretation of World War 1, but much more like a piece of E-rated learning software. Sometimes you see people die, but they never die at your hands. If you throw a grenade at a MG-Nest, the crew flees before it explodes in typical comic fashion. There is no logical reason for this except that this game is aimed at a younger audience to learn about WW1. I don't want to see people shredded to pieces and dying in horrible ways, but this just feels off in a game about a gruesome war like this.The puzzles are also clearly aimed at kids (for example manufacturing certain sheets of metal out of 3 combined geometric figures). They tend to be too easy due to the lack of an inventory and the ""dumbed down"" difficulty because of this. The hint function kicks in way too early but luckily you can ignore it. I needed it a single time in the game and felt stupid afterwards because the solution was in plain sight and I just missed it. Still, puzzles sometimes really were rewarding and enjoyable and they actually got the pace right.Everything apart from the puzzles feels like a minigame. There are assaults over no-man's-land which are basically timed puzzles and driving sequences. Too often there are unpredictable moments which you CAN NOT avoid on the first try. The most frustrating moment I remember is the boss fight on a snowy road against some sort of tank. It had an attack which could onehit the player and was impossible to predict unless you learned it by heart. Luckily this only accounted for ~2 minutes (because of my constant failing more like 10) of gameplay. The story is not that great, at times predictable and sure as hell not emotional. The artstyle is actually beautiful which ironically doesn't fit the atmosphere at all.  Make no mistake, I actually enjoyed the game for what it is. There is plenty of actually interesting trivia that you probably never learned in school even if the subject interests you. If you want to learn more about WW1 in an entertaining and lighthearted way, then you can buy and enjoy this game, but if you were looking for a mature game set in this timeperiod like me, then you have to look further because Valiant Hearts is not for you.

												I would NOT recommend this game!  The previews promised a unique, emotional game.  Instead I got arbitrary, confusing controls, uninspired repetitive ""gameplay"" that often resulted in my characters' death - requiring me to try again from the beginning of the puzzle.  Made even more frustrating by the character's slow ""running"" motion.  All this takes away ANY game atmosphere I was hoping for.  Extremely disappointing.			"

												First things first, before you buy this game know that it doesn't run on Steam. It uses the Uplay program which to me is a negative. When I buy something on Steam, I would like it to be compatable with Steam and not use another program, which I am forced to download (Not counting MMO Launchers, etc.). This game is about several characters, who must survive the tripulations of the Great War (WW1) and to do so, must solve different puzzles to advance through each stage. Each stage is also filled with facts about the Great War and little knick-nacks to find throughout the stages. There is also a section of brief diaries that you unlock throughout the game, but give no great insight into the game. The story is predictable and has the same Hollywood Ending that you would come to expect. The characters are archtypes, with little influence on how they are unique. They are standard good-guys & gals in any video game sense and carry the same archtypes as you would think of their character models. The puzzles are less than challenging, even without the hintbook which the game offers, you simply need to run around the stage for a few minutes to figure out the simple puzzles. The hardest part of the game comes with digging, not to spoil a part of the game, but it is infuriating rather than challenging. There are some sequences where timing is of the essence, but all that requires is a good eye on what is happening, with the objective plainly in sight. The artwork is pleasant to look at, with the preference to the details of the enviroment and to the sounds that you can hear in the story. It has a cute and tone heavy artstyle, but little deviance from a PG-13 flick (Ex: You are in a trench, there will be no organs , just dead bodies around and lots of mud). Characters also speak four different languages: English, French, German and Canine. Overall, this game is something that you can play if you have some spare money and a bit of free time in your hand. Do not expect it to be the next great game on your list however and it is certainly not worth the 14.99$ tag on it's packaging. If you do wish to buy it, I would wait for a sale on the game. It will keep you going for awhile, but not with a great excitement of any sort.			"

I'm surprised people even shed tears at the story. Well it's about wars, of course people would die. Honestly I don't feel anything at the end because the plot is too predictable. This game has far more cons than pros so I wouldn't recommend it.Pros+ Helps you learn about WW1 with small factoids.+ Lots of puzzles and collectibles, if you like those things.Cons- Puzzles are heavily recycled. They are just more of the same over and over. 6 hours of the game seem like forever.- The game punishes you repeatedly for not knowing what'll happen next, especially the dodging parts. And since there's no health bar, almost everything in this game is one hit kill. You'll find yourself dying and repeating more times than you can count. - Graphics are pretty bad. I understand it's a 2D cartoonish style. But I've seen many games with the same art style did a better job than this game.- Story is bland and indistinguishable from any other literature in war genre. - Last but not least, Uplay. "

												I have to be honest on this one... Valiant Hearts was not what I thought it was going to be, and not in a good way. Critics seemed to make this game out to be some dark, emotional, and deep experience, when it is far from it. Being a history buff, I was very excited about this game and looking forward to what I heard from critics and the gaming community. Instead, I was dissapointed heavily.Yes, the game mechanics are simplistic, but that's not what I have a problem with. If the story was as great as people said and what I was hoping for, it wouldn't have been a problem at all. Instead, the game is literally like an oversimplistic comic book for ten year olds. Imagine watching a movie like Saving Private Ryan where the main characters are chasing a bad guy who embodies every stereotype of a comic book villain. That's what you do in this game. The characters freely traverse the German/French front throughout the war, doing whatever they want, even though the majority are conscripted soldiers, and chase a literal comic book villain who flys around on a zeppelin that resembles something from a steampunk mag. It's not deep, it's not emotional, and it's not a realistic potrayal of war. It's childish.This game had SO much potential, and it was wasted. Utterly wasted. The only interesting thing I could take away from it was all the interesting historical facts that are peppered throughout, and the collectible items you can acquire that give some background on every day soldier life in the time period.If you're looking for a comic book from the 80's where a motley crew chases down an ultra bad guy with all the attached tropes and sterotypes that you could imagine, this one's for you.

												The developers tried to make a game here, that jerks a few tears with some simple piano melodies and a storyline that revolves around friendships across enemy lines, all of us being human and so on. But as soon as you start playing, you get a boatload cartoonish ridiculousness, as you run around repeatedly distracting soldiers with thrown wine bottles and knocking them out while they ponder over that smashed bottle on the wall. On top of that you get lots and lots of stereotypes. (Every german has blonde hair and chugs beers, one of them inexplicably runs around with WWII Totenkopfkompanie Insignias. France is filled with wine bottles and everybody you meet has the same stupid little mustache.) On top of all that the developers somehow managed to write an american soldier into the storyline, who fights in the war from the beginning and cleans out entire battlefields with his mighty fists and a never ending supply of ♥♥♥♥ing winebottles.(For the record, America did fight in WWI, but they only joined in after about 2.5 years. I guess the developers couldn't wait until then to have an american badass show us europeans how to beat up the Krauts.)This game pretends to give a serious take on WWI, just to bombard you with silliness at every opportunity. I like silly things and as a german, I am a huge fan of Castle Wolfenstein, with all of its ridiculous over-the-top action, villains, weapons, racism and general macho behavior. Castle Wolfenstein however, does not pretend to give a serious take on actual german history and does not force you to listen to the same simplistic depressing piano soundtrack over and over again.Conclusion:If you are just a little bit stupid, american, devoutely patriotic, think that Europe is a country and are looking for an emotionally challenging but in no other way challenging game, I do recommend this masterpiece. For everybody else, I believe you will be better off reading a book, learning an instrument, playing something else or just repeatedly banging your head against the wall.			"

The glich is that some of the rockets are not appeering(the music says they should be there) and the tank door is not opening. I really have been enjoying this game and really wish to continue playing it, but since this is a horrific game breaking bug I must rate poorly on this game. If anyone knows what I can do to make the game work again please message me on steam.			"

												It's got a solid presentation and a cool art style but the gameplay is just boring. It's a puzzle game where you can almost always figure out the answer at almost a glance but you'll have to spend the next minute or so running back and forth to move all the pieces into position. The game also loves to reward you by allowing you to pause the game and read a paragraph on war facts; no seriously it does this constantly. While you aren't ever forced to read anything the little notification that pops up each time you unlock a new bit of information is a constant nuisance. In all honesty with the cutesy aesthetic and ridiculous determination of the main character to always run into battle unarmed and their straight up refusal to acknowledge any kind of gun exists, this game ends up feeling like an educational game for kids despite it's subject matter.

												I did not enjoy my time with ""Uplay Failed Login Simulator.""  Although I do agree ""that which does not kill us makes us stronger,"" I fear I may have lost just a tiny bit of the remnants of my soul in this process.I downloaded the game and clicked ""play"" like all of my other games through steam, but I was unable to log in to the Uplay service.  It told me to try again later, so I did, dutifully obeying my digital master....for 45 minutes until my account was banned for too many retries.  Undeterred, I followed the next instructions, and I called Ubisoft support.  The nice gentlemen there informed me that Uplay installed via Steam does not work, so we went through the process of uninstalling Uplay and installing it from their website.  He helpfully entered my date of birth since he said that sometimes missing information can cause the service to not work properly (?).  I hope to receive a small token of appreciation on my birthday now that they know.  I regret not asking the kind voice on the other end of the phone his birthday so I could reciprocate.Excited at the prospect of finally playing...whatever the name of this game is, I forget after the baffling selection of hold muzak, I attempted to log in again....aaaaand I was still banned.  ""Fear not!"" I told myself, ""I am already on the phone with Ubisoft support, and this will be rectified quickly!""  ""Alas,"" the voice on the phone said, ""we are unable to override the ban.  Please try again in an hour.""As I sat at my desk, emotionally drained after 90 minutes of ""Uplay Failed Login Simulator,"" I felt I should...nay, I MUST tell this moving story to the rest of the world.  You owe it to yourself to feel the heartache of loss, the visceral pain, and the longing for a simpler time long past that this experience can give you.  I can only hope that you grow in this experience as much as I have, and you can pass the lessons of this great time of suffering on to your children and grandchildren.Good luck, and may God have mercy on your soul.Experience: 10/10 - It changed my lifeSound: 2/10 - The ""phone"" portion of the game was only mono...please fixGraphics: 9/10 - I swear I could feel the handset in my handAge Rating - PG13...there was no blood, and only a little nudity, but I wouldn't reccomend this level of emotional turmoil to the unprepared and/or uninitiated "

												Valiant Hearts is an interesting puzzle game set against the backdrop of both sides in the First World War. While the concept is interesting and much history is provided regarding conditions, events, details and people in WW1; the game is sadly weighed down by its own gameplay.Most of the cutscenes are not skippable, which would not be a problem except for Valiant Heart's various flaws and bugs due to the 'scripted' actions available with certain items. Solving puzzles in the 'wrong' order or picking up items at the wrong time requires that the player quit out of a level and lose all progress, in addition there are several moments in the game where re-usable/infinite amounts of items can actually cause problems for the game which once again results in 'road-blocks' to gameplay.There are also small scrolling driving segments in the game set to various classical music pieces - These parts in particular stand out for their pacing and utter charm, requiring players to dodge obstacles in rhythm with the music. Overall this would be my biggest 'highlight' of the game.In terms of replay value, you only have collectibles, and not the most interesting ones at that - Again, unless you are a fan of or take great interest in the events of WW1.Overall I wouldn't recommend this game unless you can overlook the flawed gameplay and follow the charming visuals and relatively interesting story.

												It's painful to see so much contradiction in a single videogame. There is absolutely no reason to shove in blunt satire, fun gameplay elements and comedic scenes (sic) if you want to speak about the realities of war. So ""Valiant Hearts: The Great War"" is the perfect example of indie game that doesn't meant to be developed under the hood of bellied publisher, at least nowadays.P.S. This is my first and the last negative review, just couldn't resist it.			"

												Now I tried to play this game and at first I liked it somewhat. It had nice narrative and some of the puzles were fun. But over time it began to grow old. The puzzles are nice and somewhat clever at times, though once you finish a puzzle you are going to see it again multiple times almost 100% of the time. Towards the end of the game the puzzles begin to get replaced by some very annoying and boring running sections where  you need to run and avoid falling bombs or take cover when German machine gunners pop out. That is another thing, the only weapons I saw the enemies(both Germans and others) use were machine guns and bombs, or in the case of ""Villan Von Evil""- im sorry Baron von Dorf, giant steampunk blimbs and tanks. There was one point when you needed to dodge grenades and grab the one unprimed and toss it back into Dorf's bimb engines, but that was rahter bland.The characters are also quite bland even if they are based on real people. You have the morally right grandfather who wants to go back to his daughter and grandson, Emile. The big American who wants revenge on Dorf for something that I have forgoten due to reduncancy to plot, Freddie. the nice medic girl who wants to save her father from Dorf's clutches, Anna, and the nice German boy who is the son in law of Emile, Kurt. Freddie's and Anna's stories could be left behind, and Kurts was nice but bland. Emilie's was interesting for most of the game but began to drag on as it never really tried anything special. There was a point in the game, somewhere before mid point I think, where hey showed a cutscene whihc if you pay attention to, you can alrady tell how the ""story""(I would rather not call it a game) will end.I hate to use this word so often, but the graphics are also very bland. I figure it was meant that way to stimulate the desparity of the trenches(which you are in for about maybe 45 minutes max if you dont get stuck on every puzzle), but even with that it is still too bland. Watching the game's graphics makes me feel bored and I want to stop playing the game, I had to force myself to get through most of the game.As for the story itself, I feel it would be removed entirly and nothing would change. You could even remove the chracters and replace them with soldier A,B and C and Medic A and nothing would change. I didn't really begin to care, much less like any of the characters at all. The game might have been better if they removed all but one of the characters, that way you could have less characters to not care about. There were a few scenes that were suppose to be sad, but I didn't really feel that at all. It left like seeing those ""cute"" cat images on the internet, the game was scream ""HEY LOOK! IM SAD AND DEPRESSING! CRY AT ME!"" so hard that it made me sick.The narrative was nice, though it rarly ever came in to tell me what was really going on. The story teller would jump in, explain what everyone is trying to do and then never reappear until the next chapter(4 chapters in total).As another reviewer here stated, the puzzles feel out of place, and frankly kinda disrespectful towards the war and the victims of it. The game feels like an action adventure game with the battlefields as a backdrop. It tries, but never really manages to show how grand and horrific a war it was.Let's not even mention U-Play...			"

Don't you find it mildly unengaging that the only thing tying together the plot is a mysterious baron in a freaking zeppelin, who just so happens to kidnap the exact people whom our main characters are after? Don't you find the conveniently teleporting dog, the extremely easy action-puzzles with next to no connection the the main plot combined with poorly planned-out music to be SOMEWHAT unengaging? (That random ride with Anna was simply so convenient and with lack of any proper theme that I was about to curl up in a ball of cringe. The bombs drop in beat with the music? Really? What is this, guitar hero 10?)The story sucks. The art is meh. The theme is wasted by being incredibly silly and incosistent. And no, it's not unique haven't you seen the bazzilion war-games and stories out there? The puzzles are way too easy and spans way too much of our time compared to the storyline, and, generally barely connects to the storyline. ""Did you know the Germans used gas? Well, they did, so we're now using it as an excuse for some puzzles. See you in 20 minutes!""			"

He going to war to find Karl, who is married Emiles daughter. In the end Emile will be executed for attacking his own officer, and Ubisoft even making fun of this heartbreaking moment.Everything is so fake and lie. ♥♥♥♥ing big company making money from this stupid kids, who dont know what war is this and a good game.0/10			"

The ww1 history snippets as you play are a nice touch, though few would read them unless interested in modern history.That gameplay though.

												Having launcher issues (as are many others) due to a problem launching it via uplay from steam (have other uplay titles that do work ok). Reported to Ubisoft via their website. Unfortunately the steam forum button redirects back to the store page at this time so those with problems cant post on here about it - they have been relegated to using the steam help and tips section instead so most cries for help are going unheard. UPDATE: game now has a forum but tbh its pretty quiet for a recent launch.This is a prime example of additional DRM providing no benefit to the customer at all. This review is subject to change based on if Ubisoft fix this error or not.UPDATE: Now a couple of weeks since this released, Ubisoft has still provided no useful support so I have made it clear what I think of them and told them to close the ticket - seriously not worth wasting this much time on a £12 game.I then went to unsubscribe from all the emails they are spamming me with because of my recent use of uplay and find even more incompetence, the login page wants my email, password and 2 words from a captcha window - the irony is that they can't even get this right as every single captcha comes up with one sequence of numbers lol so cant enter the two words required.Seems Ubisoft are trying to work towards EA quality in customer service and marketing...

I've been trying to figure out hwo to deal with getting an answer from ubisoft about reporting the bug, but people are a lot quicker to take your money than to make sure the game actually works.  And STEAM is of course no help either.    The onlser I can come upw ith from a web board is to restart the entire game, but that means blowing all the time into it I have done.Oh, and you'd think if they were going to make a WW1 game in France they would at least do some research about the war.oh yeah, probably half opf the time spent playing was trying to figure out workarounds on the bug.

												I would rather read real accounts of the Great War than play this again. Let's start with the solid criticisms: This game has very simple puzzles all the way through, accomplishing said puzzles requires a high work-thinking ratio (so you're sitting there boredly clicking away after having found the solution a full minute ago), and a poor control interface. In addition, there are game-breaking bugs whose soutions include reducing the window size and actions that won't finish until they've reached an arbitrary threshold (that guy you dragged out from the rubble: is he a full foot away? No? Still buried then).That said, I still played through because this was engaging as all hell. The main characters, Emille especially, are vivid and realistic. The wartime history was fascinating, and I learned a lot because I wanted to, not because I had to know something to pass a level. But while the game starts (and ends) with a willingness to confront the gruesome realities of war, the rest of the plot is full of writing gimmicks so bad it makes this feel like alt-history, instead of a stylized (but accurate) rendition of the Great War. There is a ""Big Bad"" whom the characters all havea  grudge against, and who takes personal interest in destroying our heroes. Pacing is wrecked by long puzzles, and the bloodshed is very rare. Overall, an engaging ""band of strangers"" story of WWI is beaten over the head with puzzles, forced into a ""Good vs Evil"" mold, and maintains a love-hate relationship with the horror it's trying to express. I'm left with the feeling this was a scrapped educational game that someone tried to fix. "

												Uses uplay, don't buy.I am still locked out of another game I own from steam on uplay after a year, ubisoft and uplay are useless.The game itself is reasonably original as a whole. But all the gameplay is lacklustre, the treatment of content rather trite and pretty intent on glossing over the horrors of war at every turn with its comic art style. The story comes off formulaic. It was reasonably enjoyable to play, mildly educational, with a shallow level of emotional engagement.Ultimately this is a Ubisoft cash-in on the 100 year anniversary and they deserve absolutely no money.

You don't get to play as george in the game, and it feels like he was cut out since there is only one mention of him in the entire game and was featured in previous trailers. Was disapointed. Other than that, it had a somewhat decent soundtrack. The best song was George's theme, which again, is not in the game, and is instead on youtube. I also don't like how the germans are once again the bad guys. ugh. Guess that's what we get from a french studio.without the disapointments of false advertising, 8/10.

												Beautiful game and story. SPOILERS.Great artwork, puzzles and historical information. I love me some war history.It cut my heart from what happened in chapter 4. Shows what war does to men. Emile's comrade that wears glasses what getting aftershock when all of the French men were getting gunned down by the machine gun and refused to step out and Emile's anger from the war killing the officer that was threatning death for not fighting. Absolutely impactful.The final scene  where Emile getting executed was just cutthroat. I thought this game would end by teaming up with Freddie and Karl and putting an end to this war, but I was wrong. I was amazed on how this game closed its curtains. To be honest I was looking for alternative endings.Stop complaining about UPlay. It's not bad. When you're done playing Valiant Hearts just stop the UPlay program on the bottom right.			"

Be it a fun puzzle section where you enlist the help of the faithful dog Walt, or take cover behind the bodies of your comrades to avoid the hell of machine gun fire.  Valiant Hearts gets to you.

												Valiant Hearts gameplay is almost entirely puzzle solving with some reflex and timing challenges thrown in and it does those things well.  However gameplay is not why you should get this game, the true value of Valiant Hearts is in the masterful storytelling and comprehensive history.  While dialogue is barely distinguishable it is hardly necessary with how well the game designers set up each scene and emote with the game characters, the best modern comparison for this is Wall-e.  For the packrat and sharp eyed players the game is filled with collectibles that can be challenge to find and each one provides a mini history lesson.  I would not say Valiant Hearts has challenging gameplay, though finding 100% of the items through out the game is a challenge, but I cannot recommend this game enough.  Ubisoft has taken all of the anger and desperation and stupidity and courage and fear and horror and valor that came out of what was called The Great War.  Simply put Valiant Hearts has some of the best visual storytelling I have seen in a game in years and you are doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing it.			"

												This game is really enjoyable, and you can learn quite a few things along the way (if you wish, the game doesn't force you to read diaries and extra hitorical facts included in it). Would recommend it to anyone, easy to pick up, and then you won't want to put it down.

												Valiant Hearts is  comic-art style adventure game following a small cast of characters and their trials in World War I.  It contains a endearing narrative that is neither naive nor overly melodramatic - the story isn't a ""kid tailored"" story as it deals with separation, trials, loss, with plenty of nail biting or tear jerking moments.  It is a wonderful story that gets the player emotionally involved - something that video games oft fail to do!  The gameplay is side-scrolling in nature and requires a bit of thinking and problem solving but is rarely tedious.  Additionally - if you are thinking of getting this for your kid - keep in mind - It contains plenty of interesting facts of WWI as well as conforming to the historical time line of events/conflicts of the time.  I bought a copy for mine and it sparked several conversations about the story and the history.  I can't recommend it enough.In the end - a great game and experience worth going through.			"

												Let's get the obvious out of the way - this game is infected with Uplay.  It requires a successful login before allowing you to run in offline mode, but connectivity over the last week has been hit and miss.But.  It's a beautiful game, and is a well done reminder of the horrors of war.  The puzzles aren't too taxing, though there are a couple of annoying rhythm based mini-games.Buy it on sale if you can deal with Uplay. "

												I was amazed at how good this game is. At first, I thought that the immersiveness of the game was going to be broken by the continous appearance of the facts icon. On the contrary, those facts improved the game by explaining how bad the living conditions were for the soldiers in the trenches. The story is interesting and very well developed, in a moment I was caring for what happened to the characters the characters without even realizing it.At last, have a tissue at hand when you play my t-shirt is now a mess because I couldn't find one.

It has the same feels like the walking dead games with one of the most depressing ending ever in a game that i play but not like read dead redemption but it is still sad.

(It is a bit tiring seeing the same background faces over and over again but it is understandable why it is like that) It is a very fun game to revisit every now and again. Though not perfect, this game will have you glued to its story and gameplay. I say 8/10 (being critical). Have fun!			"

												The game is mildly educational, with the collectibles being museum-like reminders of what the war was liked for everyone involved. Diaries and information about different aspects of WWI taught me quite a lot, and it's disturbing to think that 100 year old bombs are still at risk to hurt people.This game uses a lot of point-and-click-type puzzles, some of which are very annoying. Some of the puzzles also include waiting, which doesn't feel very satisfying to complete. The story is still quite excellent, though the characters could definitely be a bit more polished. The ending makes it sound like there's going to be a sequel, or a similar game based on WWII, but this game also feels like it could use a bit more polish and time.As of this writing, it's $15 on Steam, which I feel is currently slightly high of a price for a ~6 hour game that has some cheap time extenders to it. I would most definitely recommend this game when it goes on sale for <$10.			"

Instead you have games like COD which has no realistic feel too it (Only the newer CODs are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥.

What with all the ""FUTURE OF WARFARE"" or ""MODERN,EDGY WAAAAAAARRR"", they go for WW1, an important but generally never delved into setting. This game shows people the Great War,based off diary entries, in a stlye that is easy to grasp yet deep and emotional in is own right. Think ""Black Adder Goes Forth"" except every episode is the series finale from a different perspective.Hell, the comic book style graphics ADD to the grim feeling when a character gets a GAME OVER.Oh and theres a rhythm-based driving stage where our heroes are being gunned down by Germans whilst classical music plays.Germans.Shooting at you. TO THE SOUNDTRACK. While I'm only an hour in I feel this game really has potential and shows that Ubisoft,or Ubiart more or less, can well...make art. My only complaint is that if you know what happens during WW1, some vicotries may not be surprising.And the character dialouge is a bit hard to hear and the afermentioned art stlye may be offputting.AND THEN I HAD TO INSTALL UPLAY,WHICH IM FINE WITH BUT ITS LIKE IM INSTALLING ANOTHER VERSION OF STEAM AND JUST TO PLAY ONE GAME! VERDICT:8/10			"

												Exceptionally dissapointing. For a game that had kept me exctied for months through the few things I had seen. From one of my favorite deveolpers and yet was a huge let down. The story for this game that has been called ""deeply moving"" an ""emotional journey"" needs to lose those little lines of hype and give it a more accurate one fun for the whole family. There will be car chases with tanks following you and you trowing tnt and there will be a crazy villian that we made up. The few actually good scenes in the game are so far and in between I found my self being more captated by the characters of the story. Although I will to the games credit say the diaries each character has are exceptionally interesting along with the actual facts about the events that take place. That really made me ask why couldn't they have done more with this! Like for for minimal soilers one of the ending battles was so accurate it gave me chills. But there was way too many of death fakes and things that made the plot not really go towards the respecting the past element they kept saying thoughout the entire game. But if I had to give this a score I think a solid 7 is in order as the gameplay is smooth and entertaining. Just don't expect a ton of accuracy besides the optional facts you can look at. Instead expect a zany adventure story that will only get you maybe once going damn that was good. "

												Being the full, red blooded male that I am *rips off shirt, drinks entire bottle of scotch, punches Ivan Drago in the face*, I rarely go in for the side scroller or the puzzle game, let alone both. I honestly don't know why, but after playing Valiant Hearts: The Great War (or Unknown Soldiers: Memories of the Great War, for those of you who are French speakers) it may be a habit that changes.I have always been fascinated by military history, particularly that of the 20th century, so I suppose it was only a matter of time before the game and I were aquainted.My curiosity was first tickled by the thought of a World War I game that wasn't a giant geopolitical simulator. If you try to find a WWI PC game that is anything other than a geopolitical simulator, you are going to compile a very short list.I was also drawn to the stylisation of the game, despite worrying about whether or not this whimsically (and stunningly) drawn cartoon of a game was going to trivialise something as cataclysmic as the Great War. If anything however, I would say that Valiant Hearts is not only a very good game, but I would say it is almost important that it should be played. That's right. I said that about a video game. Deal with it.The game starts with the outbreak of the First World War, a family is torn apart by the impending conflict; a father joining the Germans, a Grandfather joining the French. After the tearful cutscene (oh, there are a LOT of those) you are placed in the shoes of the French Grandfather Emile, and begin your conscription into the French army. The whole experience is chock full of pomp and that whimsy stuff, everything is bursting with colour and gayety (the French even have their historically accurate bright red trousers!). After a few more cheerful scenes of tomfoolery and mischief, the French finally march into battle against the waiting Germans, the Grandfather Emile carrying the regimental standard as the French advace slowly on the German positions.From the minute the German fire the first shot, you are robbed of that sense of light hearted cheer, as a French officer's body it ripped to shreds by artillery fire. As you charge across the field, avoiding heavy fire, the battered and torn bodies of French soldiers pile up, the colours fade and are replaced by the horrors of war.It's here the traditional puzzle elements really start to kick in and it starts off at a pretty relaxed pace, streadily getting harder over time. The progression is done rather well, with puzzles starting out easily and eventually evolving into real stinkers (for me that is, being a puzzle novice). To break it up there are some skill elements added to the game and skill based levels too, giving this game a nice balance of puzzle and traditional sidescroller, despite being quite reliant on script.The in-game collectables are pretty nifty trinkets from the era, helping flesh out the history of the Great War and greatly compliment the diaries of the characters and the in game encyclopedia. It is fair to say a concerted effort was made to add educational elements to the game, maybe even for kids, which I really appreciate.The style of the game is very reminiscent of the French cartoon film ""Belleville Rendez-vous"" in term of it's athetics and how they are both largely devoid of any form of dialogue. For a game set in one of the bloodiest conflicts of human history, Valiant Hearts is almost completely free from blood and gore. One would think that this would rob from the experience of a game set in the Great War, but trust me, with the direction that has been taken, this does nothing of the sort. I'd go so far as to wager that this jovial little title does more to immerse, shock and horrify the player than most story driven games of a gory persuasion. This direction again, could be seen as an attempt to make Valiant Hearts more accessible to younger kids.The story and characters are just fantastic. Utterly sublime. The story is beautiful and tugs at the heartstrings from start to finish and is told wonderfully throughout the game. The characters are so endearing its stupid. Seriously, it makes me feel bad. Even in short playthroughs of this game I have felt more empathy for 2D cartoon drawings than I have for people I would call close personal friends! And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, if they don't have the cutest damn video game dog in history to help you on your quests. GAAAAAAAH!I haven't seen a better job of storytelling and character development done by any game in the past few years, which when you consider the characters mostly communicate in pictures or by grunting at each other is pretty bloody impressive. It's actually quite clever what has been acheived here. Valiant Hearts perfectly captures the feeling of euphoria felt by many across Europe at the start of World War I. Ordinary people on both sides were genuinely ecstatic that war had broken out and wanted nothing more than to see the other side beaten. Steets were filled with flag waiving crowds, marching bands and troops paraded like toy soldiers while brightly coloured, jongoistic propaganda and recruiting posters covered walls. It must have been difficult not to get caught up in the excitement, only for the reality of war to be more horrifying than anything anyone could have ever perceived. The world's first industrial total war - killing done on an industrial scale, which could not have been more different from the street parties and colourful posters calling for young men to give the enemy a bloody nose.Valiant Hearts DOES this to you. It gets you caught up in that slightly dizzy euphoria and then, without warning, throws you into that man made hell of artillery, trenches, machine guns, tunnels, barbed wire, mud and gas. What makes it so heartwrenching is that the whole world is this happy little comic book, so beautifully drawn, and it is torn apart in front of your eyes, with awful trials and terrible things done to the protagonists you have come to genuinely care about.It is for reasons like these that I believe it is important that people play Valiant Hearts. On the surface it's a reasonably enjoyable puzzler, but underneath that it is so much more. It's a story about finding good in times where humanity is at it's worst. It's a story about love, revenge, friendship, loyalty, courage and a doggy. Most important of all perhaps is that it gives people a taste of the feeling that permeated the world at that time and delivers a moderate wealth of historical facts and information to boot. This game was made with at least some intention of teaching people. If I had to teach young kids about the Great War, this would be my first tool to give to them.Sure the gameplay itself is fairly average, but Valiant Hearts is a fantastic creation, with this unique character, so much so it borders on art. I have never cried at the end of a video game and I still haven't, but I came bloody close with this beauty.Valiant Hearts; charming, enjoyable, whimsical, jovial, thoughtful, joyful, tearful, beautiful, loveable.

												This game has great tonal problems. It should be about horrors of the WWI, yet the main villain is cartoonish, mechanics would fit machinarium, and there are so many inaccuracies. The idea looks good on paper but the creators did not know how to make a game of this. I would even dare to say it is a little insulting to all the soldiers of western front, although I am sure the game makers were intending the exact opposite.			"

												Valiant Hearts is an interesting game. I saw it as a teaching aid for WWI, where you experience the conflict from the perspectives of different characters. In that respect, it has a lot to teach, without asking you to read pages and pages of additional information. The characters themselves were all distinct - each of them contributes different skills. The issue I have with this is that the levels are clearly designed for each character, and you don't get to choose, so they're not really pieces of a puzzle as much as ways to alter the gameplay slightly. This turned out to be ok, though, as it helped prevent the game from becoming stale.The story might not be the best ever, with more than its fair share of deus ex machinas throughout, and some padding here and there, but it was still enjoyable, and emotional. Overall, I think the core of this game is its heart, and using individual stories - which could have been taken from any adventure story ever, to highlight the horror and futility of war.The graphics don't really look any different in motion than you'll see in screenshots, but they were certainly nice enough, and detailed enough, to convey the tone of the game.As far as the gameplay goes, it's strictly linear, with puzzles having one particular solution.  This means that it's very difficult to get stuck (and if you do, there is a hint system) but it also means that there is no room for out of the box thinking.tl;dr - if you have an interest in the setting, or adventure/puzzle games (and want a light gaming snack) this is for you. If you want to go your own way and solve problems in weird and wonderful ways, you're gonna have a bad time.			"

The soundtrack is amazing, the voices are fitting to the characters.			"

												Based on what the game looked like, I figured I'd probably just play it, kill some time and move on. But it was so much more than that.It focuses on the stories of four main individuals during the first World War. Each person has their own story and connection to one another, which is built upon throughout the game. It takes you through their travels and actually also gives very interesting information about the current setting you are in (factual explanations of tactics, battles, real people, etc) if you'd like to look into it. The character development is done in such a way in tandem with the music and art style so that you get very involved with it. You can get a feel for how the characters think and act, and start to feel what they are feeling. You may laugh, get upset, feel victorious, and even burst into tears. You start to feel as if you were part of their adventure all along, and will definitely feel emotions related to what is going on.There are four chapters in total, with each one containing several puzzles and scenarios that you have to piece together and go through to keep going on. Personally, they were a perfect difficulty; not♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, but also not ridiculously hard. Along with this, there are about 100 artifacts / trinkets / antiques that you can find throughout the game as you go to different parts (it's not required, it's just there for a challenge and more interesting information if you'd like it).All in all, this game was definitely one to remember. It shows how war brings out the worst in us, but also sheds light on how it can make us all a little more human.10 / 10 for a truly beautiful game.And yes, it's okay to cry. "

												Valiant Hearts is a beautiful looking and brilliantly put together game!This is tossed around a lot with other 2d games but playing Valiant Hearts is like playing a graphic novel. However, I feel as though this is the first game to fully accomplish this idea. The reason is because others games have the look, but no story, Valiant Hearts accomplishes this idea by having both beautiful 2d art and a great story to follow. This game accomplishes more with story and emotions in the 6 hours I played of it than many movies I've seen.As far as gameplay is concerned, it's done very tastefully. The game has a very serious tone, even though it may not look that way, and the way the game is played is never over the top. It plays like a 2d adventure game, where one person will need something form you before you can get the object you need to press one. There are series of puzzles that you have to figure out to get these items but it always fits within the context of the setting! One example is at a point in the game, you need to get a clothing item from a soldier, but he won't leave it until the barracks showers are running. So as soon as you get the water running again, you can get this peice of clothing. There are also some action oriented parts with shooting middles and throwing dynamite, so those of you out there not wanting to play just a puzzle game, you should be satisfied. One of my favorite parts about the game are the car driving dodging scenes. You are driving and something is chasing you and all the shoots and characters are timed to classical music. Amazing!Keep in mind this is no Call of Duty, Shoot, Kill, Shoot, Kill kind of game. It's more about pacing and solving the problem at hand. Fully recommended!			"

												I expected something simple, as far as side-scrollers go. Another war story, with action and adventure and some shooty bits. IT was on sale at the time, so I expected to get just about enough out of what seemed like a simple title.How little did I know or realize just how much was packed into this game - I put about 6 or so hours into it, and while to some that may seem to short, I would be more than a little surprised if in that time span you do not find yourself wholly captured by the story being told.. There are no gunfights, no akimbo-slo-motion jumps wiping out entire german squads at a time. Instead you wade neck deep through death and destruction desperately trying to survive.That in and of itself - Desperation - bleeds through the game as you play through it. At any given time you feel as if there just isn't enugh time, enough space, to just survive another inch. Watching as your characters move through conflict after conflict surviving by the absolute skin of their teeth sets you on edge the entire time. And yet, at no point do you ever give up hope that they may yet survive through the end, reunited on a farm that somehow might stay untouched during all that destruction.The music is gorgeous and the gameplay is well designed around said music. Chase scenes play along to the cadence of falling bombs and symphony, and struggles are punctuated by soundtracks chosen just perfectly for whatever it is you are dealing with at any given moment. This wonderful blending of game and music leaves an indelible mark - I can still hear the trailing piano notes from the end of the game in my head, and with it the story that was told.It was once said that games are not art - and yet, this game has within it the potential to bring you to tears, to fill you with the same emotions the characters would feel in those very moments - fear, anger, frustration, pain, and relief. I would challenge any who see gaming as something without reason or without soul to play this and walk away feeling as if they have gained nothing.This is worth every penny, even at full retail price. I've enjoyed this more than games easily twice its sticker price.			"

												Ubisoft Montpelier have done something surprising with WW1 in this game -- they made it both a learning experience and a heartfelt story wrapped around a series of interesting challenges in one place. One of the most terrible periods in human history is treated with both respect for those that fought while telling its own story of bravery and heroism.The game is saturated with historical factoids about the ""Great War"" ranging from a brief look at how armies were organized to the muddy misery of trench warfare and the dietary staples of the common soldier out in the field. These are written in easily digestable form so you won't feel as if you're going to be quizzed at the end of the game and often don't pull any punches when it comes to revealing the horrors facing these soldiers day-in and day-out. You can read them at your own pace if you don't want to call them up while treating the wounded or dodging field artillery shells during play, too, and they also feature actual pictures to drawings of artifacts from the period.Story-wise, the game revolves around four different people, each of whom have had their lives turned upside down by the war. Karl, a young man of German descent, is forced to leave his farm and his wife in France when the country decides to deport all German citizens in anticipation of hostilities with Germany. His father-in-law, Emile, is drafted into the French army. Freddie is an American who has joined the French army and is on his own personal quest for revenge. And then there's Anna,  a veterinarian turned field doctor who is also on her own quest to find her father. And even though she isn't a character in the game, Karl's French wife, Marie, from whom he was taken from is also present in the game. All of them also share their experiences via diary entries that you can read at your leisure adding quite a bit to the atmosphere of how their lives all tie in together and the cameraderie that they share as friends and family.The only one that doesn't have his own diary is Walt, a medic doberman dog that eventually befriends the characters and helps the player solve various puzzles in the game from flipping levers to grabbing hard-to-get items. He's a great lifesaver pulling more than his fair share of work with the player's help. And yes, you can pet him, too.As for the actual game, it's a mix of puzzle solving and action sequences such as driving along to a choreographed obstacle course. The story bounces between the characters with puzzles centerd on their specific skills. Emile is great at digging and can tunnel his way on through to other areas when he can. Freddie can cut wire with his pliers and is generally a tough guy with a heart of gold. Anna is often called on to heal the injured by following along in a rhythm-based sequence. Also, don't let the cartoony graphics fool you -- the game doesn't sugar coat the horrors of war such as when Anna is asked to saw someone's arm off in a field hospital and you need to match the sequence to do it. Many of the puzzles often involve finding the right items to get something done, such as convincing soldiers to let you pass on through so that you can get inside a building and find another item that you need.The actual puzzle solving isn't quite as exciting as the story, though, since it can sometimes feel as if you're going through a laundry list of things that you know you need to do anyway, but the presentation and the emotions that the game wants to bring out of you during the course of the game make up for that in spades. The music also provides a great backdrop and most of the characters only speak in brief grunts and ahhs with a few short lines to emphasize certain things, but it all works. The first thing I thought of was that it was kidn of like Scribblenauts only with a few voiced lines.As for the actual length of the game, your mileage may vary, but it tooke me around 8 or so hours to get through. Once it's done, though, there's no reason to go back through unless you've missed a collectable somewhere or just want to experience the story again. Unfortunately, replaying a previous chapter will overwrite the only checkpoint the game uses to track your progress, so be careful about going back.A surprising take on WW1 that no one else has really tried and a genuinely intriguing game. If you're interested in the history, a good story, and don't mind solving a few puzzles along the way, Valiant Hearts manages to merge it all into a remarkable time. Just don't forget the tissues. You might need them.			"

												Honestly, first I was disappointed, because I wasn't able to start the game. Now I've played for about an hour and I can tell, that I will enjoy playing this little game. This is how a game should be - basically the perfect example of a game turned into art. It already has a cute, nice little storyline and I have to say I have been close to crying at such an early point in the game, I can't even imagine how the end will be. I like how the game includes actual historical facts and is basically a nice refreshment of things I have learned at school. I bought the game on sale and it was totally worth it (even after the problems starting the game) and I would definitely repurchase again. I recommend this game for anyone who is interested in history and wants to have a little game to play every once in a while.			"

												a game which brings to light one of the darkest chapters in history. And takes you through a journey with different characters with a narrative that ties them all toghether in these years of madness that is the ""great"" war. Never does it take sides with any of the countries, it doesn't focus on nationality or flag, but the people who are affected by the war. The game is a 2D sidescroller/ puzzle game, interesting but simple puzzles, Not so difficult so you will haft to look up a guide, but more of a satisfying challange. Combined with a beautiful and original style in the art, and a fantastic musical score. If people were to ask me what games i consider to be art, then i would point to this. It tells a story, it's art-style has heart and personality without sacrificing the gameplay and has enough of it to keep it a videogame (In my eyes at least)I give this game my full endorsmentAnd remember. 1914-1918Never forget, and never again			"

The game is very emotional, I loved the background and the art, even more so, during the end of the game where you really get to see the brutality of the war and its consequences. It had a group of nice and interesting characters, all of them in this war for one or another reason and trying to survive. In the end, I guess there was a happy ending and a sad ending, depending on how you see it, but, it was a fantastic ending nevertheless and pretty brave I guess.			"

												As a history buff, I greatly enjoyed this game. It's comic-style artwork captured a different look into one of the most destructive human conflicts in history...and makes it easy to understand the struggles and triumphs of a small group of ordinary people and a dog, fighting a territory war between aging empires.A list of the emotions you may feel throughout your experience, in the order that I experienced them:Happiness...calm...hope...worry...fear...sadness...terror...anger...rage...pessimism...hope...joy...satisfaction...fury...hope...panic...relief...grief...emptiness...and the cycle concludes with happiness again.WWI was, in the eyes of many...myself included, a pointless waste of life. A battle for outdated ideas using tactics and technology that made life a living hell.If you wish to educate yourself about this conflict through the use of puzzles, then I recommend this title. If you do give this title a chance, always remember those that died....those...Valient Hearts.			"

												Spoiler warningThe art and music are both good and create the right ambiant. The decision to have the game start bright and colourful but gradually get darker and more violent as the war progressed was also good.However the game has two main problems:1) Anna's mini-games are difficult and annoying. Button mashing section don't work well in a game that primarily features problem solving.2) While the memorability is good in the non-dramatic sections of this game they completely ruin the drama in other sections. When Karl is trying to escape the French Police and Anna is trying to save Karl it breaks the immersion when the player has to waste time looking for items that have no relevance to the story. It would have been better if in these parts the objects related more to the story. "

												Lovely artwork. Atmospheric music. Good story. The puzzles are logical and enjoyable, thematic and move the story along nicely. The gameplay varies, so you don't get tired of doing the same thing over and over. Puzzles, dodging bombs, car chase scenes (I loved these), hiding behind cover, digging, firing mortars. None of the game mechanics are ground breaking and the gameplay is not very challenging (although there is a veteran mode, which I didn't try). But, the story is enjoyable and the gameplay is integrated brilliantly, with the mechanics causing tension at the right times.Really, this is a game is all about the characters and their story. The main characters are nicely developed and the minor characters stand out too. I like dark stories and this game has some very dark moments, as well as light ones. At times, I wasn't sure how I felt about the sometimes comical treatment of such serious subject matter, but overall, I think they handled the subject matter well and it's clear that they wanted to teach players about this major event in human history, while telling a story and providing a fun adventure game.Time played: 8 hoursRating: 3.5 / 5Reminded me of: Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons & Tiny Thief			"

												This game shows, that Ubisoft is capable of producing not only sequels of prequels of sequels, but can make something new. Valiant Hearts: The Great War presents us a story of a family and their friends separated by the World War I. I can't say this is refreshing storyline in the gaming industry, but plays on emotions and touches from time to time.I also have to admit, that the game looks great - it is not Far Cry 4 or any AAA production, but has its own, unique style. The same could be told about the sounds.Unfortunately, one of the main parts of the gameplay - solving rather easy riddles - is annoying sometimes. As I said - they are easy, but it happened to simply stuck on the puzzle. An example could be throwing a dynamite to a container of some kind, when you have to aim quickly and very precisely. This could be too difficult for the kids and the game could become frustrating for them. It also made me mad a couple of times, when I had to quit the game and then repeat the whole level again. Yes, there are checkpoints, but when you want to leave before the level ends, then you have to be ready for this.However, I've enjoyed every minute of this (sometimes frustrating) game. Valiant Hearts is a nice tribute to all the WW heroes. I strongly recommend it to all those of you having a child in your families. Playing VH could be a great lesson of history to the little ones and could be fun to both of you.			"

												This game is one of those rare gems that is really more of an interactive story. It is beautifully told and has its cheerful, fun and heart-wrenching moments.Its really worth playing, despite UPlay. While I am not a fan of UPlay, I also don't believe that all the reviews claiming that they aren't buying this game because it is on UPlay. I think it is far more likely that a crew of anti-DRM activists go to many games that use UPlay and claim they won't buy them because of it. The fact that this game still have Overwhelmingly Positive reviews despite the anti-UPlay crowd speak to how great it really is.UPlay honestly has no impact on the gameplay. I wish Ubisoft would relax their DRM, but I don't really care very much, because I don't steal games, have a stable internet connection, and don't give my game keys to my friends. I think most people are in the same position.Call me crazy.			"

												Valiant Hearts: Tissues Not IncludedValiant Hearts: The Great War is a game I've been wanting to play the moment I heard when it took place; you see, WWI is often forgotten or skipped over, partly because it didn't involve a great evil threatening the whole world, but it was just as important to the development of the world in the last century, being one of, if not the last honorable wars, whatever you may think that means, either way, WWI involved a lot of new technologies from weapons to vehicles, to chemicals. And so, it is here that our heroes are placed, stuck in a global conflict, but only concerned for those that matter to them - this is not your father's war game.Gameplay: 98/100 A+Valiant Hearts is a straight forward game when it comes to gameplay, essentially a puzzle platformer with simple controls that are easy to learn and are applied masterfully within the world. There are also other gameplay mechanics taken from other games, such as ""Guitar Hero"" style push this button here or there. There really isn't much complaint on this end of things seeing how the gameplay was kept so basic, there wasn't much that could be ruined if it had existed to begin with. Saying that Valiant Hearts has a really solid gameplay almost seems unfair as it doesn't really change or reinvent what has come before, but then again, why fix that which is not broken? Not every new generation needs a reinvention, sometimes you just have to tell a good story - more on that later.Audio: 98/100 A+The soundscape of Valiant Hearts is warming, from the half-gibberish, half-actual words of the characters while playing, the dialog in cut scenes, or the narrator, Valiant Hearts goes by almost like an interactive comic book on WWI history, and that's not to downplay the game at all. The explosions fit the era, the music of the time, noises and ambiances all add to paint a picture of the conflict which raged across Europe in the early 20th century, and while it isn't perfect, it is damn near close, giving major, AAA titles an embarrassing run for their money. Everything is recorded and placed in the game carefully, voices are convincing, and the dog makes me wish I had one.Visuals: 100/100 A+As I stated earlier, Valiant Hearts plays like an interactive comic book detailing a story taking place during WWI, which isn't far off of what the style is, heavy black lines, bright colors and visuals which pair up nicely with the audio, creates a nice aesthetic. In a way, it falls right in line with other games such as The Walking Dead and Borderlands as far as the look goes. But it's not just the style that causes the game to be so appealing, the character design are also a highlight, as the various character's eyes are hidden, there's a different set of emotions and ways of reading the emotions on the characters, yet it still delivers, short and stout men, nimble women, all of it creates a world that is fleshed out on its own, despite being based on actual events in the real world.Content: 98/100 A+In terms of the actual game, one could easily finish it within a single sitting, but the same can be said about Portal. The game's puzzles and boss fights aren't too difficult to figure out, nor do they break the flow of action and drama that the game balances on when switching between the interchanging paths the characters are intertwined in. But unlike other war games, Valiant Hearts does a similar thing as Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna), where there is a historical aspect to the game. As you play along, your journal is updated with information either about your characters or facts about WWI, from trench warfare, technological developments, or how certain battles occurred. It takes the whole factual gameplay to heart, where you can learn something on a topic not many people know about, just like in Never Alone.Story: 100/100 A+And now we arrive at the bulk of why people just seem to love this game - the story. As many of you may know, I'm a big fan of a well made, thought out story, I don't care that it has been told before, I'd pick a good story over an original one most days of the week, and just like with the gameplay, nothing is really being reinvented, but more reiterated, that a character's journey is just as important as the soundtrack or the graphics. Here, we focus on a handful of characters, some torn apart because of the war, a father being forced to fight for the Germans while his father-in-law is forced to fight with the French. That in itself is a tension which can go in so many directions and pulling on a lot of heart strings, but the layers are just added, very carefully, like a layered cake, so that the whole doesn't come crashing down in a colorful mess. Without wanting to spoil anything, Valiant Hearts knows how to get the player worked up, either on the politics of war, family, friendship, and other things, and that should be applauded.Design: 98/100 A+Simplicity is the key here. Controls are simple, ideas aren't very layered, everything is straightforward, and there's not one thing wrong with that. While the controls may seem a little sticky here and there or it may take a few repeats to figure out a puzzle, it is far from game breaking. One thing worth noting is that, despite being a war game set in a war torn Europe, you and your characters never actually shoot anyone. It's always a joy to see a game take a risk on something we as a community have become accustom to. It's not perfect, but it is miles above most. If I did have to gripe about something, it is the fact that this being an Ubisoft game, UPlay has to open on top of Steam, and that's more to do with a problem PC gaming has with multiple platforms, but sometimes you just have to deal with it.Performance: 100/100 A+Smooth like butter over a nice crumpet at brunch. What can I say? The simple design and graphics makes it an appealing game that is easy on just about anything post 2001. Verdict: 99/100 A+Valiant Hearts is a game about people set during an often overlooked conflict, it is a game about trials and challenges, loyalty and friendship, love and family, showing that all of these things are more important than any war. From the music, the artistic direction, the characters, and the story, everything lines up just fine leaving behind a solid and emotion driven experience. Hell, even the UPlay login didn't bother me that much after 3-4 times. It's just good. I don't know what else to say. Just play it.			"

												All the reviews here seem to be giving glowing reports about this game. I wish I could find out for myself. After looking online I find I am not alone in having problems launching this program. I have tried starting it from the desktop shortcut, no joy. I have tried starting it from my Steam account, no joy. I have tried starting it from my Uplay account, no joy either. In each case it gets to ""Press any button to continue"", which I do, and then the program dies. Is that why so many people say they were crying about this game? If I could ever get it to run I might be able to recommend it, but until then it gets a thumbs down.			"

												Absolutely a must have game.  The game play mechanics are simple and the difficulty is equally so.  This will not be a challenge to most people.  That being said, the narrative is fantastic.  Although a relatively short game (5-8 hours) the quality of the plot is worth the $15 price tag.Additional: Before going into this game, I knew very little about World War I, the game expects that.  Valiant Hearts is built in a semi-educational way and has direct links to Wiki pages about the real historical events.  Furthermore, the levels and collectables within the game have facts that are interesting to read.  This is a great mechanic for encouraging natural learning.  I kid you not, I spent more time outside of the game pondering and looking up facts about Vauquois and Ypres (and other events/items) then I did playing the game.  My 8 hours of game play (as of today) does not reflect the true time I spent with this game.  If you are vaguely curious about the Great War, start here.  If you aren't, still play the game.  Brilliant.			"

												Like many others I really wanted to like this game: there's nice music, pretty, cartoonish graphics, information about WWI...I mean what's not to like? Uhmm...the story maybe? This game tries too hard to make you cry, I mean really, really hard, like chopping onions in your face, pulling your fingernails hard and, call me stonehearted, but it fails miserably. It's a tale of four war heroes (victims ?) whose stories intertwine and use up all the cliches in the book from orphaned children to hurting puppies. But even without the cheesy storytelling there's also:- mediocre at best puzzles (with a lot of running to-and-fro because you need object A that exchanges for object B that you get for object C)- the underwhelming level design that basically has you do the same missions three times over with slightly different settings (if I suck at the fist race level, I'm probably not going to improve by the second one 2 hours from now where the sole difference is the colour of the sky)- little to no background on the characters so you don't really get to build a relationship before the game puts them in seemingly impossible situations. (I mean, how am I going to shed a tear for *insert character name here* if all I know about him is that he can walk, run and sometimes change his clothes?)- I'm not one to say no to the ocasional deus-ex-machina, but this game makes a religion out of the technique. You build suspense by getting above mentioned character in said impossible situation that you can't see a way out of. Poof! Out of the blue the skies clear, they're saved and all is well again. By the look of this, you'd be surprised how so many people mananged to die during the WW- if your OCD compels you to collect all the items, you're most likely going to have a bad time what with them being hidden behind bushes and walls (that you obviously can't see behind), and blending so well with the scenery you'll start thinking maybe the game's glitching since you can't pick up more stuff- it's not that I mind having to go through Uplay to launch the game (too much), but does it really have to take 4 minutes on the clock between it registering that I've launched the game and actually launching it?***On the whole, I'd just head for the Wikipaedia page, read up on the WWI and save the money. Or maybe I'd buy if for a kid who's into war and stuff and likes comics and is just starting out in the puzzle solving bussiness. Yeah, maybe I'll do that.			"

												So far I haven't played the whole game through but the parts I have played through so far has been amazing. The characters, the history and the gameplay makes this into being one of the most fun and enjoyable experience of all. I am a person who enjoys compelling story, gameplay and characters and I can say I found all that in this game. I can recommend this for those of you who enjoy a bit of a puzzle gameplay, its not hard or unforgivningly hard but rather just use your eyes and mind and you will advance without a problem. For those of us who love a great story I will recommend this game for you. Besides handling charaters background and history good the setting in The Great War (the war to end all wars) is absolutly splendid. I found myself encrossing in a lot of history from different country during the WW1 and I just can't help but wonder why I never found out about these facts during my school years. I would say for those of you interested in viewing WW1 in a different light you may want to give this game a chance. Overall I'm in enjoying this game immensily and I will continue to play this game as soon as I am given more time in the future.			"

												one of the best and most emotional games I have ever played.it brings the player to the most painful part of a the war instead of droping the player into the battlefield where you have to go around and shooting people.in this game each character is introduced as a human being stuck in a never ending war rather than a taget you shoot and pass without caring that who that person might have been.in conclution the game was absolutly amazing. Ubisoft has done a great job with it exept the problem that it forces you to use Uplay in order to play it.  "

												I've read the reviews, many of which are positive little negativity at all. I followed some instructions to buy the game, play through the end, and cry. I told myself I wouldn't cry, but oh my gwad I surely did.  So many tears, the music was beautiful, the narrator's voice was perfectly set. The historic background made me pick up a damn war history book again, and thus I cried again. ""War makes men mad"" - Emile			"

												Fun game! I was surprised about how this game has an educational undertone to it. I actually learned a lot about World War 1 that I didn't know. Didn't expect that. Pros Nice art styleGood storyActually learns you something about WW1Good soundtrack Cons ShortPuzzles weren't really all that challengingI liked how no words are used during actual gameplay (there's plenty of talking through narration and cutscenes, however your playable characters never actually speak during gameplay) and still every puzzle and assignment feels intuitive and fun. NPC's mumble some french or german, but not in a way that it makes sense. Through speech bubbles with simple images they communicate their message in a clear way, which I really liked. The puzzles weren't really complex (asides from 2 safe lock puzzles where you need to figure out the combinations), but I think that's also because the game isn't out there to challenge you, but to tell you a good story and learn you things about WW1. And I think it did a great job at that!			"

												This is an interesting departure for a major game publisher. It is part game, part meditation on the nature of war. It breaks you out of your everyday, consumer/worker bee mindset for a moment, and reminds you of the full extent of the forms reality can take. The fact that a generation of people had to face this is so easy to forget in modern times.Highly recommend.			"

												So I know that a majority of the reviews are talking about how you will cry. And in all reality, you will. I know I did. But there's more to this game than tears and sadness. There are uplifting moments to mirror the ones that knock you down. Yet still there is more than that.Pros:-Visuals: This game is simply a joy to look at.-Music: Personally this game has one of my top 5 favorite music scores.-Story: Really captivating, I had a hard time not finishing in one play through.-History: I enjoyed the little snipets of history this game provides.Cons:-Freddie needed more of a resolution for me.If you think you might like the style of art in the game, think the music is good, or simply want to feel some emotions, I wouldn't hestitate to make a purchase. You won't have any regrets.			"

												This game is a masterpiece.Unlike most games on WW I, this game tells us a more human side of WW I. An old farmer concripted to fight a war he want no part of. A young man separated from his loved ones just because his nationality, a man seeking for vengeace, a young woman chasing for his kidnapped father and a medic dog that accompany them.The game follows battles fought at the western front. With historical background supplied to the player. There are a lot of emotional moment. Prepare a lot of tissue when playing this game, the story is very touching. In the game we can see that the developers don't like the millitary leadership of that time, represented by ridiculous extreme hyperbole characters.There is a lot of puzzles to solve in this game, the number of collectible items are also ridiculously many! The music is superherb! I can't get tired listening to it!.			"

												So far I haven't played the whole game through but the parts I have played through so far has been amazing. The characters, the history and the gameplay makes this into being one of the most fun and enjoyable experience of all. I am a person who enjoys compelling story, gameplay and characters and I can say I found all that in this game. I can recommend this for those of you who enjoy a bit of a puzzle gameplay, its not hard or unforgivningly hard but rather just use your eyes and mind and you will advance without a problem. For those of us who love a great story I will recommend this game for you. Besides handling charaters background and history good the setting in The Great War (the war to end all wars) is absolutly splendid. I found myself encrossing in a lot of history from different country during the WW1 and I just can't help but wonder why I never found out about these facts during my school years. I would say for those of you interested in viewing WW1 in a different light you may want to give this game a chance. Overall I'm in enjoying this game immensily and I will continue to play this game as soon as I am given more time in the future.			"

It has a great Story, Cool internet and graphics and is also very interesting as some of the in-game found items can tell a bit of the story at the time.

												This game is amazingly good. Good Stuff:  The story is one of the best I have seen in a video game.  The game comes packed with a bunch of historical information (pictures, short articles, etc).   The music makes the game so much more emotional.  The puzzles have a wide variety of difficulty, and if you are stuck, you can choose to get hints. Bad Stuff:    Sometimes the acheivements don't sync, particularly the one where you get all the collectables. This is frustrating if you are trying to get all acheivements.   The game is on uplay, so you get steam cards, but you don't get steam acheivements. This is a bit annoying.  Some have mentioned bugginess, I didn't get any, but it did drop frame rate once or twice. Overall, I would recommend this game. I got it on steam sale for a couple of bucks, and I have put almost 10 hours into it, and still need to finish up some more acheivements. A good buy. Plus, the story might make you cry!			"

												This is one brilliantly written and executed game, that will bring you to tears! In-depth characters as well as overly lovely designed levels with much variety will guarantee you to be sucked into the story. You have to be willing to feel a game to play this one to the full extent.			"

												This game is amazing in every way. For one, they threw in interesting and informative historical facts about WWI as the story progressed, which I found very cool. The story is compelling, the characters feel real, the music is beautiful, and the landscapes and backgrounds look great. Once I started this game I played straight through, I just couldn't stop. And games don't usually get to me emotionally, but by the time this one ended, it was all kinds of dusty in my room.  I found this game to be extremely immersive, and one of the best buys I have made from Steam. I highly recommend it to everyone.			"

												I still haven't finished this game, and it is by far one of the best I have played in years. The art throughout is beautifully charming and impactful, and the music is sublime. There was no point in the game I felt was pedantic or repetitive, as the puzzles were each a creative, unique challenge that was not overly difficult or frustrating.My only problem with this game is IT WON'T LET ME SAVE. Immediately upon downloading, it seemed to permanently break, and now it won't create new save data. I have to start a new game every time. This seems to be a fairly frequent problem, but with no known solution.Either way, this game is wonderful.Addendum: Played through in one take on 12/6/15. I'm crying so hard right now. The feels are intense.			"

												For all you people whining about having to install UPlay:Get over it. Even I almost passed this because of UPlay, but...This game, this game right here is above and beyond worth the price and installation of UPlay.The game has well-mixed elements of humour, seriousness, and the ability to break your heart in an instant. In the story you'll see the true nature of war and how many casualties there are that weren't meant to happen.You'll also see the nature of humans, because each element in this story shows an extremely blatant description of how people who have power and greed are. You'll love this game to the very end.I sure know I did.			"

												Valiant Hearts is a puzzle game at its heart.  I usually do not enjoy games steeped with puzzles but the puzzles in this game were very unique.  The narration and story was excellent and gave way to some interesting gameplay.The best part of Valiant Hearts however is the art style.  This game is gorgeous to look at.  I found myself admiring it every step of the way.  I definetly would recommened this game.  PS: If you have a xbone it is free on there with the Games With Gold program.			"

												Ok so here we have a Ubisoft game that makes you put up with all of the UPlay crap and even has a couple of bugs, it's also 2D and it's a WW1 game where you actually don't shoot anyone..... And it's a masterpiece. This game is stunning, the art work, the musical score and the historical signifigance is unrivalled in video games as a whole. This game makes you care for the characters at a deeper level than you ever have before. It's also impartial and doesn't portay the Germans as ""bad guys"" and makes you understad the helpnessness of the situation.Throughout the game you have a dog as your companion and just like real life you form a bond with him very quickly. This game also doesn't outstay its welcome, taking about 7 hours to complete. It left me breathless and I absolutely love it!I have 1 major gripe, in the sections where you dig you must have the contols set to W A S D instead of the arrows or you can't progress. That aside the game is brilliant.			"

												After just having watched the Blue-Ray remaster of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (which is excellent!) I wanted to see if this game fit into the same mold.  It does and it's fantastic.  It's really a simple puzzle game on the surface, but not a bunch of dumb stuff games like this usually have you do, but interesting puzzles to keep you motivated to move foward.  I also liked finding the collectables and reading the stories behind them.  Along the way I was learning about WWI and learned a little more about what these people where up against almost 100 years ago.  Loved having the dog as you companion!  And yes, I really got choked up at the ending.....  Very recommended!!!			"

												Being the full, red blooded male that I am *rips off shirt, drinks entire bottle of scotch, punches Ivan Drago in the face*, I rarely go in for the side scroller or the puzzle game, let alone both. I honestly don't know why, but after playing Valiant Hearts: The Great War (or Unknown Soldiers: Memories of the Great War, for those of you who are French speakers) it may be a habit that changes.I have always been fascinated by military history, particularly that of the 20th century, so I suppose it was only a matter of time before the game and I were aquainted.My curiosity was first tickled by the thought of a World War I game that wasn't a giant geopolitical simulator. If you try to find a WWI PC game that is anything other than a geopolitical simulator, you are going to compile a very short list.I was also drawn to the stylisation of the game, despite worrying about whether or not this whimsically (and stunningly) drawn cartoon of a game was going to trivialise something as cataclysmic as the Great War. If anything however, I would say that Valiant Hearts is not only a very good game, but I would say it is almost important that it should be played. That's right. I said that about a video game. Deal with it.The game starts with the outbreak of the First World War, a family is torn apart by the impending conflict; a father joining the Germans, a Grandfather joining the French. After the tearful cutscene (oh, there are a LOT of those) you are placed in the shoes of the French Grandfather Emile, and begin your conscription into the French army. The whole experience is chock full of pomp and that whimsy stuff, everything is bursting with colour and gayety (the French even have their historically accurate bright red trousers!). After a few more cheerful scenes of tomfoolery and mischief, the French finally march into battle against the waiting Germans, the Grandfather Emile carrying the regimental standard as the French advace slowly on the German positions.From the minute the German fire the first shot, you are robbed of that sense of light hearted cheer, as a French officer's body it ripped to shreds by artillery fire. As you charge across the field, avoiding heavy fire, the battered and torn bodies of French soldiers pile up, the colours fade and are replaced by the horrors of war.It's here the traditional puzzle elements really start to kick in and it starts off at a pretty relaxed pace, streadily getting harder over time. The progression is done rather well, with puzzles starting out easily and eventually evolving into real stinkers (for me that is, being a puzzle novice). To break it up there are some skill elements added to the game and skill based levels too, giving this game a nice balance of puzzle and traditional sidescroller, despite being quite reliant on script.The in-game collectables are pretty nifty trinkets from the era, helping flesh out the history of the Great War and greatly compliment the diaries of the characters and the in game encyclopedia. It is fair to say a concerted effort was made to add educational elements to the game, maybe even for kids, which I really appreciate.The style of the game is very reminiscent of the French cartoon film ""Belleville Rendez-vous"" in term of it's athetics and how they are both largely devoid of any form of dialogue. For a game set in one of the bloodiest conflicts of human history, Valiant Hearts is almost completely free from blood and gore. One would think that this would rob from the experience of a game set in the Great War, but trust me, with the direction that has been taken, this does nothing of the sort. I'd go so far as to wager that this jovial little title does more to immerse, shock and horrify the player than most story driven games of a gory persuasion. This direction again, could be seen as an attempt to make Valiant Hearts more accessible to younger kids.The story and characters are just fantastic. Utterly sublime. The story is beautiful and tugs at the heartstrings from start to finish and is told wonderfully throughout the game. The characters are so endearing its stupid. Seriously, it makes me feel bad. Even in short playthroughs of this game I have felt more empathy for 2D cartoon drawings than I have for people I would call close personal friends! And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, if they don't have the cutest damn video game dog in history to help you on your quests. GAAAAAAAH!I haven't seen a better job of storytelling and character development done by any game in the past few years, which when you consider the characters mostly communicate in pictures or by grunting at each other is pretty bloody impressive. It's actually quite clever what has been acheived here. Valiant Hearts perfectly captures the feeling of euphoria felt by many across Europe at the start of World War I. Ordinary people on both sides were genuinely ecstatic that war had broken out and wanted nothing more than to see the other side beaten. Steets were filled with flag waiving crowds, marching bands and troops paraded like toy soldiers while brightly coloured, jongoistic propaganda and recruiting posters covered walls. It must have been difficult not to get caught up in the excitement, only for the reality of war to be more horrifying than anything anyone could have ever perceived. The world's first industrial total war - killing done on an industrial scale, which could not have been more different from the street parties and colourful posters calling for young men to give the enemy a bloody nose.Valiant Hearts DOES this to you. It gets you caught up in that slightly dizzy euphoria and then, without warning, throws you into that man made hell of artillery, trenches, machine guns, tunnels, barbed wire, mud and gas. What makes it so heartwrenching is that the whole world is this happy little comic book, so beautifully drawn, and it is torn apart in front of your eyes, with awful trials and terrible things done to the protagonists you have come to genuinely care about.It is for reasons like these that I believe it is important that people play Valiant Hearts. On the surface it's a reasonably enjoyable puzzler, but underneath that it is so much more. It's a story about finding good in times where humanity is at it's worst. It's a story about love, revenge, friendship, loyalty, courage and a doggy. Most important of all perhaps is that it gives people a taste of the feeling that permeated the world at that time and delivers a moderate wealth of historical facts and information to boot. This game was made with at least some intention of teaching people. If I had to teach young kids about the Great War, this would be my first tool to give to them.Sure the gameplay itself is fairly average, but Valiant Hearts is a fantastic creation, with this unique character, so much so it borders on art. I have never cried at the end of a video game and I still haven't, but I came bloody close with this beauty.Valiant Hearts; charming, enjoyable, whimsical, jovial, thoughtful, joyful, tearful, beautiful, loveable.

												Out of many games I have played involving war, this has one of the best stories, and probrarbly one of the saddest storylines. This game may not have the FPS appeal of most war games, butit offers something completely different; a complelling and heart-wrentching story.Pro:One of the best storylines ever. (This game will emotionally kill you.)Has good puzzles.Great sound track.No ""multiple difficulties"" everything is all one, ou can't make the puzzles easier. (or harder for that matter.)Of you are into has badges and trading cards.Cons:Very short game, the hours you see is how long it took me to play through the game.Unless you don't touch it for a while, not much replayabilityThe ending hurts.Conclusion:It's a great ""one-time-through"" game. I personally love it, when I had my old 360, this was on it. RATING:STORY- 5/5MUSIC- 4/5REPLAYABILITY- 2/5OVERALL: 4/5			"
