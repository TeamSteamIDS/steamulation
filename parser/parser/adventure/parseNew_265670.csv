Early Access Review
								UPDATE:Adding random generated dungeon did not saved this game.The controls are still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and most of the time, the maps are ridiculous. And since most of the time you will die for stupid reason, the absence of checkpoints makes the game even more frustrating then it was before.This game is just a mess. I don't see how can somebody save it.EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:I wish I could Imagine a better game..Imagine me is just one simple platformer. The concept looks nice I guess, but there aren't any interesting new gameplay elements. This makes the game flat.The art style probably is the only good thing from this game. It's not new or mind-blowing, but looks neat at least.Everything else is a huge mess: the controls are super weird, you never understand when you're gonna jump high or when you're gonna jump IN THE HEIGHT YOU WANT.The levels are super easy. Really, no effort. Looks like a flash game from the early 2000s.9€ for this is a scam. I only have it 'cause I got a free steam key for it. And I beat all the levels in less than 20 minutes.For now, don't bother spending on it even on a big sale. Wait to see if the game gets any better with the time.Final Rating: 3/10It has nothing to offer. Literally nothing. Except tons of achievement for just opening the game.			"

												Imagine Me is agitated by its own existence. It can’t decide where to commit, patching on modes of play like a bad worker trying to explain their way out of a botched job by showing you all the little, trivial tasks they’ve completed instead. Right out of the gate Imagine Me tries its hand at procedurally generated level designs (it can’t be that hard, right? Everyone’s doing it). But once the algorithms start rolling and the levels actually come into existence, it’s immediately clear Imagine Me hasn’t the slightest clue what it’s doing.Chunks of familiar levels become hastily adjoined to one another into an unplayable mess of broken hitboxes and impenetrable block mazes. It’s chaos of the highest degree, silent caverns filled only with the cries of my broken soul as I beat myself against a metaphorical wall trying to beat a game which is quite literally impossible to complete. Somewhere along the development pipeline it must have been clear that something had gone horrible wrong, but rather than rework the disastrous level generator into something functional, Imagine Me instead decides to abandon it altogether and starts building levels by hand (it worked for Mario, didn’t it?).But much to my dismay Imagine Me hasn’t much of a knack for level designs, random or otherwise. At numerous points it almost appears as if whoever actually designed these levels fell asleep and never completed them, or otherwise became so bored with their own creation that they decided enough was enough and shipped whatever they had in front of them at the time. And thus we are left with 30 or so astoundingly dull and simplistic levels which play very much like the afterthought they were.I might feel worse about the depths of Imagine Me’s failure if it didn’t seem so apathetic toward aspiring to even moderate quality (or functionality). Everything feels empty and tedious, leading you in circles until either the game breaks or you stop playing. Imagine Me is sloppy and dysfunctional, but I couldn’t say it seems to actually care.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Honestly, not much to see here. Run of the mill graphics, one weapon, 2 enemies. Random level generation, which in this case was a bad idea. PIts that lead to no where, locked doors leading to dead ends, and areas where suicide is the only way out. Not worth it at full price. If you see it at 75% or 90% off however, its an easy game to 100%. Its a shame too, as the dev seems cheery, responsive, and they do fix the bugs. Problem is, the game just isnt that good.			"

												From a somewhat decent little platformer, Imagine Me fell to a plain mediocre game.Back one year ago, this game had pre-defined levels that were fun to play just to pass time. Now it has some badly designed generated levels. I often found myself playing the same level and it gets boring very easily.I'd suggest the devs go back to the previous stage of the game and improve it.Pros:+ The Challenge levels are pre-defined and were fun to play; it took me a short while to complete them all, but they weren't that bad;Cons:- Generated repetitive levels, gets boring in a short while;-Lacks initiative, there are only 2 types of enemies, 2 types of traps and 1 weapon;-Boss levels are random aswell, many people complained that they had to play dozens of stages to finally reach a boss area;-More soundtracks were welcome..Conclusion:I would recommend Imagine Me only if you really can't afford any other platformer out there. Even then, you would probably put it away soon. The gameplay lacks many features and I see no real reason to replay the game after you have finished it.Personal rating: 30/100 - Awful			"

												I really wanted to like this game, because the dev seems like such a great person, but the game itself isn't very good.The game is constantly updating, which shows that the dev is working on making this a better game, but there are some bugs that make this not so much a great game. Controls feel generally bad, since there is a lot of random generation there are some poorly placed blocks (For example, a lock on a wall that leads to nowhere) Also, the campaign doesn't save, so when I Alt+Tabbed, the game crashed and I couldn't be bothered to start again from the beginning. Only 2 kinds of enemies and the boss is incredibly easy.On the plus side, the game is an easy 100% if you're an achievement hunter.Since the dev is working on the game a lot, I hope that I'll be able to switch this to a reccommended eventually, but for now I can't reccommend it.

Early Access Review
								I sincerely hope the creators of this game are at 10% completion, because that was really REALLY underwhelming. This is basically an easy-mode platformer with spikes and trampolines. That's basically it. I was excited to see portals and crates... but they didn't add any mechanic to the game worth mentioning. The boxes are pushable. Woohoo. I beat the entire game in about 10 minutes, and spent another 10 trying to figure out if there were any secrets or achievements hidden somehow, somewhere. Nope. Be sure to read the memories, they add a ""story"" to the game. [SPOILERS: You were a kid, playing in the park, at a birthday party, and you were hit by a car. So sad. I guess this is a coma dream?] This feels like something built as a class project from a high school progamming class. No, I take it back, a community college class. It IS fairly polished and smooth, I suppose, just ... really too simple.			"

UPDATE:Wow. Decided to give this another try now that it's been released and somehow it got worse. The d-pad still doesn't work, which only exacerbates the problems with the new level design. The levels are extremely frustrating with lots of tight death traps to maneuver, and the imprecision of your movement makes this almost impossible. Try to do the same thing and you'll get a different outcome. It's almost like it's a response to the dearth of content in the original Early Access offering, by just stretching out the gameplay. I don't know how much content is there yet, but it's worse than what was there before.It's also more about exploring than platforming skill, featuring large levels with items to pick up, but it doesn't really give you much incentive to do so. You can pick up keys to unlock boxes that don't hold anything or get in your way. Arrows can destroy some blocks, but usually you don't need to do that to progress. There's just no point to it, none of the platforming is fun, and I gave up after 20 minutes. I might give it another go later and try to blaze through it and update this review again or even rewrite it entirely, but wow, was not expecting to come away this underwhelmed at the full release. At least the price came down.Original review:This is one Early Access game you should avoid, at least for the time being. The content in the game currently lasts all of 15 minutes, and none of it is any good. There are far better platformers out there with far fewer flaws.First of all, one of my pet peeves surfaces in this game: it doesn't recognize the d-pad. For a platformer that specifically tells you to use a controller every time the game loads, this is borderline unforgivable. The platforming itself feels boring and uninspired, consisting of short levels with not much to do in them. Sometimes the jump decides it isn't going to jump today. The timing on getting a boosted jump from springs feels similarly capricious. The random level generator usually spits out unplayable garbage, and the actually developer-designed levels are so sparse as to barely be worth mentioning. The level select resets to the first level every time instead of automatically moving to the newly unlocked level, which is a minor annoyance.In its current state, there is nothing that should compel you to spend $10 on this game. In fact, if you wait you'll actually get a better price, unlike most Early Access games which offer you a discount to encourage you to buy an incomplete product:""The price will be lower outside of Early Access. The game is currently priced higher. This is so no one buys the game without reading a little bit about it.""Don't spend money on this game right now, it will be cheaper and hopefully better later.

								This is not a good game.  Like many people, I got it in a bundle, so no real loss there, but if you are considering paying ten dollars for this, don't.  It's an amazing game for maybe a grade school student to make in their spare time, but has no business asking for money on Steam.  I really don't feel moved to rate games that often, only if I really enjoyed the game, or if it was so bad I feel the need to warn people, as if I'm being thoughtful or noble, but really, I just want help prevent games this bad from making money, so that people stop making games this bad.  Maybe it's hypocritical of me, being one of those people who buy bundles of crap just so my library looks swollen and engorged with gaming goodness, verily dripping fun, but two bucks for ten games at least gives me a fighting chance of finding something cool I never would have seen otherwise, whereas ten bucks for one game with a slew of negative reviews would be madness.

								According to Steam, I have only played the game for 15 minutes. That sounds about right. During that 15 minutes I have played through the entirety of the game. I then quit, while scratching my head and asking myself ""What am I missing? There has to be something I'm overlooking here."" After a little investigating it is clear that I did not miss anything, I really did 100% the game in 15 minutes. About 5 minutes of that time was spent pressing every button and key on my controller and keyboard trying to find hidden options or abilities that will help me beat the 75% of the ""generated"" levels that are literally unbeatable.The game consists of 8 ""tutorial"" levels that slowly introduce game mechanics of springs, keys, doors, and spikes. You will beat these levels in about 5 minutes if you take your time. After you are done with those, all you are left with is the ""generated"" levels. 75% of these ""generated"" levels (which are not actually generated, you will run into the same few levels over and over) are unbeatable due to the positioning of the exit door, and the lack of an actual game mechanic or player ability other than running and jumping. If you are lucky enough to end up in one of the winnable levels, then after you reach the exit door you will be kicked back out to the hub world where you can once again choose to play the tutorials again or another generated level. I have cycled through the generated levels several times, and I only counted 2 of them that are actually winnable. The game has no replayability, no interesting mechanics, and no redeeming factors. The sound is fine.Something important to note is that despite the Steam Store page for the game saying ""Full Controller Support"", the game does not use xInput (important to anyone using an Xbox controller or x360ce) and does not allow you to rebind keys. So you'll likely have the jump button be something ridiculous like a shoulder button on your controller.Don't buy this game for any price in its current state.5/5			"

For anyone out there studying to be a game designer, this game is the perfect case study for the difference between 'randomly' and 'procedurally' generated content.This uninspired platformer immediately thrusts the player into randomly generated levels that are not always completable and almost certainly not fun.The protagonist controls stiffly and the hitboxes for hazards are inaccurate leading to very frustrating play.

												The moment I started playing this game, I knew something was wrong. I went to look at the controls, and the screen came up behind the level I was on. THIS GAME IS CANCER. DO NOT BUY/PLAY.Everything about this game screams 'baby's first programming attempt'. The game relies solely on randomly generated levels, which often contain impossible jumps and walled-off spikes, and offers little more gameplay than jumping (of which you can double-jump, but ONLY if you jump first - no fall-jumping) and shooting blocks to get to the end of a map. Enemies are little more than moving dangers - one hit of which will send you back to the beginning. Becareful of projectiles too, as hitting one (which kills you) will cause it to remain floating in the air, making some maps impossible to complete (as the stationary object will still kill you on touch).I say this not out of spite - I know everybody has to start somewhere - but you can find better games for free on flash sites. Paying for this game would be a waste of any money. I can't remember how this came to be in my library - possibly by a Humble Bundle - but be assured that after this single sitting, I have no reason to ever come back to this poor excuse of a game.EDIT 1: I finally made it to a level that was literally impossible to reach the end of. Luckily the developer foresaw this and gives you a 'regenerate' button on the menu. Known your generation system is that flaw to put a failsafe in is quite something. Oh, and I hope you like the first three bosses, because you'll be seeing them again.EDIT 2: Having played two hours and 8 bosses worth of levels, the story (a scentence between levels) just loops, with no ending or purpose. They might as well be blank loading screens, as there is no payoff, no cohesive story, and NO END TO THE GAME. This is nothing but a worseless, waste of time. Yes there are challenge levels, they're nearly impossible to do.This game is randomly generated. Infinitely long. Handles like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Campaign is too easy. Challenges are too hard. There are three enemy-types, which all might as well just be moving spikes. I have seen better games for free on Newgrounds, so do yourself a favour and give this a wide berth.			"

								Imagine me imagining me some Imagine Me by imagin- alright, that's enough.Another cheap puzzle game. Only this one is pricier.The goodies:- The art in this game is a joy to look at.- The music too.- That's about it.The baddies:- This may not be correct, but the singleplayer had 9 levels, I think, and they're all too easy.- In the store page, it says something about ""beat the levels any way you want"". It's true but it's not right. At all.In a puzzle, you're supposed to take all the pieces and put them together the way the designer wants you to complete it. When was the last time you went to school and had a test which in it, had a question that could be answered with two completely different answers? Never. Unless it was ""what's your opinion on..."", the teacher should be fired. The player doesn't make a puzzle, the player beats the puzzle made by the developer. There I was trying to figure out how to use the boxes to get tot the door, then, I accidently knocked them over, and I realized I could just jump over the gap. Jump. That's not a puzzle. The game congratulates you for doing it YOUR way. That mindset belongs in a RPG.- Actual level design is not something you'd write home about. And I talking about both the singleplayer and the randomized levels.Don't buy this game, if I see anything good in the horizon, it's the ""Coming Soon"" stuff in the store page. That seems interesting. But it doesn't fix anything.			"

								This is probably the blandest platformer I have ever played. All levels fit on one screen, and objects are limited to blocks, spikes, springs, and occasionally a key. Gameplay does not vary at all between levels, and there aren't very many of them. The game also features a random level generator which spits out garbage that often is either impossible, or can be won by running to the right and jumping over one pit. The controls are bad, with it being difficult to guage the time you need to jump to bounce high off a spring, especially after they start sinking into the ground after you bounce on them a few times. The stats are completely broken, with the game awarding my the 50 deaths and 100 deaths achievements the first time I died, and the 1000 deaths achievement a few deaths, and less than a minute later. The game requires you to upload something to the workshop for one of the achievements, so expect the workshop to be flooded with garbage from people who just want the achievement.I can't possibly recommend this unless you get it as part of a bundle, or it is less than $1, and you want easy achievements.

												The controls, the levels (randomly generated, which led me to get stuck on several occasions), the gameplay in general, is very crude.The developers might have run out of funds, or their level, game and interface designer weren't really up to the task, or maybe there were time constraints that made them rush the shipping.Either way, this game is clearly not finished. Art-wise, it is mostly pretty, but the arrow animations are still amateur, for example.Interface navigation also has some poor choices: options menu is not accessible from in-game. Control mapping is not accessible from the 'esc' menu (maybe there is a shortcut, but one thing should not preclude the other).At least, the game let me play it in a window with a resolution of my choosing. That, bafflingly, many games still refuse to do.			"

												So...I wanted to go through my Steam library to play games I had yet to play.Well, I'm glad I went to this game first because I'm no longer going to play this game again.I've made a few games for fun back in the days, self-taught. They were far better than this game. My games were simple, yet was fun. This game is boring. There's not much of a reason to play this game. This game is too repetitive. The levels are randomized but practically all the same. There's no variety in this game really. Even my first platforming game I had ever made had more than two enemies and they had different qualities. The enemies here poses no threat. If you die, you restart the level. $2.99 is too much to ask. Bad Rats is a much better deal. I actually did have fun with that game. I would had actually spent money on Bad Rats, I would never spend money on this game. I got it for free from...somewhere. I have regrets of getting this for free, but I could sell the card I just got from this game. Yay!Things I liked:-I can make a little profit from that card (you won't get profit if you buy this game. According to Enhanced Steam extension, this game lowest price has been $2.24. Get it only if you can sell the cards for more than you've spent.)-One boss somewhat made me startled I guess...-The text after every level were somewhat interesting I suppose.Things I disliked:-Everything. -There's a dedicated button for showing the controls which looks ugly because it goes behinds the platforms and such. You can't even see it. The controls however, are easy to learn, but not precise at all. I found my character still running even without pressing any buttons. Not too sure what the look button was for either...-Two enemies, boring, no threat.-Bosses were pretty boring too. Much more improved than the regular enemies, but these bosses can easily become regular enemies. -The boxes...I'm not too sure why I can move them when I jump on them. -Sometimes I can't double jump. I'm not entirely sure why I can't do it at certain moments but I'm not playing more to figure it out.-Repetitive. All levels are basically the same just randomly arranged. (Have yet to see an impossible level.)-Nothing really to look at.Oh, I can provide another positive. I can cross this off my ""Steam Games in my Library I haven't Yet Played"" list.			"

												I'm a little confused, why would you use random level generation in a campaign mode.  A lot of the time, I think that random level generation is more of a lazy excuse to not put time and effort into level design than a way to have the game be ""Spontaneous and different every time"".  In addition, random generation still has to have some sort of regulation, or your game will end up like this game, where you often find that enemies will block passages with no way to get past them, two locked doors will block your way with only 1 key available to you, and spikes will be placed in areas that make it impossible to progress.  Enemies have much bigger hitboxes than are shown visually, and they often move so slowly that it takes 2 full minutes of waiting before an enemy will get out of the way.  There are just a lot of problems with this game.			"

								Make sure you dont buy this game for $10. I completed this game 7/8 achievements (8th one seems bugged) in 10 mintutes. What you should know about imagine me is it as nothing special about it. No special gameplay or mechanic to make it stand out. It's simply run and jump. It has a random level generator for when you beat the game, but with all the much better platformers out there this isn't worth it. I personally got this game from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the equivilent to $0.19 and im still upset. Yes this is Early Access, but I see no potential what so ever.			"

												Oddly unpolished. Poor execution. Imagine Me feels like someone's project in a beginner's game design course. Perhaps there's a decent story in there somewhere but the level design, movement, and hit detection make it a mess. Sadly game design toolkits like GameMaker make far more polished games than this. For $3 it's not a major hit to the wallet but I can't see why anyone would buy this game outside of a bundle deal with something they do want.			"

												Imagine Me is a side-scrolling randomly generated action platformer.It features a campaign and challenge levels, as well as a workshop. The campaign is randomly generated but sadly, the level design is broken and offers too little variation, making it repetitive and boring. The challenge while interesting is somewhat easy and can be completed in less than one hour. In the end I'd say there are other platformers that surpass Imagine Me in every single aspect, making it not worth the money or time.★★☆☆☆ | Disliked it "

												Imagine Me would be considered plain even if it had came out back in the early 90´s, and yet, its astonishing how such a simple game manages to do so many things wrong. Every level looks the same, you just go from point A to point B, avoiding spikes and  enemies that barely move, by the end of each level you get a memory, that grants you further passage to the next one.Developers like to show theyre still working on this game, but: -The exit is always located either on the bottom right or bottom left corner. -Every time you die you get the same dead screen, it gets really annoying. -controls aren't tight. - i wouldn't mind the art-style but there's a severe lack of animations. - the game is too repetitive and has a very poor level design,  it would be more interesting if there were some  Non randomly generated levels. - the hit boxes are bigger than the objects that are supposed to kill you, its an easy game and i could adjust to that, but it just shows how little work was put in this game. - The Broken level generator more often than not leads to impossible levels, i've played for 10 min until i came across an impossible level. Levels don't even change when you die, the only option is to start the game all over again. -the options menu is pretty lousy and cannot even be accessed while in game, instead you just get this really annoying            screen that appears every time you start a new game showing you the pre mapped controls and some instructions on how to play, there's even a special key just to open the instructions again. I dont get it, of all things that are missing, why do the developers want to force this on players, the game couldn't be simpler, children games are harder to understand than this, it serves no purpose.If devs were ever involved in Imagine Me they would have fixed some of this problems by now, they seem to take into account everyone's bad feedback and yet no changes have been made. How difficult could it be to generate new levels every time you die just so it was at least possible to continue playing without having to start from the beginning every time you get stuck. As is, Imagine Me is not even worth its current price. Its one of the worst games ive played and deserves every negative review it got. At Least most indie developers try something different and creative even if they happen to fail			"

The very little I played of this game is bad, and I would not even recommend getting this for the cards, unless you got it in a HumbleBundle for another game, like I did. Stay away from this game, and never even go near it. I like to play bad games ironically sometimes, but this is just too bad, even for me. I would rate this with a 2/10.The 2 is because the beginning background is beautiful.That's it. That's the ONLY good thing.			"

												I get what this game is trying to do, but it's not doing it well, neither in gameplay nor in storytelling.The story isn't engaging and feels disingenuous. The gameplay is unpolished, repetitive and feels very dull after a while. You spawn in pseudo-randomly generated dungeons where you need to get to the exit while collecting arrows and keys. After every dungeon, you get 3 or 4 lines of the story, and at the end of a ""memory"" you fight a boss, the same boss every time. The game doesn't get harder in any appreciable way, and the story gets less interesting as you progress.The biggest issue, however, is that the game is VERY unpolished. Enemies' AI keeps running and they retain their hitboxes even during their death animations, the menus are wonky and have incorrect button labels, the death screen feels like something hacked into a game engine that didn't have a feature to add death screens. This game was in Early Access until early December, but it feels no more finished than when I previously played it in June.It's only 3€, but it just feels more like an idea someone had and never followed through with, rather than a game, so I really can't recommend.

								Imagine Me is sort of like one of those puzzle type games which you find quite regularly everywhere, even freely on flash games, the game itself is quite simple although the puzzles are nice. Unfortuantely I don't reccomend this game for a number of reasons, first jumping on springs are super annoying, the only real information you get is to jump at the ""perfect time"" whenever that is, I just ended up spaming the jump button to get around it but I never had this much trouble trying to jump on any other game. Deaths by spikes seem to be set on both the spike side and its side, so a lot of spike deaths feel wrong? The game is in alpha stage at the time of writing through so its not suprising that bugs exist but considering it retails at $10 USD for me, I could find a lot more better games, much more polished and worth the price in comparison. I also can't really find too much of a hint of a story line, and unless I'm playing the wrong parts (AKA the menu doens't feel too intuitive) it seems to be super short for full price.On the flip side though it does contain quite nice graphics even through it feels a bit like the green is overused everywhere and it has controller support which is a nice addition. Also considering the game has no story or anything its quite interesting, its not too difficult, but not too easy either, there isn't a long death time so you can get back to playing pretty quick, and I never felt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, after playing which is always a plus. If you got the game freely or part of a bundle or SUPER cheap then it would probably be worth it. Its just no where near worth the current price at this alpha stage of the game.			"

 Interesting ideas, but badly executed Imagine Me is a little platform game in which you play as Robbe, a little kid with some problems and you have to help him to complete his journey. As the game progresses, you will learn about his past and his present.The game offers a short campaign and some challenges for extra fun, it does have trading cards and achievements.Pros:-Nice artwork.-Extra challenges.-Random generated maps in every level (sorta).Cons:-It is way too repetitive, the game offers different generated levels but most of the time is pretty much the same.-The story and written in general could be a lot better. It goes from consistent to not consistent at all. Is like when you are watching a bad movie with interesting story, you think the movie could have potential but the script is a mess.-The sountrack could be way better as well. Is not terrible, but I wish there was more diversity.So in general, is not a terrible game, is just not good. I can see the devs had interesting ideas, I really do, but the final product was badly executed. If you are person like me who enjoys indie platform games you might like it a little bit , but personally I was disappointed by it. Score 5/10.			"

This usually happens when a steam notification pops up. One background music, which is not bad, but becomes annoying after a while.

And by short i mean very short, 15-20 min if not less. Yes there is a random generate level button, but those levels give no challange at all. The price as it stands now is to step for such a product. I just hope this isn't one of those games where the dev makes a minimal efort to make a game with only 21 levels and then expects the community to make the other content with the level maker for him. That's just lazy. For now i can't recommend the game but in the future, will see.			"

The gameplay is very much simple. The graphic is bad and the aesthetic does not suits it at all. The story does not working and it buggy as hell.The developer were good and responsive just the game i really consider its very poorly design and just not working.			"

												I have barely played this game, but, looking at the reviews and the first level, things make sense...I've played about 2 minutes, yet there's already something that really annoyed me: the backgrounds sound. It's almost a droning sound, very low (bass-y), but it's really uncomfortable. And, when you die (which is a lot), it slightly stops and goes back to the beginning. I've never had a game do that to me, but it's really bad! Surprisingly so.Anyway, iffy hitboxes, the first campaign level is not only too hard, but also a disjointed mess. Clearly not a carefully designed level...I'll pass it.			"

												The Bad:-Glitchy physics and inconsistent collisions (you can walk on obstacles, ride bullets)-Fake Procedural generation (the game pulls from pre made chunks and arranges them randomly, this leads to sometimes near impossible levels-Bad art (Obstacles blend into background, character sprite doesn't fit with level art)-Bad Sound (has 5 sound effects and a 10 s ambient loop)-Bad Code (Player can move while dead screen shows, and effectively move the spawn point)-UnFun (game is very trial and error, but the level doesnt reset when you die, it feels like a slower more tedious attempt at the meat boy formula.)-UnFair (game often requires large drops with unsafe bottoms that you have to guess about)-Un-something...There are dozens of bugs and quirks that make the game tedious and unfun if not downright annoying.After playing for an hour I still have no idea what the game is about, it seems to go on forever with no real story progress.

Early Access Review
								There is practically nothing to this game right now and you can literally do it all in ten minutes.   It's not good and its not fun.  The listed price is definitely a rip off.-----So I have now come back several months later and my opinion of it has actually gone down.  It controls much worse now.  Slides around for no reason, like you are walking on an icy surface.  Sometimes it doesnt jump when I press the button.  The jumping itself feels very imprecise.   Objects in the world, such as spikes, manage to kill you when you arent actually touching them.  I clipped into the ground and was no longer able to move.    It was a really unpleasant experience, this time around.			"

Early Access Review
								After playing the alpha build, the game seems terrible with the physics and limitaions (specifially running too fast and collision detection as well as controller mapping on d-pad for xbox) which are big issues for this genre (platforming).After reading the feedback as well and seeing a beta build availabe, the beta fixes some of the major issues for campaign mode, specifically the running physics. However, the challenge mode still suffers from the alpha build issues.I still don't recommend the game in its current state. However I feel it is far from complete and may update the review in later builds.Note: Currently, easy to 100% achievement the game for easy stats.			"

												honestly, I went into this game expecting a cerebral, thought-provoking story with some, at least decent, platforming. what I got, instead, was this... thing, that tried to tell the story of the protagonist, Robbe, through little snippets after every dungeon. and once I got to the end of the Bully chapter, the game actually looped back and started me from the beginning of the game. I tried again, thinking maybe I didn't kill a specific boss to progress, only to find out that one of the bosses is unbeatable. I had slain the Winged Guardians (which there were only two of, from what I saw), and went for the Depths Monster. I had loosed 100+ arrows into it, and it didn't die. I thought I missed a guardian, so I looked around and found no more. just... invulnerable spheres that shot the same projectiles as the Guardians.all in all, I'd have to give it...C- on the storyF on level designF on balancingoverall, this game failed to produce any feeling other than confusion and exasperation.

There are so many design and programming issues (read the discussions to see the kind of problems people are encountering).It has about as much depth and polish as a developers first flash game they made while they were learning, would not suggest buying, no matter how cheap it is; there are a million better dungeon platformers out there.

												The game is bad, there is no doubt about it, however i got every single achievement and i think this game could have been  a good game if it had better levels / challenges.Sure the controls are not perfect, the hitboxes are off and the game looks and sounds bad, but the mechanics are solid although basic. The biggest problem with the game is that it doesn't have any good levels, the random generated levels are really boring, the arrows and keys you collect are meaningless and the 2 different Bosses i encountered died pretty much instantly. The challenge levels are not very challenging, dodging a couple of spikes to reach the exit door isn't interesting enough.The game feels more like a proof of concept than an actual game, it isn't the worst game on steam but it sure as hell isn't a good game.

												I want to recommend that game but I just can't. The only 3 good things I can tell about it are that it was made with love (but love =/= quality), random generated levels are cool idea and its short soundtrack is really really good.But...The story is confusing, when you finish it it just starts from the beginning with no explaintion and no conclusion. Also very very very boring with horribe horrible pace.Some of the random levels are unbeatable because you simply cannot get the exit or due to other bugs the path is blocked by standing-still projectiles from earlier failures that were not cleared out.The programmer has no idea of how to work with Unity and it's horrible. For a game that the number of animations and assets can be counted on 3 hands it's stupidly weights 1.3GB. If it was done right it should be 100MB tops if you compare it to Thomas Was Alone. I have no idea how the ♥♥♥♥s it weights so much when there's so little content in this game.The documentation is just super bad. You see the instructions of how to play at the beginning of every level and not even once it tells you you can dounle jump (which is bugged when intercating with springs) or sometimes you can head stump enemies and won't die (probably a bug).If you can get it for like 20 cents or less go for it for card farming and the soundtrack. The game doesn't worth any spare second or cent beyond this. Too bad you have to install this♥♥♥♥♥♥to get the soundtrack. I recommend the developers to learn how to do a properly 2D game in Unity or just to move to Media Fusion Studio or GameMaker.			"

												Not a great plateformer. Controls are quite bad, it's really hard to place the character where you really want.There's a 1,5 seconds delay everytime you die where you can move, it's so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, You get touched, you can still jump and move until the ""You Failed"" screen appear. It's the same for winning a level. You're at the exit, but you get touched, so it doesn't count like a win.The hitbox. It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's a spike diagonally to me, if I go too much near the block that should stop you from hitting you, you die. Approching a block near a spike made me paranoid.Then, the generated levels. They sucks. Most of the time you can't access the exit. For the challenge levels, some of them are quite hard, but it's quite repetitive. The difficulty curve is really bad, too. I had lots of difficulty near the level 10-15, and yet I did 25-36 with almost no difficulty. I didn't reached a boss yet, so this review is subject to change a bit. Anyway, I'll give it a 3/10, do not buy. It feels like a pre-alpha, it should have stayed as an Early Access. You can easily find games more fun than that on one of those flash game's website, for free, too!			"

												Imagine Me is a platformer game that tells you a bit of the main story after each completed level. For the platformer part, it is not difficult at all (jumping over spikes and throwing arrows with your bow at ennemies), but it is repetitive. It seems to me that all the levels are randomly generated, but there must be less than 10 different levels, so, at some point, it will get boring.Nevertheless, I did enjoyed the written story and the soundtrack, so I managed to spend ~2 hours to entirely complete the game. It includes the challenge levels (which are not really challenging :s), which means that it took me a little bit more than one hour to unlock all of the achievements.In the end, if you are looking for an easy platformer with a nice story, 2,99€ seems to be a fair price !

												Lots of bad reviews for this game.. not sure why - maybe it was for previous versions?  Anyway, for me, it was worth the small price of admission.  Using a controller was key, and with that, the control went well.  The graphics aren't anything much, but they fit the simplicity of the game well.  There is some frustation as it is a dying simulator game, but it wasn't horrendous, and the ability to regen the level you are on is nice to ease some of that frustration.It is very short, and repetive though, so if you know you don't like those kind of games, pass this one by.Overall its worth the buck or so it costs (sale, bundle, whatever).. 3 bucks is a bit on the high side, but for a couple of hours of fun, not outrageous.

								Yes, its eairly access, they have progress bars on what they are working on and they stream on twitch to keep you up to day with what they are working on. They are headed into the right direction and I have told my friends about the game. I hope they keep up the good work and they respond back to any questions, comments and bugs. If you are on the fence about buying this, just put it on the watchlist and see the progress. Im sure you will want this game.			"

								Gonna make this review before the game's official release (Dec. 9th), so here we go:The game is pretty much of a fun, platform-type game, where you go through a randomly-generated room, collecting arrows and keys as you make your way towards the exit. Complete 3 rooms to face off against a boss, then you repeat to regain more memories.The control scheme is pretty much basic, it can be controlled by keyboard and controller, movement is fluid, and combat... well, not much actually. It's optional to defeat the enemies, but at times you'll need to defeat them, which at times will randomly drop a gold arrow bundle, which contains 5 arrows to use to either defeat enemies or break blocks.The music fits really well, especially facing off with the Haunted boss, feels like you entered another genre without notice, plus the music intro theme (unsure of who sung it) has a nice feel to the game, in a way.All in all, I give the game a 9/10! The game is constantly being updated and has a pretty awesome community. If you're a fan of puzzle platform games, I recommend adding this to your collection. Keep cool, bros! B)			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to give Imagine Me a tentative recommendation, but that's on the premise that this is still an Early Access game, and I hope to see it expand (much) farther beyond what is currently here.Imagine Me is a pretty simple platformer where your goal is to get from start to finish in each room / level. Sometimes you need to unlock a door by collecting a key first, and sometimes you traverse portals. Spikes and scowling, flaming enemies are to be avoided. The levels are also sparsely populated with crates, random physics objects for which I could find no real purpose.As of this review, this game is a decent foundation for a much better game, but for now, it's only a handful of levels that provide a very low level of challenge. I like the idea of being able to craft levels for others, and being able to find out more about the game's protagonist by collecting snapshots is interesting, but it's all over so soon and you're left wanting more. The current set of ""challenge levels"" are a little uninspired.Here's to hoping Imagine Me will grow into something better. For now, only buy if you're really wanting a new, simple platforming experience and you want to support this game before its official release.			"

A good little platformer and though it's still in it's alpha stage, I kinda wished I knew why Robbe was jumping on trampolines to get to doors.

												A fine game at the moment but not remotely close to being worth 9.99. I'm not sure where I got it exactly (part of some bundle that I paid less than 3 dollars for the entire bundle). But if you have to pay full price I would wait til release. I've beaten basically all the game content in about 30 mins. But it is enjoyable. The developers are well on there way to a good game here.Update: I see the game has since been lowered to 2.99 for the base price, if you are still only getting what you got when I played the game I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it, but I'm assuming the developers have added a decent amount of content since I think this review is at least a year old. Might be close to being worth the price tag now.			"

								OK This game is bad.First of all you CANNOT CHANGE SETTINGS and the music is very high though.The graphics are bad, looks like it was made in MS Paint.The music is pretty annoying and you cant mute it (you can from the computer settings or at your headphones)and now, the game:First of all i found it hard to play because of ""ACCELERATION SYSTEM""that means you start walking slowly and then gaining speed. If you played other platformer games you can see that there are ice blocks that you slip on them and you really hate them? So all of the blocks here are like that,Because of that if you use the ramp you will jump and will move really a bit because you didnt gain your speed yet and then you hit the spike and RESTART THE WHOLE LEVEL.and some minor things: the ""tutorial"" is a picture of 5 seconds that you can realize in this time what to do.Avoid this game.

												it would be a decent flash game, but recent indie games are generally better, I know developping a game is hard, but this look more like something that a guy made as a hobbie than something you would sell.if you get it for less than 50cents or in a pack, it might be worth buying if you like hard try and die platformer games.what I don't like:the game is buggy, the pseudo-random (badly procedurally generated) levels that half reset when you die are sometimes impossible (two locked doors and one key) the half second blood splater from super meat boy is replaced by a black screen with the hero falling, which means sometimes you die without seeing what killed you, this combined with the weird hitboxes makes the game more frustrating that it needs to.the art from the game is pretty bad*.what I like :the challenges are pretty good (ignoring the hitboxes and death animation).*the menu and titlescreen art are good, If the rest of the game was as good looking, that would be great.the death animation is short.the idea of combining procedurally generated levels and die and retry is pretty good, but it should be almost flawless to not be frustrating.

												Overall rating: 2/10It's not particularly fun, but the simple mechanics kept me playing for almost 30 minutes.I got this game as a part of a humble bundle, and that is the only way that I could recommend paying for this game.I'm not quite sure what this game is supposed to be about.  I guess there are memories you are supposed to try to unlock by descending into randomly generated levels.  The issue is that as the levels progress, there seems to be no increase in difficulty, and the memories you unlock don't seem to be particularly interesting.I might recommend this game for younger audiences, as an introduction to platforming and puzzle solving (especially since the game is incredibly forgiving - there are no ""lives,"" and any time you die, you immediately respwan), but for anyone looking for a challenge or rewarding experience, look elsewhere.

												The best part about this game is the song on the Full Release Trailer. This is a very basic platformer with terrible collision detection (you will die from hitting spikes through walls and in other ridiculous ways) and very simple gameplay. The main campaign has randomized dungeons that are terribly boring, with only the same few traps/enemies in the way. And the boss fights are all extremely simple affairs.The entire campaign of memories plus the challenges will barely last you an hour. Unless you get this in a bundle... avoid!			"

There are glitches that can actually break gameplay, for example in the boss room with the ghost, sometimes the rotating platforms with just start drifting, eventually making it impossible to reach the exit. Dying, or just hitting respawn does not reset any level and you don't actually lose anything other than a few seconds of progress, so there are no death consequenses, however if a level breaks, in order to get free you'll have to actually quit to the main menu. When you return you get a different randomized level. The game just doesn't have any variety to it, even the boss levels don't feel that special. One boss even seem to be unkillable, taking over a dozen of my arrows without dying when the other bosses only took 3. exit was only blocked off by a single breakable wall though, so I just left without trying any further to kill the boss.After each level you get a little bit of the character's story. Once you get all parts of the story it just loops again. Every few levels you get a boss level, usually one with a ghost who teleport along the bottom of the room. There's no tell or warning to his teleports, he just pops randomly around, sometimes right on top of you, and every hit on you is a one hit kill.The hitboxes in the game are weird, some blocks you can just kinda pass through, the arrows you shoot move like half your walking speed and make a weird offkey piano chord when you pick more up, the graphics and animations look thrown together almost last minute with many back ground assets sticking out of the sides of the field and sometimes appearing on top of monsters who should be in the foreground...Overall it feels like an unfinished student project.

												Currently would not reccomend this game to any friends. While it has been growing in features, it seems as if no new additions can save this game. The only good thing going for this game is the music and SFX, which really is not good, considering this game has been thought out for at-least 3 years now (From the kickstarter page that still stands, from 2011). To me, and it seems many others, the cons out weigh the pros.Is it the worst game I have ever played? No, that would be an overstatement. This game is one to keep and eye on, but in its current state is not a good buy. The devs do work on this game still, so its still a WIP, but once again in its current state its not a buy.4/10			"

												This game feels lazy. The animations, combat, graphics, and overall feel of the game is blocky and unrefined. It feels like the developer learned to code yesterday and decided to make a game.			"

												Ran into a level mid game that was impossible to complete due to poor random dungeon generaion. The game has potential to be a simple mediocre platformer. It current is a mediocre platformer with a lot of bugs.I got the game super cheap though, but still I sort of feel like I bought nothing. I wish the dev luck in fixing this game, because it needs fixing. Perhaps my review will become positive one day.			"

												So this game is very much still in development.  In its current state it is not worth it as a game, but if you are interested in helping the development process the devs seem open to reasonable suggestion and constructive criticism.			"

Early Access Review
								EDITED Review first: OK, so as I promised, I have come back to try and replay this game and see what has been changed/improved. I find that a lot of things have indeed been overhauled and many improvements have been put in. There is more to the game to be sure and it plays a lot smoother for me. I can say with all honesty that the Dev took criticisms to heart and really tried with this one. It's simple but challenging. But I will caution you to read the reviews with an open mind before deciding to buy. As I mentioned originally it is basic but remember people, this is a small developer. It isn't the next Mario Bros game but it's not crap. Anyway, the long and the short of it is. You will either like it or not. Just go in eyes open. It has flaws but there is some fun there if you are fond of challenging games. Original Review.This is one of those games where early access is a bad thing. Like a lot of others, I received this in a bundle. I've played all of maybe 5 minutes of it and already uninstalling. It's not for me and unless there are major changes involved, it will never be for me. The jumping feels glitchy, the graphics aren't bad but as many have pointed out there is a HUGE problem with the level generation. Without more being added to the moveset then you will find many levels unbeatable. Now, that said, I am not bashing these devs or the game itself. In fact I am kind of curious to see what they plan on doing with it, if anything. As it stands now though I would not value this game at $9.99 or even $4.99. Stay away until the full game is out. Give it a chance at that time. Should things improve I will gladly look at it again. Just not that much to be enjoyed in its current state.			"

												How to put this delicately... this game is a poo-poo stinky rotten trashbag deserving of no real attention.  There is no game to enjoy here.  I actually had a level that was incompletable but lucky for me they had a ""regenerate"" button in case their awful random dungeon generation failed.  It's like some art project that, for some reason, they put their cutesy pop-art and story over a rushed videogame instead of just making it a flash animation or something.  Or just... plain old art.  There are like one or two pictures that, as a standalone piece, don't look too bad, one of them being the cover art.I had noticed the other negative reviews and readied myself for an ironically entertaining experience.  It is indeed hilarious for all the wrong reasons.  The best part is that a few minutes in I realized it was trying to be a Spelunky clone and has ""rogue-like elements"".  And it has cards for what feels like an alpha.  Unreal.  I'd also like to bring attention to the achievment named ""Nice Game Developers"" in which you can get an achievement for moving a box.  Just... ♥♥♥♥ off.Not sure where I got the key for this (probably humble bundle), but I would never buy it from this storefront, nor would I play it for free.			"
