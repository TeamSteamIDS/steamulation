												Free if you have Half Life: Episode One. I completed it in about 4 hours last night on Hard so it's not a very time consuming game either. Was very entertaining, very difficult at times which I believe is a positive. Actionpacked to the max, always a firefight behind every corner. The map was amazing, a bit like The Silent Cartographer from Halo: Combat Evolved. Music in true Half Life-style, pumping beats to get your heart rate up. Puzzles and combat as in Half Life although more combat oriented, set in the same universe. Spawn system/level design is one of the best I've seen. There's a set number of enemies per ""event"" (like opening a door, there's a lot of these), meaning you can clear it out entirely and feel somewhat safe. But the ""events"" put spawns far away at times, making the enemies then run towards the sound of fire but only arrive after most things are dead, surprising you without feeling random and making the experience harder and more lifelike at the same time. Never coming at you alone, always from several angles. At times scaring me to screams, panicing against what seemed like impossible odds in the moment. Fast paced, fluid, brutal. Excellent. If you have Episode One and like combat more than running around looking at the view then you should play it. That's not to say it's not a beautiful game, it's probably the best looking game in the entire franchise... and it's a mod.			"

												This is easily one of the best Half Life 2 mods. It offers a comfortably similar mission style to compliment Half Life 2. Minerva may be short in overall game hours, but if you enjoyed Half Life 2 you will definitely enjoy this reminiscent detour. Minerva offers exactly what you would expect from what is a mod side story that is intent on delivering a unique and enjoyable experience with purposely simlar gameplay to Half Life 2. I would highly reccomend Minerva to anyone that enjoyed the Half life 2 singleplayer experience, but is still craving more of what made Half Life 2 one of the best atmospheric story driven fps games. You will not be dissapointed.			"

												Bored of waiting for HL3 ? So am I, but here's a little something to make the wait easier. MINERVA: Metastasis is a source based mod set in the Half life universe. Its amazing if you're into HL and it's universe, probably a bit less if you're not (you would definitly rather start by playing HL2)It has similar atmosphere, mechanics (duh), and immersion than HL2 and it's Episodes. Consider it as a plus or a side quest to the main game, kinda the way Opposing force and Blue Shift are to HL1.It's creator has worked at Valve so no wonder it is a good game !I really enjoyed the map and plot. No spoiler, but I can tell you that once again you're gonna have to f*ck with some huge combine installations :D It's hard to tell when the game events occur compared to City 17's events, I think it's just some Resistance action happening before Gordon's come back. Only downside is that the game had some weird graphic settings the first time played it, it was really bright and well... quite ugly compared to what I was seing online.If it happens to you (you can compare with the community page screenshots) add ""+mat_dxlevel 90 +mat_hdr_level 2 +mat_hdr_enable +mat_fullbright 0"" (no quotes) to your game launch options. The game is free if you already own HL: E1, so get it !			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that was good. Short, sweet, and to the point. Unlike HL2, where you have to fight to clear an area, in Minerva you simply need to keep running. Forget killing everything, forget the loot. Just run. Survive. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire ride. What a beautiful project.Cons: Voice acting would have helped.

If you have no idea what MINERVA is then this is your chance to give the mod that in 2007 stole the hearts of both Valve employees and Half Life fans alike a try. The intuitive storytelling and eerie level design make for an awe-inspiring experience that you won’t want to stop playing until the very end. Unravel the untold secrets of a remote combine island base where not everything is as it seems. MINERVA is a must play for any Half Life Fan!Thanks Adam Foster!9/10			"

If a sequel comes, it should have a log history so you can remember what ""Athena"" said, and maybe shed some more light on the person your playing as and ""Athena"" (Which kinda reminds me about Durandal from Marathon) as well. So I recommend this game? YES!!!! And maybe the sequel should be also for Half life 2 itself and episode 2.			"

Posted: November 23, 2014
												*NOTICE* I just finished playing this mod and here is my final verdict.MINERVA: Metastasis, what may appear as a generic, fanmade Half-Life 2 mod on the outside actually appears more on the inside. I have played many Half-Life 2 mods and this one definetely goes on my list of one of the most interesting if not one of the best Half-Life 2 mods I have ever played. The mod is mysterious which really fits into the Half-Life universe, the story is told via text which may seem horrible on paper with many flaws, which it does don't get me wrong, but it gets the job done and in a way gives MINERVA its character.The level design in MINERVA is very similar to Half-Life 2's level design yet also has some variation with the mod being more maze-like than Half-Life 2's which in my honest opinion gives the mod more variation and gives an immersion factor to it. The mod is also surprisingly challenging compared to Half-Life 2 and I was playing on Normal difficulty! I mean its not rage inducing hard but the beginning levels do stir up a challenge with the mod throwing enemies at you in tight corridor-like locations. It the kind of hard difficulty which does test you, makes you think and makes you aware of your surroundings and makes you think of plans to take on the many Combine foot soldiers and aliens head crabs and zombies that you will encounter.There is a lot more to say about MINERVA, the design of the levels and the detail that the mod developer placed are truly amazing, the gameplay and pacing is spot on and the mod just truly feels interesting to play. Many things in MINERVA are also interesting with the themes of Greek Mythology being in the game with the Narrator telling you your mission objectives via text.The story in MINERVA like I said is mysterious with a lot of what is going on is confusing but atleast there's forums to explain whats going on. A lot with MINERVA also fits in with the Half-Life universe that I feel that someday Valve should incorporate into that next Half-Life game that we are all waiting for. When you get to a certain part involving a portal you'll see what I mean, not spoiling it that is.In the end MINERVA is a must play, it really makes you happy to play a good Half-Life 2 mod, its short yet sweet, and plus it makes you think more as to what Half-Life 3 could be.

												MINERVA is a beautiful, well paced mod for Half Life 2. Taking place on an island occupied by the combine, it features fantastic level design that rivals that of vanilla Half Life 2. The areas weave together in a very believable way and every area is shrouded by an air of mystery. Also noteworthy is the expert use of verticality. I often found I was able to use this to my advantage against the numerous, well placed enemies in MINERVA. Not only are the areas well designed, but each is also visibly distinct. Because of this, I never found myself lost for long. I even stopped once to admire the setting sun reflecting off the ocean's waves. The Story is engaging enough. It does a good job of adding to the mystery of the island, although it would have benefited from proper voice acting as it is sometimes difficult to read during intense gunfights. Over all, MINERVA provides some of the best Half Life 2 content I have experienced. Anyone with a copy of Half Life 2 owes it to themselves to give this a try.			"

												If what you're looking for is more Half-Life--and you don't think you can wait on Valve to satisfy--then MINERVA gives you a bit of what you want. As much high praise as this game has received, though, I feel obligated to make a few criticisms.The first is obvious: this is MORE Half-Life. Nothing here hasn't been done already, or better. It has a few problems of its own, though. Some encounters seemed almost designed to annoy. In several places the direction the player should take is not at all obvious. Of course, MINVERVA (the character) is always there to berate you for not seeing what should be, but isn't, clear. Speaking of which, what's worse than poorly-written monologue? Why, poorly-written monologue that's supposed to sound clever but comes off as ham-fisted.Of course, these criticisms somewhat overlook the fact that, in the end, this is a mod. And as mods go, it's pretty good. It's also free. So if you've already finished Half-Life 2, might as well give it a whirl.			"

												I haven't played many Half Life 2 mods, but this one reeks of professionalism. The level itself is small, but not exactly. It's full of detailing and the layout is actually vertical. Most of the setting takes place below ground in an expansive Combine structure that really fits in with the original lore. It looks Combine, it feels Combine, and it's definitely a bit sinister. It's not very short, but if definitely feels like a single level in a larger campaign.It's a fun, enticing little experience, and yes I played with godmode. It's really challenging! Or maybe that's just me with horrible skills.			"

												MINERVA is a community made mod for Half-Life 2. I guess you could call this one Half-Life 2: Episode 2.5. It looks, feels and plays exactly like the other Half-life 2 parts. The story is small, yet very entertaining. The levels are amazingly well made to match Half-Life 2's environment. It is certainly not an easy game and you will sometimes spend some time to figure out on where to go next, but it is certainly not too difficult either.If you liked Half-Life 2, then you definitely need to try this mod.

												Quite possibly one of the greatest video game modifications ever made, MINERVA embodies some of the best sensibilities and philsophies modding has to offer. Taking advantage of the Half-Life 2 assets, mechanics and narrative to produce an almost immaculate experience that fits neatly into the greater Half-Life continuum; and featuring some truly ingenious, intricate and at times, stunning level design that truly rivals Valve's own work. Ostensibly, MINERVA is ""Valve-quality"", considering its creator, Adam Foster, was hired by Valve to work on Half-Life 2: Episode Three in late 2008. He also did level design for Portal 2, which I thought was rather unfortunate. In any case, though the MINERVA series never got past this first chapter, its legacy does live on at Valve. And you can play it if you own HL2: Episode One. And you should probably do it.			"

												This, this genius addition to the Half-Life universe - shows off what kind of personal expression and inspiration must be present across Valve's employee's.  It follows the crucial story trap, of not letting you know what is happening in this world, but showing you - only giving you a tiny peice of the whole picture at a time, and forever pressing your inate desire to explore.  This mod capitalizes on many atmospheric qualities that set the origional half life as such a memorable masterpeice.  The horror of bio-assimilation, bleak military intention, and all within confined steel corridors - leading to epic chambers of technologial experimentation.   (Just get used to that goulish blue combine metal texture).This mod is also fkn hard when put at max difficulty, conserve your ammo and use every tool at your disposal.9 > Badass			"

												In short - it's probably the best single player HL2 mod out there. It's creator was famously (and deservedly) hired by Valve after working on this.It's a mod that masterfully uses a lot of the available game assets (up to Ep. 1) to add to the original game - it does this somewhat in story but mostly in gameplay style. The result is a short cohesive experience that almost stands up there with Valve's single player campaigns (well almost - this is still just a little mod).+ detailed production, good pacing+ unique vertical/layered level design+ occasional puzzles and HL style set pieces+ surprisingly good soundtrack (partially new)+ challenging combat (compared to HL2)+ decent self contained story set in the HL universe- constant backtracking can get tedious and/or confusing at times- combat challenge mostly stems from endlessly respawning enemies- the character that should serve as a guide in the game world actually ends up being quite annoying - also the vague greek symbolism within the story is kind of forced and pretentious (but that can all be thankfully ignored)- frankly the pacing is so good (for a mod) that you inevitably forget you're playing a mod, and that means that sometimes the campaign can feel a bit lacking in polish (at least compared to HL2, one of the greatest games ever, mind you)			"

												A well done & free four-chapter campaign/mod developed from 2005-2007 which utilizes Half Life 2 resources. The difficulty is very high (even on Normal) but can be excused with an abundance of ammo and no quicksave penalty. While this island seems small on the outside: you are left to ""infiltrate and observe"" at your own pace. Storyline is presented well although predictable. Several multiple-path scenarios, some decent puzzle solving, lots of high tension encounters, and plenty of baddies keep things interesting.My only complaint is that most baddies take more than a clip to kill while all weapons have poor accuracy. Rushing & spraying most enemies can get frustrating. Perfect length for a campaign, which was about 5.5 hours while taking my time. Music is done well and used to bring tension.			"

												Fantastic little mod!The pacing seemed to cater more to those HL2 fans that want a good solid challenge, but the bits of exposition kept it from being to monotonous or unrewarding. Im a total sucker for mods that take what a player learned from a previous games and puts it to the test in a more stressful environment like this. To be fair though, there were a few parts that had me scratching my head, mostly due to pathways I didnt see or lights that didnt appear when they needed to but it was never during a combat segment so I wasnt too upset. The best part about the way this was set up was that you always feel slightly pressured, in a good gameplay friendly kind of way. Often times huge pauses in combat hinder immersion of the experience but I felt urgent about my task all the way through. The dialouge with 'Athena' and the cleverly designed environments added to this sense of impending doom and picked up the aesthetic slack when I wasnt being shot at by Combine. This constant nipping at my heels kept me engaged from begining to end (especially the end.)You know gaming experience is good when you sit back in your chair after finishing the final area and let out a breathy explative in a mix of satifaction and relief. Which is what I did.Its good, play it.			"

												DEFINITELY had to write a review for this one. If you like Half Life, you NEED to play this mod.This was the first time in a long time that I felt like I was playing something truly set in the Half Life universe. I stopped thinking ""wow this is a great mod"" and kept thinking ""wow this is an actual Half Life game."" Valve also basically accepts it all as canon as the guy was hired on by Valve after this mod's completion, and he went on to work on Portal 2 and is working on whatever form of Half Life currently exists within the Valve offices.Excellent design and the story - though somewhat light, doesn't actually FEEL light. It's intriguing, and Adam Foster excels at storytelling even through the environment, making the gameplay flow smoothly and just feels more open and fluid than most level designs even in a lot of modern day games.Just, please play it. It's so good. Adam Foster contributed to the greatness of Portal 2, and his hand will be at work in whatever Half Life comes out next, whenever that might be.			"

												I fell in love with this game the minute I hit the shore. I keep playing it over and over, in fact I can't quit playing it. It just got into my blood you might say. It's action packed with never a dull moment. You not only have the Combine soldiers hitting you but there is a constant barage of head crabs, zombies, turrets, manhacks and the machine you are trying to destroy as well as the complex layout of the place. Man you can get lost and turned around in there. The new music composed for the game as well as the existing music from episode 1 also makes the games very intriguing. The puzzles are excellent and are the kind that really exercise your imagination thinking ability. I also like the length of the game, you don't get tired of playing. I highy recommend this game as a valuable addition to your gaming library.			"

												This is a tough thing to review. I have mixed feelings about level design - Sometimes you are told about a ""door"" which turns out to be a metal plate in the wall. Sometimes you are told to do damage to some crappy reactor - It turns out you're supposed to dump crates inside of it. Some puzzles were tough.Certain fights seem badly setup - enemies in a bunch as if they just spawned and didn't even walk apart. The chase scene were you run away from soldiers without weapons. That was very fun, but you are supposed to wait for the next area to open, while most people would run away and not wait for the door assuming it was closed.There's also the thing with breakable scene elementns. No, a sparking piece of metal in a huge collapsing cluster♥♥♥♥ of identical surroundings is not enough to attract my attention.Despite of it's many shortcomings I suppose I sort of, enjoyed this mod? I felt more happy at the end then I did at the end of HL2, and that says something. The level design really wasn't that bad, since I never consulted a walkthrough. I did on multiple occasions during my HL playthrough and that game's level design is considered to be amazing. It's only two hours long but trust me - it feels a lot longer than that. In a good way.So yeah, check this out! Definitely worth your time. I certainly wouldn't buy it if it was paid, but it's free!			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's all I have to say.This game kept me thinking! Hell, I was stuck on a few parts for extensive periods of time.While playing through this mod, I noticed a few things that were similar to the original Half-Life.You don't get too many supplies that make you fell over-powered.Or too little supplies that make you feel too under-powered.The only problem I actually had with this was trying to read the text in the upper right corner,and the auto saves. You need to have more frequent auto saves.I died just after this long elevator part and it took me all the way back to the start of the elevator.Please, add more auto saves so you're not repeating too much.Thanks for the great game!

												This mod is basically a little side story of the Half-Life series. Do you play as Gordon Freeman? Possibly, but the game never explains who you are or who you're working for. The game plays pretty much like Half-Life 2 but the difficulty is ramped up with stronger enemies which you gotta put down hard. There are also way more of them. I found myself getting surrounded if I moved forward too quickly. The game has some challenging puzzles that you'll have to think outside the Half-Life box to progress. The game looks great and the music really builds on the atmosphere the developers created. One thing that really makes this game stand out is the level design. Very good use of the environments which feel more like the original Half-Life. I highly recommend giving this one a go if you are a Half-Life fan. Even if you haven't played through the half-life series I would still recommend this game.			"

												This mod requires ownership of Half-Life 2: Episode 1. This review also assumes you already own and have completed Half-Life 2 and its two episodes.Mod: Minerva: MetastasisFor the game: Half-Life 2Developer and publisher: Adam FosterReleased: 28 April, 2013Genre: First-Person Shooter with HorrorCanon status: Non-canonSetting: 15 October, 2009, an unnamed island, Baltic Sea, Europe, EarthSpoiler-free plot summary: You play as an unnamed renegade Combine soldier only referred to as Perseus. After arriving on an island controlled by the Combine, a mysterious member of the Resistance, only referred to as Minerva, guides you via on-screen messages on your quest to destroy the facility built beneath the island.Full review: Minerva is a short and mildly difficult mod for Half-Life 2: Episode 1. This mod is no doubt one of the best Half-Life mods ever created, and Valve must have thought so too because they ended up hiring Adam Foster to work with them!Another Half-Life 2 mod, more typical Half-Life 2 gameplay of running-and-gunning and solving a few puzzles. No new game mechanics are introduced like several other Half-Life mods; instead, this mod is based on level design. Being set in an underground facility beneath a small island, the levels in Minerva are very vertical. You'll find that most of the combat sequences require shooting at enemies above and/or below you, and that navigating can be very maze-like, especially in the final sequence, when the facility begins to self destruct and you have to run through the now ruined areas you previously went through.Dialogue with Minerva can be quite awkward; if you proceed through levels too quickly, her messages will overlap, so you can miss out on crucial information, like how to solve a puzzle, and because the text is bright orange, you won't be able to read her messages in bright areas or against brightly-colored surfaces.Do I recommend Minerva? Yes; it's higher in quality compared to other Half-Life mods, and it can entertain you for a couple of hours. If Half-Life 2 is a meal and its episodes are dessert, then this mod is a breath mint; small and sweet.			"

												Gameplay: The gameplay is very true to Half-life 2. This feels it could slot right alongside the other missions in HL2. Seriously, the level design, enemy placements, and puzzles are right on par. This excellent work, so not much explaining needed if you're familiar with Half-life gameplay... which you probably are if you're reading this.Story: I missed quite a bit of the story. It's conveyed through long text boxes that pop up on-screen. It pretty much takes the place of voice-acting. This is a downside, but not a big deal for a free mod.Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is true to Half-life games of old. The island gives you plenty of areas to explore, like the usual old buildings, worn down docks on beachfronts, and combine infrastructures. The one change is that there is a decent mist or darkness cast over the island. This fit with the more subdued and smoother soundtrack.Overall: Excellent game! If you're suffering from Half-life withdrawal and need a lifeline, this is the game for you! It's a free mod, that's about a 4 hour playthrough and the quality is certainly there.			"

												Great game(mod), very nicely written, beatiful scenery, it brings you back in the Half-Life universe/atmosphere with a few interesting twists.The game is finishable in one sitting, depending on the difficulty, it's about 3 hours long. It could've been longer with a slightly more interesting finale, you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there, but it felt good playing it nonetheless.My only regret is that I knew about this mod for a few years and I only gave it a shot this late.

												I freaking love this game! It almost perfectly recaptures  the atmosphere of Half-Life 2 in an original setting - specifically, a Combine outpost on an island involved in some underhand business that you, the former Combine soldier nicknamed ""Perseus"" directed by ""Minerva"", the mysterious overseer of your onslaught through the base from her secret underground hideout. Personally, I reckon that Minerva is actually LM, the original head of Black Mesa.Why? Simple.1) The Greek Gods reference. Oh wait, that's Cave Johnson. Hmm, then again, that could be something else...2) ""I played a large part in mankind's discovery of this, although few would like to admit it.""3) https://hylobatidae.org/minerva/archive_4.shtml 4) ""Please don't take it as some residual aspect of my own purported humanity"", which indicates some Combine involvement at some point - I could speculate, but I won't.5) SHE HAS AN UNDERGROUND BASE?But anyway, it's a fun game with a great storyline and I hope (though I don't expect) Out of Time recieves a swift release.

												Might as well have been another episode to HL2.  MINERVA was a very enjoyable experience that didn't necessarily introduce anything new but is of such high quality that it's difficult to remember that it wasn't made my the developers themselves.  Well, I suppose it was, as this mod was so damn good it got the dude a position at Valve...What narrative that exists is told in a very subtle HL fashion.  I found it to be very interesting and moving.Action was superb.  Pacing was very similar to how it was in HL2 so you never get too tired of this. Puzzles were minimal at best, but they exist and they're believable while still contributing to the atmosphere.Level design is what makes this mod stand out.  I guess the creator used an approach that revolved around efficient use of space rather than expanding the levels on the X axis; you therefore have very small, tightly-packed levels that are well designed and have more use of verticality than you would typically see in a game.Overall I liked it very much.  Fantastic mod, and I look forward to seeing more of this guy's work.			"

												Just finished my first playthrough of MINERVA: Metastasis. What an excellent, excellent mod. It is all the more impressive when you know it's been made by one guy, who went on to be hired by Valve.And no wonder: the level design is excellent. None of those frequent loading screens that plague Source games. In fact, I only remembering one loading screen in a 4-hour playthrough of massive proportions. It makes great use of space, compressing game areas, using verticality, sending you back and forth sometimes - never tediously.Another excellent bit is the pacing. This is a brutal fight from start to finish, with intermittent calm stretches. The rhythm is perfect. The modder manages to craft action sequences within HL2's trademark limited perspective. Unlike modern games where you feel like you are watching your character do all the cool stuff, here you get to do them yourself.At one point, you are stripped of all your weapons & ammo, and soon an avalanche of enemies is unleashed on you and you must scramble down foreign corridors, frantically searching for an armory, solving puzzles at lightning speed with your pursuers hot on your heels.Even though the game is linear, in true HL fashion, I often found myself stuck, only to finally go ""of course!"" notice and solve a mini-puzzle, and proceed to the next bit. It's refreshing to once again play a game that doesn't hold your hand - I can't help but be used to that by now, with modern games going out of their way to nudge you in the right direction at all times.So yes, breathtaking difficulty - of the thrilling kind, not the frustrating kind - and no hand holding. Although if you stay stuck for a long long time, there is a subtle and plot-appropriate hint system.The plot is very basic, but very intriguing. It doesn't get in the way, and it's not an afterthought by any means - but it leaves you with questions, and that's very cool.One last thing - the mod uses some HL2 musical tracks, but there's an additional musical score that's awesome, and I must acquire it.

												One of the best HL2 mods I've played.  Decent story line, really good map design, well-rounded difficulty.  Very recommended...  One thing I didn't like is the ally character constantly sending text messages that appear on your screen.  I had to keep stopping what I was doing, find a corner to hide in then read the 2 paragraphs of text I was receiving.  I appreciate the story, but with a mod this in depth, you couldn't have recorded some audio, or at least used some sort of TTS?  Doesn't take away too much from the game, but just a suggestion...

												I dare say this is damn near a masterpiece. On more than one occasion, this phenomenal game is better than Half-Life 2 itself. The level design is some of the smartest I've ever played. Its pacing is also a great mix of suspense and tension, never leaving me bored the way some sections of HL2 did. Minerva's use of the HL universe is also fantastic. It cleverly builds on the existing material and pushes to delve deeper into the Combine's sinister plots. The game isn't without its problems however. I found myself lost twice, having to look up the solution in a walkthrough. The problem would have easily been caught by a larger QA team, so it's hard to hold that against the creator. I also would really have preferred a voiced narration instead of blocks of text. The story was well written, but reading so much text in between firefights kind of pulled me out of the action. Again, this is easily forgiven for what is essentially a one-man project, but it would have really helped the pacing.Overall, this was without a doubt the best Half-Life 2 ‘mod’ I’ve ever played. But what’s more, this one-man game was one of the best FPS’s I’ve ever played. While it lacks the polish of most other games, it more than makes up for that in cleverness, style, and execution. A fantastic ride from start to finish. "

												Possibly the best singleplayer Half-Life 2 mod ever made. What really makes it an instant classic for mod-lovers is the approach to narrative story telling. Like most games it doesnt lay the story out in front of you, instead it forces you to find out, and causes you to wonder; that is an excellent thing. The level design and general gameplay experience is also enjoyable and very consistent with that of the rest of the Half-Life 2.

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 3.4 hoursMINERVA, or MINERVA: Metastasis are one and the same thing. Throughout the years I've heard people using both names and so I thought there was a sequel, but in truth it is not. This is the sole mod.I enjoyed it. From a well-delivered story to outstanding level design, MINERVA is packed with non-stop action. It contains what made Half-Life 2 great, or shall I say...Episode One? Now that I think about it each Half-Life game (aside from the first's expansions, mostly) has had its own, unique taste. Episode One, for example, had those creepy encounters and focus on Antilion/Zombie combat, but is at the same time hideous in pacing. You get the crowbar waaay later on. This is another story, but even with that said I'd have to compare MINERVA to Episode One. It does not have the same horrible pacing, but it has the same familiarity. Half of the game is Combine combat, the other is mixed. You can feel the same vibes present.I will not spoil the story more than I should, but the text-on-screen method of storytelling worked nicely, unlike most of the time you'd seen it fail. You are an ex-Combine soldier who's gone head-on into a Combine facility buried deep within an island. That's it for one, but it gets much more interesting along the way.Now the only significant thing that has bothered me (no bugs/glitches encountered, guess I was lucky) was that our protagonist still wears the HEV suit model from the original game. Like, yes, it is a hazard suit, but why the same look? Wouldn't it be a little more fitting to have some black jumpsuit with armor pieces strapped on? I considered this to be a little immersion-breaking, but to be honest it's not something that will bother you a lot. The constant tension in between will make sure of that.A great deal of work has been put into this map, and I'd like to congratulate the author. A must-try for Half-Life fans. Let's not even talk about the fact that it's free, but you still need to own Episode One. I suppose you do, innit?			"

												Whoever did this game deserves a medal. It is everything I love about HL2; I haven't finished but I cannot believe it will be dimished as I do finish it. This developer certainly has the same feeling for this most wonderful game as I do as well as more talent!Like HL2? Play this.			"

												For me, this mod is a great way to just.. Get all the memories back about the Half-Life 2 series and it's story.It also can make others experience and see that even a modder like Adam Foster, you can make things like this with the Source Engine tool only! :D. It has indeed inspired me :). Even though, you'll need to prepare yourself and have the time and skills to do things and mods like this one :PAnyway, about the game itself and the experience that I will share with my words, it gives what everyone want's, action. There are very cool map design and story-line to it basically and much more! There is not much that I can say about what I've experienced by playing it for 2 hours straight, as I'm quite indeed out of words and shocked about how you can make such an successful mod like this. But, you'll enjoy yourself with the vision and story it brings! "

												I did finish this Half-Life 2 mod in 2.3 hours.(Finished in one sitting) You could finish the game faster if you figure out how to progress faster than I did while playing. ""I never cheated, and figured things out myself."" - (Just a side note)Review PortionFun and actually very beautifully put together Half-Life 2 mod. Awesome scenery, the level design is good just can be a little confusing. Not everything is pointed out right away so you can progress, but as I found you normally find out how to progress eventually. I recommend to anyone wanting to go back to shooting the combine and/or headcrabs.One negative aspect I noticed while playing is that there is no dialog. There are only messages you need to read to understand the story as you progress. This took my immersion away personally. Most people I know like to have dialog in there game, and this game is just lacking in it. I did enjoy the game, it just felt like wasted time when there was nothing that really motivated me to play the game which adding dialog in the future could definitely do. If this game adds dialog to the story, and the dialog is good then I would definitely recommend playing this game!Another positive is that it is free, which is umm how can I say? Awesome!			"

												Great game, I think the best mod out there.  It changes the HL experience but with the same similar gampplay, as the enemies are more realistic, harder to kill, sneaky little gits, the ammo is well placed and in good but not exhaustive quantities, you need to use grenades rather than blast your way through.  The story and use of the area's is good, with retracing steps, especially to escape, as you would expect going into a facility like that.Thoroughly enjoyed it, great work!			"

												This is the best Half-Life 2 mod I have ever played. At some parts, it is hard to know what to do such figuring out what to shoot to make a broken elevator come down. Or fighting off an infinite horde of zombines and fast zombies for 30 minutes and realising you have to throw a grenade at the back of a door through a bent floor to unlock it. This was also the first time I was scared in a Half-Life 2 mod. Those hordes of zombines are spooky 0.o I got lost alot but always found my way with the help of Minerva. The game looks amazing and runs smoothly. It has a great story and it explains where those ♥♥♥♥ing evil poison headcrabs and dirty scumbag fast headcrabs came from. I HATE POISON HEADCRABS!!! I definetley recommend to any Half-Life 2 fans. I rate 9/10 (the minus 1 is for the maps that I got lost in and the unclear objectives of some areas). I defnitley understand why this mod got the creator a spot at Valve.Try out the creator of Minerva's mod for Half-Life 1 called Someplace Else. It has some impressive level design and an interesting architecture.			"

												The Mod Minerva has returned in the form of an updated ""Director's Cut"" edition.In Minerva, the player is an anonymous person who is hinted to be a renegade Overwatch Soldier. During the game you are guided by the mysterious MINERVA. The player is deployed on a tiny island occupied by the Combine - an island which hosts a huge facility - with the goal of infiltrating it and discovering its purpose.The mod has nothing to do with the Half-Life 2 storyline but it shares the same universe. Minerva Metastasis has an amazing level design and ambiance, an excellent soundtrack and a good story.In my opinion one of the best mods for Half-Life 2.Sounds 8/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												A very well made mod outside a few things:The texts can be hard to read, not having enough time to read in peace was oftenly a problem.At times there's just too many enemies and not a single one at others when you'd expect at least someone guarding the room.The first layer of the base wasn't always using assets fitting the background (this isn't City 17 obviously).The endless zombie wave can be problematic if you don't find what to do, having zombies spawning all the time didn't help.

												MINEVA the Half Life 2 mod is great. Why you my ask? Well If you keep reading I'll tell you. In MINERVA you go onto a island to defeat the combine. At first you infiltrate the island (not very stealthy I might add) and then desend into the depths of the facility to learn its secerts. The level design is good, and the way they use Half Life assets to create new ones is impressive. It plays like Half Life 2 but there is a minor diffrence, you recive messages from the person who sent you on the mission.This is one of the few problems I have with the game.The person messaging you is unbearable through most of the game saying the most annoying and cruel things to you.  Even though he softens up at the end of the game, you still have to deal with a this complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for half the game. Although the environments are beautiful puzzles can be...confusing, to say the least. MINERVA has a nasty habit of making puzzles irritating simple, yet cause ""How the hell was I supose to know that"" sort of reaction. The story is decent, you are on a mission to investigate this island. However, it gets more complicated the further you go.  Like headcrab experiments, and a super portal.  However I have on minor complaint about it.  How did they get a satalite? Why did they not use this super laser before? Coulda been useful, just sayin. However, it didn't damage the experience as a whole. If your into Half Life 2 (and have episode 1 installed) Dowload this game! Its good to kill an hour or two.			"

												Awesome mod, i can see why valve hired the creator. Great level design, decent story. However, there are some game elements in this mod that half life games don't have which can cause great confusion and frustration: You need to break some supports for a platform above you in order to continue progressing. This is unexpected and not really hinted to at all. It took me about an hour to find out what i needed to do. Otherwise great mod, if a little short.			"

												After reading about the creation of this game and it's creator, I must agree that the level design is excellent. Very effective use of the space in each level, limiting loading times and allowing players to eventually go just about everywhere that they can see. The game also has a nice difficulty level, accommodating Half-life veterans who are not new to these weapons and tactics. It was fun to dive back into this world fighting the combine, as there have been no Valve Half-life releases in quite some time (2007 at the time of this writing).

												I remember playing this a few years ago and it was fun. Why did i stop? no clue what so ever i just seemed to have completely forgotten of this games existance. Highest of quality half life mod you can get for free; there aren't any better quality HL2 mods you can buy. Extremely well made maps (although the island up top makes me feel like im playing Halo on the Silent Crytographer Map over and over again, which i loved... Nostalgia) Although Half life gameplay has become rather predictable for me i still enjoyed puzzling my way through the boundless amount of Combine like some sort of 653 Tank Battalion that consists of tanks that are as big as a city block with more guns than people on earth.... but thats the appeal of Half life. How ever the f*cken unbearable amount of reading can get off putting at least theres enough time to read it all.10/10 would run around with the 1st barrel i c and an SMG again!Side note, not on topic.... i noticed if you are quick enough with the crouch button you can actually ""crouch"" at a higher position than normal. E.x. you have a barrel in front of a door that leads to combine city you can hold yourself at a position just high enough for you to shoot over the barrel while protecting yourself. How i never knew of this......... i will never fully understand.			"

												After reading about the creation of this game and it's creator, I must agree that the level design is excellent. Very effective use of the space in each level, limiting loading times and allowing players to eventually go just about everywhere that they can see. The game also has a nice difficulty level, accommodating Half-life veterans who are not new to these weapons and tactics. It was fun to dive back into this world fighting the combine, as there have been no Valve Half-life releases in quite some time (2007 at the time of this writing). The only issue I had with the title were a couple of the environmental puzzles. Perhaps 2-3 times in the game, I actually consulted a walkthrough to progress. One in particular, where the player is expected to shoot a ""weak"" support beam for a platform located overhead, I was pretty baffled.If you miss Half-life, give Minerva a shot.			"

												MINERVA was a modification that was thoroughly enjoyable to play. Crafted to the level of quality where one could have thought that it was one of Valve's creations. Nicely paced combat, well thought places for health and ammunition refills, and a nice challenge. The story was driven through an enigmatic narrator, which created a nice dynamic to the game. A gripping edge-of-the-seat experience, which I played through in one sitting. The only negative thing really, and this doesn't actually count as negative, was the relative shortness and the vagueness of information given about the elements of the story. But then again the vagueness sparks imagination in it's own way, and fits in the Valve's style of not revealing too much information. If you search for a new delve into the universe of Half-Life, look no further.			"

												Minerva: Metastasis is a masterpiece. The level design is on par with a Valve production. Although it is a grueling, uncompromising task, it dosnt detract from the game as a whole. The only gripe I can level is the lack of the gravity gun. The pacing of the mod is brutal. And the enemies are always better equiped and brink on being overwhelming at times. Having completed on hard, I can say that it is definetly not impossible. The story is fresh and well written. The constant jabs by the unknown 'director' are almost enough to feel like taunts at your present lack of skill. The music is amazing. The track that plays when entering the headcrab facility resonates dread and melancholy. The music really sets the mood and tone for the whole adventure. This is a truly awesome mod and the author deserves a job at Valve if he hasnt been offered one already. For something that doesnt charge admission save for owning Half-Life 2 Episode 1, there is no reason to miss out on this. Truly amazing!			"

Minerva has veeeeery good level design. Great pacing, very challenging. The Combine Soldier's AI feels much smarter here than it did in Episode One, but I'm not sure if it was modified, or if it just works better with these maps.This is the best missionpack mod for HL2, imo. Adam Foster truly does deserve his place at Valve. Don't know what more should be said, it's free HL2 goodness.Oh, and don't forget to check out Someplace Else. Minerva is the sequel to it.			"

												- More enemies that you would be facing in HL2. All of them are thrown at you right from the start.Save. Save often.- A map of some sort is badly needed here. The levels are much more twisting than in HL2 inself. You can end up walking in cicles considering how levels are vast and interior sometimes gets rather similar - levels are (imo) well designed (not repetitive), but navigating them at times is just difficult.

Now that's fine and dandy but what excactly is he doing now? There certainly isn't a Half-Life 3 now is there?-Game has no voice acting(Unless you count Combine and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that) so there is text that shows up on your screen which at times is very hard to readOverall: Highly recommended.

												This game is a pretty nice game, but has some minor flaws.Story: I really liked the story and how it's like the hl1 expansions where you don't play as gordon. In this game, you play as a ex-combine soldier so it's kind-of like hl:op where you play as the hecu/combine.Gameplay: The gameplay is normal hl2 gameplay so nothing bad here.Enviroments: The levels were wonderful! You can tell that Adam Foster put a lot of effort into the suroundings. The amibent music also drew me into feeling like I was there on that combine island.Length: This is my only downflaw with the game, the game was too short. If I did really well in this game and knew what I was doing, then I could beat it in about 4-5 hours. Difficulty: Minerva seemed harder than hl2,ep1,ep2 on normal when playing this game on easy. Also there are some parts where the game expected to do quite hard things. For example, in the beginning you are attacked by rollermines. You don't have a gravity gun yet and are expected to lead the rollermines into the water, but there were leches in the water. Now Minerva isn't a hard game, it's just that there are some difficulty spikes that are somewhat minor. Overall: Minerva is a fantastic ep1 mod. If your a hl2 fan then I would recomend downloading this game, IT'S FREE!			"

												HL2 is my favorite game. Minerva is playable, but the Combine soldiers are literally everywhere. I consioder myself pretty experienced and I died like 10 times in the first 5 minutes of gameplay. If super-challenging face-paced gameplay is your thing, than this game is for you.  Also, idk why but these soldiers take significantly more hits to kill than just you regular HL2 combine soldiers. I stood face to face with one, he kept hitting me, and I emptied three clips with a Machine gun, and he killed me.			"

												I gotta say if it's action you're looking for, this mod gives it in spades. The island is thick with enemies and yet at the same time it's storyline and plot are paper thin and vague as hell as to why you're even there to begin with. You'll get these weird cryptic messages prattling on about Greek mythology and what to do to further your mission (Something about observing and analysing stuff) and how you're insignificant and worthless (Not sure where they were going with that aspect....)It's challenging and fun but at the same time annoying and vague. Though I did enjoy my time with the mod, I'll say from my perspective the bad outweighs the good. Enemy difficulty is artficially inflated to somewhat ridiculous levels. Just to kill a single combine soldier you'll need to pump about 40-50% of your weapon magazine into them. Found out the magnum got nerfed as I aimed at a combine soldier's head at point blank range and squeezed the trigger. He punched me several times and finally went down after a second shot. It also doesn't help that the A.I's only real strategy is to bum rush the player with overwhelming numbers. The game really doesn't make it clear at times that you might need to do a little bit of backtracking to find new paths you have opened. Oh and I also forgot to mention this game just LOVES to spawn large hordes of soldiers or monsters behind you. I never once needed to turn down the difficulty but the last part of the game was just one big ol' monster spawn marathon. After I beat the mod it just didn't feel fun to me......almost felt like work. But hey YMMV (your miles may vary)  As always I say give the mod a spin for yourself before you go taking anyone else's word for it.			"

												Minerva is a two hour FPS set in the universe of HL2. It has probably the most beautiful maps and design I have seen in a source game or mod since playing through Shadgrimgrvy's Paranoia map series. It has decent sound design, and an overall above average story (that I'd rather not spoil). However, it simply is far too difficult to be fun. The majority of encounters in this mod consist of seemingly buffed enemies, with numerous units. Generally, you are armed with weapons that are inneffective, and twice in the story, you are forced to lose all of your weapons. These are followed by encounters that are frequently annoying or cause you to die more than you really should half to.In fact, the very ending of the game is the easiest encounter, which is strange considering that it's a battle with a gunship.Overall, the difficulty of this game is almost to the level of being heinous, and it never stops forcing you through encounters, no respites or times to really admire the rather beautiful scenery, or just take in the sounds of the world. The game is just poorly balanced combat- and the difficulty settings hardly seem to work. I know the difficulty is the only thing I'm talking about, but it honestly is just that bad.If you want to learn how not to balance a game, or see what you can really do with the source Hammer editor, then I'd really suggest giving it a shot. Otherwise, just look at the screenshots section. I do have to repeat that it is a really pretty game, and that if you are an aspiring source mapper, then you should spend the two hours with it.			"

												So, this game was suggested to me by a friend and he said it adds more to the Half-Life 2 storyline. I played about 60 minutes of this game...And I never want to play it again. Yes I know it's not exactly enough to make a review but in that small amount of time I already hate this game with all my heart. But hey! I'm going to give it credit for breaking the rage quit record in my playthrough history (right next to Mass Effect 3.)Gameplay: it's pretty much the same as Half-Life 2, no new content added...Well, except for the fact that you're instantly thrown into the game with useless weapons! no sneaking, no strategy like Half-Life 2 demanded. No, instead it just throws you on the island with about 3-4 gunners spamming grenades and killing you almost instantly before you know what happened to you. The A.I however is what I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about. It feels somehow...altered, some of the actions the A.I commits is out of character. As for why the A.I has been altered I'm not entirely sure, my main assumption is to fit the mod creator's sported preferences. Either way this game is pretty much a free stress test on your mind. Also I should probably mention that the mobs have infinite spawn so good luck trying to create yourself some time to process what you're doing.The Story: You play as Gordon Freeman, you have been supposedly ""saved"" from the Combine. Your goal: kill everything and listen to a smartass over the comm channel. This is obviously poorly written fan fiction-- now of course you may just say ""Peter, don't be harsh! everyone has their version of the story"" you have no idea how long I've been reading this excuse someone out there counts as a storyline.""Pip pip cheero good man! I am your Athena! you are my ♥♥♥♥♥ perseus! and this island is Medusa! would you be a dear and kill every moving thing while listenning to me as I explain everything to you in a swimming fancy way? Oh joy! allow me to show off my intelligence by saying words your tiny mind would have no understanding! Dulce et decorum est pro terra mori! I feel so smarter than you right now! teehee"" This story has no connection at all with Half-life 2 so don't even bother trying to find a place to tuck it in the current universe (that's the mistake I made with Half-life: Before.) Now do you understand why I hate fanfiction? you want to write it? fine, but please don't turn it into a physical thing that has the potential to punch someone in the gutt...Potentially me that is.Final verdict: I'm giving this mod a 0/10. It has done nothing in any way to impress me or surprise me except chuck 50 bots at me then give me this prick I have to read as a reward! It's like spending hours slaying a dragon for the princess but instead all you get is a picture of the princess you were saving as a reward. I know there isn't a whole lot you can do without a large developement team but this was sad beyond words, and painful to just pay any serious amount of attention too.			"

												Meh, nothing special. Boring level design, boring story, boring enemies etc.. just a very boring mod. I've read somewhere that it was just as good as Half-Life 2 with the over all design. I didn't at all like it, not just a tiny bit. It's bad. I didn't finish, think I got half way through according to the number of chapters..			"

												-NOTE- I have not yet seen actual gameplay, read the rest of the review please.I looked at this game on the steam page and thought this game looked pretty amazing, however, after installing it last night I had to go off to bed, the computer remained on for the next hour or so, then when I got up in the morning to play it, I got the error ""Could not load library client."", due to this error and the lack of reliable ways to fix it (I searched on the forums and google for a good hour), I cannot reccomend this game untill it is fixed, and due to the fact that people have been having this error since October last year, I doubt there will be one.-Have Tried:Writing ""-game metastasis"" (without quotes) into ""launch options"".Copying ""client.dll"" from hl2/episodic.Verifying every hl2 game and every Source SDK.Restarting steam (multiple times)May try reinstalling at a later time.

I cannot believe half-life 3 is not out yet ( I guess the creators are tired of making a ton of money) but Minerva could be considered a third Half-life, and it's free???? GREAT (that, I cannot believe, but good for all of us gamers). If you love half- life, you'll love Minerva too.  Thumbs up to the creator.			"

												First off: it's a bit short (2 - 3 hours) and it doesn't come with voiced dialogue. There is dialouge, but it comes in the form of a communications log. With an invisible timer (Bah!) Also: mouse acceleration. There's no raw mouse input :(So, the good parts? The quality of level design is probably on-par with the other Half-Life games. It doesn't hold your hand or force you into cut-scenes/scripted events, yet it's often clear enough where to go.  And while the dialogue is text-based, that doesn't mean that it isn't worth reading.This is ideal for when you just want more Half-Life after having played Half-Life 2, HL2: Episode 1 and HL2: Episode 2. Especially since, at this moment, the full Black Mesa release might still take a while before it's released. And Half-Life 3? Yeah... Who knows?			"

												Awesome mod, a must play for any HL2 fan.Story is told though messages sent to you by a mysterious resistance member who calls herself ""Minerva""Minerva has great dialog, she is a character you come to love and hate at the same time.The level design is grat, with multiple segments of the level that pass by just before it manages to get boring.Some people complain about the difficulty, yes it is harder than standard HL2. I consider this a plus.Enemy placement is well thought out and reinforcements generally appear at the right time to keep firefights going.It's short, but overall a good 4 hours or so, and it's free so nothing to complain about really.

												This is an awesome mod by a very talented designer, Adam Foster, who now works at Valve. While linear it feels very open. Enemy engagments feel as if they can happen at any moment instead of feeling like the player simply activated a trigger. The level design is some of the most beautiful I have seen in mod. This is what you would call an ""anti-mod"", no new assets were created to make it. Foster instead uses existing HL2 assets in new and interesting ways.If you own Half-Life 1, you can also play one of his older mods, Someplace Else. It is very good as well.			"

												Thirsty for a new taste in the Half-Life universe?  Search no more beleagured Valve fanperson!  While the company behind the release waits to release an entirely new engine to debut  new Half Life content the mod community goes out and produces a gem like this.  The story is provided through text and the action is all you would expect from the Half-Life series.No gravity gun to help you here.  A few of the puzzles took a bit of searching and the descriptions of how to move the plot forward can be vague at times but the overall experience left me chomping at the bit for another installment.

												I enjoyed this a lot, playing on a friends PC. I'm fairly new to the Half Life legend and in fact, FPS's all together. But as an intro to the genre (for me, not the game series), I was hooked enough to investigate Half Life 2 and buy it all from the begining. Thrown in at the deep end, I've taken at least three times as long as anybody else to complete this mod! Loved the graphics and the interface, as this made playing Half Life 2 even better as I already knew all the controls. Well done, Valve, you have another fan.			"

												Though not very long, Minerva: Metastasis is an Interesting, Action-Packed shooter, based off the Half Life universe (taking course during or after Half Life 2.) It's very fun to play, not too long to last a week, but just long enough to last a day or two (finished it in one evening.) It's basically more of what you liked from Half Life 2, in a completely new story, with new caracters. Totally recommend if you're a Half Life fan. If not, still give it a chance and you might like it.Also what's with the steam database Half Life 3 leak? Is it a prank or is it for real this time?			"

PSN with their $60 Steam knockoff. Companies like Ubisoft and EA with DRMS and the hateful software known as UPlay and Origin. 3 Gaben said,""My company will not put up with this, from now on only Valve will be a long-lastingly successful company."" 4 In those days and for some time after, giant corporations such as Ubisoft created games, and whenever they produced a game, they became the the favorite titles of the peasants of ancient times. 5 Gaben observed the extent of the wickedness of game developers, releasing pre-purchases and early access, seeing that they were wholly and totally evil. 6 So Gaben regretted ever putting these games on steam, it broke his heart. 7 So Gaben said,""I will wipe the Valve Corporation of the filth of these companies and I will destroy all of them.

It has everything you've ever wanted from a Half-Life game, without being official!  Well-made levels, an intriguing story plot, great combat, and even puzzles!This game is like a side story for Half-Life 2, and it's incredibly well done.  It took me a good 2 and a half hours to get through, but even that didn't seem like enough.

												What a great mod for Half-Life 2: Episode 1, with a quality very close to Valve standards. It's basically a side-story with text instead of voice acting. The gameplay style differs by chapter: chapters 1 and 2 are very combat based, with labyrinthic maps that are tricky to navigate; chapter 3 is lighter, focusing in puzzle-solving; and chapter 4 is linear with combat, and is the one that most resembles the Half-Life 2 gameplay style. The game is polished and makes good use of the Source engine. It's more of Half-Life 2, and because it does it well i definitely recommend it.			"

												Amazing mod! This is the best mod I've seen probably EVER.  Beautiful, great combat, and puzzles. Half the time I didn't understand it :D, and have the time I was shooting headcrabs or combine stuffs. Lots of fun, not too difficult, and enjoyable. Play time through the game is about 1 hour, nt too short or too long. Minerva was awesome. Still wondering what that giant beam of light was for. ;-;.  Anyway, I find that is cna be confusing, and that is about it. I say best mod in a while (as in what I played.). I also really like sitting there thinking and figuring out it was something obvious. It was pretty, and I mean everywhere. Two best parts of it were the combat and the details. Interesting because it was made with Episode 1, not inside of the facility of course, that looked pretty episode 1 like. I kinda wish I got to meet the person messaging us, but too bad.			"

												What can I say? This mod is so good it made me forget it's not officially from Valve!It starts simple, with a simple task, and them escalates to something surprisingly bigger.If Half-Life 2 Lost Cost is a extra short chapter to Half-Life 2, Minerva is worth saying it's 4 full new chapters, presenting the player to the familiar gameplay, but with a completely new scenario. A side story to the Half-Life tale that don't interfere in the main plot, but still can add a significant and hight quality gameplay experience to the series.It's really worth playing while waiting for the next Half-Life game. And, hey, it's free.			"

												MINERVA is a highly recommendable Half-Life 2 mod, set during the Combine occupation of Earth in the Half-Life saga. With some great map design, including large scenarios and interconnected rooms, it provides plenty of options for ambushing your enemies, and it also allows the AI to shine, giving them plenty of places to take cover and flank the player.It's a great experience, in my opinion, and it really seems to fit within the Half-Life canon, although nobody at Valve has confirmed that. Even then, the fact that its creator, Adam Foster, ended up working at Valve, says something about the quality of this mod.			"

												No wonder the creator got a job at valve. This mod has great level design and overall pacing, feels like some actual half life campaign levels. It's rather difficult at times, especially on hard but if it gets unbearable, tone the difficulty down since there are some areas in which the developer should've toned it down himself.For those who enjoy the half life series and its gameplay, this is a no brainer. It's a 4-5 hour romp through an island which has some surprises here and there. Reminds me of the plot for half life and a bit of the portal series even if it's coincidential since it came out before Portal.Highly recommended, just don't be afraid to lower the difficulty level from time to time.

												(This is more of a journal of thoughts than a review, sorry if I'm not too clear on some things).I completed my first playthrough in a little over 2.5 hours on normal difficulty, probably half an hour of which was being stuck (three specific areas, one of which I feel incredibly stupid for being stuck on). Minerva is a challenging game, compared to Half-Life 2 and it's episodes, at least. Level design is interesting and gorgeous, albeit a couple of parts that aren't too clear on how to proceed, and some issues w/ framerate. There's four loading screens throughout the entire game, and each level is fairly huge, so I experienced quite a few frame drops... big ones: 300 fps - below 40 fps at times, and hovering around 60-120 while looking in some directions (I'm running a GTX 770 and an AMD 8 core, and I tried lowering the graphics settings to no avail).Combat is challenging and on occasion relentless, but you're given plenty of opportunity and supplies to restock and fight on (the pacing of this mod reminds me a bit of another HL2 mod, Station 51, only that was shorter). I dont know if it's just me, but the enemies seem tougher on normal than in the other hl2 games.I just finished the game at the time of writing this, so these are first impressions. The game left enough of an impression on me to make me write something on it. For a free mod, I'd say it's worth your time, especially if you're into Half-Life 2 inspired settings and challenging gameplay.My personal score: 7 out of 10 - was a bit frustrating, especially with staggering frame drops here and there hindering combat (nobody else I've seen mentioned this problem, so you might be good), but aside from that I enjoyed it. Maps are beautiful and for the most part straight forward, and I had a challenge in a Half-Life game that I havent had in years.			"

												I don't know what to say... I guess I'll just repeat what the vast majority of people of played this say.MINERVA is a mod that is comparable to Half-Life 1's Opposing Force and Blue Shift Expansion Packs. MINERVA reuses the assets of Half-Life 2: Episode 1 to create a new expirience. It has a story and atmosphere that fit in with HL2, but is still fresh and interesting. The levels are extremely detailed and are of top-notch quality. Gameplay is the same old HL2, but it's not redundant or monotonus after playing HL2 and it feels right at home. The story doesn't clash with HL2's, so it doesn't feel like it's trying to replace it; instead adding to it.If you're not convinced in getting this, let me remind you that this was designed so well that it got him a job at Valve, the creators of the Half-Life series. There's a reason that he got hired, and this is it.Besides, if you have HL2: Episode 1 (which you most likely have if you've been linked here), it's completely free of charge, so if on the off-chance you don't like it, you lose no money. If you don't have Ep. 1, it is about $8, which is extremely low compared to the standard $60 price tag of most games. Add onto Steam's requent deals, and you can play this for nearly nothing.Now, I have to admit, I have not played much of the Steam re-release, so I don't have a good idea of how many changes were made. However, from what I have gathered, it is mostly the same as the original, with only bug-fixes and translations added.			"

												This game is a great addition to the half life series; It brings challenge, great level design, and great music to the table, and sculpts a grand experience from it. Pros: It has a barebones, albeit interesting background storyExcellent level designNice atmosphereIt's very, very well polished. During my playthrough, I didnt come accross a single gamebreaking bug.Challenging, but fair (imo)Cons:Checkpoints seem to be a bit sparse, nothing major, but it is a bit annoying every now and then.The AI at times is a bit odd, for example, if you're particularily fast at getting somewhere, soldiers who are supposed to be hunting you will run past you, firing potshots while desperately heading to the place where you entered the level. Also fast zombies ocasionally freeze or go into their default pose for a split second.During some scripted events you can run behind you or forward and find freshly spawned soldiers standing about waiting for you to trigger their arrival, but they will quickly snap out of it and fire on you.(I'm having a bit of a hard time finding other complaints, and even some of the ones I've listed feel nitpicky)Overall, I'd highly recommend this for someone who's longing for a new Half Life game, or someone who's just looking for a fun little shooter. It feels professional, it's fun, and it has a great feel to it!   "

												So much ingrained in the Half-Life universe that this feels every bit an installment in the series. Entirely too short for the depth of storytelling, variety and challenge. Veterans may be caught off guard by the difficulty, but it is welcome in the open world into which many have ventured their narratives in this universe.Get it.			"

												(This is more of a journal of thoughts than a review, sorry if I'm not too clear on some things).I completed my first playthrough in a little over 2.5 hours on normal difficulty, probably half an hour of which was being stuck (three specific areas, one of which I feel incredibly stupid for being stuck on). Minerva is a challenging game, compared to Half-Life 2 and it's episodes, at least. Level design is interesting and gorgeous, albeit a couple of parts that aren't too clear on how to proceed, and some issues w/ framerate. There's four loading screens throughout the entire game, and each level is fairly huge, so I experienced quite a few frame drops... big ones: 300 fps - below 40 fps at times, and hovering around 60-120 while looking in some directions (I'm running a GTX 770 and an AMD 8 core, and I tried lowering the graphics settings to no avail).Combat is challenging and on occasion relentless, but you're given plenty of opportunity and supplies to restock and fight on (the pacing of this mod reminds me a bit of another HL2 mod, Station 51, only that was shorter). I dont know if it's just me, but the enemies seem tougher on normal than in the other hl2 games.I just finished the game at the time of writing this, so these are first impressions. The game left enough of an impression on me to make me write something on it. For a free mod, I'd say it's worth your time, especially if you're into Half-Life 2 inspired settings and challenging gameplay.My personal score: 7 out of 10 - was a bit frustrating, especially with staggering frame drops here and there hindering combat (nobody else I've seen mentioned this problem, so you might be good), but aside from that I enjoyed it. Maps are beautiful and for the most part straight forward, and I had a challenge in a Half-Life game that I havent had in years.			"

												Awesome mod, a must play for any HL2 fan.Story is told though messages sent to you by a mysterious resistance member who calls herself ""Minerva""Minerva has great dialog, she is a character you come to love and hate at the same time.The level design is grat, with multiple segments of the level that pass by just before it manages to get boring.Some people complain about the difficulty, yes it is harder than standard HL2. I consider this a plus.Enemy placement is well thought out and reinforcements generally appear at the right time to keep firefights going.It's short, but overall a good 4 hours or so, and it's free so nothing to complain about really.

												First off: it's a bit short (2 - 3 hours) and it doesn't come with voiced dialogue. There is dialouge, but it comes in the form of a communications log. With an invisible timer (Bah!) Also: mouse acceleration. There's no raw mouse input :(So, the good parts? The quality of level design is probably on-par with the other Half-Life games. It doesn't hold your hand or force you into cut-scenes/scripted events, yet it's often clear enough where to go.  And while the dialogue is text-based, that doesn't mean that it isn't worth reading.This is ideal for when you just want more Half-Life after having played Half-Life 2, HL2: Episode 1 and HL2: Episode 2. Especially since, at this moment, the full Black Mesa release might still take a while before it's released. And Half-Life 3? Yeah... Who knows?			"

												Using only assets and mechanics from Half-Life 2 and its episodes - minus a few minors additions -, MINERVA still manages to deliver a gaming experience far different from Valve's game.From the nagging text monologues of the titular Minerva, strongly reminescent of System Shock's SHODAN and Marathon's Durandal, to the eldritch-ness, vastness and level of detail of the underground structure, the ambience is tense, cryptic and sometimes contemplative. The game is also challenging, both in its riddles and its combat, thanks to its unusual level design.Indeed, what really sets this mods apart from its progenitor, and from most FPS, is its level design. Instead of providing the player a world, Adam Foster provided his world a player. Don't expect strategically located chest-high walls, or conveniently located ammo crates. Every element is placed somewhere it would belong if the Combine's installation was a real-world place and not a videogame level. You will therefore often find yourself back-tracking or realizing several ways lead to the same location.This mod is truly a gem of game design and videoludic storytelling - no wonder its creator was hired by Valve afterwards.

												Very interesting mod, telling but of a story not in city 17, but a secret island that the combine has to distribute bio warfare weapons (headcrab canisters) and many other devious things. It does have many things you would see in a citadel and you had to infiltrate the facility to take out the core that is drilling and destroy the facility. After that, the main mission is to escape the facility after it blew, hacking down zombies and killing leftover combine soldiers that survived. Overall, I rate this mod 8/10. It seems like it could be a quality half life 2 expansion or new episode.			"

												What can I say? This mod is so good it made me forget it's not officially from Valve!It starts simple, with a simple task, and them escalates to something surprisingly bigger.If Half-Life 2 Lost Cost is a extra short chapter to Half-Life 2, Minerva is worth saying it's 4 full new chapters, presenting the player to the familiar gameplay, but with a completely new scenario. A side story to the Half-Life tale that don't interfere in the main plot, but still can add a significant and hight quality gameplay experience to the series.It's really worth playing while waiting for the next Half-Life game. And, hey, it's free.			"

												MINERVA is a highly recommendable Half-Life 2 mod, set during the Combine occupation of Earth in the Half-Life saga. With some great map design, including large scenarios and interconnected rooms, it provides plenty of options for ambushing your enemies, and it also allows the AI to shine, giving them plenty of places to take cover and flank the player.It's a great experience, in my opinion, and it really seems to fit within the Half-Life canon, although nobody at Valve has confirmed that. Even then, the fact that its creator, Adam Foster, ended up working at Valve, says something about the quality of this mod.			"

												Minerva is short, and really doesn't have much of an impact on the series canon. However, in addition to the finely-crafted story and evocative soundtrack, this mod has some of the best level design around. Levels are compact and easy to navigate while still feeling realistic. It's a perfect mix of style and functionality. The environments are pulled from Half-Life 2 and Episode One's assets, but still manage to feel unique in their own right. Add in some brilliant pacing and enemy placement, as well as physics-based puzzles that never tire, and you've got one of the finest mods the HL2 community has to offer. You have no reason not to pick this one up. Also, it's FREE.			"

												This is a really good add-on for HL2:E1 - I'm amazed at the production quality and level of detail that is on show. The storyline is really good and makes sense, drawing you deeper into the complex with the aid of an instructive messaging system. There are a few of the usual Half-Life puzzles to work out and that thing they do where you are relieved of all your weapons at a critical point in the mission. I played it on hard first time and it was hard, took about 4 hours. Recently, I played it again on easy just to enjoy the show and it was good fun.Obviously a lot of the visual work has been done by the Half-Life team in terms of models and textures etc... but that's the nature of an add-on, there's a lot of recycling involved. The set and scenary design is what we're playing in and it's been done in the proper style. This add-on could easily have been a part of the retail version and I'm surprised that is available for free. It's a really good portfolio for Adam Foster who I believe spent a couple of years putting it together. Well done fella.If you've got Half-Life 2: Episode One and you want some more, get a load of this.			"

But its not just a bullet magnet, this mod has some amazing backgrounds, visiuals and level design, I first played this mod when it was first being released (and had to wait several months to get at the final levels) but some moments like the Combine research portal and the headcrab laboratory stuck in my head either since.Give it a go and see why the creator got a job at Valve out of it.

												Amazing mod! This is the best mod I've seen probably EVER.  Beautiful, great combat, and puzzles. Half the time I didn't understand it :D, and have the time I was shooting headcrabs or combine stuffs. Lots of fun, not too difficult, and enjoyable. Play time through the game is about 1 hour, nt too short or too long. Minerva was awesome. Still wondering what that giant beam of light was for. ;-;.  Anyway, I find that is cna be confusing, and that is about it. I say best mod in a while (as in what I played.). I also really like sitting there thinking and figuring out it was something obvious. It was pretty, and I mean everywhere. Two best parts of it were the combat and the details. Interesting because it was made with Episode 1, not inside of the facility of course, that looked pretty episode 1 like. I kinda wish I got to meet the person messaging us, but too bad.			"

												Using only assets and mechanics from Half-Life 2 and its episodes - minus a few minors additions -, MINERVA still manages to deliver a gaming experience far different from Valve's game.From the nagging text monologues of the titular Minerva, strongly reminescent of System Shock's SHODAN and Marathon's Durandal, to the eldritch-ness, vastness and level of detail of the underground structure, the ambience is tense, cryptic and sometimes contemplative. The game is also challenging, both in its riddles and its combat, thanks to its unusual level design.Indeed, what really sets this mods apart from its progenitor, and from most FPS, is its level design. Instead of providing the player a world, Adam Foster provided his world a player. Don't expect strategically located chest-high walls, or conveniently located ammo crates. Every element is placed somewhere it would belong if the Combine's installation was a real-world place and not a videogame level. You will therefore often find yourself back-tracking or realizing several ways lead to the same location.This mod is truly a gem of game design and videoludic storytelling - no wonder its creator was hired by Valve afterwards.

												This is a really good add-on for HL2:E1 - I'm amazed at the production quality and level of detail that is on show. The storyline is really good and makes sense, drawing you deeper into the complex with the aid of an instructive messaging system. There are a few of the usual Half-Life puzzles to work out and that thing they do where you are relieved of all your weapons at a critical point in the mission. I played it on hard first time and it was hard, took about 4 hours. Recently, I played it again on easy just to enjoy the show and it was good fun.Obviously a lot of the visual work has been done by the Half-Life team in terms of models and textures etc... but that's the nature of an add-on, there's a lot of recycling involved. The set and scenary design is what we're playing in and it's been done in the proper style. This add-on could easily have been a part of the retail version and I'm surprised that is available for free. It's a really good portfolio for Adam Foster who I believe spent a couple of years putting it together. Well done fella.If you've got Half-Life 2: Episode One and you want some more, get a load of this.			"

												Very interesting mod, telling but of a story not in city 17, but a secret island that the combine has to distribute bio warfare weapons (headcrab canisters) and many other devious things. It does have many things you would see in a citadel and you had to infiltrate the facility to take out the core that is drilling and destroy the facility. After that, the main mission is to escape the facility after it blew, hacking down zombies and killing leftover combine soldiers that survived. Overall, I rate this mod 8/10.

												One of the best HL2 mods you can find. An action-packed, tight-difficulty and well-desigened piece of art.The only downside I can find is how...your boss i guess? likes to message you with large text walls, wich forces you to stop to read them, sometimes in unwieldy situations. It's also quite mean sometimes, but as we learned from that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that wanted us to pick up a can long ago, in the dystopical combine-dictatorship future there is no place for niceness.I give it a 9/10, losing a point due minor problems with how some puzzles are oddly-desgined(like a time you need to blow up X enviroment thing by shooting it, wich didn looked like something destructible), some overly-labrynthic zones, minor enemy problems(how the inclusion of fast zombies in a vertical zone makes them able to just tackle you off-plataform and into fall damage/death).

												Great job Adam ! I really enjoyed this mod. It could be a little longer but it was nice. In some places the combines literally hunt you down which is bad especially when you have 30HP. Great mod if you want to spend about 2 hours trying something else.			"

												One of the best mods I've seen for the Half-Life series.Some of the pros and cons are from my experience and may not be the same for you.Pros: Amazing detailing job.It feels like something from Valve.Good little bit of story though not much.Impressive level design.Cons:Short.A few bugs.You can get lost to what your supposed to do and where your supposed to go.Can be quite challenging at some times.

												Really cool mod! So many neat assets used in very creative ways. When playing, you almost seem to go through different \'levels\' as the environment around you changes drastically. Super cool effects as well!10/10 "

												This mod is quite well done. It is a bit small but the level of detail that went into this makes up for it. The attention to detail is fantastic. This mod feels more like an extention of the half-life 2 game rather than mod. I high recommend it.			"

												Very interesting mod, telling but of a story not in city 17, but a secret island that the combine has to distribute bio warfare weapons (headcrab canisters) and many other devious things. It does have many things you would see in a citadel and you had to infiltrate the facility to take out the core that is drilling and destroy the facility. After that, the main mission is to escape the facility after it blew, hacking down zombies and killing leftover combine soldiers that survived. Overall, I rate this mod 8/10. It seems like it could be a quality half life 2 expansion or new episode.			"

												Probably the best Half-Life 2 Story MODYes, the unwanted commentary can be annoying, yes the beginning doesn't seem promising...BUT my God, there's a whole campaign in here, lots of great work and planning, I loved the sense of clostrophobia and how you go move down beneath the earth and then need to escape back to the surface!SO SATISFYING!

												Almost genius. For a community made game it's amazing. It looks like it was made entirely by the original hl2 creators. The strategic efforts are flawless (meaning it basically makes sense). Every detail is just amazing, this could honestly pass off as an original valve game. Bravo I give 10/10.			"

												Awesome game! The variety of gameplay stuffed into a small area made me think of Resident Evil's Hive layout...kept going deeper down the rabbit hole. Thank you for a great game and free, even!			"
