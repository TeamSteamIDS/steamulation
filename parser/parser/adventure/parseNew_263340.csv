												Before we continue we must ask ourselves: what is an experience? Not what is a game, because that is almost too broad to bother trying to put into words. But what is an experience? What is something you enjoy experiencing?I cannot define this for all of you. An experience changes for each person- it is a variable that makes each person who they are.Continue?9876543210 (wow that was fun to type out on the keyboard, I slid my finger down the number keys like some sort of badass) is definitely an experience. Whether it is a good one or a bad one is up to you. I personally felt like it made me think a lot about my life and what I take out of it, but I personally do not feel that much of the game other than the thought it provokes lives up to the price I paid for it, even at this discounted price of 8 dollars I paid for it. I personally think thinking should be free. What should be paid for is how the developer makes you think- either through visuals or audio or even story and gameplay.The gameplay in this game is very basic. You run around and talk to people who usually just jabber on about strange things, but sometimes they open doors for you, and sometimes they sell you things. You are able to choose ""lightning"" or ""prayer"" when you enter these doors, and what these mean are up to the player to interpet, but what they do is either randomly spawn lightning to clear the path ahead or spawn a house in a town that is crucial to survive the later stages of the game. After 45 seconds to a minute though, garbage collection or something similar runs and takes you down to play a combat based minigame. After too many of these though, your game ends- but progressing to the next area resets this. So you are in a battle against time to progress to each area.This gameplay sounds fine, but it is very repetitive. I was about to quit and take a break after the third one of these, but then I realized that there is no save feature in the game- the point is to play the game in one sitting it seems. And so I druged on (and how fitting to relate to the plot of the game), hoping the game wouldn't be TOO much of this. While the gameplay is unique and quirky, after the 3rd or 4th time through, it just gets old.The music and the graphics are fitting to the theme of the game, but leave much to be desired. I found the graphics and music just plain boring to look at and listen to, and while there are some flashy scenes and very well done graphical choices during cutscenes, the levels look somewhat all the same in exception to a few that look amazing (the level where you're chasing down your reflections in the sea comes to mind) and in the end I just grew tired of it all very quickly.It's very ironic that a game where you have to find peace with yourself grows harder and harder to get through. I found myself getting very bored with this game very quickly. But it's not about the game right? It's about the experience!Well that my friends, I do not think is worth my 8 dollars. While it made me begin to think, I feel the game ITSELF did not make me think but rather the themes of it did. I apologize if that may be a mouthful, but it is hard to describe a game like this into words. In simpler terms, I feel like I could have just poked around the website of continue9876543210.com and gotten the same feelings I did instead of playing the game. And for that, I do not give it my personal reccomendation.But experiences change for everyone. Who knows? Maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.			"

												A rich experience focused on the inevitable. You follow your main character's journey on the acceptance of his deletion by traveling and consulting with the inhabitants of other locales moments before their Garbage Collection. You have two primary options when speaking with the villagers, lightning or prayers. Lightning will help you escape the current level, or access secret areas that will aid you achieve your closure. Prayers will create a shelter based in your own town, which will protect the player from the deletion storm - literally lightning that deletes objects. Your ultimate goal is to survive long enough so the main character accepts his fate. The attitude at the time of their deletion depends on which villages you have been to, how many, and any ""secret"" areas you have been to which includes objects from your past and present.The combat is fairly varied, but not overly complex. It does require skill, and this is certainly not a game you can skate by on without thinking what you are doing. To receive lightning or prayers from certain people, you might need to remember a fact about the town said by another villager. The combat can vary from side-scrolling challenges, to zelda-esque dungeon crawling, to arena ""kill-house"" style challenges. Depending how well you do can give you bonus lightning or keys which open doors in the villages, which allow you to speak to more villagers. I would advise against those who think the combat itself is the only reason to get the game- you will be dissapointed.In addition to the combat and memorization, the skill of time-management is needed as well. Each village only has a certain amount of time before it's expiration. You have to prioritize what you need done. This is indicated by a countdown timer in the upper-right, once it hits zero there is a ""stage"" of degradation (Which varies how many there are by village). You will then enter a random combat scenario. Upon completion, you will return to the village which will have become slightly more hostile. Deletion monsters will roam the village which will delay you in your quest for shelter and closure.It's an emotional ride that is open to your own interpretation. It does a grim subject matter well and was emotionally captivating enough to tug me along. And for that I am thankful.Edit: Just would like to clarify on something some reviewers seem to have missed (Even though it's in the instructions). This game does have an auto-save feature each time you load a new area.			"

												I'm a sucker for the TRON-like digital afterlife concept.  So I went into C?9-0 eagerly expecting a deep, affecting experience.  And for the first five or ten minutes, it seemed like it just might deliver on that...Sadly, it very quickly descends into a qurky, poorly designed pile of...bits. Instead of feeling like a solid, well-thought out game, it feels more like an overly ambitious Digipen student project.  The biggest problem is, you're thrust into a bizarre, abstract world without any sort of guidance.  ""DEAREST FRIEND, YOU WILL BE CONFUSED AT FIRST, BUT BE BRAVE, IN TIME YOU WILL UNDERSTAND."", the game assures in a large, ubiquitous, fatiguing-to-read typeface.  Part of me wonders if this line was a lampshade put in at the 11th hour of development to assuage confused newcomers.I've spent more time than I'd care asking myself ""what the hell is going on?!"".  Given the concept, this MAY be a conscious choice by the developer, since you're no longer in a 'game' and you're figuring it out as you go along just like the main character, Maggie.  But as a player here in meatspace, I still need some sort of graceful introduction to the concepts.  Like, what the hell is 'Foo'?  Apparently it's money.  It says 0/5 RAM on the status bar.  What does that mean?  Oh, now I'm suddenly sucked into a Zelda-like overhead persective and attacking chattering teeth?  Whoa, now I'm in a platform section where I have unexpectedly acquired a jump key, slaying more chattering teeth.  Aaaand now I'm back to the Indian trailer park, talking to Juggalos.  Seriously.To be fair, there IS a clumsy, minimal in-game manual to ham-fistedly explain some of this stuff, if you deicde to ""spoil the mystery"".  And the more you bang your head against the wall, things begin to slowly connect together.  Unfortunately once you begin to weave together a vague notion of what's going on, you begin to realize that the core gameplay is not nearly as complex or interesting as you'd hoped.  As an outsider, this has been an incredibly frustrating, confusing experience.  Abstract concepts are great, but they need a clean and well-thought out game design to prop it up, more than most.It's clear from other reviews that some players got a lot more out of this game, and I'm sure if I magically ""got it"" from the outset like they apparently did, I'd probably like it more, too.  But as it currently stands, I'm confused as hell, and -- the bigger tragedy -- I feel no overwhelming desire to invest more time into understanding it further.  In some ways, that's a worse failure than my benchmark for bitter mediocrity, ""Thirty Flights of Loving"".  At least I was compelled to finish THAT, such as it was.  But also, like that game, reviewers attributed to it a great weight of intellectual complexity that, frankly, I had a hard time giving it credit for.Save your rupees, gang, and simply enjoy the lovely developer-provided screenshots.  Imagine a great game built around those images and know that the game you have imagined probably DOES exist somwhere, out there, in-between the bytes of your computer's RAM.			"

												Wow, where do I start with this one?! Ok, Continue? is definitely an acquired taste. It begins with a beautifully drawn-out introduction on the death of a videogame character. Yet, he doesn't want to die. He escapes deletion for a while, and it's your job to keep him alive. While that sounds like an interesting premise for a game, Continue? doesn't stop there. Oh no. You quickly realise that the developer is trying to tell you something, and it soon turns into a reflection on life, on death, on childhood, love, freedom, knowledge and the inevitable. Each scenario that you play through is meant to be a prayer, not necessarily in an overtly religious sense (in fact, the game never comes across as preachy) but more in a sense of inner prayer, inner discovery for who you are, and what the important things in life are. It's not surprising that the developer made this game following a near-death experience. It does make you wonder whether there are better things to be doing with your life than playing a game, but that's beside the point!Yes, there is a game here, but it's a long, drawn-out game full of interludes and reflection. Let me warn you, if you're not the kind of person who can sit through 5 minute long dreamy interludes, this game is probably not for you. Even the introduction, beautiful though it is, is completely unskippable each and every time you begin a new ""life"". When you eventually reach the gameplay, you're in a for a shock: it's hectic! You need to dash around looking for characters to speak to. Each will give you a clue, or a cryptic message, or open a door to a building. Getting information and opening doors is essential, because it's here that you can choose to either destroy sections of barriers that impede your exit from the level, or construct more buildings in your sanctuary town (more on that shortly). There's a strict time limit here, and you're also being chased around by chompers (servants of the garbage collector trying to delete you) that will drag you away to mini games if they touch you. Mini games happen every 45 to 60 seconds, and are either 2d riffs on simple arcade games, or 3d exploration / combat games. None last long, yet if you fail you will suffer the consequences! Each failure usually leads to the destruction of buildings in your sanctuary, and this is fatal if you aren't careful. Every two levels you will be taken to your sanctuary to survive a garbage collection ""storm"". Several buildings will be destroyed, and you need buildings to shelter from the storm. Run out of buildings, and you get deleted. This is how you die in the game, for real.This gets really frustrating when you're having a run of bad luck. Finding characters, talking to them and making ""prayers"" to build your sanctuary or ""lightning"" to destroy exit barriers is very random; sometimes you might run around like a headless chicken for 20 seconds without finding anyone to speak to (and when the time limit for each deletion attempt is 45 seconds, that's a long time!), sometimes the lightning hits the same piece of ground over, and over, and you ""waste"" valuable time trying to escape the level, sometimes the price you pay for making a mini-game error is the deletion of 80% of your sanctuary buildings (other times you get off lightly). It feels unfair at times, yet when it's going your way it feels wonderful. It's as though the developer is telling you that life sometimes sucks! Yet despite all this, I love the game. I really shouldn't, it does all these things that annoy me, and yet it's... it's just compelling, somehow magical, relaxing even if you're in the right frame of mind for it. If you're not, expect to rage quit! (it's CTRL+Q btw). I wouldn't blame you.			"

												Despite the big thumbs up, I wouldn't recommend the game at its full price. It's good but you can get a lot more with $10 on Steam.As for the content itself, its atmosphere sort of reminds me of a 3D Sword & Sworcery. However, I found Sword & Sworcery to be little more than a collection of pixel art and mysterious but ultimately meaningless dialogue whereas I found Continue to have genuine meaning that you can connect to your own life. The gameplay is not the focus in either game, but it is at least entertaining in Continue. Where it really excels is in its metaphorical meaning,It is more art than game, designed to make you think as you race against time to build up what resistance you can to a fate you ultimately cannot escape. There is little replayability; you will discover most of what the game has to offer in a few short playthroughs. But I wouldn't call that a fault considering the goal of the game is to explore a theme, not to provide hours of entertainment. If that doesn't appeal to you, then avoid the game; otherwise, it's something to look into.			"

												Not worthwhile. As much as I like strange ""artsy"" games like To The Moon, Antichamber, etc., I found myself struggling to like this one. I was really interested by the initial idea of Continue?9876543210, but in the end it delivers nothing but a load of horribly vague, cryptic, ""2deep4u"" nonsense with an absolutely bizarre excuse for a playable game. Very few things are explained or made to make sense.The idea of ""shelters"" being the worst as far as the gameplay goes. How many of those freaking things do you need? I ""died"" from having 4. Okay, then I'll just go for more. But having over 14 shelters didn't save me from getting zapped. And then I had to sit through the agonisingly long cutscene yet again, to start at the beginning again. To do what differently, exactly?This is far too ""contemporary art"" for me to think that it'll be enjoyable for most people. Whatever this is, the artist has picked a bad medium for it. If you want to tell a story that can turn out differently or have different meaning, tell it in a different way. A multi-choice visual novel would have been a far better medium, for example. Not a game that punishes the player for their expected failure by giving them an absolute waste of time of a story/experience.			"

												Continue?9876543210 is a surrealistic adventure game that is somewhat stylized like an old RPG game. Or something like that. Continue is a very strange game; The basic idea is that you play as a video game character who is at the end of his life. The classic, 'Continue?' screen of arcade games of old has passed, and no quarters were inserted. And so, you have 'died', and enter into a realm where all data from a previous game goes to be erased, wiped clean for the world to start anew again for the new player, and New Game option. In this desolate space, data is assimilated into bytes and data, and you having not made your peace yet struggle to survive in a climate made to delete you. In the game, you start on a level that is representative of some gameplay trope, IE town, field, ruins, etc. There are a variety of NPCs and locked doors. You can talk to the people, who will either try to sell you something, give you a hint of some sort in the level you're currently in, say something about the story of the game, or say some rather useless blabber. NPCs phase in and out of existence, however. There's also monsters that spawn on the level, and wander around. Touching them triggers a battle scene, that transitions to a different scene like an RPG game. However, the battles aren't turn-based, but real-time, and work more similarly to a Zelda game. However, what they exactly are changes per encounter. Some are top-down, some are side-scrolling, some make you defend something, or you just have to fight all-out. Winning battles or doing things around the level usually get you a key, which you can use to unlock one of the various locked structures around the level. Inside the structure you'll either find a shop, something to push the story, some sort of side-quest, or a person who will either build structures or cast lightning.Now building structures and casting lightning is important. The game has a sort of time limit, both in levels and the overall game. The levels you go to are randomized, and each has differences to each other. However, you have a certain number of 'rounds' that will pass before the whole level is eliminated. If you're in a level when it's eliminated, it's game over and you get a bad ending. There is a time period you have to do stuff in the level, and then the round ends and you face some kind of challenge. This can be like a tricky level, a boss fight, some kind of puzzle, etc. They're random. If you win, you get a big benefit to your cause of survival, but if you lose you miss your chance for some aid. Aid for what? To exit the level, you need to get people you encounter to cast lightning, as casting lightning will destroy some of the blocks randomly blocking one of the several exits out of a level. However, you also need to build structures. After every two levels or so, you'll be in a sort of 'storm' you need to survive, or else its game-over. In the storms, you're in a town that is formed of the buildings you have made people build in the normal stages for you. A storm hits, and the buildings are stricken by lightning. You have to hide in a building and wait for the storm to pass, though if your building is hit and destroyed you have a certain time limit to quickly scamper around the town to another building. If there are no other buildings or you run out of time, it's game-over.You will always be given a choice of either Lightning or Building Structures. Lightning will clear a path to the next level after a few lightning strikes, while building structures will create buildings to hide in during these 'storm' sections.Basically the game is all about time management and succeeding in the various challenges that both the monsters, NPCs, and Round End's bring, for doing these allows you to gain chances at either Lightning or Structure Building, to make it past the individual level in time and to build structures for the storms that happen every two levels or so. You'll either like the game or not, it's a bit complicated to understand at first, and won't be fun for everyone.Also there are side-quests you can do that effect your story. The game has multiple endings, possible level paths, and more... What you do in levels, what level path you take, and the like effects the ending you work towards. The game is kind of made to be played multiple times, as its not very long and you won't go to many of the levels or see the whole game in a single playthrough.And the game gets weird. The story is told in a very indirect way, and some of the events that can happen are just absolutely bizarre. Honestly the story feels most similar to something that David Lynch might of concocted up if he were to make a video game about video games. Depending on who you are, that might either be a good or bad thing.The game's oddness is supplemented perfectly by its audio department. The game has a haunting soundtrack, interesting but odd sound design, but it all fits the weird atmosphere of the game perfectly.And there isn't really much to say. The game is deceptively complicated, but actually rather simple when you get down to it. It strikes me as a huge love it/hate it type of game, and something that'll divide people's opinions on whenever it's good or not.My stance is that it's interesting. The game itself is okay, but the atmosphere and some of the surreal elements I enjoyed. Of course, if you're less fond of such things, there will probably be less to enjoy in the game for yourself. Basically said, while there is a game here, the game is more about the experience. And depending on who you are, that experience will either be worth taking, or it won't be.Continue may be worth it if you like experience-based games with a surreal and strange edge that are open to interpretation. If you don't like that, you probably won't like the game. Like the game itself, it all seems so complicated but it's so simple, really.			"

												Somewhere, in the depths of a gamer’s RAM, you are a dead video game character who must come to terms with your imminent deletion.  You know that you cannot escape deletion, only that you may delay it.  Continue?987654321 aims to be an “experience” more than it does a traditional game, drawing an obvious metaphor and resting on the hope that we can identify with or be moved by it.  For most, it will not be enough to justify the purchase but, if you’re still interested by the time you finish reading, it may be for you.Your quest in Continue is to survive long enough to make peace by staying one step ahead of the garbage collection program, which will clear you from the RAM, bringing your existence, and your game, to an end.  To accomplish this, you must travel to six villages in each playthrough—chosen at random from a pool of eleven—spawning shelters back in a main hub. After every two villages, you will be forced to ride out an intense lightning storm in this hub and, if you do not have enough shelters in place to survive the destruction, you will be deleted and it’s game over.Each village you travel to is comprised of citizens, locked houses and multiple blocked exits. By speaking with villagers outside, you can learn important keywords and secrets, receive items and stat bonuses or pay to unlock houses.  Within houses are shrines or more citizens, which grant you either lightning (partially clears exit paths) or prayer (spawns shelter back in the main hub) for returning the proper item or answering questions correctly.  In rare instances, villagers may sell you entrance into trapped houses that will destroy shelters you have built, but other villagers will also warn you about them.Time in each village is valuable as you only have two to three minutes to spawn as many shelters as possible, while also clearing an exit to escape. The difficulty is unforgiving and leaves little room for error.  The game intends to give you no feeling of respite at any time. At regular intervals there will be a glitch, forcing you to play a brief minigame that opens up additional houses in the village based upon your success.  Minigames usually involve combat where it’s also possible to die, in which case you can only revive by having a particular item, enough money, or by sacrificing some of your shelters.For a game that tries to connect with the player on an emotional level, the dialogue is too often cheesy and nonsensical; the only thing the game managed to make me feel was nervous and hurried. Continue is a good example of a game where it's possible to get just as much out of it by watching someone else play. I can only recommend it to those looking to experience something truly unlike other games they have played, for better or worse, and who can accept that experience might not actually be fun.			"

												For starters i must state i like Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP so trying out this game was something i looked forward to despite negative reviews. These two games share a lot in their way of telling the narrative - or not telling. It is much to the player to figure out things yourself.  Just fine with that - there are not that many games on Steam that are 'artsy' like this and are yet able to provide a experience without becoming some kind of weird ego trip for the dev.  Unfortunately Continue?9876543210 goes for a more action oriented road despite having a somewhat more undrestandable universe where events take place (inside a computer).  This is this game downfall since after the early interest goes away all that is left is a frantic action game where you try to mass enough shelters to survive data purge and enough lighting strikes to open a exit path. You also better learn the ropes with the action scenes quick since you cannot survive long if you need to start paying foo (money) or car parts (continues) to go on. I found the lore interesting. No gods to pray to, just fading memories and void in the computer ram when the purge comes to eliminate the survivors. Too bad this marvelous setting gets lost under the frantic action. This game has got all the components for a cult classic. unfortunately it will not be so. Designed differently 'my lightning, my prayer' could be almost as well known saying as 'the cake is a lie'. edit: last line was lost. To conclude: i still recommend the game since this is a unique experience and despite the miss on the action design this game makes you think. For that i like it and i recommend you try it. It is quite reasonably priced in the store also.			"

												Emogame and Emogame 2 were staples of my adolescent experience. They turned me on to a slew of music that I wouldn't have appreciated otherwise and managed to be both hilarious and thoughtful throughout. When I saw that the creator of those flash games, Jason Oda, had developed this odd-looking title, I was intrigued. So, I'll lay out the negatives first: unskippable intro (that you will have to sit through many many times), boring and awkward combat, unintuitive gameplay mechanics. With that in mind, the game is a remarkably beautiful meditation on mortality explored by proxy through slain video game characters facing deletion and finally oblivion. If you go into this expecting a hack and slash dungeon crawl, you will be sorely disappointed. This is more of an interactive poem than a game, and it excels in that respect.			"

Take note, this game has a bit of an arcade style to it.  You play until you die, then start again from the beginning.Yes, the game saves, automatically at the beginning of every level.Yes, you can skip the introductory cutscene, you have to click somewhere and a box appears in the top-right corner saying ""SKIP->""Some people will not take appreciation of the metaphor used in this game.

												This is a tough game to describe in a review, it's not really like anything I have played before; But in a good way. This is the type of game you have to experience for yourself to truly understand it and even then it takes some time. At first I was lost, the game just kind of throws you into the world and asks you to figure it out on your own. It took me a good 30-45 mins of playing to start to understand that a lot of the things shouldn't be taken quite at face value and most things seem to have a deeper meaning than at first glance.  It's not an easy game, but it's not a hard game. It's a game that require's player mastery through experience. You won't ""complete"" this game on your first go at it, and likely not your second or third either. The subject matter keeps you interested and often times will make you think. It's really a journey for the player character to make peace with the fact that their death is inevitable. This certainly isn't a game for everybody, but I say if the game's premise intrigues you; then give it a go!			"

There is one level in the game that I strongly disagree with and I don't understand the dev's vision of making it (Anita Sarkeesian is a hypocritical & hateful♥♥♥♥♥♥but MundaneMatt made a vid about the subject so I suggest you watch his vid & if any future game devs are reading this please don't mention Anita in any of your levels because in my opinion she makes herself look like an♥♥♥♥♥all the god damn time) http://continue9876543210.com/princess/

			Just my thoughts on the subject. Sorry for the long rant (it got away from me), but I think I make some good points on the subject matter. What do you think?		

2. I hate the timed levels because I value exploring & solving puzzles at my own pace but that's just a minor complaint3. The game gets really repetitive around the 3rd or 4th time playing the game4. I don't recommend paying the full price of the game since the game is confusing for most people & I just want to warn you that it's very foggy on the story side5. The game doesn't have a save button or a load button (It has autosave but you still start at the beginning anyways which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t)Overall I have mixed opinions on the game & this game isn't for everyone but this game just ♥♥♥♥ing sucks♥♥♥♥♥because it was executed quite horribly but maybe someone else might like this game. (I give some credit to the dev for making this game even though it has one of the laziest game titles I have ever read & before I go the escape button is CTRL+Q in case you want to escape this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game)			"

												I don't know why people haven't tagged it this way, but its obvious that this game is a roguelite behind the messages and themes that it contains. Jason Oda covers the whole story aspect pretty well in the about section of the store page, so I will focus my review on the game beneath the facade.The game mentions that you take on 6 out of 11 levels each playthrough, but these 11 levels appear to be split into two different types where there arent any major differences other than the graphics/map layout for levels of the same type.  The first type being a tag/hide and seek with npcs and the second, more frequent kind, is an open town where you talk with the npcs and try to gather keys,resources, and information. This repetition would be boring if it wasn't for the short minigames in between.There are at least 5 different types of minigames ranging from platforming to Galaga to zelda dungeons and these different types can come in varying difficulties. If you succeed at the minigames, there is much to gain, especially if you play them perfectly, but they can also be rather dangerousFirst off of the roguelite checklist, randomness. Random characters, random levels, random npcs, random minigames, randumb... The first two don't really make a difference, but the random npcs are what make the game. You'll have to get clues and keys from these npcs, but not all are to be trusted.  The npcs never seem to lie about information, so aside from getting some nonsense one liner that wastes your time talking to the npc, the worst they will do is sell you a trapped room. However, since you can get free, safe rooms from the rounds, the npcs really are the least of your problems. The information from the npcs will make otherwise random choices definite, but if you are really desperate for time or resources you can guess questions, although you don't really need to do that to beat the game.The worst of all randomness is the lightning. The first kind of lightning is used to pave the way to an exit, but there are several exits and its possible that your lightning will hit an empty space, so it is easy for the lighting to be spread out and still not have an exit. These rolls will make or break your runs, they are the difference between having to focus all of your resources just to make it to the next level and being able to safely farm resources with impunity. Then there is the matter of having to find shelter in the storms. The randomness here has the potential to be more punishing when you have few buildings. Some buildings can take 1 or 2 lightning bolts and still stand for the next storm, but too few buildings and these tankier buildings are likelier to be destroyed. Despite all of the possible ways you can get ♥♥♥♥ed by the dice, you do have a decent bit of leeway to messup. Even if you get a few bad dice rolls, you should be able to make those up with resources from playing the minigames well.Then there is the matter of death. You can use your various resources to get second chances once you 'die', but when you run out of those, you must start from the beginning.  Additionally, the penalty when using buildings to revive gets increasingly severe, while using money to revive, while a static cost, will prevent you from getting more buildings/lightning.What do you get for replaying this game? Mostly you just get to see different specs of story/dialogue; however, actually seeking out the in game diaries will be detrimental to progressing to the end, but I suppose that's just part of the message with this kind of game. You'll see the different level art styles and see some different minigames, but thats about it. Some roguelites require you to play the game over and over to get direct benefits or crucial knowledge, but any useful knowledge is rerolled with each new game aside from knowing how to play a specific minigame.In the end, its not close to being the hardest game of the genre since you dont need a truly perfect run to beat the game, but it isn't too simple either. Players have the option of playing the way the developer would, but you could also speedrun it too if you wanted to. I recommend both playing to win and playing to explore in order to get the most out of this game. Finally, for your own sanity, do not play this game in full screen mode unless you want to make it even harder, perhaps impossible.			"

YouTube™ Video: Continue?9876543210 - A Quick Look 

			Views: 1,751		

			Let's take a look at a new indie game called, Continue?9876543210! In this game you are a dead video game character trying to come to grips with your fate.		

A quirky, weird, and very unique game. Continue?9876543210 has a very nice art style paired with an awesome soundtrack. The gameplay is a bit too simple in my opinion however.The concept of the game is what really drew me in. Playing as a failed video game character who must come to terms with their fate is something new that I hadn't experienced before and Continue?9876543210 executed it well.I picked up this game about a week ago on the Humble Store's Winter Sale event so I've had a good bit time to play with it before it launched on Steam.

												Before I start an important disclaimer:If you are prone to epileptic seizures or in any way sensitive to strobe lights, DO NOT ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This game spams strobe lights like it's Christmas, from beginning of the game to finish. If you play this game and you're an epileptic, you will be as dead as this game's protagonist, before even the intro ends.But yeah, this game. It's pretty flawed.As I said before, this game spams strobe lights. It also has it's hard to pronounce name, as well as this 3d pixel style that to be perfectly honest, looks kinda ugly. The gameplay is the weakest part of Continue, because you are so reliant on rng to not screw you over it's ridiculous. See, in each stage, with gc stages being the only exceptions, your goal is to escape the stage with lightning, while building shelters for gc stages with your prayers. However, lightning strikes at random, so it's entirely possible to have your run ruined all because lightning struck the same already cleared location three times. This is tolerable on large in length levels, but if you get bad lightning strikes on somewhere like the Riverbanks, your run is pretty much over, because you cannot escape in time.The plot? This game does seem to have a story, but it's a jumbled unconnected mess. Each stage has its own story, its own history, but its all disconnected from the protagonist, which are shuffled everytime you restart the game anyway. The only thing we know for sure is what's on the cover.And yet, despite all that, despite all these problems, I still love this game. A lot.The music and the atmosphere are some of the places where this game shines. I don't remember the last time I felt so peaceful when playing a video game. I would download the whole OST if I could. The filters and the sound effects, give the game a weird broken console dream simulator quality that I can't really explain. That, combined with some really touching scenes and you have yourself a game that made me cry at several times.There's also the message itself. As someone who had troubles accepting the idea of dying herself, I was completely repelled by this game when I first saw it. It seemed to me like just as a game so dark and so obsessed with its own darkness, that it would be completely unenjoyable. It wasn't. It was a journey, complete with thoughts and feelings people may have when they confront their own mortality. And it ended up being one of the most serene games I have ever played in my entire life. I haven't expected to be so pleasantly surprised at all.So final verdict? I dunno. I can see why people can be turned off by the message and the gameplay and other things. The dev himself said that he made this game this way SPECIFICALLY to repel CoD brogamer dudes. From the name itself, to pretty generic gameplay, I get it. Still, I'd say give it a chance.If you love these cerebral, borderline-walking simulator type games that are very emotional and sad, maybe this game will give you something. If you are like me and are struggling with accepting your own demise, maybe this game will help you not worry about your own mortality as much and even accept it like it did for me. If you are looking for some neat gameplay or a story heavy game, pass. This game will not satisfy you. And if you're prone to epileptic seizures, dear god stay away.			"

												The intro is the best part of this game.  The gameplay itself is fairly repetitive, and when I had reached the point of repeating levels or scenes, many of the sequences cannot be skipped even when I had seen them a number of times.  I really like the concept which is why I bought it despite the poor reviews.  I do not really care for the execution and was quickly bored with the title. Additionally the Linux port is not very good.  No resolution/fullscreen configuration without finding the config file and editing it, unlike the Windows launcher.  It also does not handle widescreen aspect ratios unlike the Windows version.			"

												I believe that an idea is much more important that how the idea is expressed. As a conseqence, I am almost always willing to overlook bad gameplay provided a game has substance. Contine?9876543210 is the exception to this.Ostensibly the game is a contemplation of death, but the gameplay is so awful that it ruins anyting that the game is trying to communicate. Specifically: -The instructions provided are totally inadequate.-The controls are unredeemably bad.-Most sections of the game have arbitrary time limits. These appear to be included solely out of spite that the developer has for you.-A substantial portion of the game is composed of unskippable cutscenes.It seems like the total length of the cutscenes for the total game is probably less than 20 minutes, but thanks to the awful controls you will have to replay most of them for hours before you win. Given this situation, it is probably only a matter of time before some masochist posts them online. Since the main point of the game is for you to contemplate the cutscenes, if that happens you will essentially get the substance of the 'game' for nothing.Finally, do not be fooled by the trailers, they do not accurately represent the game. If you are truly interested in buying it, wait until some gameplay videos are posted online before you make your decision.The only positve aspect of the game was the music.			"

												When I first saw this game in the Greenlight queue, I was astonished.  The trailer looked wonderful.  An action/platformer that is esentially a deep meditation on the existence of video game characters, with a simplistic yet stylish look, and not to mention, a great track to accompany the whole affair.  Once I saw it available in the Steam market, I bought it immediately (this never happens).What I got was a little different than what I expected.Yes, the deep philosophical message was there.  The eerie, ethereal atmosphere was there.  The melodious, calming soundtrack was there.  But gameplay was not.  At least, not what I was expecting exactly.The game opens with a very beautiful sequence of death and transcendence into the after life (In terms of a defeated video game character).  As wonderful as this opening is, you will get very sick of it.  You will die quickly from the get go, and you will see this long cut scene each time you restart.  But the first time around, it really sets the tone and feel of what is happening.  Very melancholic and simple with an underlying complexity.  From here on out is where my feelings for this game took a turn.From the trailer, it looked very Zelda-ish (to which I'm a sucker for.  See my review of ""Anodyne"").  This was certainly not the case.  You did not really have freedom to explore.  By freedom, I mean with enough time.  As soon as this starts, you are on a kind of timer for each world.  After a certain amount of time, the world around starts to fall apart and glitch; the system is essentially trying to delete you for good.  You have to do a lot of walking around, talking, while every once in a while being subjected to a rather lackluster battle sequence.  The point is to get out of the area you are in and move to the next area.  Now, there is also a small town in another area of the game.  It is here that you build up buildings which will also be subjected to termination.  At some point in the game (I forget when, as it has been some time since I've played this game) you go into the town.  The program starts systematically deleting the buildings.  If you get hit by a lightning bolt, you are deleted, and this results in a game over.  Then, it is time to start again, from the very beginning.The game is rather difficult, and when I played, I found it annoyingly difficult to survive inside of the small town you construct.  No matter where I went or the buildings I had, that bolt found its way to me, resulting in an instant game over.I might give it another go another time, but it was a big disappointment.  I like how they tried to really do something different, but in the end it wasn't fun.  I give it a perfect ten for style and music, but for gameplay...let's just say I give it a much lower score.  Maybe if it had been more free and open world, then it would have worked well.  I don't expect a Zelda knock-off AGAIN...but Anodyne seemed to manage being Zelda without being Zelda.Sorry creators of Continue?9876543210....Great concept.  Not so great execution.			"

												This game is the most mixed-up 'mixed bag' i've ever played.The good stuff- the idea is amazing, and the game captures the sense of hopelessness that wandering lost around the recesses of RAM might entail. I really like the dialogue too, which has a kind of meaningful meaningless quality, like haikus written by a gifted chimp. The music is quite good, and the basic organisation of the game (wandering around talking to people, finding clues, collecting game resources and then battling to save yourself) is well organised and a good idea for how to conduct this kind of game. So based on originality and thoughtfulness, it would be a 10/10.However, the execution of the above gameplay is a solid 0/10, and since the gameplay is most of the game, it hurts the overall experience really badly. Generally, the game well captures the futility of trying to escape deletion because it is nigh impossible not to fail over and over and over again, based on flaws in the game mechanics rather than your skill. The combat is incredibly bad, making safe zones suddenly kill you, murdered enemies spring back to instantly and unavoidably shave off half your health (every enemy can do this), and enemies spawn teleported right on top of you to instantly initiate punishing combat with no chance to evade.The punishment for failure also increase geometrically- every time you make a mistake, the punishment gets worse by 1. For reference, you need to build shelters towards surviving a storm every few levels, and each shelter takes a couple of conversations or minigames to build, with bigger (more effective) shelters taking more. Then when you fail, you lose a shelter. Fail twice, lose 2. Fail 5 times (throughout the whole playthrough), and you lose 5, then 6, then 7 shelters each time. Given how arbitrarily you fail, and that the game actively selects your biggest and most valuable shelters for deletion (i've played it enough to be sure this isn't random chance), the possiblity of getting past level 3 or 4 is extremely low for any given playthrough. Add in poor collision detection with environments (falling off parts of maps to your death), continue screens which also delete between 1 and 7 shelters every time, and randomised puzzles and level order, and you have a recipe for extremly consistent frustration. So I give the gameplay 0/10, with the developer either being really lazy on this element (doing no playtesting to realise what a piece of junk his game is to actually 'play') or really hostile to people who pay for his work (taking the 'avoiding deletion is really hard' story element as an excuse to ruin the gameplay element of the game).I still really enjoyed Continue?, finding it artsy and thoughtful without being too pretentious. But being almost impossible to finish due to game design unfortunately takes it down quite a few notches.			"

												Existential Crisis: The GameNo really, this game, while legitimately good in how it delivers its message, is one of the most depressing games you'll ever play. It's a game about a game where your character dies, and its programming object is freed from active memory, and that videogame character is desperately trying to buy a few more microseconds of time to make peace with the inevitability of being premanently erased by the system's garbage collector. Yes, this is a game that pointedly informs you that, some day, you will die.I considered it edifying as an experience to have through games, but consider this both a strong reccomendation and a legitimate warning. It's hauntingly beautiful in its effort to gameify the final journey we all must take some day.			"

												And though I left, I took with me their lightning and their prayers.I've never come across a game more contemplative and philosophical. It's got a gorgeous pixel art design (like a more colorful Swords and Sworcery), hauntingly melancholy music, and a unique concept. You are a video game character, and the game starts when you die.  You are set on the path for deletion, but have an opportunity to run. What do you do?  The game's story focuses on acceptance and reflection, which is at odds with its gameplay, which has a focus on action and timed sections that are fairly frenetic. And the action sequences are more challenging than you would expect from the rest of the game.  That being said, the feelings this game engendered are not common for games, and if you have an interest in seeing what games can do outside of their traditional boundaries (but are capable enough to play traditional games), this is an experience you won't soon forget.

												The developer said it themself: ""This is one of those love it or hate it experimental art games.""Take that into consideration before you purchase this. If you're expecting entertainment or a pleasurable experience then you'll be disappointed. This isn't like Bastion or Limbo that pair a deep dark story with solid gameplay, this is strictly the former.Unfortunately it was just a bit too experimental and surreal for me. I couldn't get into it no matter how much I tried. The fact that the game bugged out within the first 20 minutes and stuck me in an inescapable room didn't help - but hell, for all I know, that might be just another attempt at relaying some covert message to me.

												One of the worst purchases I've made.The game has awful play control, awful storytelling (with lots of forced ""cutscenes"" that are both repetitive and uninteresting), and awful direction.  I say ""cutscenes"" very loosely because the scenes are regularly just a face or unmoving model with lots of text.  At no point do you really understand what you're supposed to be doing, yet you suffer consequences for failing to do those things.  There are also choices you're forced to make without any information about those choices (including thirty seconds into the game when you're asked if you want to change your character from one nondescript pixel man to another).The underlying idea of a fallen video game character trying to live again is actually compelling and the developers had a great mind to play with concepts like garbage collection and memory dumps, but the actual execution is... awful.

												I feel bad that my friend bought me this game.From a storytelling point of view, this is an okay game with a deep message about sentient data (?).It's a strange idea though, having a self-operating program that actively avoids garbage collection and takes up CPU time sounds like a virus to me.Personally, I couldn't immerse myself because all the people at the start talked to me like they already knew me and then names were thrown around, and there's some sort of existing sentient data (?) culture going on, and if I were to sit and trawl through the game lore or sit through the cutscenes, it would feel more like a spectacle than something I can invest myself in.I like the story though, I guess?Garbage collection being a force of nature that wipes these thinking, feeling creatures is a morbid thought, and that they worship and understand this frailty is also a deep.But if kind of killed it for me when I thought the lightning specifically targeted the shelter I was in and mercilessly destroyed me.Wasn't that area supposed to provide me with cover from the random nature of garbage collection, other shelters being taken down as I run for my existence, sacrificing them?From a game point of view, this game is absolute garbage.Unskippable cutscenes (I don't want to watch Simon lie in a field and repeat the same three lines while the camera does a pan around him, I've seen this five times already)Xtreme Strobe Lighting™ incorporated into almost every aspect of the game makes it hard to look at (there isn't much to look at anyway but that's ok, fine graphics aren't all that important)Text that is hard to parse, (yes ""parse"" - reading it isn't enough) (yes there's a lore explanation for this but it feels half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The game pauses whenever you alt-tab even if it's windowed, which means you can't go do other things while you wait for the stupid cutscenes to be over. (yes the cutscenes build up the story but I've seen this one three times already and I'm sick of it)The red and black text is hard to read because it's in what, 272pt at the four corners of the screen? The Pause menu text is perfect, I wish the rest of the text was readable like that (good use of padding, font-size, line-height that the red text could REALLY benefit from)No way of telling how many hits each garbage collector monster thing takes to hit, I've had some that die in 1 and some that die in 3The combat and puzzles are lazy but that's ok? This game leans heavily on story anyway.The walking collision is pretty bad but only because you can get stuck on stuff really easily.The only thing I can rag on the sound side is that the sound for taking damage is also the sound for initiating a fight and other things, so it confuses me sometimes.Oh and if you excuse these bad game design choices as lore or worldbuilding, then screw you, you damn apologist.

												Continue?9876543210 is an interesting game with some potential for frustration. It's somewhat mysterious and pretty good at creating tension while aiming to bring about its philosophical conclusion. We see deliberately low-poly 3D graphics which nevertheless are easily translated into ""the world"".The game expects the player to go for several, slightly changing run-throughs, not all of which let the player get to the end. The player is mostly playing on limited time but can sort of recover in mostly unskippable cut-scenes. Will you find the strength to go on or will you find the strength to rest?+ Nice low-poly design+ Good music and good atmosphere+ Special exits+ Live stories+ Restarting areas0 ""On the clock""0 A tad short- Bad restart method - ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""- Camera is sort far-sighted- Fade-ins waste time and make it harder to react- Controls somewhat lacking- Incomplete menu with and ambiguous optionThe game features a number of modes. There is investigation mode where you run around an area or level, talk to people and gather knowledge which is needed to find an exit from the area and build up shelters, all within a time limit (except for the first level which has slightly different rules). That mode already shows how the camera is sort of far-sighted when giving a perspective view. Enemies will randomly and with increasing ferocity and frequency spawn around you. While the perspective view shows enemies or people in the background pretty well, it's hard to see things in the foreground. This is coupled with the foreground also often going down. So it is possible that you run the avatar towards the foreground/player, run over an edge, be in the air and without control over the avatar while unknowingly steering into an enemy. You have a sword to fight of enemies but to use it effectively you still need to know where enemies are.Running into an enemy brings you into an action mode of always the same type where you have to fight of a number of enemies approaching you from the air while you play in a 2D brawler fashion, think minimalistic smash brothers. Those fights are easy but time-consuming at first but grow challenging and fast over the levels/investigation areas.Hint: When jumping and attacking in the air go into the direction the avatar is not looking to make an overhead swing.Each investigation areas also features up to three other action modes where you are thrown in one of a number of, let's say, mini-games. There are some where you have to find an exit, there are some where you have kill objectives and there is even one where you simply go right.Action modes mostly offer treasure and performance-based rewards, but failing them results in harsh consequences.The third mode is a shelter mode where you need to hide from impending doom. It's paramount to have gathered enough shelters or this is where the avatar gets GC'ed.While cut-scenes offer time for recovery and breaks - they prompt the player before continuing - they are mostly unskippable and it may take you upwards from 30 seconds to get into an investigative area. This is unnerving in connection with the restart feature. You can restart the current investigative area if you feel like you didn't get enough out of it - the game autosaves at the beginning of an investigative area. While the game tells you restarting is an option it doesn't tell you how to realise that option. Instead of clicking the button ""Start Over"" in the menu and confirming the reset you have to kill the application and restart it, then you are loaded back into the area.The reset instead means starting the whole run over and losing all progress, not just that of the last area. Imagine my happiness when I found out.Apart from the ""far-sighted camera"" problem there is another one with visuals. While investigating you are required to enter houses. When you subsequently leave them the main area fades in, i.e. the world is turned back on before you can see clearly. While you can remember positions of enemies or people and interact with them blindly you are more likely to run into a problematic situation all while running out of time.Action modes have a number of control problems. First off, navigation is sometimes hard because you don't always know which things you can pass over and which things present an obstacle.Then, I often felt like I couldn't turn fast enough with incoming enemies. When trying to stab enemies you sometimes only hit when your sword is at or near full extension. So despite facing the enemy and presenting good points they will hit you anyway, reduce your performance and hinder progress in the meta-game.Specifically the last and fix action mode where you need to turn and jump had me failing jumps multiple times because ""up"" is somehow not available  when being pressed while changing directions. And yes, I specifically bought a keyboard where ghosting doesn't happen when only two keys are pressed.I found the gathering of knowledge surprisingly fun, the random life stories are effective towards the game's philosophical goal and I enjoyed the special exits you can find. Even though I played through the game with ""full points"" I have yet to see some parts of the game.If you're not immediately put off by its graphical style, I'd say give this a go. With all the little short-comings listed above, I, maybe not highly but securely, recommend Continue?9876543210. Even with its relative shortness of six captivating hours its price tag compares well against the average movie.""Oh little townshelter me""			"

												The wasted potential of Continue? is disappointing but not very surprising. It checks off all the typical mistakes of fresh developers making ""art"" games.Sluggish control during minigames against enemies that can move at any angle. Also, controls can't be remapped.No option to reset a level in progress. If you end up in an unwinnable situation, you can restart the entire game but not the most recent level.Core gameplay completely given over to the Random Number Gods.Ponderous transitional cutscenes that can't be skipped.Here's some advice to indie developers who aspire to make art through the medium of video games.If the medium of art is the video game, make the ""game"" parts fun and engaging on their own.No developer has anything so profound to say that players should tolerate poor gameplay just to hear it.Developers who can't or won't make their gameplay fun should develop a visual novel rather than a video game to make their art.Finally, the forced analogy between human mortality and software processing is somewhat awkward. Exacerbating this awkwardness are incoherent metaphors to ""lightning"", ""prayers"", ""storms"", and ""shelter"" that have nothing to do with computers or software. If developer Jason Oda had simply replaced ""Garbage Collector"" with ""Thor, God of Thunder"", the result would be otherwise identical.			"

												Although I think the game resembles an artsy movie more than a game, its music and some of the ambiance it generates are nice and relaxing, if not mostly nonsense... I feel like the game may have been better suited simply as a movie / short film, but for what it's worth, if you're into these conceptual, retro kind of games, I think you'll find it an interesting experience. Can't say it's ""thrilling"" or ""action-packed"" but I find it enjoyable. The music is probably the standout feature to me.  "

												Occasionally I wonder, how many times have I died in this life?  How many Marios have I plunged down bottomless pits?  How many chosen nobodies of Tamriel have I gotten run through?  Alas, the video game lives that have served me, I have not served well in return.  Sometimes in the throes of drink or the in darkness of despair I wonder what has become of those unfortunate sprites, those amalgamated polygons with their illusions of agency.Continue?987654321 tells the story of one such departed and the game begins with her dying moments.  The machinations of digital afterlife play out before us as we witness the software of souls.  Shortly thereafter, we're given control of our fallen warrior in a run-down corner of the afterlife.  ""Where are we,"" our spirit character asks another. ""Well..."" he replies tilting his rectantangle head up to ours, ""I suppose on a line of code, on a sliver of light, floating aimlessly through the random access memory.""  Unwilling to fade peacefully into the digital night, our heroine strikes out to escape the inescapable.The game unfolds as we move from town to town, one step ahead of oblivion.  Each vignette is a small area to explore and escape.  The player has several minutes of game time in blocky planescapes to find the folks that can grant them lighting or prayers.  Some are vendors, some are quest givers and some are simple well wishers.  There are few ne'er do wells in this well of souls;  everyone is facing the same dissolution.  Their bestowed lightning can destroy barriers to level exits, their prayers raise buildings in the one place where our heroine can shelter against the wrath of the Garbage Collector. At set intervals the player is thrown into minigames.  Some involve zelda-like dungeons, some are hacks and slashes and some involve a bit of platforming.  All in all, they're quick diversions enabling the player to get more precious foo and ram.  Foo buys you lightning, prayers, extra time and second chances.  Ram is your resistance to the Garbage Collector's pursuing minions.  Run out of ram too soon or fail to escape a level and watch your shelters blasted into smithereens and know that next time you run for shelter, there may be none left.If the game seems disjointed, it is.  But it works mostly because the minigames are challenging, diverse and fun. And through each disjoint, the unifying metaphor is ever present.  Death is not something that many of us choose to think about.  Perhaps it is a Western mindset, or perhaps it is even gamings' own emphasis on not dying that encourages the avoidance of the inevitable.  Continue?987654321 takes a more Eastern approach.  It is zen-like and Buddha-ful experience, though a bit heavy handed at times. In the squalor of the /apps/Ghangees level, we encounter a npc and her dead grandmother whose foot has been stolen by a stray dog.  But while often grim, it is touching at times and refreshingly self aware:  during a dream the player may approach and ask questions of the great Garbage Collector like 'What is the metaphor?' For which it has no answer.  Between one level and another we're asked to do a short meditation remembering our dearest departed pet.When games go all philosophy they usually go all pretentious too.  Not so with Continue.  Many of the levels are ponderous locales, but in their pixel precise portrayal of squalor and the evocative conversation of their denizens, there is a comfort in despair. Perhaps the comfort is in acceptance, but either way at the end of the game, based on how long she lasted, the player is told how their avatar met her inevitable death.  Did she escape long enough to come to grips with its mortality?  Or was she ripped from digitalia with wailing and gnashing of teeth?Continue brings to mind a book I'm fond of named ""The Beginning Place"" by Ursula LeGuin.  At its most basic level, it is the story of two people who run from their lives and find each other in a broken fantasy world.  When read at that level, the story is a bit uneven and the conclusion unsatisfying.  But when read as the allegory it is intended to be, it's a journey that offers the reader new insight every time through.  Continue?987654321 is not unlike that novel.  If one sits at their keyboard expecting metroid or its latest manifestation, one might walk away slightly underwhelmed.  But when experienced as the metaphor it is meant to be, Continue is far greater than the sum of its mini games, its foo and its ram.  It is a sober reminder of the priceless now, a virtual wise man on the mountain offering wisdom where so many other games merely offer escape, a life lesson to be learned over and over.Go and wander to lovely, awesome and mysterious places.Think and feelSit quietly and contemplate the precious silence.Take in the wonder of existenceAnd then want nothing else from itOnly then will you be ready    - Celia, Continue?987654321 "

												This game feels like the kind of game I would bring up if I were trying to impress some one with my intelligence and good taste. I do like the game I don't necessarily love it though. The game play, especially when I'm trying not to be deleted, is pretty fun. It's interesting to build a shelter town through prayers and unblock the exits through lightening. The variety of the minigames is pretty cool too.My only problem with this game is that there isn't much point, or at least it ends up feeling that way. No matter what, the game ends in the character's death. Which is fine, but it's that knowing it's the only way to play the game makes everything else feel a little bit empty. I still enjoyed the experience. It just sort of left me with a feeling of ennui. Even with the ennui I would say this is a fun game. At the very least it got me thinking. It does need some achievements though. Usually it doesn't bother me whether a game has them or not, but this one pretty much needs them. The entire point of the game is to go around and try to find some kind of value in the short time the character has left. It would make sense to have achievements that mark those moments. I say give this one a try. If nothing else you'll end up playing a game that you could bring up when artsy friends start talking about Melancholia or As I Lay Dying.			"

												A simple game tackling a difficult subject matter: mortality.The gameplay simulates the desperation of wanting just a little bit more time to contemplate on life before the inevitable. I think it manages to achieve this quite well through time based scavenge hunts and reflex games.I wouldn't call this game pure fun per se, but I did feel a sense of accomplishment as I explored memories of the protagonist's past, helping others to achieve their peace, and building shelters to protect me from harm.Every cutscene is a soothing experience, nicely contrasting the gameplay, which is quite frantic, since you're always on the clock. There's also an element of luck involved, so you can expect to have a few retries before finishing the game.The music is melancholic and beautiful; very well done. The visuals are charming, with well designed levels full of voxely detail and nice color schemes.In conclusion, Continue is an emotional ride. To get to the end, you'll need a bit of patience, and to plan ahead for the coming storm.			"

												Great game and I know from reading the forums of this that a lot of people are debating getting it, well let me tell you how you can tell if this is your thing or not.I like the game, it is deep, reflective, classically designed, and obviously is a reflection of events in the author(s) life.The combat is incredibly simplistic, just like old button pressing games, but it stays interesting a varied by the variety of puzzles and combat scenes you do. You won't get bored of combat quick.The story is very good if simple, and is as the description says the story of a man trying to come to terms with his death, while also trying to complete his original quest he was designed to perform and locate a woman who has also fled from deletion.Now here's the thing if you only like games for their story and not difficulty you will struggle on this one, because the very simple combat also makes it challenging at times, and so you really have to work at getting towards the precious story.If you're solely looking for a combat game you are in the wrong place, the strongest parts of this game are its puzzles and memorization stuff, as well as deciding whether to invest in more lightning or prayers.I like to make mods for video games and honestly this is the kind of thing you can find a mod for, but that said I am still glad I paid for it and recommend it			"

												Picture it... you start up the game with quite an interesting tagline of what happens to a video game character when they die. Unity starts up and tells you that the only option is for the 'fast' mode. Alright... that's fine.Then it loads up - there are no options menus, no start-up screen saying 'welcome'. You're just thrust into the world with a barely apparent text dialogue box that I personally forgot in about a minute. There's nothing to say what the things you're collecting do. There's no reason presented for you to do anything in the world apart from to make something bloody happen, you're just expected to go with the flow and whatnot.Once again... fine. It might not make sense to me, it might do to someone else.However... what I can know as part of concrete truths is that the game itself... is poorly designed and executed. The controls feel jerky and off, the combat is little more than just holding down a button and pointing the way you want the bad stuff to stop bothering you, the pause screen a) has no controller support, despite the game being listed as 'completely supported', there's no way to exit the game apart from killing the screen for crying out loud...All in all... the idea behind the game - of what happens when a video game character dies - was enough to spark my interest and get me to at least look at the game, whereupon said spark was immediately doused, dissolved, and forgotten due to the rusty nuts and bolts inherrant throughout the game.

												I love this game, the atmosphere is romantic, in the way I am romantic myself. The Idea of following a hero after death is something new, yet not since it is one of the oldest mechanics in games. This once again is one of those games that make you say:""How as no-one done this already?!"" as they did with minecraft in it's time. But there is but one problem.. As far as gameplay, I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue to what is going on. I am not a dumb person, it is, in my opinion, not explained very well. If the people did a demonstration, it would be much better. That being said, great game.Written later: When you get into the rules of the game..this game is actually QUITE good. It has an amazing sound track, which with that makes an even more amazing atmosphere. That mixed with decent rules, when you start to get past the mist of confusion, makes a great gameMy rating: 8-8.5 out of 10			"

												  I just bought this game a few hours ago and can't seem to put it down.  I won't enumerate what it is or isn't or even the game play.  Others have taken the time to do that.  I just want to say that it is a fun, interesting and profound experience for me.  I'm not really sure that to call it a ""game"" is correct, although there certainly are gaming elements.So, let me just name what I like about it in no particular order.- Interesting, yet enigmatic gameplay/experience.  The kind of game that you just go with. You pay attention and figure it out (or not :) ) as you go. Very whimsical and serious at the same time.- Lots to think about via your intereactions with other beings (sprites?) you encounter.  Those interactions may be profound or meaningless, you just don't know yet.- Graphical style is very pleasing, interesting and not always the same. You can see that from the trailer. - Music is cool, awesome and relaxing, except when it isn't.- You experience or take away from this game what you bring to it.  I'm not trying to be elitest or say that if you don't like it then you just didn't get it.  I just mean, that not everyone will be interested in what this game is (whatever that is).A quick comparison would be ""knock! Knock!"".  That is a very different game that is more unnerving while ""Continue.."" is more peaceful.  But, they share the same idea that you do normal gaming things on top of a story or game that you don't know or even really have an idea what it should be.  Also, as a side note, I really like the whole DOS style thing a lot.  So, if any of this interests you at all, then I would try it out for sure.			"

The graphics are great, the music is fantastic, the gameplay is alright, the mini-games are really fun but really hard but the story is a bit confusing. Some characters are glitching in and out which I thought was weird. Anyways I think it is a great game overall and I really enjoyed playing it.			"

												Continue out of 10, would be consumed by the feeling of hopelessness in the face of imminent death again.Jason Oda did a pretty nice job creating an engaging, often melancholic and overall pretty surreal journey through the afterlife of the Random Access Memory. The game's centered on a feeling of inevitability and it achieves this effect quite well. There is always a sense of urgency; despite your quest to come to peace with your death, the Garbage Collector is never far behind, slowly deleting each area you visit as you rush to return items to shrines, answer riddles, speak to locals, survive minigame-like trials against the Jaws creatures trying to destroy you, and lastly, obtain enough lightning to escape the current area, and enough prayer to build a strong enough shelter to shield you from the deadly Garbage Collection storms which occur after every 2 areas of the 6 total in each playthrough. There's a delicate balance to obtain, and with every mistake you make and every opportunity you miss, you can feel your chances of survival dwindling.You will die, but with each death you'll learn a little more than last time. The game's far from a rogue-like, but that said there's enough randomness to its elements that it retains enough fresh material after your first two or three runs to be worth playing again in the future in order to to discover new areas and hopefully have things play out a little longer before you meet your end.A lot of deep topics are relatively skimmed over due to the fleeting nature of the game, but it covers a lot of different topics and does so with enough of a dark humor to keep you entertained if it suits your fancy. There are quite a few thoughtful scenes throughout the game however, mostly taking place in the transitional cutscenes between each level. These range from reminiscing old memories of a loved pet, to finding a good field to lie face down in. This is a game about coming to terms with death, and surviving long enough to reach your acceptance of it. Even the creator himself inserts some of his own personal feelings on dying via hidden journals you can discover in obscure areas. The game can be a bit of a downer overall, but it's done well enough to make you laugh and think deeply on your way to that final curtain call. It's not to everyones' liking, and I can see why there's a love it/hate it vibe to it, but in my humble opinion it's a worthwhile experience.			"

												This game is over ambitious very confusing and over all a mess of ideas. The main puzzle element of the game is delivered through on screen unvoiced dialogue, the font choice is so terrible that it strains the player to read it. The spacing between the words on screen is so tight that is almost dizzyingly bad.The gameplay isn't very strong if it's even there at all it's probalby one of the worst games I've ever played, purely form a gameplay,writing,presentation and story telling point of view.The game trys to be meta and place a game within a game and break the 4th wall of what it means to be a videogame protagonist and it fails in every respect.

												A game that explores the concept of death and its inevitability in the face of an indifferent universe. The game could have used more useful dialogue, actually exploring what the player felt, instead of simply exploring the overall tone. The actual game mechanics were unneccessary and felt disjointed from the overall tone the game presented. The game never really allowed the players to fully explore what the characters in the game actually felt. A game that was so emotionally charged could have used some of that to actually get a few messages across. Now then, back to what the game was about, the theme.To fully feel what this game is, understand that the author had a near-death experince, which helped bring the game about. As such, the game is more of an interactive thought experiment, allowing the player to discover their own nature and feelings toward death, if they let it.Imagine someone tells you that you don't have long to live, most likely due to a terminal illness. No matter what you do, you are unable to stop it death from coming, but you can postpone it. What do you do?- Do you spend all your time trying to beat death, trying the newest in the medical fields in a search for a cure?- Do you exercise day and night to strengthen your body and immune system, to have a chance at survival?- Do you spend time with your friends, family, and possibly lover(s), to leave them with a shining, memorable piece of you before you go? - Do you seek closure with those that you have known, trying to bring peace to those you've known?- Do you seek closure for yourself, spitting on those who've wronged you, and giving the middle finger to the world that allowed you to die before you were willing?- Do you make an effort to be remembered, pouring your last days into something worth noting in history?- Do you write a book, pursue your hobbies, and try to die happy and fulfilled, doing the last few things you've always wanted to do?- Or do you simply give up, knowing what is to come, and die on your own terms?Death comes for all things. Some run, some hide, most try to postpone it and even reel against the knowledge, unwilling to go into and with that cold, unstoppable unknown. Others are completely unaware, and some are affected by it. Ultimately, all things leave this world, and the question of the game arises.What would you do in the face of nonexistence?			"

												A gorgeous game that makes little sense and a whole lot of feelings.If you are the type of person that needs points and numbers and solidity, this isn't the game for you. It's an experience, a sort of indescribable trip you have to be willing to open yourself up for. You won't understand, at least at first, and you certainly aren't going to do anything that might mean 'win'. It is a game, you fight things with a sword, you talk to characters, you beat a timer. But in a way it feels as if those things really aren't what make it, it's something different, and something wonderful. The tone is incredibly dark, the graphics are incredibly flashy on some settings (Epileptics be warned!), the controls are the only downside as they feel a little too slippery			"

												I'm not really sure what to make of this game. It's one of those story/experience games, but this one does include gameplay elements.So bascially you have a limited amount of time to ""explore"" and area and try to open up doors that will allow you to create a safe house, or open part of an exit to the next area. After a set time you have to complete a challenge that gives you money or keys to open more doors. After a bunch of challenge routes you have to escape the world to the next one, or face the ""battle ground"" where you need enough safe houses to continue.The challenges are mostly fighting off pacman like creatures within a short time. The ""open doors"" give can give you a question to answer (answers are given by others in the main area).It's quite difficult given the short amount of time you have.And there's some kind of ""existential"" background story. It's a bit like a combination of Zelda 2+Proteus+Dear Esther.			"

												I think this is an example of a trend going too far. In my experience, Swords and Sourcery was the first of an indie game line up to use an obsure script, lovely art direction and slow-paced gameplay to execute an original, experiential game.The idea of Continue? 0987654321, is kind of cool (A game character runnung around RAM)... but it seems to me like it's relying on the concept to appeal the indie fans, over content. The game feels uncrafted. The script is gibberish. Fighting (if you can call it that) is shallow and unsatisfying. The graphics at first seem cool, but quickly become dull, bland and uninspired.Maybe they wanted to get it out the door faster. I think more time and more original ideas could've made this a sweet game. Iwant to like it. I want to want to play it more... but there are better games to spend my time on.5/10			"

												PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUYI am a huge fan of this type of game.  A game that explores the deeper parts of the mind and such, its like reading an excellent book you have some control over.  The problem with this type of game is that most of them are indie and underfunded.  This means that a lot of the times, the gameplay gets in the way of the storytelling...This is one of those games...The gameplay is pretty bad.  Maybe, MAYBE on an Ipad it wouldn't be as horrid, but on the computer the controls suck and the gameplay is repetitive.That said, the storytelling and more esoteric qualities of the game are supurb.  Personally, I have found it hard to fully enjoy them because the gameplay is bad, hence why I don't have much time spent in game.  Once I'm in the right mindset though, I know the cerebral excersices will be greatly enjoyable.TL;DRGameplay - REALLY badesoteric stuff - AMAZINGif cerebral > gameplay = buyelsesave money			"

												I have not played this for an extended period of time (so take that for what you will). However, I have played it enough to get a grasp on it's concept and tone. First off, this is a very interesting game. And, yes, this is a game. There is combat, there is strategy, there is survival. For as much as I enjoyed Gone Home and The Stanley Parable, there wasn't much in the way of a real ""game"" wiithin their systems. Those looking for something different though still, very much, a video game, this might be for you. As far as said gameplay goes, there's a lot to explain. So I won't bother with extensive explanations. I will at least tell you that it's a game of managing Lightning and Prayers. Lightning slowly opens up paths to one of several possible stages (there are 11 in total, supposedly... though, I imagine there's a 12th), while Prayers grant you safehouses in a nearby town. Those shelters in those towns house you from Garbage Collection. Basically, death. Think of the world of Continue?987654321 as Purgatory. You're neither alive or dead, and your end goal is closure before your inevitable passing. Various other systems are at play, and they will probably quirk your brow at first. But, eventually, you'll realize everything's intention and a complete picture will begin to form. Those claiming the game is a mess of design are possibly correct, but even with my limited time with the game, I personally feel it's a solidified set of systems. Nothing amazingly arbitruary. You'll at least never be bored.[Also, talk to everyone you can.]Now, the other focus of the game is EMOTIONS. I guarantee at least some of the dialogue will make you sigh, and those with a low threshold for ""pretentious"" imagery and dialogue might be annoyed by a good handful of it (the beginning scenes even had me rolling my eyes a bit, despite it's slick presentation). However, there is, thankfully, a fair amount of humor (whether intentional or not) that offsets the sincerity. Example: You'll come across a tribe of Juggalos  alongside actual Native Americans. The dialogue here can be... pretty hilarious. There are moments where the sincerity is enjoyable, and this is where the game is especially good. In these moments, the mellow music, the great art design, and gameplay all come to form a tight bond. And you want to keep playing, for, as I've already said, the game is also never boring. You'll have to recall dialogue, participate in gameplay challenges, balance Lightning and Prayers, and so on. Again, this is a very interesting game. Whether or not it's worthwhile to me in the long run has yet to be seen. However, upon first impressions... it's pretty damned cool.			"

												There's nothing for it, this game doesn't stand up as an enjoyable title as it goes on.It makes every effort to be a cerebral meaningful experience, an allegory for death with a gaming twist. But as a game too many things work badly in the design and work against the player in an unfair, unenjoyable way.To escape each level, the player must talk to people in the street to gather clues and buy entry into doors around the stage. In these doors the player must use the clues to answer riddles and return treasures, in exchange for one of two boons. Either lightning strikes at one of the blockaded exit, or a shelter is prepared in a future level to protect you from the enemy.However the lightning strikes are completely randomised, and will -with alarming frequences- strike the exact same spot every single time, leaving the remaining barricade intact, and meaning you must now spend even more doors on lightning instead of shelter.Couple this with the deeply unpleasant text, which apes a primitive console script, but is painful to read in it's stretched, unspaced format, coupled with the unnecessary grinding noise ever time it is 'printed' on the screen.The game features middling variety in it's battle sequences, with a variety of different situations needing to be combatted to escape the enemy at the end of each round. A platforming stage, a dungeon crawler, a cute homage to Space Invaders (Mattel). It is a nice effort, and despite the simple nature of the one button combat, an enjoyable close to each round.But the way the game is designed to be played multiple times undoes this charm. Each time you play, the player traverses six stages from the game, before meeting with an ending. After your first playthrough, there may be optimism to see some of the other stages. But very quickly it becomes tedious, as in between every stage is a sizeable, 'evocative' cutscene. All of which cannot be skipped.I advise people to avoid this game, it is not as intelligent and evocative as it wishes to be, and is not a pleasant or rewarding experience to sit through.			"

												Here's the dealio kids, I went into this game not with high or low expectations, I just really liked the premise of it. You are essentially dead and you're trying to put together your life and desires in this crazy afterlife inside a computer. I thought to myself ""Hell yeah, existentialism!"" Playing the game is a completely different experience, I will admit this I have not beaten the game yet. I get to the very last level and die every time, but here's the thing if you die in this particular level you restart the entire game. Now let me try to explain the mechanics of the game you go to a random level of ten differnet levels that you can be dropped into, you will then try to complete various tedious objectives normally involving talking to the residents in the 'town'; what you are trying to do is gain lightning and prayers from around the town you need both to win the game, the lightning will randomly destroy a piece of the blocks blocking the exits. Prayers build a safehouse in the very level I cannot get past, all while on a timer. ""What happens when this timer runs out you ask?"" Well the level will slowly be destroyed a piece at a time until you find an exit or get destroyed with it. So let me run you through it all together now: You get dropped into a town, 3 minutes to get enough lightning so that you might be able to open an exit, and get some prayers to build up your defenses in the town that will get destroyed by the computer. Oh and if you get attacked and lose a fight against one of the enemies they'll take away one of your safehouses.So let's say you make it through all that and make it to the town (You have to go there twice to win the game) you run into a building several houses get destroyed then you have to find a new one, this goes on a couple times and then let's say you win that round, yay! You will then have to go back there in 3 more levels and you have to build up more prayers or you're not going to make it.I tried to like this game, but I just could not get past the terrible gameplay, if there were better objectives, not such a harsh timer, or anything really, it could be playable, but it's just not.3/10			"

												 TL;DR - Recommended, yes, but with caution. This is an interesting concept that is not always well executed in terms of mechanics, and it's easy to get frustrated.I really, really, really wanted to like this game. Continue? is a beautiful idea, and has very strange but wonderful writing. I love this style of graphics, so that's another tally in the ""Pro"" column. The music is nice, and some of the stage designs were really wonderful. A special shout-out goes to the Pink Castle level, where a number of princesses wander about. One of them tells you a story about being kidnapped and taken to a castle, where she awaited rescue. And when no one came, she took up a sword and beheaded anyone who got in her way, forging a new path for herself to carve out a life where she could have peace. It was a beautifully written story that I wish I had screen shots of, but unfortunately the levels randomly generate and I can't quite work up the motivation to play again until I get to that level. Which brings me to my next point…There are some flaws. Big ones. The idea of semi-random encounter battles that drop you into a sort of mini-game based on some other style of game, mostly arcade-style games from what I saw, is a really great concept that fits the theme of this game and it's story. The downside is that the encounters are frustratingly difficult, to the point of nearly gamebreaking, and ultimately I gave up on this title. It has some other flaws, some in the mechanics (I hit some glitches that required me to start the game over--which is ironic as hell, considering the plot of a game character battling through random access memory trying to buy time to avoid being deleted) and some with the repetitive nature of the conversations and cut scenes that can't be avoided or skipped. I will, hopefully, pick this up again one day. I recommend Continue? because it's an interesting idea with some cool graphics and great music. But take the recommendation with a grain of salt, because in a lot of ways it's very difficult to play through and not the rewarding experience I had hoped for.  "

												Continue?9876543210 is not going to be a fun game for everyone. Many will find its lack of guidance frustrating, or its over simple art style and gameplay to be an overdone trope. But I feel this isn't a game in the traditional sense, in the same way poetry isn't prose. This game makes you reflect, look deeper, and even contemplate existence as you wander through simple yet beautiful worlds interacting with the people within. It truly is a beautiful game, and if you want to have an experience of contemplation and love rather than just skill, I highly recommend this game. 10/10			"

												A great premise but I can't recommend this game. I'm all for philosophising and a deep story, but the premise is ALL this game has. I couldn't really find a story behind constant references to prayer and lightning and very brief discssions of nihilism. Tedious gameplay with no proper gamepad support and obscure mechanics further marred the experience. If you want ruminations on computer people - play the Talos Principle instead.			"

												It's been a long time since I played a game that invoked thought, and the first thing I'll say of this game is, it does it on a massive scale. Where do we go when we die, when the last breath we take is over and we are sent into the infinante void of the unkown? Well the game explores that concept in a way that a videogame character would. Your character dies, and only waits to be deleted forever. However... he is not ready to die.The game brings in lots of puzzles, mainly memory games, and lots of exploration. Different areas bring different challenges, which can be somewhat luck based unless you explore more effectively. Making a wrong choice can be utterly disasterous, rendering your last chance to survive completely null.The biggest highlight I have to give this game, is the music. The games soundtrack is so amazing, and honestly sounds like a masterpeice all on its own. I wish there was somewhere I could buy it, because I would in a heartbeat. The music fits very well with the game, giving you a feel for each area while also reminding you of your impending demise. This is honestly one of the most inventive and amazing Indie games I've ever played, probably up there on the list with the all mighty Braid. For 10 bucks, this game is worth buying twice.			"

												Here's the dealio kids, I went into this game not with high or low expectations, I just really liked the premise of it. You are essentially dead and you're trying to put together your life and desires in this crazy afterlife inside a computer. I thought to myself ""Hell yeah, existentialism!"" Playing the game is a completely different experience, I will admit this I have not beaten the game yet. I get to the very last level and die every time, but here's the thing if you die in this particular level you restart the entire game.

												I purchased this game based on what I saw in the video trailer. I saw a retro-style action adventure game with a deep, sad, yet sweet story that would make me think about life and fill me with a desire to help this poor protagonist sprite. Perhaps it's my fault for misinterpreting the trailer, but it seems to be more like the developer misrepresented the game quite heavily.Rather than your typical adventure game where you advance the story by exploring new areas, fighting the Bad Stuff, and engaging in dialogue with NPCs, you have here a frantic experience of rushing to find disappearing NPCs to talk to and doors to enter punctuated by uninspired slice-and-dice minigames.On the up side, the introductory cutscene sequence is a beautiful thing to watch, but I could have done that on YouTube.

												Christians like to explain what happens when people die. Problem is, easy answers ignore the gravity of the situation. Death is confusing, especially for the living. Jason Oda’s game, Continue?9876543210, takes a long road through the mourning of a life lost, awaiting absolute termination.Players aren’t sitting immediately with Jason Oda as they play his game, ruminating on life, death, and eternal destinations. But the invitation to enter into that tension is one that joins his longing for life and meaning at the point of death. When in mourning, we’re a mess and life isn’t fun. Death is confusing and frustrating. And the game’s metaphors are so unclear that I don’t even know what we’re mourning. Is it our own existential death? Or the death of a loved one? In the end, I don’t think it matters. What does matter is being able to mourn with those who mourn and rejoice with those who rejoice.Read more: http://gamechurch.com/death-and-mourning-in-continue9876543210/ "

												This little indie gem is actually an interesting game. It gave me a feeling of futility and wonderment. The first few playthroughs can make you a little lost but the setting in which it takes place is dark. If you know anything about processors and how they operate, this games gets you thinking about entities it operates on, however unrealistic it may be. Dark, depressing, and a pleaseant addition to my library. 8/10			"

												A wonderful, poignant experience. A bit philosophical. Sometimes a bit intensive, when you need to act quickly. And overall a pretty hard game (or maybe I am just bad at it).It's hard to describe who might like such a game. Maybe it's mostly a matter of being able to immerse yourself into the game and to be in the right (albeit sad) mood. It is certainly beautiful in a strange way.It's one of these games that is just different from everything else.			"
