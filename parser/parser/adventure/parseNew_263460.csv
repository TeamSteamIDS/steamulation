												This is one of the most insane puzzle games I've ever played. The mechanics are simple: you have a grid of X by Y squares, place your pieces down in a way that everyone likes who they're seated beside (the basic rule of the game: Girls like Robots. Girls don't like Nerds. Nerds like Girls, Robots, but not other Nerds).Except then suddenly you're learning that June actually really likes Bugs. But Bugs don't like Girls. And Ben likes June, so make sure to leave a space near June for Ben so he can ask her out, and...The game's complexity builds slowly, and it comes through adorably quirky cutscenes. It also has 3 tiers of medal per stage, but in a twist I absolutely adore, ""gold"" does not mean ""perfect"" - it just means ""the highest"". This is one of those games where the designer didn't go through and mathematically 'solve' every stage and expect you to do the same, and that goes a long way for me in saying ""This is the kind of game devoted to fun first, humor second, and everything else is just a bonus"".Plus, if you score enough golds and things, you unlock alternate silly modes. I'm waiting to see what Nerd Drop is.edit: Infinite Nerd Drop is everything I wanted from the name.			"

												After eight hours of enjoying the small storyline, smiling at the art, rubbing my forehead in frustration at the occasional level, trying to get gold for all of the puzzles and giving the nice message I gave to one of the developers, I finally have my review for Girls Like Robots.I was not disappointed.I don't play many puzzle games, but I'm happy that this one was the one off.  Basically, you have to arrange the people in the way the game demands; Girls like the robots, robots like the girls, nerds like the robots and the edge of the playing field and, last but not least, the girls don't want to be near the nerds.  It's all straightforward until you begin to realize that this isn't a linear, repetitive game.  No, the developers keep throwing new things at you in order to keep it fresh.  This made it extremely entertaining the entire playthrough.The music isn't too bad, but at times it could be repetitive.  Then again, I was focusing like a madman on the puzzles and the art (the square people are cute, ok!?) so the music didn't really capture my attention that much.All in all, a good puzzle game for the price and an enjoyable one at that.  I recommend it to anyone interested and I hope they find the same amount of enjoyment that I did in the game.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. It caught my eye a while ago and it's been on my wishlist ever since. It looked so cute and entertaining, and the reviews for it seemed quite positive.That said, Girls Like Robots really fell flat with me.The charm of the game wore off very, very quickly.The puzzles were boring and the music was terrible.Even for a puzzle game the gameplay was subpar.I played through and kept hoping its initial charm would make a surprise comeback... but instead the game slowly dragged on and on, getting more boring as it went. Even the art was hard to enjoy, when all the characters were just a bunch of heads bobbing up and down, it all felt lazy and uncreative. The puzzles became redundant and failed to evolve into anything challenging or interesting. A disappointment all around.If you're planning on getting this game, aim to get it on sale. Don't waste $7 on it.			"

												This game is pretty hilarious. The puzzles get more difficult as you get further into the levels, but the hilarity of the 'plot' and the reasoning.... Girls like robots, nerds like edges, girls are only okay with nerds if there is an adjacent pie.... Just a quirky unrealistic logic game, but hey, who knows! Maybe some girls really do like pie THAT MUCH. Turn it around from a way to a man's heart is through his stomach.... now it's a way to sit next to a girl is through an adjacent pie. It's definitely some good laughs with some 'wtf logic' moments.			"

												Very fun, little, casual puzzle game.  The art style is playful and vibrant with a wonderful attention to detail, especially in the backgrounds.  The animations were smooth and fun to watch, as a feature the game also allows the player to skip the cutscenes or even watch the cutscenes again in the level viewer.  The story was surprisingly well done as well. Normally, I would not expect a story in a puzzle game like this, however there was a story, and it was quite easy to follow.  Though the adventures were wacky and didn't make any logical sense, it fit the overall tone of the game perfectly.  I must also applaud the creators of the game for adding little references from other media and of course geek culture.  The soundtrack of this game was great, however it got very repetitive as the game progressed, for my ears got tired of hearing the same banjo tune strummed over and over again.  The best way to remedy this problems is to take a break once in a while to let your ears rest.  However this little problem did not and will not dull the rest of the gaming experience in anyway. The game was easy to pickup and play, however don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles will take a little bit of thinking to figure it out, especially if you are a completionist.  Bonus content allows for some replayability which adds to the value of the game itself and in no ways detracts from the main game itself.  The system of unlocking bonus content is well done, as even an intermediate skilled player will be able to ""buy"" the content (The main game will provide more than enough ""happy"" points to unlock them).  The achievements brings nothing new to the table, but it fairly awards those who are willing to spend some time in the game.Overall this is a solid game with little to no faults to describe.  It is a must own for people who like puzzle games, and for people who don't, this is a good game to pick up, because of its ease of play.  The game's content to value ratio is good, however don't expect to sink hundreds of hours into this game.  9/10			"

												Classic ""beat it perfectly to get 3 stars"" kinda puzzle game - every puzzle is easy to beat, but difficult to get perfect. The core mechanic lends itself to experimentation, where you could move around the pieces until you get the perfect solution and get the satisfaction of nailing the puzzle and understanding the mechanic. Except it doesn't. A placed tile can only be replaced by undoing that action or resetting the entire puzzle. And some puzzles even dictate the order in which you have to place the tiles (and it doesn't tell you the order. It just hands you a tile). The puzzles are already difficult to keep track of in your head, and not being allowed to freely move the pieces passes the point of ""difficult"" into ""annoying"". Instead of inviting experimentation, the game is just unnecessarily restrictive and an otherwise interesting mechanic is lost in slow repetition.			"

""Blocky Girls really like blocky Robots""The Square University has sendout its blocky students to discover different places in this weird world. Firstly everything seems very easy. Girls like Robots but dislike Nerds. So you have to manage the seats in a bus that nobody gets annoyed. With each level the complexity of seats and possible combinations raises.This little action puzzle game has probably not the greatest visual animations but it's still lovely designed and the logic puzzles feel quite comfortable. Highly enjoyable gameplay. And then it goes crazy. Suddenly you get an Teacher character who loves bugs, ladybugs, fishes, fires, pies, and mustache robots. But that is still not the best. In the end you fly to space and handle space seals, alien slughats, alien girls and ofc alien nerds. Fantastic. Before you can think who likes who you must act to build up your laserproof shield. The endboss is quite challenging.This game simple makes fun. Also to mention the endless squaredance soundtrack and that it is now in Japanese avaible. There must be some fans out there ...			"

												I'm not sure how I ended up having this game in my library (maybe a friend gifted, or I picked up in a sale not sure?) but hell yes I'm glad I tried it.  I usually hate puzzle games because they are 'kinda' repetitive, the main objective is always the same.  But this Game is something else.  It's not a plain, dull, monotonous puzzle game with a crappy sound track and same freaking objective everytime. It's different, different enough to make me play it 1 hour at a stretch without getting bored, without realising I actually did spend 1 hour playing this game.  + Cute figures+ A unique puzzling game, which kinda changes as your progress into the story. + They have managed to include a very sweet, short but nice story in complement with the puzzles.+ Bright and happy theme. A perfect ""Casual"" game to brighten your mood!+ It's not TOUGH, it's not EASY. It strike a sweet balance between the both, and that is a HUGE PRO.- Even though the sound track is nice, it's the same thing repeating endlessly in loops. (Got irritated of it after an hour..)- A little cheesy, some people might fall sick. (:P)I might update the review after I play more of this game.  But for now, I'd give it a rating of 8/10.			"

First playthrough time: 8 hoursMajor Pros:Clean graphicsEasy to use in game interfaceDiversity in mechanics, level goals, and stylesGood bonus content (Nerd Drop is a great time waster)Game had a good sense of humorMinor Pros:Seals are adorableCustomizable iconsKeeps track of solution ""prefectness"" for perfectionist playersMajor Cons:Relied too much on basic gameplay (aka what you learned in the intro)Didn't take enough advantage of most unique level designs (aka used about 3 times and then never again)Minor Cons:Story was silly and made no sense (but matched the theme of the game)Level select when you came back to the game was sometimes unclear where you left offI hate banjo musicAll together not a hard puzzle game unless you want to go for perfect on all the levels, but cute graphics and some interesting level designs make the game fun. The whole thing is fairly long for a puzzle game, but can be picked up and put down easily. The biggest thing I'd say it suffered from was some overuse of the basic Girl / Nerd / Robot interaction and not enough exploration of some of the other concepts and level designs that the game put forth, like shooting giant insects.

												I'll confess in reality i'm just undecided about this game, I really wish i loved this game. I love the idea of this game, i love the look of this game and i love the design of this game however i just can't get into it the same way i can/have done with other games. Sure i put in a few minutes here and there but for me personally this isn't a hardcore sit through and play till i finnish game, although i suppose thats how it is for a lot of puzzle games, they're good for just picking up and playing here and there. The story 'film' segments can be a little irritating because i wasn't looking for a story in this sort of game, however i'm sure if it didn't have a story i'd complain it didn't flow properly (You just can't please some people!).Besides all that, i do still like this game, at least a little, i have played it in short bursts of time, but when it comes down to it i often get too frustrated with the puzzles, because they are actually challenging which is a very big part of a puzzle game, so i wouldn't see that as a necessary down point especially as you don't have to get it 100% correct to move through the levels.This game is fun and quirky and i would reccomend giving it a go, it's the sort of game everyone needs in their steam library just for those times you want an easy to pick up and play puzzle game and for that i give this game a thumbs up!

												If the words ""Logic puzzles with a silly sense of humour"" scratch your fancy, this is what you're after.  It's all based on arranging various pieces that react differently to their adjacent pieces.  Which sounds simple, and it mostly is, but the developper showed a lot of wit and creativity in the game's design, and it's very well refined.Only problem is that it's a bit short, but the ride is plenty enjoyable and, I think, well worth the price.

												The plot is lunacy but the game is solid.  It's a puzzle game where you have to calculate the seating arrangement of a group of people based on their preferences.  For instance, if you sit a girl next to a robot, both are happy unless the robot is surrounded on four sides -- in which case the robot becomes very unhappy.This may seem like a very rudamentary game mechanic that would get boring very quickly, but the developers did a good job of constantly adding new seating rules and curve balls that keep the game fresh all the way to the end.Based on my playthrough, the game is 5-7 hours long.

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/girls-like-robots-first-impressions/Girls Like Robots is a nice, casual logic puzzle game. It's very obvious that its a mobile port, but it doesn't actually play that bad on PC.The game itself is very funny and completely unrealistic. Girls like robots, girls dislike nerds, nerds like edges, etc. Very simple gameplay, easy to pick up on, especially considering the game holds your hand throughout the first several levels. The art style is very quirky and colorful, along with the smooth animations.The game does have a slight story to it, in the form of various cutscenes scattered in between levels. It's a ridiculously simple story, nothing fantastic, but it is rare to see any type of story in a puzzle game like this, so props for that. The story doesn't really make much sense logically, but neither does the game, so that's okay! The game's soundtrack is quite repetitive, however.The puzzles were (for me) quite easy to follow. It gets progressively more difficult, but not so difficult as to prevent progression on my part. It really depends on how much thought you put into each puzzle before acting, as it is a logic puzzle game. The game has a high replayability if you're a completionist. Each level can be perfected, if you know what to do, and it would take quite some time to do so, hence the increased replayability.Overall, Girls Like Robots is a fantastic little game. It's a pleasure to play, even on PC, although I can only see myself playing this on mobile instead of Steam in the future. The pricetag is set at $7, which may be a bit high for a game of this scale, so try to pick it up during a sale if you're interested.			"

Girls like to be next to robots, boys like to be next to girls, etc.  You want everybody to be happy!  As the game progresses, more pieces are introduced with interesting rules.The difficulty seemed just right to me.  Some puzzles are tough, but it's always fair.  You get unlimited ""undo"", so you can experiment with placing pieces.  The game really makes you think, but overall it's a relaxing experience.			"

												Girls Like Robots is a puzzle based game, it starts off fairly easy but as more rules and characters get brought in it can be a little challenging. If you're worried about getting stuck part way through there are plenty of helpful guides out there if needed.-I have 100% on this game so it is able to be completed with all the achievements, though one is fairly annoying.The annoying achievement is based on one of the side games (though using the term ""side game"" doesn't really seem fair) you will probably play upon completing the main section of the game, I don't know if it bugged out for me or if its like that for everyone but you just had to leave the game running, on screen, whilst a character falls and builds up your score. I ended up leaving it on overnight when I knew I would be having a lie in.			"

Also, every puzzle can be completed in three tiers of increasing difficulty, which means the game is not hard to complete, but at the same time it presents a challenge if you want to get the gold for every puzzle.All of these elements make for a charming game that is well executed and well worth your time.

Girls Like Robots is a title that perfectly captures both the charm and the core mechanic of this excellent puzzle game.It's such a simple concept. There is a rectangular grid and you're tasked with placing the various characters in the scene in such a way that everybody is happy or some other requirement is fulfilled. How happy people are is influenced by who they're next to, so girls literally like robots.Nerds like girls, like robots and like being near the edge of the group but dislike being next to other nerds (I like to imagine it's because they disagree on the age-old Star Wars vs. Star Trek debate).Girls don't just like robots, they also dislike nerds and tolerate other girls. Robots like girls and have no strong feelings about nerds or other robots.These are just the first three characters, and already they have enough different interactions to have plenty of puzzle fun, but this barely scratches the surface. There are tons of other characters, each with their own likes, dislikes and quirks, but never so many that you're forced to remember all of them (and if you do forget you can always easily look up the relevant interactions, just in case you'd forgotten that fish and robots were mortal enemies).The puzzles themselves also vary in type, with some allowing you to freely place characters while others restrict the order in which you place them.This would already be a strong recommendation without bothering to go into the delightful story.It starts simple enough, a school trip, a sports game, a volcano erupting, a big dance. Wait, volcano?!Never taking itself seriously, but always sharing the joke with the player, the plot is as light-hearted as they come and animated in the same gorgeous style as the core game.With three large Acts, each with around a dozen chapters to go through (which themselves consist of ~4-10 stages) there is plenty to do, but it doesn't outstay its welcome and the finale, while a bit long, is definitely worth the effort.Strongly recommended, get some Girls and Robots in your life today.

												Nice, entertaining little game.Graphics are not much elaborate, but it doesn't stop you from having fun seeing those people get happy or angry.The storyline doesn't (always) make sense, but it is funny and original, and every little cutscene in the game (and there are a lot) introduces a new feature.If you want to get full marks on each level, it will take a bit of time, as it is hard to master everything here but the good point is that you'll definitely not get bored in this game as each objective is pretty much different from another.Just a little thing that's bugging me : I find it difficult to know how much I'll gain or loose from placing this character in that place because all the neigbours will react at the same time to this new presence (in a good or bad way). So, that means trial and error until you get the perfect/good enough combination to pass the level.Ah ! and as you've probably noticed while watching the trailer, this game also has a bit of humor ... enjoy !

												This girl loves robots and man, is this an addicting little game! Remember those brain teasers from gradeschool tests? ""Lisa hates Lyle but Lola wants to sit next to Lucas. Who is eating the ham sandwich?"" Girls Like Robots is like the grown-up (okay, term loosely used) version of that. Mix and match, use your cows acid milk to burn some holes in picnic blankets and don't forget to save a seat for bug girls pet insects. A very cute, endearing sort of game that's about 20% brain power and 80% clicking around until you find a match. Excellent absorber of excess time when you have 10 or 20 minutes to kill and features some super adorable (yes, -super- adorable) cut scenes between levels.It might just be the estrogen talking but a definite 4/5 rating from me.

												A decent puzzle game with a cute presentation, but some annoyances as well. Under the hood it's all math: each of your square figures has a like/dislike relationship with every other one, and score is kept based on which faces are in contact at any given time. This is only explained briefly, once, though there's a button to show current relationships on a colour scale instead.Things become more complicated when you're forced to place tiles in a specific order. Things become annoying when, doing one of these puzzles, you realize that in order to correct a mistake made a dozen turns ago, you have to undo all twelve moves. Tile swapping puzzles present a similar challenge in that you're only given a certain number of moves, and a similar annoyance in having to restart if you realize that you've fouled things up royally.Unfortunately, the developers decided to throw timed minigames into the mix, and make them part of the scoring/unlocking scheme for the bonus puzzle levels. They're skippable, but again, they're tied into the system that unlocks bonus levels. This kind of thing baffles me-- these games are supposed to be brain teasers, not repetitive, fast-paced drills.Despite those gripes, I definitely recommend this title. There are dozens of puzzles in varying formats, and the whole thing is very well presented.			"

												It's not that this game is bad, it's just way too repetitive. Puzzles gets frustrating fast, different levels keeps making the game feel fresh; and yet... it just feel like more of the same even if all the rules are different.This game is for huge puzzle enthousiast, which isn't me; as after a single act I started using a walkthrough.

												Puzzle games normally don't hold my attention for very long, but Girls Like Robots was a complex story about love, rejection, and being unable to make everyone happy. It's not a game for everyone, but I was surprised to find out that it was a game for me.Some things about the game might seem tedious, but they sort of break away if you overcome the difficulty curve and truly learn how to play. It also helps to get into the mind of every character and understand what they like and dislike, rather than memorize a series of patterns.The soundtrack is very folksy, and I happen to love folk music. I don't think everyone else can appreciate that, but that is a factor to consider before getting this game as a gift for a friend or loved one. Also, I appreciated how it was Safe For Work and at times amusing.			"

July 21, 2015Girls Like Robots is fueled by silliness and delightful writing. Despite being a logic puzzle, the world is an entirely crazy place. But the game succeeds at developing a personality without pushing the absurdity too far. It may appear like a mobile game, but it feels very solid on PC.The game is a fairly casual puzzle, involving interactions between character pieces. Each group of levels focuses on new mechanics, introducing them smoothly and keeping the game fresh. Each group uses the story to justify rule changes, with some levels focused on getting the lowest score possible. The game stays fresh and hardly feels repetitive. Some levels did cause me trouble, mostly the five or so levels with a time limit. The music is solid and relaxing, but some songs can be repetitive. Sound effects are often hilarious, and still make me smile after playing the game to completion.A sense of humor is needed for Girls Like Robots, as you can't take it seriously. It's a lovely game with a great personality, and strong gameplay to keep it going. It's perfect for a fan of puzzles and silly comedy. With the full price of $7 USD, I'm willing to recommend it to everyone.			"

												A decent puzzle game with a cute presentation, but some annoyances as well. Under the hood it's all math: each of your square figures has a like/dislike relationship with every other one, and score is kept based on which faces are in contact at any given time. This is only explained briefly, once, though there's a button to show current relationships on a colour scale instead.Things become more complicated when you're forced to place tiles in a specific order. Things become annoying when, doing one of these puzzles, you realize that in order to correct a mistake made a dozen turns ago, you have to undo all twelve moves. Tile swapping puzzles present a similar challenge in that you're only given a certain number of moves, and a similar annoyance in having to restart if you realize that you've fouled things up royally.Unfortunately, the developers decided to throw timed minigames into the mix, and make them part of the scoring/unlocking scheme for the bonus puzzle levels. They're skippable, but again, they're tied into the system that unlocks bonus levels. This kind of thing baffles me-- these games are supposed to be brain teasers, not repetitive, fast-paced drills.Despite those gripes, I definitely recommend this title. There are dozens of puzzles in varying formats, and the whole thing is very well presented.			"

												Cute puzzle game but the difficulty is not well balanced. Some chapters were quite easy and others I really struggled with. I would have enjoyed this game more overall I'd been allowed to place and switch squares as much as I liked. Call it easy mode if you like but some of the movement restrictions, while I understand were part of the challenge, felt more frustrating than fun. There is a complete walkthrough available which helped keep my puzzle rage in check. I don't want to give this a negative review as I found it a charming puzzler overall. Just keep in mind that you will probably be reaching for a walkthrough in some sections. And if you're better than me and don't need the help you may find it a little short. I would recommend waiting for a sale to buy this one.			"

												A decent enough puzzle game with an amusing style. It even has a story line!Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be my type of puzzle game.I have a few complaints about it. If they don't bother you, then you may enjoy this game.- Despite being most of the way through act one, it is still adding new rules and restrictions.- I don't enjoy the puzzles where you have to place the pieces in a certain order. - Slow / hard to earn achievements.- The in game navigation / menus are a bit confusing to use. Simply put, this does not feel like the casual puzzle game I expected. The adventure tag is more fitting.			"

												Girls Like Robots is a quirky puzzle game with an adorable art style and a story that was really entertaining. Overall the puzzles themselves were just the right difficulty and were done is such a way that even if you seen these types of puzzles before GLR made them feel new and refreshing in there own way. The music fit the game very well and complemented the mood the game was trying to set while playing. If you enjoy good puzzles that are fun and challenging then you won't regret buying and playing this game.			"

												I played this game very enthusiastically many months ago. Then I stopped playing it. I just realized I hadn't finished it, so I relaunched it. Uh... What? I'm still not finished with the first act? 88 out of 108 scenes just for that?! Let me see... No achievements unlocked yet? But... I played for several hours! Oh... Right. It's a game for hardcore puzzle fans, I guess. The achievements are annoying to get, there are tons of levels, new mechanics are introduced like every other minute, and I guess you're supposed to have a PhD if you want to finish all of the levels.Yeah, well... I think (hope?) that many will enjoy that, but to me the mechanics lost all of their charm after the first hour, especially with the unbalanced difficulty. This gets no recommendation from me, unless you're fine with stopping it when you feel you're done with it. Just gotta know when to quit.			"

												I just finished Girls Like Robots after 10 hours of gameplay and there is still more to do as I have not played through the bonus levels or achieved perfect scores on all main levels. It is the perfect game when in the mood for relaxing and casual puzzles.What to love about Girls LIke Robots: The humor! The storyline and narrative is wonderfully silly. The art. It is unique, creative, and calming. The music. It is relaxing, playful, and fits perfect with the art and overall style of the game. As for the gameplay... the puzzles are fun and are not too repetitive, they are challenging if trying to get a perfect score                 but if not you can get through the levels pretty easily on the first or second try.

												Very nice game. (And ""nice"" is the best word I can come up with; it fits very well.) The mood is positive, maybe a bit cheesy and clichée, but that can easily be overlooked. The puzzles are very varied. You get new types of challenges and viewpoints and problem-types very often, and it's all embedded in a story arc.You can skip particularly troublesome puzzles and finish them at a later time, which is REALLY good. You can finish and move on with low score, or try to get a better one for more points, thus getting earlier/more unlocks of bonus features.So the game is very forgiving, combined with being motivating and having lots of variety.If I had to say one bad thing about the game, it would be that there could be a little more musical variety. The music fits the game though. It just gets a bit repetitive after a while.Oh and when you play the final level ... that takes FOREVER, and towards the end it gets more tricky, and if you make a single mistake, your chances of getting a certain achievement are ruined and you'd have to start over. Happened to me. So frustrating!In general, the whole game is casual and then the finale is not at all casual. But with patience, focus and perseverence it will succeed.I don't know what else to say. I'm usually quite critical when reviewing games, but this one is an easy 'thumbs up'. This game is so cheerful! It's like the whole time you're playing this, you're partying.And while I got this with heavy discount, if your own budget allows for more, it might easily be worth full price. Especially since the game has a decent length if you don't try to rush through. (108 puzzles) ... It is also quite challenging if you want to get gold for all puzzles.			"

												Not recommended for achievement hunters due to tedious and unfun last achievement. From it's store page, this game looks really charming and appealing. It has very positive reviews and an adorable trailer. I bought it for the fun of the puzzles and because I liked the art style. However, by the end of it, I found it to be tedious and unlikable. As someone who strives for 100% on games that I enjoy playing, I open this game now only in pursuit of the last achievement. Here's what stands out from my experience:Pros Cute art style, fairly unique Customizable avatars for each of the puzzle pieces Interesting and challenging puzzles with many variations Easy to use menus and settingsSkippable cutscenesCons P.I.T.A. to get the last achievement (50/50 Infinite Nerd Drop - even the developer has acknowledged this one was bad taste on their part) Not enough gameplay to warrant the $6.99 base price Lacks replayability - no settings or difficulty modifiersIf I were writing this review earlier in the game, I might have recommended it. There were a lot of good parts to it, but it was not satisfying overall from a completionist perspective. Girls Like Robots has left a bad taste in my mouth that I could not, in good conscience, wish unto others. Looking at the global achievement stats and seeing that only 17% of players have even finished the first act, I think that others have also had a negative experience. If you like to buy games and then not play them through, feel free to add this one to your collection.			"

												I actually really liked this game a lot. I didn't think I would. I thought people were exaggerating when they said this game was so good but it kind of is. I don't normally like puzzle games but this one was really nice. It is proooooobably best as a phone game though. I would love it on a phone. But it did really well with what it has. They keep it really fresh (most of the time) and give you new gimmicks to play around with that often times dramatically change how you solve the puzzles. The gimmick never overstays its welcome and it's just really nice. i wouldn't pay 7 dollars for this though. But it was a good game for how simple it was. I just liked it ok			"

It's lighthearted and absurd story is a real joy, especially for people who love terrible puns and revel in playful absurdity.  A game that's as fun to quote out of context as it is to share with others.  Don't let the very simple premise fool you, Girls Like Robots has plenty of variety that will challenge you with new kinds of problems continually.  I'm impressed with how carefully the stages flow with one another, not allowing any one challenge to become overbearing.			"

Understanding nerds, Artificial Intelligence, women, and romantic chemistry...I'm a huge fan of puzzle games, almost any kind of puzzle game will entertain me. What sets this one apart and makes it fun to play and interesting is the very same thing that holds it back from being a ""great"" game. The graphics, while well drawn and cute, do grate on your nerves after a bit. The developers responsible for this game have obviously spent a lot of time worrying about the sound design, the cute voice effects and absolutely fantastic old-timey bluegrass soundtrack kept me playing longer than I would have otherwise for a first sit-down with this game. Even with the great soundtrack and cute voices, I see myself playing through Girls Love Robots in small 15-minute chunks, as opposed to marathoning the entire thing like with most puzzle games. So, really, my most major criticism is that it just isn't addictive enough.  Cute, simple to understand concept with some surprisingly challenging puzzles when pared with the childlike graphics do not make something easy to sit and pour hours into at a time. I don't think this was the point of the game, anyway, but it is definitely something that loses points - at least for me, it does. After 20 minutes or so, you will want to strangle every, ""Normal girl,"" that lets out an excited squeal whenever placed next to a robot. Very mixed feelings about this game.Switching up the gameplay features and creating interesting challenges does keep the game interesting to a degree, and I appreciate the silly but harmless sense of humor inherent within it. This game would be great if you have a friggin' genius for a child that can figure out puzzles, but they would probably get bored with it after a few short sessions, as well. The hilarious use of stereotypes is great - you've got your nerds that sit in the corners, and are pleased as punch surrounded by robots, your preppy girls who love robots because they're cute, the nerdy girls who are loners and love ladybugs, and the robots, which are way overdone - but it has been a few years since they've been featured in a major way in anything pop culture related thanks to the zombie boom. It hasn't been that long, yet, fellas. I got it in a bundle, so I really can't say anything bad about the price, but on the Steam store it would be a worthy pick up for less than 5 dollars. However, I wouldn't pay any more than that for it, because you might not finish the game, or you may take forever to finish it by playing in small bursts of time. Sure, I recommend it, but don't count on getting addicted to it like with some other puzzlers. 6.5/10 - Gameplay and addictiveness.9/10 - Soundtrack.			"

												I just couldn't get into this. It starts out really handholdy and boring, and it remains boring throughout. If you're a fan of puzzle gamers you might get a kick out of this, but everything this game does is done better in pretty much any puzzle/match game out there. It basically sacrificed the gameplay over the style, and it really shows after about 5 minutes that it's nothing special.			"

												A small puzzle game with an absolutely amazing art aesthetic and folksy soundtrack. Gameplay is ""put these things in the best order"" with lots of alternate tiles and rulesets to always keep the player engaged. This is absolutely worth the asking price and I recommend it to anybody who enjoys puzzle or casual games.			"

												I got this game from Humble Bundle and had absolutely no idea what to expect. I was not particularly drawn by the strange title or artwork (square face icons). After a while, I decided to give it a shot. I've got to say, it is a well made game. It starts out easy, and you are slowly introduced to more difficulty. Though the artwork is... well... square faces, the makers did well to animate them and make a little bit of a story. It is surely quirky, but the game itself is solid. The music is good. It runs very smoothly. I can say that it feels a bit like a tablet game in some ways, but it doesn't take away from the PC experience. All in all, it is an enjoyable game that is quite quirky, but in a good way. It is good, clean fun with nothing objectionable that I have seen.			"

												Girls like robots is a puzzle game where you have to sit different people next to each other according to their likes and dislikes, girls want to sit next to robot and away from nerds, nerds near the edges but away from other nerds (why can't they be happier when next to a robot? they're NERDS!), pie makes everyone forget about their trouble and more.Sound wise the game is somewhat lacking, you're hearing the same soundtrack for hours, graphical wise the game looks cute.Every few levels the game implements new features to mix the gameplay a little, hot spots, new characters, some people doing random movements across the board, etc.For 7 dollars you can get a few hours of fun , or a week of frustration if you go for perfect score in each level.

												Girls like robots, but hate nerds, who also hate nerds, but like edges and robots, who like girls, but not 4 of them.Basically this game is a puzzle game where you put people in grids to max out the happiness. More and more rules are added, and honestly it's actually really funny. So kick back and solve puzzles to laidback bluegrass music. Or turn off the music and annoying sound effects and watch TV while solving puzzles.			"

												Pretty good. Charming is the single word I'd say best describes this. The storyline is silly and whimsical. The visuals are cute. The gameplay is similar to a lot of games but I haven't seen this kind of matching game translated to feelings before. At first I thought this might be a reductive attempt at a ""girl's game"" since it's all about ""feelings"", the graphics have a cute style, and ""Girls"" is in the title. But I'm not a girl and I enjoyed it. It's a fun little game you can play for a couple minutes or an hour.Yes the single music track gets annoying after a while - muting it is easy though. Total game time for me was about 6 hours, since I tried a lot of levels over again to get a better score. Well worth the $5 I spent.			"

												I'm a puzzle game addict, but I kind of hate this game. Maybe it's just the way my brain works and something just doesn't click, but the puzzles were either laughably easy or impossible to get a gold rating on without brute forcing or looking up the answer. Or maybe it was just that the gameplay mechanics were so unfun it wasn't enjoyable to spend more time solving harder puzzles.It was cute at first, but the cutscenes really drag on and are just not funny or engaging, and if you skip them it says ""Skip this darling bit of theater?"" which is just irritating. Plus there are cutesy and slow animations when interacting with the menus/map which makes things take even longer.The final straw is the last achievement which is just to fiddle with an interactive screensaver for approximately 5 hours. No thank you.			"

												Interesting logic puzzles game, but the puzzles are pretty repetitive, and weren't able to grab my interest in the first hour or so. Slightly ofensive stereotypes in places. Overall game feels like an effortless port of a mobile game, and I think it would be better on the mobile platform.Edit: After thinking about it more, I think the thing that turned me of the puzzles themselves was really the interface. I liked the puzzle concept, but it would have been better to be able to move the pieces freely. having to undo back to the begining to change an early placement makes the puzzles a bunch harder without adding any value to the experience.

												Interesting concept, but the forced positioning wasn't interesting to me.

												This should've been an 'average' thumbs if steam would let me, but alas...I really can't bring myself to upvote this game.It absolutely has its charm. The style is absolutely not to my taste, but I understand that this a personal thing. If you like minimalistic graphics, cutesy characters (I'd even say caricatures) and a chaotic feel: all the more power to you. You get what the trailer and pictures promise.It's a puzzle game, and...while I've certainly encountered enough puzzles to say that they're not lazily done, they don't captivate me. This is partially because you don't get the long time needed to grok all the piece mechanics and use them in various combinations, but instead get introduced to new elements quickly. And with all the rules, this quickly adds up. So girls like robots, robots don't like being surrounded by girls and nerds like girls and corners. But how much do girls dislike nerds? How do they stand toward robots? This mix-and-match thing isn't that bad to figure out over the game, but before you can really learn those things (and you need to, to get the overall happiness high enough) you get new characters who like different things and you can start anew.So...I don't know. This might just not be my kind of game. I might not give it enough chance (note: that level where you got to surround the bug lady with bugs really got me into figuring it out. If the game didn't kept throwing new pieces at me to learn and not have a theme like this, it'd be an easy thumbs up). And I respect others who like this game. It's just...I...don't. :-(			"
