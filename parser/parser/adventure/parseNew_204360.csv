												Introduction:Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008. The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge). The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010. Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates. Verdict:This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't). The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again. However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes. If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them). Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons. Give this game a try by downloading the demo. If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it).			"

												A great game to play with a room full of friends, a pizza, and some drinks. The game is decent by itself, but with friends in a local coop setting, it's wonderful. The game is mostly you verses monsters, but occasionally you have to duke it out amongst yourselves for the hand of a lovely maiden. It has wonderful items, and challenging gameplay. I'd highly recommend picking up a 4-pack on sale to play with your buddies some time.			"

												Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up with some RPG elements. I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween. You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate. Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance. You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses. Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith. I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups. They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way. But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting. Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression. Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility. Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly. Do you want to focus on one or two stats? Or would you rather be more well rounded? How will you compliment your teammates? Or what is best for solo play? It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great. The ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences. Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign. And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan. I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool. The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title. However, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game. Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns. When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked. New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit. But after a while... it loses its luster. There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game. Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level. You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels. Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game... excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster. More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge. Also, the online isn't always the best. It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision. Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome. So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer.I like Castle Crashers. Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything... you'll be playing longer than you enjoy. But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people... all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun. Is it worth $15? Well... it really depends. If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably. Try out the demo and gauge your excitement. I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it. I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10. A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well. I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too.			"

												I first played this game on the Xbox 360 and I have just loved the game ever since. I obviously have done a lot with the game, considering that I have over 300 hours in it.GameplayThe gameplay is absolutely perfect. The arena asset of it where you must kill every enemy before you proceed is very fitting for a game like this. The enemy AI is also great, as they seem to get more agressive as you progress more through the game, and then once you beat the game, you have the option of doing it all over again, but with a brutally difficult twist where almost all of the enemies get nearly x10 health, damage, and everything.Playing with another friend is highly recommended for this game, simply because it's just one of those games that's better with friends, however I would say the only fault with it is when there's connection problems, causing the entire game to just pause to let the other players catch up. The difficulty in general is great and increases at the perfect rate, the ending of the game is actually nice and hard, even on Insane Mode it's probably one of the most difficult things in the entire game once you get at the end, but it feels good to beat it once you kill that damn Necromancer.The StoryI find the story of this game comedic and silly, while it still gives a clear representation of what is going on and what you must achieve in the end. The ending does feel very rewarding and it makes you realize how big of a thing it is that you're at the end of the game. With how everything is set up in the story, it makes you realize that it's a long and difficult journey to save the princesses.ContentThis game has so much content in it just as you play it. By how fun the game is, and the fact that you unlock a new character for each time you beat it, you'll see yourself constantly beating the game over and over again, unlocking all the new characters, new swords, and all of the animal orbs. There is also the two DLC characters that most players might end up buying, or at least the Pink Knight because who doesn't want a character that murders their enemies with rainbows and love on the field?Simply a great game that has so many reasons to play again and again, whether by yourself or with a full party.

												I can't even express how much this game means to me. I love my younger brother, but we never really spent a lot of time together. Him and I are the only brothers in a large family of mostly girls, all of whom couldn't care less about me or him. I felt so bad that I just didn't have a lot of time to hang out with him, with work and school and my own personal selfishness. Then I bought Castle Crashers. It was ok, especially for an old title. One day I was playing it, and my 7 year old brother walks by, and he's like, ""that looks fun."" And I didn't say a word, I just plugged in the old F310 and handed it to him. I let him kiss all the princesses. 120 hours later, with almost every character unlock, I can 100% reccomend this game and 100% say that my relationship with my brother has improved so much because of this game, as well as Battleblock Theater, and now Pit People. Thanks for a masterpiece, Behemoth.11/10 would fix relationship with little bro			"

												Castle Crashers,one of the best indie games I have ever played.The gameplay is really fun with a controller,but playing with a keyboard won't ruin your playing experience.The co-op mode is a lot of fun,especially if you play with 3 other friends.They are many pets and weapons you can collect and the amount of fun can't be described.You can usually get the game for 3.74$ sales,but the game is worth it even for the full price,the DLC's are great,but they are not a ""must have"" to enjoy the game.So yeah,I would reccomend you to get this game if you think about buying it,but try to get atleast one friend to buy it with you,because once you play with a friend,you will never want to play alone again !

Castle Crashers is insaneGTA, Saints Row, Manhunt? Not even close. In terms of sheer gore, those games have Castle Crashers beat, but there are few action games out there without plenty of gore. No, the traumatizing, soul-crushing characteristics of Castle Crashers is not about gore or level of violence, it’s in between the lines of the actions of the “heroes” you play. On the surface, it might seem like your average ‘hero on a journey to defeat evil’ type story, but if you look more closely, you will quickly realize that the heroes you play are among the most monstrous, psychopathic killers you have ever had the opportunity of controlling.Let’s have a closer look at your actions throughout the game, which means in the case that you feel the story is of importance in a game like this, you should know that there will be SPOILERS ahead. The Corncob. This poor vegetable had the sad fate of being either: being born very differently from the other maize, or having had some spell cast on him to turn him into a monster. He’s probably been bullied by the other corncobs his whole life. Is it strange that this unfortunate soul is a little aggressive? And yet what is the logical conclusion that the “heroes” reach when they meet the corncob? They slaughter him, and then proceed to eat his remains. Follow me on this, they slaughter a lost, confused creature, whose only crime was being different, and then consume his dead body because it’s tasty. The motivation? The corncob was kind of in the way of a place they were looking for, and decided it was too much trouble simply going around him.Next up, genocide. On their journey, the player champions and the army that follows them encounter a primitive tribe of polar bears. The bears like to eat fish, sleep and dance in the rain, and are completely oblivious to the ongoing war. When an army invades their land, the bears will naturally try to defend it out of fear. Do the good guys try a diplomatic solution? No, they exterminate the entire population of polar bears without mercy.Wedding crashers. Our righteous heroes crash a wedding, destroy the cake, and murder the guests and the groom, whose only wish was to get married. The groom was quite the villain though; his evil weapon was a musical instrument. Be grateful they saved us from that guy. The champions are not quite finished, though. The groom was the Cyclops’ only friend, and upon seeing him dead, the Cyclops flies into a great sorrow and rage, escaping to his cave to grieve. You get one guess at what the heroes do to the Cyclops. Wrong, they do not simply murder him, but make sure to give him the horribly painful death of molten lava.‘But wait!’ A player familiar with the game might say. ‘They rescue animals!’ This is true; they rescue a selection of animals from both battlefields and black market vendors throughout their journey. Then they proceed to use them as weapons. Baby seals, kittens, birds. You name it; they probably threw it right into the bloody war, to fight for their lives for their own cruel and selfish gains.What about the hermit in the mountains? The heroes meet a crazy, old hermit living in the mountains, who only wanted to show them his sock puppet show. They kill him because he has a steering wheel that they want. Oh, and the aspiring painter, let’s not forget about him. He also only wants to show off his artistic prowess by displaying his paintings. They kill him because....no reason what so ever! F*ck art, apparently.If this is not convincing enough, then I don’t know what more to point out. Except that if you decide to play multiplayer, when you rescue princesses, you will casually be fighting your friends to the death if it means you’ll get some of the fair maidens' sweet lovin’. This is the heroic thing to do, of course. Doesn’t get more morally rotten than this. Final verdict: AwesomeSide note: after approx. 50 hours of playing, a bug caused my entire save to get erased, without chance of recovery. Not so awesome.			"

Castle CrashersDefend your kingdom! Beat up baddies! Crash their castles and fight for honor and love! Hack n' Slash your way to glorious victory with a few poop jokes along the way.Castle Crashers is an Action Co-op Beat 'em up Flash game!Developed by The Behemoth, originating from their popular website, http://www.newgrounds.com/. Knowing that, the game comes with hilarious, but crude sense of humor, which is all part of the game's special charm. The game is all hand-drawn in Flash, giving it a nice and colorful artstyle that adds a cartoonish appeal to the game. Additionally, most of the music in Castle Crashers are submitted by loyal Newgrounds fans!Hack! Slash! Smash! Abracadabra!The gameplay is what makes this game great. It's your usual beat 'em up formula, with light and heavy attacks, performing combos and such. But in addition to that, you have the ability to cast magic! Controls the elements as you spark fire, summon icicles, conduct electricity, fling poison and throw buzz saws? Castle Crashers also features RPG elements, as you gain EXP for every hit, and with enough EXP, you level up! Granting you points in which you could assign to either physical or magical power!The Evil Wizard has kidnapped the King's daughters!The story can't be much simpler than this. As your king's loyal knights, you venture off to save the 4 princesses that has been taken away by the evil clutches of the Final Boss! You journey through war fields, forests, deserts, snow lands and many more as you battle various bosses such as barbarians, trolls, robots, dragons and aliens! Whenever you save one of the princesses, the true battle begins, as you and your friends fight to the death to win the princess' kiss! During your free time, you're free to participate in other game modes such as Arena; as you duel your friends gladiator style, and Back Off Barbarian; where you and your friends escape in this tricky tile-based mini-game!Journey alone or adventure with your buddies with up to four players!Either local, online, or hell, even both! You can select from a variety of knights, each with their own unique magical element, with many more unlockable characters as you play through the game. You can also select from a variety of weapons and pets, or ""animal orbs"" as the game calls them along the way, as most of them are cleverly hidden all across the map. However, this becomes a problem for most unlockable characters involve beating the game as certain other characters, then beating them game with those newly unlocked characters. Most of the characters are pretty much the same anyway for they share similar magic, while certain ones break the game from how Overpowered they are. While the game is relatively short and fun, it could be bothersome to most who plans to unlock everything.Final Verdict!While the game is fun alone, it is strongly recommended playing with friends. The game is unfortunately dying, so there are not many people playing online that often, so it's best to just host private games with friends. While unlocking more characters, animal orbs and weapons can be fun, it's still dependent on the player if they're into that sort of thing, and if they're willing to play the game numerous times just to achieve them.Grab the game when you can! Get the 4-pack, even! The game went as low as 90% off on sale, so you have no reason not to get it! And when you do start playing, don't play as any of the DLC characters for your first playthrough, for they do not unlock any new characters if you beat the game as them. Despite all these flaws, I'm a fan of it myself, so if you need someone to play with, give me a holler and we'll crash some castles together!			"

												Probably one of the best 4 player co-op games you can get in the Steam Store! Apart from Left 4 Dead that is. Castle Crashers has a lot to offer to those special groups, composed of four friends, as you'll find your team gaining experience, learning new unique moves in combat and fighting to the death of every chapter, all with a touch of humour. This game reaks of Indie-goodness and it goes for a fact that I love that type of game producing and development; Independently made, tying in nicely together, to make a labour of love.I love the particular 'crude' and simplistic art style this game has. Coming from the beloved artist, Dan Paladin, his ingenius creativity is best said as beautiful and completely staggering. Every character has a ''comic-component'' to them, including their emotions being presented in that of a slap-stick type of fashion. Interaction with random NPC's and the wacky medieval environments are top-notch and goofy and the rest can be left as fun. What more could be said?The game's appeal and genre, being in the typical 2-D Adventure Beat 'em Up hybrid, relates to the classic and retro games like Golden Axe for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, the classic Arcade game, Final Fight and even dating way back to Double Dragon and Battletoads for the NES. All of which shrouds you in a distant yet cherished memory, while this game adapts to its own heartwarming and charmful stylish nature. If you have played all of these previous games or other games that shares this joyful genre, you will most likely adapt to this game's control with pure expert skill.The game's mechanics are very immersive and easy enough to figure out even for first timers. Most battle systems work in waves; with a certain number of enemies that increase in power as you progress and defeat all enemies in a specific wave, which lets you advance further within a level. Most levels end in with a big boss battle, where your techniques, might and agility is put to the test, as you'll take down numerous tyrants and beasts, again with all a touch of humour and creative cartoon-ish atmospheres. All of this, to uphold the traditional tale of medieval times, where a brave knight will rise up and save the princess, either from evil tyrants, corrupt kings or beasts and the much darker figure that is behind the game's plot overall.Though this game is impeccable and fun with friends, this little gem doesn't seperate itself from its own fair share of problems. First of all, I find the controllability with the keyboard a little finicky and hard to manoeuvre when you're on the field, smashing vikings and gladiators alike. Understandably, the game does warn you right from the very beginning that a controller is highly recommended, but it doesn't distinguish the fact that a keyboard is optional and here's where I think a little more work should've been put in. Another problem I keep running into is the multiplayer connectivity. Me, neither of my mates who I've played Castle Crashers with had no internet connection problems at all, while the game seems to freeze, not respond and generally lags while in-game. To me, this game is one of the biggest icons, to serve off as inspiration to even those small Independent game developers who will hopefully get their projects recognized around. As well as a big Indie-icon, a definite recommendation from me as you will soon find out that many people have this in their own game library. I will conclude this review by saying that this game is just that damn good.			"

												Like my pre-teen kid when she's hopped up on Mountain Dew and Skittles, Castle Crashers is completely frenetic and has a penchant for toilet humor. And that's why we love it! The cartoonish graphics are great and there's little else more satisfying that to run around bludgeoning things indiscriminately . It's cheap, you'll have hours of fun. Why aren't you playing already?			"

												I'm going to look at Castle Crashers from two points of view: casual and hardcore. Now I'm fully aware that ""casual"" is a dirty word when it comes to videogames. Honestly, I think a game being casual is a good thing. If I'm playing a lot of hardcore games, the kind with a lot of depth, high punishments for failure, and an extreme level of difficulty; I'm going to want something to fall back on. In this regard, Castle Crashers fits the bill.However, a lot of games - sometimes the best ones - can appeal to both the casual and hardcore gamers. These titles offer a perfect learning curve and are enjoyable at any skill-level. There are multiple methods for playing through them. The challenge can range from easy to improbable. It all depends on how the player approaches these games. Though it tries, Castle Crashers can't bridge this gap. It's a fine game for a friendly get-together, or a time-sink on a slow day. If you're looking for a quality brawler, the kind you can keep coming back to again and again, then look elsewhere.I hate to say it, but this review isn't over yet.Looking further, Castle Crashers works as a casual game due to the constant thread of ""niceties"". These are moments that make you say ""Oh. That's nice."" when they happen. Leveling up, the discovery of a new weapon or animal, a dead enemy dropping a valuable crystal instead of a mere coin; these are all examples of niceties. The game is further bolstered by simplistic but charming hack & slash action. Through the combination of both elements, as well as flavor touches like the set-piece battles and action sequences, this game works. It just plain works.Even with this casual approach, you're still bound to run into problems. The balance between strength, magic, and agility is crap. Magic and agility require huge investments to attain any noticeable effect. Strength is an absolute necessity, unless you want to juggle foes for several minutes at a time. The ranged options are only forced onto the player by the rare appearance of giant enemies. You know who these jerks are, because you can't get close to them, without being grabbed and thrown.Also, while the niceties are appreciated, I believe that Behemoth could have done a little better. Character-unlocking is just plain awful after a certain point. Having to replay the entire game with character F to unlock character M is maddening. It's especially bad when A) all characters behave the same outside of spells B) every character starts at level 1 and C) there aren't any methods for passing experience onto new characters. Dynasty Warriors is a franchise with gobs of playable heroes, and usually there's some method for strengthening unused characters, so everyone remains at a level playing field. In Castle Crashers, this -admittedly not all that important - element was overlooked, and it's pretty annoying.The insane mode is ironically where hardcore gamers are liable to get the door slammed in their faces. This is also where the game almost completely falls apart. A high difficulty mode is fine, but it needs to make sense. Insane difficulty features faster and more aggressive enemies, so it's good on that front. Unfortunately, their HP and especially their strength have recieved a massive multiplier, and that's really bad. A number of enemies and bosses go from non-threatening to entirely absurd. For most players, insane mode ends with the large troll of the Thieves' Forest.This is my third play-through of the game, and I still don't understand why insane mode exists. In the original Xbox 360 version, insane mode was somewhat mitigable, due to a prevalent experience glitch (involving the troll boss). This is one of those rare glitches that actually made the game worse when it was fixed. Depending on how you look at it, abusing an XP glitch to make a game easier probably isn't very hardcore. As far as I'm concerned, insane mode is where the game actively cheats. Everyone has too much HP and does too much damage, but apparently it's unfair for players to have something to fall back on. Personally, I would have suggested difficulty modifiers (ala Bastion) instead of a difficulty mode, but this a 20/20 hindsight suggestion. I certainly didn't have the idea, when Castle Crashers was released, back in 2008. All told, this game is still pretty enjoyable and even better with friends. Just don't invest too much of your energy, because the pay-off isn't worth the effort.			"

												Castle Crashers has a lot of unique things to offer. A fun 4 player co-op game where you and your team (or even by yourself) go through many battles and boss fights leveling up your character to learn unique skills, combat skills etc. The game does not have the best graphics, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still a fun and of course an addicting game for you and your friends to play together. The game has a lot of enjoyment to it, the type of game where I would spend my time on for a while showing lots of love for.Basically, a couple of enemies have come to your castle and stole the princesses. You and your friends go on adventure progressing through many battles and boss fight trying to save the princesses by being ""Castle Crashers"" if you know what I mean. It starts off from easy battles to becoming more difficult but you'll be able to level up your character so he/she could become stronger and acquire unique combat skills and magical abilities. Shops will also be available for you around the map so you can buy healing potions, weapons, and even cute little pets on your journey.The maximum level you can reach each character is 99 as I believe. Once you reached level 99 or completed the whole story, don't think you're finished yet. There are lots more things you could do. While you are on your adventure, note that you could've missed a lot of ""secret"" items hidden around certain parts of the map whether it's weapons or pets. Battle arenas are also around the maps where you can test out your characters combat skills fighting certain multiples of the same type of enemy (Yes, there are different types of enemies). Now, if you're sure you're 100% completed the game, try maxing out another character to level 99, or even better, do it with a couple of friends. It's usually fun when you're playing with friends even if you've completed the game.You'll have the ability to unlock many different characters in the game with diverse abilities. While progressing through the story, you'll be unlocking new playable characters. Many characters can be unlocked through completing battle arenas, or completing a certain area on INSANE mode like the royal king of your castle. Insane mode is a special mode after you complete the story. It's much harder but you'll gain a good amount of EXP. If you're into some fun humorous RPG games, I'm 100% sure you'll like Castle Crashers. I've spent most of my hours on this game alone but still have fun playing it. Great content, great story, great features. Overall, it's just addicting as hell. "

												Of all the games I've ever played this would be my favorite. There are four basic knights you can play as when you begin the game. You can unlock more knights as you beat certain levels, or beat the game as certain characters. There are twenty nine characters you can unlock, and two DLC characters. As you defeat enemies you wil level up. Leveling up unlocks new combos, and rewards you with skill points that you can spend in Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility. Reaching levels 1 - 20 grants you two skill points, and level 21 - 78 give you one skill point. once you beat the game with any character, you will unlock insane mode, and you can play through the game again with tougher enemies, harder bosses, and some of the stores will have different items. The objective of the game is to rescue the four princesses from the Evil Wizard.11/10			"

												The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world - there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute.PRESENTATION:The story is straightforward and the game is easy to pick up and play.GRAPHICS:Everything is beautifully drawn and animated.SOUND:The digital, techno tunes are upbeat and perfect background music for raising hell.GAMEPLAY:Classic side-scrolling brawler gameplay mixed up with fun boosts and magic makes for a great time with friends. Slightly busted multiplayer is a downer though.LASTING APPEAL:The campaign is short, but there are multiple characters to unlock, lots of weapons and animals to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with.Two other negatives:The game is not worth the high price. Buy it on sale instead.It can be rather repetetive.6/10			"

There's plenty of other characters to unlock after you finish the game. The animations are as pretty as they can get and sometimes the game is just plain hilarious.

												I got this game on sale and boy was it worth it, I was obsessed over it for a few weeks.Let's start the review. Graphics	The game has animated graphics and that's probably one of the reasons why I love it.The art-style just seems really fitting.There is really nothing to talk about an animated game's graphics. Gameplay	An arcade styled 4-player side-scrolling beat'em up.Combat feels great and you can combo to your heart's content.Depending on your timing of certain hits you can make infinite combos.Using magic to combine with your melee attacks can do alot of damage so I usually do that.There are Animal Orbs that are hidden through out the game with each one having it's own unique perk that you gain by having that certain Animal Orb by your side.The same goes for weapons, there are alot of weapons hidden across the game.You can unlock probably every single enemy in the game as a playable character which is nice. DLC	The DLC characters, the Blacksmith and the Pink Knight are awesome, Blacksmith is my highest level.The DLCs are both cheap (I bought them along time ago but I think they were 99 cents) and the money goes to charity. Bonus character	You get to a new pet and a character by owning the game ''Battleblock Theater'' which is made by the developers of Castle Crashers.The character Hatty Hattington and the pet Golden whale.It's a nice gift just for owning an equally awesome game. The Plot	The plot is pretty simple,4 princesses get kidnapped and a magical crystal gets stolen from the king and 4 knights head out to rescue the princesses (1 if you don't have any friends) and retrieve the magic crystal. Pros.	+Really fluid gameplay+Big roster+Alot of replay value+Really fun with friends and even without friends.+Difficulty is just right - provides you with challange later on and goes easy on you in the beginning.+Alot of unlockables. Cons.	-Combat gets slightly repetitive. Final Verdict	   9.6/10	 "

												This game is what I would call a classic of the modern gaming era. It's not exactly new, but it still manages to keep a certain freshness to it, which is actually quite impressive. When I say ""classic"", I mean a game that is a sort of important pillar to gaming in general. Now, I wouldn't say that it changed the whole industry per say, but I still consider this one to be a game that is part of my childhood to an extend. Many can possibly relate to that thought, I'd wager.Now, what exactly is Castle Crashers? Well, to resume the whole experience in a single sentence, it's basically a ""smash right through the enemies, save the princesses and defeat the evil king"". Sounds simple, doesn't it? That's no surprise; because this game is simple. The true experience truly comes to life when you bring a friend or two along the ride. As most multiplayer games, having someone to play with you really is a must to enjoy the full adventure. Honestly, playing through this game alone is kind of boring, and considering that the designs of the levels highly support multiplayer, trying to go through the game alone can prove to be a chore. Then again, I did play and finish it alone the first time, but when I replayed it with a few folks, my overall opinion changed drastically.This game is huge. Don't let the tiny sixteen bucks tell you otherwise; it's probably one of the biggest adventures I've seen for a Smash 'em up. The adventure itself isn't much to speak about, my friends and I started from the beginning and finished after around four sessions of one hour each. What makes this thing so huge is the unlockable content. There are a ton of them, such as characters, pets, weapons, levels, and even a secret difficulty. You'll be grinding and repeating the same levels many times to find rare items and weapons if completion matters to you. I'd like to speak about the difficulty, since I feel like difficulty is something that matters for many players and buyers. The game in itself isn't harshly hard. Most bosses have simple patterns, the level designs can be either fair or sometimes overwhelming, and the overall product will not make you frustrated to the point of screaming. Of course, I won't say that it is an easy game either; sometimes it feels like the game throws so much at you, I find it almost unfair. Without spoiling too much, the final boss in particular has a lot of annoying patterns that can drag for a while, especially if alone. Upon finishing the game, you will have the option of changing to an even harder difficulty. I will warn you : It is cheap. Enemies are insanely powerful, and quite frankly, it's not fun. If that sounds appealing to you, then go ahead and try it. I, for one, will stay away and advices you to do so as well.The game has two primary mechanics : Physical attacks and Magical moves. Physical attacks are, as the name says, attacks with weapons. The damage that you will do to enemies is generated by how much points to give to your Physical stats. Magical moves are attacks composed of magic. Giving points to this stat will not only grow your magical abilities and make them more powerful, it will also make the range and overall usefulness much more adaptable. The best idea would be to try to make a balanced knight, since enemies later on will either be extremely resistant to Physical attacks or highly resistant to Magic. You always need to have an alternative, or else it becomes truly bothersome. I believe that I mentioned every aspects worth mentioning. This game is great, and while not a masterpiece by any means, it should prove itself quite worthy of your purchase. Do not forget to try and ask a few friends if they wish to play along!			"

												This game is super fun! ^_^ There aren't a lot of modern day side scrollers that make you feel like you get more game than you paid for! Many of them can actually be played out in one session. However, this is a game you'll definitely find yourself probably picking up for 3 sessions with a buddy, with characters that unlock for some level of replayability! The plot is funny and there's always some feeling of monotony throughout a beat em up adventure but the quirks of this game (for example the giant corn boss that drops popcorn as you hit it) keep them to a minimum!

												tl;dr? Aajwdlijf ajw dhrugdh 11/10!!'Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me.....'I was first introduced into the wacky world of Castle Crashers back in 2008 via the mini flash-game Castle Crashing ""The Beard."" Back then, Kongregate was the king and it quickly became my favourite platformer. Despite the simplicity of the artwork and game mechanics, the game had character and it was obvious that the developers weren't afraid to show off their work against the smorgasbord of stereotypically depicted knights, castles and overworked medieval warfare.Well a few months later, it was announced that Castle Crashing ""The Beard"" would fully mature into a proper side-scrolling beat-em-up platformer with an actual story (like fighting a giant beard would be believable lel)! While I was quickly swept away by the hype, I wasn't an Xbox owner and the prospects of getting one just for Castle Crashers weren't high. And so after beating the flash version a few times, I slowly let go of the unattainable and moved onto other things.4 years later, things had certainly changed; games were easily attainable now that I had become a successful Steam trader and suddenly out of the blue, Castle Crashers appeared on the Store page! So much time had passed that embarrassingly, the switch inside my head didn't immediately click... I saw the 4 knights and noticed the mellow colours but couldn't put my hand on why they were so familiar.. After a quick google search of ""Crashing beard game"" my mind became frantic, the impossible was finally possible, I HAD to play this game!!Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me. While the flash-version was extremely addictive, Castle Crashers is a refreshing rendition.Here are a few reasons for which Castle Crashers is a must-buy for people in the same position as I was: The simplicity of the fighting mechanics and overall movement has been entirely conserved. Artwork and soundtrack stays true to the original version :). Extensive storyline that will take you through an epic journey where you will meet the most creatively designed foes. Local and Online Multiplayer! Ability to play as other characters other than the 4 knights including...Pink Knight :D:D:D  (Yes, Pink knight from Crashing Beard is in this game with his lollipop sword!!!!!) Now unfortunately there are a few downsides: Latency issues and lag when playing with others across the world (Yes it's an old game, luckily its smoother with peers who live closer to you). Few features and special attacks are missing from the flash-version including Orange Knight's special pheonix attack.  Grinding: there will be unavoidable moments where you will need to grind certain stages of the game in which you will need to repeat certain levels to kill enemies due to the simplicity of the game's levelling system. For each character, you will need to spend a few hours on the same level to be able to play insane mode.Fortunately a few of these issues will be addressed in the Remastered edition to be released later this year (2015) including performance improvements - especially in online multiplayer. If you don't enjoy the grinding, just play with a friend, the social interaction will definitely put the boring aspects of the game to ease ;)Overall, I definitely do recommend Castle Crashers, if you loved the game on Kongregate or Newgrounds and don't trust the ""overwhelmingly positive"" review rating, let me assure you that it is undeniably worth it's weight in gold. Also the game does drop to $1.49 and usually below $5 during the Steam sales so there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't give it a try!			"

												Pros+Hillariously drawn character designs and animations.+Great music.+Tons of fun online with friends.+Fluid controls.+Amazing amount of weapon, pet, and character variety.+Lots of levels to play through with several unique bosses.+Tons of different enemy types.+You can kill your friends in order to get a Princess' kiss. Why wouldn't you want to?+Insanely challenging on the ""Insane"" difficulty that you unlock after beating the game with your character once.+Back Off Barbarian is a fun little time waster mini game.+Good beat em up combat with decent RPG mechanics.Cons-Some of the weapons and characters are so overpowered that they make everything a joke or so weak that it makes the game almost impossible to beat.Overall Castle Crashers is a very fun beat em up that I highly recommend to everybody who enjoys the genre.

												Do you like arcade games? Maybe you wanted to try some but you've never had a chance or you don't want to waste time with emulators? If YES is an answer to any of these you should totally check Castle Crashers! Humoristic, pretty and friendly arcade game here on steam. Perfect for playing with a group of friends or your siblings.What's so cool about Castle Crashers?• Nice cartoon graphics.• Even decent plot.• Lots of funny moments.• Tons of characters to unlock, each one with thier own ""magic"".• Lotsa swords and weapons.• Pet companions.• Interesting sceneries.• With a friend to join your game, the fun is doubled.There are few disadvantages tho;• 12€ is not so cheap as for indie arcade game. • Playing alone is not as fun as with friends.• You will need a controller if you want to play on one PC.Other than that Castle Crashers is one ♥♥♥♥ good arcade game worth your time if you like the genre.I honestly recommend it.                                - D.Punk "

 Castle Crashers is some “Old School Arcade Fun”.I was on the fence about this one because of the art style, and it looked like a kids game. I ended up picking it up on a Steam sale for my son, who wanted it. To my surprise this game is a blast. You pick one of four knights each with a special ability. Fire, Poison, Electricity, Ice, you get the idea. The powers give you a special attack that does significant damage, as well as decides the color of your knight. The game supports full controller, local co-op, online co-op, and local plus online co-op. This is the way it should be. Local co-op, and split screen belong on PC! The game features three modes, campaign, versus, and a jumping mini game (not my cup of tea, but some may like jumping). The campaign mode is where it's at. You, and up to three friends button mash your way to victory against the evil horde to save the princesses. The combat gives you some options aside from hack n slash, like your special power, bow, bomb, and a few simple combos. The music is great, they did a nice job on the tracks for this game. The monster design is comical, and slicing the heads off little minions is fun.  The game will run on almost any PC (Not your Commodore 64, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you've been passing on this one, give it a try at the next sale. OLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED  Visit our Currator Page "

												This is a highly fun side scrolling beat 'em up with great controls. To start with the story is that your princesses have been captured, you and up to 3 friends set out to save them. This of course means co-op mayhem fun with up to 4 players at once. The controls are simple.... quick attack, heavy attack, jump, item, magic, block and item swapping. The combat is simple, fun and the enemy AI makes it more than a button masher. They will flank you and or shoot arrows when they can. It makes for some quick thinking. The art style is amazing and charming. Everything looks fantastic. The humor is charming and surprising at times. There are light RPG elements in the game that level up your character and you can assign skill points to them. Oh and ontop of that there is a world map to quickly find previous level. All of this is combine with a great soundtrack of good video game music you'll enjoy. This is worth your money and I often don't say that about games.			"

												Imma tell a story. So my cousin, brother and I we're goofing around on the Xbox then my cousin said while browsing the xbox store said this game looks cool lets try it! We bought it downloaded it and launched it. I was the Blue Knight my brother was the orange, and my cousin was the red. we got to lava world then me and my brother had to go. My brother and I pleaded our father to buy it too. We ended up convincing him, so we all three of us played it til wedding crash then my bro had to go. and me and my father got to Full Moon, then I had to go to my mom's. the next weekend I went to my dad's I convinced my little sister (5 at the time) To play castle crashers. And since then me and her played it soooooo much. then came when my brother got back into it, me and him were fire and ice like before, but im lvl 58 and hes lvl 61 we  both played to the final boss, turned out we were overleveled and it was too easy so we went to insane mode to die to the barbarian boss multiple times. He gave up on it, so I continued to play it alot with my sister. she now has lvl 70 posion knight and rn on the xbox cc im 98 ice knight. 3 Years later I got steam, and played it alot. And when I figured out Castle Crashers was on steam I freaked out. I've played it alot ever since, and still play it. This is my favorite childhood game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 I need friends to play this with that have skype please. XD :3			"

Brought to you by The Behemoth crew, Castle Crashers is a four-player hack ‘n’ slash three-dimensional side-scrolling title that rivals and is reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara…well, if it held a different tone. Castle Crashers retains a resonance with the cast of the game, featuring the likes of Dan Paladin, Will Stamper, and several others, and mashes comedy into the classic ‘your princess is in another castle’ story arch. This title features four base knights-green, blue, red, and orange-with varying powers, and adds Hatty Hattington to the roster if you own BattleBlock Theater for Steam; there are also twenty other unlockable characters as well as two purchasable knights, but I will speak further on the said two in a later section. Here are a few things that I find interesting about Castle Crashers:Leveling System - Players have to put in some work to level up, as experience is granted based more-so on enemies routed and hits connected than overall damage done. What I love about this take on level-ups is that it blends well with the player-versus-player elements, and allows the more tenacious ‘crashers’ to gain levels more frequently than those attempting to preserve health; the player-versus-player aspect will be explained in further detail next. As an individual knight gains a level, he has the opportunity to allot a gen number of points into four different traits: Strength, to determine the power of the knight’s attacks; Magic, which improves the knight’s magic attack maneuvers, spell effectiveness, and how much energy a spell utilizes on cast based on the total amount of energy; Defense, which dictates the knight’s health point total; and Speed, which determines how much damage the Bow item deals with each strike and, obviously enough, the individual knight’s movement. Combined with varying statistic-altering weapons, items, and pets, this leveling system permits players to create their own form of strategy.Forced Player-Versus-Player - Castle Crashers is a cooperative experience, so what could it possibly mean to ‘force’ players to combat against each other? At the end of each stage resulting in the liberation of a princess, only one knight may earn the kiss of valiance from the fair maiden. To effectively decide who is chosen, the players duke it out with all of their acquired abilities and equipment. Unlike most things in this title, a princess’ kiss does not grant any boons, bonuses, or additional equipment; however, it is very satisfying viewing the ‘saltiness’ on friends’ faces when you have stolen the embrace from their colored princess.Minigames - With various landscapes and degrees of difficulty between the stages, the campaign offers an abundance of cooperative play. But minigames are available to sweeten the deal. I must admit that I have not played too many of them, but the few that I have experienced-like beach volleyball-were so much fun to play with friends and online, win or lose.Humor - Simply put, from its theme to its plot twists and cutscenes, Castle Crashers is a title that will provoke, at the very least, a snicker. I feel as though I should refrain from revealing too much from this engaging title’s comedy approach as it is very well written. It can also be humorous when played with friends even at points when it is not necessarily meant to be; this is enhanced through splitscreen play.TL:DR - Castle Crashers is highly enjoyable, especially for fanatics of hack ‘n’ slash and cooperative titles, character leveling and building, and of The Behemoth’s previous title, BattleBlock Theater; speaking of, I also recommend-if you do not already own both games-the purchase of the bundle featuring Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater. I would also recommend the purchase of the Pink Knight and the Blacksmith downloadable content since proceeds are given to various charities. Whether solo or in cooperative play, with BattleBlock Theater and the downloadable content or not, Castle Crashers is a laughably good time. I had wanted to mention other notable features in this title such as its outstanding level design and themes, gameplay, and specific items but I feel as though I would be continuing on for days if I started. On a side note, I would like to mention that I will gladly play with anyone that owns this title or others. Simply add me on Steam and post the reason why you plan to add me on my profile. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	. "

If your a 100% completionist like me, then your going to have an awful time, mainly because of the 84 weapons available, and the 32 characters who you have to beat the game twice with  each one if you truly want to comeplete the game.  Overall though if your looking for a casual play through or a hardcore experience, both types of people will enjoy this game.			"

												This is a great game to pick up and play with friends.  The wide selection of chracters that you can choose with their certain kinds of magic and you can build them all different ways is a nice breath of fresh air, but the game has two serious flaws off the top of my head that I should point out that people should be aware of if they're going to buy this.1.  Online multiplayer always seems to have some sort of lag; it can be varying from slight hiccups to completely unbearable.  Just keep that in mind when playing with friends.2.  At the beginning when loading up Castle Crashers it says that a ""controller is recommended.""  I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!  The keyboard controls for this game are horrible and I've re-mapped them several times and it just doesn't feel as good as when you play with a controller.  Please make sure to have some sort of gamepad before you buy this game unless you can deal with re-mapping buttons to subpar locations.All-in-all though such a great game.  I put lots of hours in it and had lots of fun playing it.  I definitely recommend it and if you haven't played Castle Crashers before and you're kinda iffy on if you'll like it just search it on youtube, look at other owner's reviews and you'll see it's a pretty good pick.

-Quick Review-Castle Crashers is a side scrolling Beat 'em up developed by The Behemoth (A developer I'm falling deeper in love with) and released in 2012. -Detailed breakdown review-Story: Castle Crashers takes place in a cartoon Middle Ages universe. The knights are sitting around a table eating a feast, but suddenly an evil wizard steals a large gem, and runs off with four princesses! Being a knight, it is your noble duty to save the princesses, the kingdom, and retrieve the stolen gem.Queue Adventure!

Gameplay: The Castle Crashers recommends you use a controller, when you first launch the game. Anyone who knows me; knows I'm stubborn and refuse to purchase a controller for my computer. So... regarding the controller suggestion: Yes, it would be much easier on your progressing-carpal-tunnel. But, the game is completely doable with just a keyboard. (It's worth noting that the game key prompts on the menu and in game are actually for a controller; but again, you just get used to it)

The controls are pretty basic you have three types of attacks: light attack, heavy attack, and throw item. (you can unlock and use different combos between jumping, quick attacks, and heavy attacks) You also have a block button that slows you down, but if you time it correctly, it can literally save your character's life.As you progress through the game your character will gain experience points, money, animal orbs, and new weapons that you can purchase or will randomly drop off enemies. Your unlockables are accessible at the Blacksmith, and there are plenty of things to collect to keep you busy.Achievements: There are 12 achievements in Castle Crashers, this is one of those games that is relatively easier to get 100%. However, four of these achievements require playing with at least one other player. One achievement requires being in a four player game.There are only two achievements worth warning/note: Arena Master (Win 40 Arena Online Matches) and Glork (Win 20 All you can Quaff Online Matches). I won't lie, to earn these achievements, I ran between two computers. My brother was nice enough to be a punching bag, when he was away at work or school.Alternative strategy: Hit the fourms and see if anyone wants to trade off, you could do something else while you get beat up... …..likeeee Battle block Theater! link at bottom. :PPrice: Castle Crashers is priced at $14.99, for the amount of time you'll spend playing this game on your own, and with friends, that's a fair price. However if you're the first of your friends to play this game (unlikely... but who knows, maybe it's possible?) you should grab the 4-pack so you can play with 3 other friends. (Trust me, the game is even more fun with a friend)Conclusion: Story: Pretty stereo typical story line, but it's delivered hilariously and without any voiced/text narrative (bonus points) and with plenty of humor. Gameplay: Suggested controller, but doable with a keyboard alone, I won't pay for carpal tunnel treatment. Shush! Achievements: Fairly obtainable 100% without too much of a time commitment, but you will need another friend or three. Price: Fair, better with a sale, or buying a bundle deal on sale.All in all, this game appeals to anyone who might have enjoyed playing an arcade styled game, indie platformers, 2D, indie graphics, 4 player games, or just wants to support The Behemoth.


Same level, Same Sword, Yeah we're cool. :P (old screenshot taken in 2014)

												Yes, just yes.PROS:- Play with up to four people!- Crisp graphics- Multiple hours of gameplayCONS:- Same plot- Get this game on sale..If new adventures were added to this game + harder places to beat, this game would improve and gain more people buying it. Overall, this game is really fun and worth $15.00. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have an extra game to play and only plays about two or three games. This game has nice challanges and achievements that you can unlock and it's great for parties.I rate Castle Crashers: 4.7/5 "

												Castle Crashers looks like a standard beat-em-up game on the surface, but it's definitely more fun the average game of its type. original cartoony beat 'em up with a just dose of self-aware toilet humor.In Castle Crashers you and your friends play as one of four knights who set off an epic journey to find the princesses that have been kidnapped. Why they were kidnapped beats me, so there are a couple of plot holes. Should you care? Not really, because this game doesn't really focus on the plot in the first place.Each of these four knights have their own special ability that can be executed on the battlefield. You take your weapon, your shield, and your power, and you hack and slash through swarms of enemies and the occasional boss fight. Yes it has the potential to get boring, but I haven't reached that point yet.Throughout the game, you can discover and pick up new weapons and little pets to follow you around, all to be saved in a little shed that you can go back to to change up your stats. So it's your decision whether you want to destroy enemies with an epic vorpal sword or a slab of meat, and whether you want a tiny floating ram following you around or a tiny floating cat.Each time you play through this game with a different knight, you unlock another character to rip through enemies with, which does add to the motivation of playing.This game is very quirky. There will be moments in the background that make you look at it and say ""Did that just happen?"" in the ridiculous sense. These moments will even happen in the up close foreground. There are many moments that made me chuckle which made this game all the more appealing.The soundtrack is pretty badassIf you're looking for a coop game, local or online, definitely consider Castle Crashers. It was an enjoyable experience, but it's certainly one that requires you to play with others to be fully satisfied.100/10 MASTERPIECE!			"

												Pros:- You will get a laugh while playing the game, trust me- Wanna be a knight, a wizard or a hunter? It's your own choice- Don't like this weapon and that weapon? No worries, plenty of them to choose- 10 hrs playthrough (for 1 character); good playtime design for an indie casual adventure RPG- Many characters you can choose to play- 4 players in co-op- Both local and online- Make fun of me 'til very end of the game (=w=)""Cons:- You cannot play alone to get some achievements- Collecting every single weapon and pet is quite tired, you need ton of coins to buy them- Cannot play different characters on the same playthrough			"

												Castle Crashers is a coop, 2D/side scrolling hack n' slash game. Lots of levels, cool weapons and ADORABLE AS ♥♥♥♥ PETS. 4 starter characters that you can level up and build their stats the way you like. There's plenty of other characters to unlock after you finish the game. The animations are as pretty as they can get and sometimes the game is just plain hilarious. The game puts up a good challenge even in coop, you'll find yourself having to grind a bit after encountering some of the game's bosses/difficult levels.i recommend using a gamepad.Plus, any DLC you buy for Castle Crashers (2 available at the time) helps charity, how many developers do that, right? :)			"

												I was gifted this game by my boyfriend and so far it's been pretty entertaining. I didn't like the medusa boss, she moved very awkwardly and it was just kind of an annoying one to beat. Also, the pillars in the Sand biome, when you're going through the castle get in your way during battle. That was the most annoying part considering my boyfriend had to revive me without seeing the meter and i couldn't see my enemies majority of the time.I really like the wide range of weapons/pets & am hoping for armour to be added later.If you wanna get money really quickly I suggest beating the barbarian boss over and over (you get a load of gems and coins) or if you want exp one hit kills are pretty sweet if you wanna do it quickly (like the scorpions and in the sand biome, the barbarians before the boss and the alien minions on the space craft).Overall the game is about an 8/10 just because of those couple of annoying features and the fact that I've had to grind like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥ for hours to get high enough levels to progress.I'm not yet done but am really enjoying it so far.

												Sigh. Where do I start?Castle crashers is a jule for me, same with a lot of people. It dose have a repetive game though. Yet, Theres something just about the beat 'em up games that I loved, and I feel like this game puts it out there the most. With the wide choice of characters, there is almost no limit. Anyone with a love for the cartonny, yet dark humor, would adore this game. Words can not express how much time i've put into this game on the X-Box 360, and the soundtrack is Beautiful. Pros:Great community.Wide range of characters.Co-op.Soundtrack.Cons:Repetiteve.Lots of grinding in the works.Insane mode is almost impossible.I really do suggest this game, its also cheap. And screw Ice King. Wow is he annoying.			"

												Pretty great side-scrolling beat em' up. With an intriguing art style by Dan Paladin, and tight controls, Castle Crashers is a great experience, multiplayer or single player. What really makes the game special though is the multiplayer. If you do choose to buy it for single player, there still is a buttload of content, but it is endlessly entertaining to work together with friends to steam roll enemies. If this is your first time looking into this genre, you won't be upset. If you are a fan of side scrollers, or beat em' ups, I would definitely pick up this game.			"

												ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! This is one of the best games I have played in my life! Very fun with its 4-player co-op, amazing replayability, all around great time! If you are reading this, pick this and BattleBlock Theater up ASAP, as these are amazing!GAMEPLAY-The combos feel very smooth and easy to master, and I feel I get them at a good pace. Spine-crushingly difficult, but also fun- I do have the complaint that there are a lack of mid-level checkpoints. Bosses are intuitive and fun to fight.PRESENTATION-The art style, in Behemoth fashion, is cute and funny, as are the actual in game events. Special credits to the Thieve's Forest Level in humor!VALUE- I got this for 80% off during the sale, but even for 15 dollars this is good- you will spend 10+ hours for your first playthrough and 100+ as you replay with other characters. HUGE VALUE!POSTGAME-After you beat the game once, insane mode becomes available to play- 100% completion is obtained by beating the game  in insane mode with all characters. 62 playthroughs. SO MUCH TO DO!!In summary this is a great game- So much playtime, all of which is fun and enjoyable!			"

Introduction:Castle Crashers is a 2D hack and slash adventure game set in a cartoonish medieval world of knights, princesses and dragons  pooping animals. Your only goal is to rescue the four distressed princesses from formidable foes and earn their kisses as a reward. This game is best played with two to three other friends, a controller, and a box of pizza to share.Pros:-Over 30 unique characters and dozens of weapons to unlock and choose from.-Cheap DLC characters with proceeds going to charity.-Can be played on keyboard or a controller.-Wonderful cartoonish graphics and easy-to-learn gameplay.-Constant action and a simple levelling system.-Crude humour with poop jokes.Cons:-Game can get boring and repetitive after completion with multiple characters.-Lacks a high number of achievements for achievement-loving gamers.Overall:Castle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends and is a must-buy when on sale. It is simple and provides constant action throughout the story. Beating the game with certain characters unlocks other unique characters that all have their own pros and cons. With so many weapons, pets and characters to choose from, Castle Clashers is surely an enjoyable classic. My rating would be an 8/10.			"

												This game asks the dangerous question on everyone's mind:  What if Golden Axe had been written around poop jokes?It's a solid cooperative game in the vein of old arcade beat 'em ups with a cartoon feel and more than enough crude humour to go around.  Pick it up with BattleBlock Theatre in the bundle sometime!(Make sure the person with the best connection hosts, though; connectivity pauses the game frequently in multiplayer if you have someone with a spotty signal, but it will nearly always recover in a couple seconds rather than drop the connection.)

												Very enjoyable game. Completed this game multiple times on xbox only to play the game all over again on Steam. If you like unlocking badass characters, super cool weapons and different companions to help you along the way. Straight up buy this.			"

												This is one of the best co-op games you will ever play. The RPG elements are subtle, but very nice and combined with the leveling progression system provides a nice sense of progression. The art style is something to appreciate with its cartoonie elements. The game is a good length for an indie game not too long, but not too short. The bosses are challenging yet fun. Their is a comedy that is wrapped into the game that makes ot even better as you go through the story. The co-op is a amazing it was built just for co-op. I highly recommend this game it is the best indie game I have ever played.			"

												I absolutly LOVE Castle Crashers, been playing it since it came out on the Xbox 360 a good few years ago, recently purchased on steam and still holds up as one of the most entertaining games EVER!!!!.A great thing about it is my 5 year old Daughter can easily pick up the controller and play it, and boy does she love playing it, you should hear her shouting with laughter,if you are looking at it and thinking is it worth it? HELL YES, this is a game I give my ever refered 10/10, anyone who knows my reviews knows that I never give 10/10, the comical stylings of newgrounds is phenomenal.Do not delay any longer, get this game now, you will not be disapointed.

												Great Game! Easy to learn, and easy to get motivated. I like how you can easily decide that one level is too much to do solo, and just do it with another online player! One thing I don't prefer though, is (lag, of course) that you cant invite someone into your game if the match is already up and running. You have to gather everyone up while still in the lobby.			"

												The game itself is fantastic! The humor, game play and the low price make it worth every penny. Unfortunately, the developers were a bit lazy making the port - When playing on a keyboard you will have no idea what you are doing. The game doesn't tell you how to play and the tutorials show the Xbone(xbox) controls, not the keys.Overall though, the game is damn near perfect. If you don't own a controller but don't mind 30 minutes of fiddling and clicking, the game is perfect for you. If you own a controller and can connect it to your PC...BUY THIS GAME NOW.One of the best indie games ever made hands down. It has it all. Fun medieval sword fighting against evil knights, monsters and strange creatures. Good graphics and addicting levels. Castle Crashers is best enjoyed through multiplayer. The game lets you enable voice chat for a more fun experience. I seriously think it's a powerful and engaging fighting experience, even if it is  cartoony.Plenty of replay-ability in this title also, with arenas and arcade modes available. 10/10 for me.			"

												Castle Crashers. It's one of those games that is best enjoyed together with friends but also very do-able on solo. In my case i can't say how much fun i had with this game whilst playing together with a friend on his playstation. The story is pretty easy to understand, the castle you live in is under attack by barbarians and the king has something stolen from him so it is up to the player(s) to get it back for his majesty. It's an arcade style adventure game where you will fight enemies along the way and every once in a while you can expect to be treated to a bossfight so be sure to gear up. Castlecrashers also has an awesome ingame soundtrack made by various users over at Newgrounds which set a proper athmosphere and to be honest can be very catchy.When it comes to leveling and items the game also comes with a level system (1 > 99) and during your playthrough you will find different weapons and items that will fit your playstyle and will unlock different skins with each their unique attacks and magic. There are also pets you can find in the world to aid you along your travels.Castle crashers is definitly recommendable. It comes with a normal mode and a very challenging hardcore mode so ye be warned.All the best!(s.i.e)			"

												Castle Crashers is a game that you have to be willing to put a few hours into. A MMO for gamers and professionals alike, you can pick 4 starting characters; Red Knight, with the power of lightning, Green Knight, with the power of poison, Blue Knight, with the power of ice, and my favorite, last but not least, Orange Knight, with the power of fire. As you beat the game with different characters you unlock more characters to play as, including Gray Knight, King, the Necromancer, and many many more.			"

												Played this game thoroughly on Xbox a few years ago, and it's still just as good as  a PC port years later. Any character can fufill the warrior, mage, and rogue archetypes, or you can go as a Jack-of-All-Trades master of all four character skills: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. Not to mention, there's a huge selection of 80+ weapons and 20+ ""animal orbs"" (pet followers) with special attribute bonuses that make archetypes even stronger.There are a few levels, such as Lava World and Full Moon (at least for me) that can come as a pretty big challenge if you're not prepared, meaning a bit of grinding might be in store if you don't have friends to back you up. However, even the grinding isn't as tedious as other games, as you can potentially revisit past areas and pick up weapons and animal orbs you might have missed.The game is even more fun with a friend or two, cos why beat up a horde of enemies on your own when you can juggle them back and forth with a pal? However, the game lacks the same ""more loot per additional player"" mechanic that Borderlands 2 has, meaning that weapon, animal orb, and boss chest loot is often unfairly divided. However, the loot is not a large problem, since as long as you have a good sword that matches the build you're going for and enough money to buy some potions, you should be able to survive and thrive.The game is good for quick, casual fun with friends, and can also satisfy more gameplay-hungry players with it's ""Insane Mode"", which rescales the entire world so characters that have beaten the game can replay from the start (retaining any levels, skill points, weapons, and animal orbs you collected so far) with enemies that remain challenging.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's suitable for all types of players, whether you play for 1 hour or 100 hours. Everything in the game feels good, from leveling up and developing your character's skills, to watching your collection of weapons and animal orbs grow with every cleared area, to finally beating that one boss that looked so threatening at first. Buy it, it's well worth the money.((also, if you do buy the game, get the two DLCs too. it's cheap, has good content, and 100% of the proceeds goes to non-profit good-will organizations))			"

It's a great game especially with friends. You can have up to 4 players and 2 is the least that is for multiplayer. If your doing your own game then you're on your own. I would do it with friends just because by yourself its really hard especially halfway through. The All you can Quaff game i think its called is so much fun. The arena fights is fun except for the thieves one just because they just keep on firing arrows when you're on the ground. But still a fun, hilarious game. Their was also the combat style: HACK AND SLASH! Just like the Devil May Cry series. And also the DLC. What can i say about it. You have 2 other players and 10 new weapons (5 for each). One of my favourite weapons for Pink knight is the lollipop. The blacksmith has also got great weapons. I would buy it if I were you because very addictive 10/10 for me			"

												Castle Crashers is a 2d sidescrolling beat em up, sounds generic, right?No. Castle Crashers is much more, it has a total of 82 weapons (unknown), and 31 total playable characters, but even if you've beaten the game, it doesn't get old to see you beat those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies up.Finished normal game? you still have Insane mode. If you've done that, well, why not aim for all of the weapons, characters, hell, if you're a completionist, get all 31 gold skulls. I've seen people with 100+ hours, and they don't seem to be bored.However, I have a few cons.The multiplayer is dead, barely anyone.I understand the controls are meant for xbox, but if you're using keyboard, it should show you what to press, instead of showing XBOX buttons.Minus these two cons, this game is an 8.6/10 for me.

Yes, even better than the Ninja Turtles one for SNES.To start off, I hate Beat 'em ups, because of their simplicity and repetitivness. This game is neither of these things. It has great level design, Upgradable characters and an RPG-like leveling mechanic.The story is as simple as indie games get, where you go around saving princesess and fighting bosses.Oh, the boss fights. They're loads of fun and are very varied, and aren't too much of a challenge.The multiplayer is fun and unlike most multiplayer games(New Super Mario Bros Wii), it's better to cooperate than to screw each other over.Although controllers are reccomended, they're not neccesary at all, and the PC controls are (by default) comfortable and easy to get used to.The game doesn't get boring after a LONG while, with most of your efforts post-story going into Maxing out your character stats(and having fun doing it).The DLC is only $1 a piece, with them adding new characters, weapons and animal orbs.There's no reason to not own this game if you're a fan of beat 'em ups, and wth the new refund system, trying out this game has never been more worth it.

												It's good, but it gets boring after....I'd say you beat the game once or twice, if you don't have anyone to play with. If you don't have anyone to play with at all, you're going to have a...somewhat boring time. The story is good, and can be completed anywhere from 3-13 hours for skilled players. The art style is unique and special, and the story is somewhat short. I definetly expected a lot more in the game and such, but unlocking characters and trying to beat the game with friends will keep you occupied for hours and hours to come. The more players, the better. Single player isn't really anything too good. You should buy it asap if you have other friends who play it, if you don't have any, then I suggest you wait for some friends to get it or buy the 4 pack and give it to friends.			"

												Castle Crashers is a fantastic game. Nothing beats side scrolling hack-and-slash fun. There dozens of characters, tons of weapons find, and pets to collect. Fight many bosses and level up to a maximum of 99 while inceasing your 4 skills, strength, magic, defence, and agility. This game offers a great challenge with insane mode which is unlocked after beating the normal mode. I have put many hours of my life into this game due its 4-player capability and variety. This game has been one of those I could always come back to every once and awhile and that's why I've been playing it since it was first released on the Xbox 360.10/10			"

												A great multiplayer beat-em-up, very hilarious and lots of depth in the game. Although the plotline is rather short, the large amount of characters more than makes up for that.

												Castle Crashers is a hard hitting story about an old man getting his potatoe stolen. The game really starts to grab you in by the cajones when you unlockl the Pink Knight in the DLC. Once you get the Pink Knight the plot thickens, enemies get tougher, and princesses get uglier. I like the part where you tell someone to go away from where you are digging, you dig up the giraffe, and then he takes it. The excuse was ""I didn't know a giraffe was going to pop out of the ground"" as he was told to get away. But the moral of the story is, no matter how far or how long you travel, never trust a purple haired, downfaced, orange dress wearing princess.2.5/10 would crash again.			"

												TL;DR: A wonderfully silly and fun game, that is also challenging and rewarding. It's great by yourself and much, much better with friends. Would definitely recommend.Castle Crashers is a comedic beat 'em up game that incorporates silly content and solid gameplay to create a fun, classic, and heavily group-centred game. You traverse the land, beating the ever-living crap out of every enemy in your way. All the while, you're able to take in the hilarious atmosphere around you and excercise your level of completionism by hoarding money from your friends and grabbing as many pets and swords as possible. There will seriously be moments where you'll be taken back for a second to laugh and say ""I can't believe that just happened!"" In addition to the button-mashing combat that is fun and challenging, you can enchance gameplay with unique magic powers that every character has. Playing single-player is great, but the real fun comes from multiplayer. You fight each other indirectly for items and money, while at the same time really being on the same team when it comes to battling enemies. The game even has segments where you actually do fight each other, in arenas and when jockeying for a princess's kiss, which keeps playful competitions between you and your friends. At the end of it all, you truly feel accomplished and satisfied by working as a team.I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a game with their friends, the whole experience is wonderfully fun. Any negative points are honestly mitigatable, such as there being sub-par support for keyboard users which can be circumvented by using a controller or simply not caring. All in all, this is truly a wonderful game. Play it, and play it with friends.			"

That, in and of itself should speak volumes.Amazingly catchy soundtrack is coupled with vibrant graphics, crude humor, and a host of enemies, weapons, items and orb pets to keep you wanting to come back for more. Mix in over a dozen unlockable characters and you'll be playing this game for hours to come. Comes with both couch and online co-op (both of which can be intermingled) to allow you to enjoy this experience with many friends.Honestly, I cannot suggest this game enough.

												Feels like an Xbox port.The game it self is very good and is really fun, you can run it on a toaster and it will still look amazing, although I've found the controls extremely difficult however my friends with a wired Xbox controller find the game fine; if you want the best experiance get a controller!

What's not to love?Positive:- Old school 2D beat-'em-up- Smooth, responsive controls- Great quirky humour - Very fair (you will often realize that getting hit or dying is your fault)- Plenty of collectables and characters to play- So much replay valueNegative:- Kind of short story modeConclusion:If you love 2D beat-'em-ups you will love Castle Crashers. I remembered when a much shorter and simpler version was released as a flash game years ago and I already loved it back then. I'm glad to see they actually made a full game around the same concept. There are so many things to do in this game if you are a completionist and it still continues to be fun. This is always the game I go to when I have friends over who do not necessarily play games. It's simple and entertaining enough for them to play and I do not feel frustrated if they struggle.A definite must-buy "

												I don't know what I enjoy more, the actual game or beating up bad guys as Hatty.  Or eating sandwiches as Hatty.  Or saving princesses as Hatty.Quick warning: They recommend a controller.  Playable with keyboard, but it takes a bit of getting used to.Second quick warning: This game made me crave PB&J sandwiches.  I did not get super buff after eating, though.((If you don't already have it, get Battleblock Theater, too.  So you too can break stuff as Hatty.))			"

												Ow , this game is awesome.... When i saw the summer sales and Castle Crashers was only 3 euros  , i was like "" I need this game "" I mean who doesn't like to smash things in games like this and try to unlock new things like weapons , characters , pets etc. The graphics aren't realistics but still...       There are only 2 dlcs but the dlcs are awesome , you have new weapons , 2 new characters ( pink and purple ) with great skills . Purple ( blacksmith ) for example , his first skill is to summon a toad that deals some pretty damage and knock up and then you have these cool hammers spinning in the air throwing them at the enemies , and he's overpowered too.       If u like hack'n'slash games you will fall in love with this game . There are like 32 characters ( I'm not sure ) and a lot of bosses , you have arenas and if you complete one you will get a new characters :D , this game is epic and the first time you see the game you don't thing it's so good , but when you play it with your friends this game is very very fun.       Oh , and a thing , every character comes with his unic skills and a weapon ( more weapons in blacksmith's and purple's case )			"

												Absolutely amazing game. It has great gameplay with some amount of crude humor causing a overall more casual atmosphere, perfect for a couch co-op session. Some have called the combat repetitive and stale, but in my opinion, with great co-op games becoming rarer and rarer to find, sometimes a simple hack n' slash with some friends is really all you need. The game can get tedious in a journey to grind to 99 and obtaining all collectables, but coming back to the game every once in a while allows the enjoyment of this magnificent title to be stretched out as long as possible.

												Around 2 months or so I have been enjoying this game a lot. I did a run as the green knight and currently working on insane mode. I simply love this game for it's creativity on what appears to be a cliche ""rescue the princess"" game. The artist for the game just made this game very enjoyable, especially when you first start playing it. The flaw I have with this game is that it gets a bit repetitive. The combat system is nice and simple, heavy attacks and light attacks. Not to mention each knight has it's own magic. You gain combos for mele attacks and new magic attacks as you level up. Another thing I would like to mention is the Animal orbs, a.k.a pets. Each pet has its own special thing, it could be a stats boost, it could have a progectile attack. Who knows!?. Overall this game is amazing in my opinion.                                                  9/10			"

												Castle Crashers is one of my favorite games for when you have guests over, it is up there with smash brothers. The perfect balance of ""my first rpg"" with "" beat em up"" makes for an addictive experience. I saw it was on steam and had to get it. I did have one concern going in to the steam version, how would the couch co-op be done on the PC version? Some of you are probably laughing that I had this concern( or at my awful spelling due to my dyslexic writing habits) but keep in mind that there was a dark time before steam when PC games blew chunks, look at any PC game from 2007 to 2011. Just like how steam fixed the PC gaming market, newer games on steam are easier to use. Castle crashers supports up to four players at any time like it's console counter parts. Just for the love of gawd don't use the key bored, that is the only negative I can say about this version is that if you like games to support mouse and key bored, stay away from this game. The amazing game play, awesome visuals and stellar co-op makes this game a must own, but i will say since the price of the game is the same as the PS3 version, that is the better port. The steam version does hold up well and is a good addition to anyone's steam library. 9/10			"

												It is a game about a bunch of dudes beating the life out of other dudes with some cheering princesses watching in the background for some reason.  This game blends together a mediocre combat system with an overuse of poop jokes and leaves the player feeling like the game was written by a bunch of kids in Middle School.  However flawed the game my be, it allows for a group of friends to play it with nearly no understanding of whats going on other than dudes need to be hit with stuff so you can save the day or something.  This once unique blend of indie magic leaves the player feeling like the game could have been a lot better if some obvious changes had been made as to how character progression worked, and reminds us why the Xbox is a failure as a platform for indie games that get ported to PC.  All in all the game did not disappoint too greatly and thus it earned a hearty 3/Not Borderlands 2.			"

												Cute, adorable, fun.Too difficult for singleplayer though. your best bet is to play with 4 players.However, with that being said, the difficulty stays the same, no matter the number of players.This makes it very hard for singleplayer, and too easy for 4 players.They should therefore adjust the difficulty.This game is mainly okay, but there are some small tweaks it needs.

												A classic game that really does require a controller/pad. Get together with 3 friend or power through by yourself. This game is cute, challenging and 100% funny! An absolute must have if I do say so. If you have played previous games from the makers of this game (For example; Alien Homind) you will see that they do carry on their previous ideas and even add to the game with them. You start off with 4 knights, but you unlock many more as you carry on. Each have their own spells and each level seperately and go through the story seperately. Graphics are cartoony, but they suit the game perfectly. Even if this game is old, it's still one you will continue to play and I don't ever seeing this being one of those ""Games of the past"" because when you do think back to it you'll end up saying ""Let's just go on it for old time's sake!""Although I do recommend getting it on sale, I wouldn't have too much of an issue if I paid £9.99 for it. I got it for 90 pence during one sale and don't know how I got by without it! One thing that is worth mentioning, when you unlock new weapons and pets (There are pets with indivual buffs/talents), they unlock for all characters! So there is no real repetitive grind with this game. Truly a game you can always go back to.Should you get bored too, see if you can't button bash harder than your friends in the ""All You Can Quaff"" mode! Bash X and Y as fast as you can to eat as much as you can as quick as you can! Finish all the plates before your friend and gain your very own boasting rights! (Terms and conditions apply. Pain in the hand is a known side affect. All rights reserved. Don't see online for details.)This game really does speak for itself and one of my most highly reccomended games.			"

												So. This game was released on XBLA in 2008, PS3 in 2010, and only came to us computer-type gamers in 2012. I'd heard so many good things for those four years, whenever castle crashers came up. People gushed. You know what?They were right.It's still charming. It's still fun. And it's still one of the best games to play with your friends when you're bored. Boss battles are often repetitive. Poop jokes get old. But the ridiculousness and the artistry and the hitty-hitty-whomp-kapow are all super fricken great, from the get-go and still twenty hours later. If you liked beat-em-ups back in the day-- your double dragons, your streets of rage, your golden axe-- buy this. And if you don't have friends who already own it? Buy a fourpack. Make three friends.And in the immortal words of Tatsu: ""Go. Play.""			"

 Castle Crashers Review  PROS -  Very fun and unique Is also a good Co-op game Good for all ages Stunning and Unique Graphics Amazing music Some sort of humour is in it CONS -  Its just button mashing Keyboard controls ( However it does recommend a controller ) Sometimes it gets just to hard and isnt fun Some bosses are repetitive Overall Review Castle Crashes is very fun and is better with friends. Although the cons may seem incredibly bad, remember that this game is currently overall 'Overwhelmingly Positive' (2017) and is a port from the Xbox 360. I think game is great and definetly worth its price. Its unique and has nice touch to the hack 'n' slash genre.			"

												Castle Crashers is very nicely done with good graphics, fun, adrenaline action, tons of enemies, simple gameplay, all this combined with a cooperative mode impeccable, longevity neither too short nor long, a mini system of growth of its characters, lots of unlockables, a unique style and a lot of irony. It is best enjoyed through online multiplayer with friends. A must that I suggest to anyone.			"

												**AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW, I COMPLETED ONE PLAYTHROUGH ON NORMAL, SO SOME POINTS COULD BE MISSED**Castle Crashers, developed by indie devs The Behemoth, became famous at the release of one of the top selling games on XBLA, Castle Crashers. It was highly praised by many and lots of my friends used to play and were obsessed with the game. I wasn't much of an Xbox guy at the time, and therefore did not buy it. After four years of castle crashing, it was finally released on PC. Then, over a year later, I decided to give this game a whirl and bought it. I must tell you, I was very impressed.I'll start with the visuals. I actually enjoy the graphics in the game, taking a rather simple style. It doesn't get all artsy like Braid and Bastion, nor does it get too realistic like Crysis. It sits in the middle, and I'm happy it doesn't have graphics like that. Not all indie games need to be artsy and heavily story based platfomers or whatever. For the most part, I do like the visuals this game offers.Now, I'll move to the gameplay. This is probably the first reason Castle Crashers is so awesome. It's a beat-em-up game, so let me make this clear: THE ENEMIES ARE TOUGHER THAN THEY SEEM. Be warned when buying this if you're looking for a simple, kill-this-guy-quick kind of game. You WILL be dissappointed. The gameplay is simple, yet challenging.  I didn't discover any horribly unbalanced weapons, which makes the game even better. Bosses are usually quite easy, but there are a few notorious bosses in the game to look out for, none of which are extremely hard. One other thing this game has is an arena where you can duel it out with friends or fight groups of enemies. I love the gameplay, but not the best part to this  game.Story time, kids! I have very little to say for the story. Repetitive and cliche, but adds some unique twists to the generic ""kill the wizard and save the princess"" kind of style.Audio is good mostly, but could be fine tuned so there are some more individual boss themes, like most of the bosses besides the final boss. I could be incorrect, but for some of the major bosses, it was a simple theme, while others didn't even have a theme at all!Now for the best part about this game: The replayability. After you beat a short campaign (which is actually necessary in this case) then you can beat it as another character. You can unlock the 28 Animal Orbs, the 30 characters, and then beat the game with all of them, then you can go to insane mode after completion. You can also find all of the weapons to this game, play All You Can Quaff, which is a food eating game or something like that, Arena, which is simply a battle arena, and maybe help a few newbie friends or anyone in the CC community that is new or even a veteran. On average, most of my friends who play with me have usually 200 hours, and they only have one or two level 99 characters. Quite a bit of content here, so there is about 500 hours, maybe tops, if you're extremely dedicated to doing everything this game has to offer. Kind of surprising for me, even for this kind of game.Just a few flaws I want to point out: The shield is pretty clunky and is pretty difficult and annoying to use. Also, because this is a PC port, it seemed a bit rushed and only showed the buttons for an Xbox 360 controller. One other issue I found is that the multiplayer can be quite laggy, and can ruin multiplayer experiences sometimes. However, that isn't too frequent for me.Overall, Castle Crashers is an amazing game that I cannot stop playing. I highly recommend this game, and I'm always willing to play with you guys. Add me if you want to play! Graphics- 8/10Gameplay- 9/10Story- 5/10Audio- 6.5/10Replayability- 9/10.:8.0/10:.+Highly replayable+Humorous+Mostly balanced+Simple graphics+Lots of content-Clunky shield system-Multiplayer lag-Port seems ""unfinished""			"

												It's a 4 Player medival Beat-em-up set in a comedic medival setting, let's get this out of the way, it's a port from XBLA, meaning it WILL tell you the XBOX controlls, and it WILL tell you to use a controller.The game is fun, but since there are only 2 attack buttons it gets redundant fast. Much like with borderlands 2, the story is just too repetitive and they have too many characters to play it as. I guarantee you 1 playthrough of this should be enough to quench your thirst.I'm not saying it's a bad game, the thing about it is just that the only replay value it has is with it's 3000 extra characters, but think about that, would you want to sit at your computer for hours a day as each character trying to get them to level 99? of course not.The game is good though, and it does have some minigames, but expect to lose at them.i give it a 6.5/10.

												Warning: This is an old review that has been re-uploaded intentionally to not only fix some false/missing information, but also to remove the ratings this review has received due to the false/missing information. This has been your warning.Castle Crashers is a game where you take the role of one of four knights who have to save the 4 princesses of the land and the king's magical crystal (no idea why it's so special), while fighting the evil wizard's minions, hostile inhabitants, and even the environment at times. It's gameplay is a Beat-Em-Up with RPG elements. Every time you injure an enemy, you gain EXP, after gaining enough you level up (much like any RPG). Every level up grants you a curtain amount of skill points. These can be spent on your attack, magic, running speed (and even arrow shot length as a bonus), and defense. After gaining curtain amount of levels, your character learns a new technique such as the spin-attack or maybe a strong finisher. If you invest enough points onto the magic skill ""tree"", you can learn new magic techniques such as your character's specific magic projectile such as fire or electricity. It is worth nothing that magic attacks differ from all characters. Nobody is a reskin of another in terms of magic.As you progress through the game, there will be lots of things to find & collect. For example: there are many different weapons with different stats and elements, the golden treasures (you require them to continue the story), animal orbs (little cute (or ugly) animal/monster buddies that increase specific stats further, or provide buffs such as being able to pick up items from far away or possibly having health regeneration), and of course money.There is quite a lot to come back to the game for: many secret items hidden within levels requiring specific conditions to be fulfilled, multiplayer, mini-games with multiplayer features as well, DLC adding even more content into the game such as characters and/or weapons, and a hardcore mode after beating the game with even more weapons & animal orbs that were not in the original game. Did I forget about unlockable/secret characters?The music is very well-done, even to today's standards for a classic game. It always seems to keep that ""Epic"" feel throughout the adventure. I must also give credit that the tracks never feel offbeat, especially during boss fights. Sure, some tracks are re-used, but there is enough variety that it doesn't even matter. While the music doesn't sound very medieval, it still stands as a major selling-point for me in terms of buying the game.Enemies in this game aren't that easy to kill, but they aren't hard either. Like other Beat-Em-Ups, enemies in this game head towards you and try to damage you. When you attack them, you can knock them down and they will get back up, unless you kill them. You'll know if their corpse flashes a bit then disappears. The bosses are quite different in terms of taking them down. Like any generic boss, they have a Life Meter (this time displayed at the bottom of the screen). Once it's depleted to zero, you win. What makes bosses special in this game however is actually the character and humor they bring into the chaos that the game already was. The barbarian boss always gave me a good laugh, and I am sure you would too after being used to the head-slicing and many things being killed.The humor in this game. Just the humor. It's just insanely clever, and devious at the same time. The barbarian boss being a good example. The fight itself can be quite humorous. There is tons of humor in the game, mostly violent yet guilty-pleasure kind of humor. Whether it be a pooping owl, a cyclops wedding crash, or even the silliness of the hostile inhabitants.Who's ready for some fun facts?Fun Fact: Did you know before the ""Barbarian Makeover"" update (also is known as version 2.0), there was an old mini-game (that is now exclusive to the Xbox 360 versions of the game) called ""All You Can Quaff""? This mini-game involved you mashing the buttons as fast as you can to beat your rivals in an eating contest. The achievement related to the mini-game was changed to the ""Back off Barbarian"" mini-game achievement. Those who already obtained that achievement previously would still have it.Fun Fact #2: If you own Battleblock Theater along with Castle Crashers, these games actually sync with each other! In Castle Crashers, you can play as Hatty Hattington and unleash the wonders of green gems (and some other fun Battleblock Theater related stuff) at your enemies along with having the golden whale animal orb, which is basically a mini-money generator. In Battleblock Theater on the other hand, you get a Castle Crasher head. Worth quite a lot on the market due to it's rarity and being a promotional item. You don't have to buy the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle to get the promo items, you can buy them separately and still obtain the promo, although it'll likely cost more $ from you.Overall, I feel that Castle Crashers is a blast to play (despite me buying it three times on different platforms), and is worth the 15$ price tag, even more worth it buying the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle. I also must exaggerate bring your friends as this is an awesome game to play with friends, whether it be online or offline. I will most curtainly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun time with their friends (or by themselves..like myself..#ForeverAlone).			"

												Now I started my love affair with The Behemoth when I saw Alien Hominid on the X-box Live Arcade. After many years of playing that game off and on I read in a gaming magazine that The Behemoth was going to make a whole new game that would be similar to Alien Hominid but with Knights. When it eventually came out I grabbed it on the X-Box marketplace. Honestly I must have spent Hundreds of hours on it over the years. It was the go to game when friends came over. We would consistently work towards unlocking new characters and trying to find different swords. There was a lot of fun nd incentive in coming back to play the game over again. It was probably a collective favorite of all my friends and my personal favorite side scroller.Now years after that constant obsession with Castle Crashers on X-box, it's on Steam. And it is still amazing. The keyboard controls are a bit difficult at first. But after you get used to it the game is smooth and fun. I'm incredibly happy it's on Steam and I highly recommend it.

												Castle Crashers is one of the best co-op games that i have played yet. This game is a button mashser so take note if you son't like that type of games. I really like the graphic style that looks like a cartoon. You start out with 4 different characters that look almost the same but are yet so different. They each have some type of magic that you can use. The blue one uses ice, the yelow one uses fire, the green one uses poision/poison gas and the red one (the one that i use) uses lightning. You can level each one of these characters up individually and everytime you level up you get some skill points that you can speend on stenght, magic power, health/defence and agility. The strenght upgrade let's you dish out more damage, the magic power will make your magic more powerfull and give you new magic tricks, the helth/defence one gives you more health and defence (duh..) and the agility one makes you faster and do more damage with your bow. The bow is one of the items that you can get others include a boomerang, a shovel, a health poition (up to 5), a super sandwich (up to five, a bomb (up to 5) and some quest items. On your quest to save the kingdom from an evil wizard you can have a flying pet following you. These pets will give you a variety of boosts like helping you level up faster, hit some of the enemies, helping you find new weapons and others. There are so many different weapons that can boost your stats or make some stats go down while the weapon is equipped like for example a weapon might give you +2 in strenght but -1 in magic. I won't spoil anything but when you beat the game the character you beat it with will unlock a new character so if you are more than on person the person who played played blue might get an alien and the person who played red might get a skeleton (i don't know what the different charaters get). I can't really mention the soundtrack and the soundeffects since i didn't have the sound on most of the time but what i heard was pretty good. When you have beaten the game and have a high level charater you will be pleased to find out that you unlocked INSANE MODE which i am curretly playing with my friend. INSANE MODE is the entire game again but much harder. Before you start insane mode you can buy some weapons and pets at a high cost but they help a lot. I forgot to mention the money. In stages you will collect money that enemies drop and these money can be spent on potions, pets, swords and other good stuff. One of the good aspects of this money system is that you don't EVER have to spend any of it. You can collect pets and swords everywhere so you don't have to buy anything. Shops are located al around the map and there is almost always a boss battle close to them. These boss battles are so good. They are really creative and can prove to be quite a challenge sometimes but not to hard. I mean like you had to fight a corncob that when you hit it turn into popcorn that give you health. There is a lot to do in this game and it is really gret but now to the parts that i didn't like so much. The game starts by saying the it is best to play with a controller and sure thats is fine but the game does not show any pc controls ANYWHERE! The controls for pc kind of suck too. Sometimes the achivemets can be such a pain to get and you need a friend to help you get them. On the topics of needing people to play with this game is nowhere nears as fun playing alone as it is playing with someone else. I tried alone for a while and it was not very fun at all so if you don't have anyone to play with then DON'T buy this game, but if you have someone to play with i defintly think that you should buy this game. To be honest this is an amazing game when playing with you friends. The game is so creative and fun and there are so many sword and pets and charaters because you can get more charaters from arenas and  beating the game with new charaters gives you more characters. The graphics are really cool and the gameplay is also really fun. The controls can be a bit stupid at times but it can be overlooked if you have gotten used to them. If you can play with someone else this game is a 9/10 because it is so fun and creative and all the stuff you can do even after beating the game it has high replay value. If you have someone to play with BUY THIS GAME! However if you don't have anyoe to play with the game becomes so much less fun. Alone it is one long grind (if you want to complete it) or just a game you will only beat once and then thats it. Alone i would give it a 6/10 because it is still a great game in my opinion but i would say DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ALONE! I hope this review was useful. It was my first so i would love critisism. Thank you:-)			"

												Castle Crashers is exactly what you expect it to be. Its a really fun beatemup for both couch and online co-op and even single playthroughs. It is not a huge game but the replayability is great if you have your friends on board since there are enough achievements to keep you motivated and tons of weapons and characters to unllock. There's even a harder game mode if you are up for a challenge. Overall i think this game is a must buy for everyone looking for a fun beatemup with great controls and gameplay. 9/10			"

												This game is an outstanding game, I recommend everyone to purchase the game. It is worth the $15, I'd even say it's worth $30! This game is fun to play over and over, and I find it to get old sometimes. But I still find it fun when I get back to the game. Try it! I know you'll like it if you try it out. This game is a very good game and fun to experience over and over, especially with friends. If you have some friends to play with, it'll be a very very fun game. I purchased this game for my cousin and I to play together, and I found us playing it a lot together. We are even going to complete the game on Insane mode (A harder difficulty unlocked after completing the entire game). Well I recommend you people who are reading this review to pick up the game yourself. You'll enjoy it if you want a cool adventure, although the graphics can be bad... I think that it is still outstanding in performance! :P The game can be glitchy at times, like my cousin is playing one level at the same time I played another. So we were basically in the same game, but in different levels? I don't understand how this glitch can occur, but it can be resolved if both players exit the game, wait a few minutes, then start up the game and get back together. This game is worth all the money, and I believe whoever reads this review will have the urge to purchase the game themself. The game is a very good game, I own it on Steam and on the PS3. And if you saw my playtime on the PS3 version, I believe it would say 600 hours. I did get all my characters to level 99... This game is a blast! Try it out right now! You definately will enjoy all of the fantastic levels that the game has to offer!			"

												Castle Crashers is an amazing battle game sure to make you satisfied with your purchase. Some parts funny, others intense, this game is an allout fight to get back what is rightfully yours, a crystal and bae. This game is a huge production that has been out for years with addons by purchasing the games : Alien Hominid HD, and Battleblock Theatre. The battle aspect is what makes this a winner plus the head to head battling you can do with friends along with the regular story and a food eating contest! I've wasted about 30 hours on this game as of today and im really satisfied with the wasted time :D. I would reccomend buying all DLC because the characters you do recieve are worth it, plus, it's really only $1.99. Thanks for reading and I hope to play some arena games with you sometime in the future!			"

												Decent, but overrated.  The combat and customization is great, and the multiplayer and trademark Newgrounds goofiness makes this a great party game. However, the experience/leveling is too overbearing; it controls not only the player's moveset and abilities, but also their health and damage-dealing ability. This kind of soils the experience by creating situations where the enemies either feel too tanky or too glassy, with rarely any middle ground if you play the game's levels out of order (or, if you play the game's tedious Hard Mode). And while the player character has diverse combat abilities, the enemies you fight start to become a little same-ish after a while.As far as single player gameplay goes, I honestly would prefer to play Turtles in Time for the SNES.  Price tag is ""eh"", your milage may vary.			"

												This game is amazing. I recomend it even if its not on sale. I also recomend playing it with friends, that makes it much more enjoyable than it already is, and thats how its best played anyway. Dont let my short playtime on it for Steam fool you, I played the life out of this game in the following years after its 360 release and I even played a decent amount on my friends PS3. Cant wait to do it all again on Steam with the Remastered update.For those who havent played it I will say its technically repetitive after a few playthroughs with different characters, however, it might be the only repetitive game thats actually fun to replay over and over and over again. Its replayed to unlock characters, characters' abilities, weapons, pets, to level up, to play on the harder difficulty, and just simply because the game is hilarious and fun to play.10/10 If it was on Ouya id consider buying an Ouya to do it again.Consider.

												An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.Castle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, ""I'm bored, let's play"" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.The game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,The gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.The multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.The art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.The game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into ""run forward, mash buttons, run forward again."" In that case it simply may not cater to you.Those aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.			"

												Warning: This is an old review that has been re-uploaded intentionally to not only fix some false/missing information, but also to remove the ratings this review has received due to the false/missing information. This has been your warning.Castle Crashers is a game where you take the role of one of four knights who have to save the 4 princesses of the land and the king's magical crystal (no idea why it's so special), while fighting the evil wizard's minions, hostile inhabitants, and even the environment at times. It's gameplay is a Beat-Em-Up with RPG elements. Every time you injure an enemy, you gain EXP, after gaining enough you level up (much like any RPG). Every level up grants you a curtain amount of skill points. These can be spent on your attack, magic, running speed (and even arrow shot length as a bonus), and defense. After gaining curtain amount of levels, your character learns a new technique such as the spin-attack or maybe a strong finisher. If you invest enough points onto the magic skill ""tree"", you can learn new magic techniques such as your character's specific magic projectile such as fire or electricity. It is worth nothing that magic attacks differ from all characters. Nobody is a reskin of another in terms of magic.As you progress through the game, there will be lots of things to find & collect. For example: there are many different weapons with different stats and elements, the golden treasures (you require them to continue the story), animal orbs (little cute (or ugly) animal/monster buddies that increase specific stats further, or provide buffs such as being able to pick up items from far away or possibly having health regeneration), and of course money.There is quite a lot to come back to the game for: many secret items hidden within levels requiring specific conditions to be fulfilled, multiplayer, mini-games with multiplayer features as well, DLC adding even more content into the game such as characters and/or weapons, and a hardcore mode after beating the game with even more weapons & animal orbs that were not in the original game. Did I forget about unlockable/secret characters?The music is very well-done, even to today's standards for a classic game. It always seems to keep that ""Epic"" feel throughout the adventure. I must also give credit that the tracks never feel offbeat, especially during boss fights. Sure, some tracks are re-used, but there is enough variety that it doesn't even matter. While the music doesn't sound very medieval, it still stands as a major selling-point for me in terms of buying the game.Enemies in this game aren't that easy to kill, but they aren't hard either. Like other Beat-Em-Ups, enemies in this game head towards you and try to damage you. When you attack them, you can knock them down and they will get back up, unless you kill them. You'll know if their corpse flashes a bit then disappears. The bosses are quite different in terms of taking them down. Like any generic boss, they have a Life Meter (this time displayed at the bottom of the screen). Once it's depleted to zero, you win. What makes bosses special in this game however is actually the character and humor they bring into the chaos that the game already was. The barbarian boss always gave me a good laugh, and I am sure you would too after being used to the head-slicing and many things being killed.The humor in this game. Just the humor. It's just insanely clever, and devious at the same time. The barbarian boss being a good example. The fight itself can be quite humorous. There is tons of humor in the game, mostly violent yet guilty-pleasure kind of humor. Whether it be a pooping owl, a cyclops wedding crash, or even the silliness of the hostile inhabitants.Who's ready for some fun facts?Fun Fact: Did you know before the ""Barbarian Makeover"" update (also is known as version 2.0), there was an old mini-game (that is now exclusive to the Xbox 360 versions of the game) called ""All You Can Quaff""? This mini-game involved you mashing the buttons as fast as you can to beat your rivals in an eating contest. The achievement related to the mini-game was changed to the ""Back off Barbarian"" mini-game achievement. Those who already obtained that achievement previously would still have it.Fun Fact #2: If you own Battleblock Theater along with Castle Crashers, these games actually sync with each other! In Castle Crashers, you can play as Hatty Hattington and unleash the wonders of green gems (and some other fun Battleblock Theater related stuff) at your enemies along with having the golden whale animal orb, which is basically a mini-money generator. In Battleblock Theater on the other hand, you get a Castle Crasher head. Worth quite a lot on the market due to it's rarity and being a promotional item. You don't have to buy the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle to get the promo items, you can buy them separately and still obtain the promo, although it'll likely cost more $ from you.Overall, I feel that Castle Crashers is a blast to play (despite me buying it three times on different platforms), and is worth the 15$ price tag, even more worth it buying the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle. I also must exaggerate bring your friends as this is an awesome game to play with friends, whether it be online or offline. I will most curtainly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun time with their friends (or by themselves..like myself..#ForeverAlone).			"

												Now I started my love affair with The Behemoth when I saw Alien Hominid on the X-box Live Arcade. After many years of playing that game off and on I read in a gaming magazine that The Behemoth was going to make a whole new game that would be similar to Alien Hominid but with Knights. When it eventually came out I grabbed it on the X-Box marketplace. Honestly I must have spent Hundreds of hours on it over the years. It was the go to game when friends came over. We would consistently work towards unlocking new characters and trying to find different swords. There was a lot of fun nd incentive in coming back to play the game over again. It was probably a collective favorite of all my friends and my personal favorite side scroller.Now years after that constant obsession with Castle Crashers on X-box, it's on Steam. And it is still amazing. The keyboard controls are a bit difficult at first. But after you get used to it the game is smooth and fun. I'm incredibly happy it's on Steam and I highly recommend it.

												An old-school beat'em up, where you have to save princesses, by first freeing them and then getting a kiss from them. 10/10 for originality.Graphics - If you have watched any of the 90's - early 20's cartoons, you are going to fall inlove with the graphic style of this game. As a person who grew up watching cartoons, everything I see has a mixed combination of new and nostalgia.10/10Music - Boy does the music in this game have a wide variety of emotions, from the melodical and calm one that is playing while you are just moving on to the powering up it does the moment you enter a fight. Overall the place and time for every single song is perfect. 10/10Cinematics - It does have quite a few cinematics, most of them are to introduce a level or a boss, but still you won't see a one that copies the other, every single one is unique. I have to add most of them are quite funny, 10/10Story - A pretty basic story, go there, save that, get a kiss, easy as that. The but the comedical depth it adds is just tremendous. the story is mostly told through text bubbles, either way your going to see the funny side in the text or through their action. 10/10Content -  The game lacks nothing, enough enemy variations to keep yourself interested, a wide variety of weather types, random things that happen on the screen. No matter how much you play, you wont be able to predict what a person will say or do. 10/10Controls - You can play on either mouse+keyboard or controler (I recommend the controler). Both of them are fluid and responsive. 10/10Gameplay - A really fun experience, but best played with friends, even by playing alone you are punishing yourself, by what you are missing if you have 4 players and that it is really hard for 1 player. That is either the game really does get way too hard for 1 player or that I am a bad player (the second). 10/10Just the perfect game in my opinion, it gets every single thing it strives to get right, from the littlest detail to the biggest of ones. I strongly recommend playing with friends, either buy it for them (that won't happen),  make them buy it themselves (still won't happen) or buy it for your pet bear (most probable). I would like to add why the hell do you have a bear pet, but hey that is life.Overall score: 10/10			"

												An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.Castle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, ""I'm bored, let's play"" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.The game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,The gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.The multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.The art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.The game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into ""run forward, mash buttons, run forward again."" In that case it simply may not cater to you.Those aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.			"

												Castle Crashers is one of the best co-op games that i have played yet. This game is a button mashser so take note if you son't like that type of games. I really like the graphic style that looks like a cartoon. You start out with 4 different characters that look almost the same but are yet so different. They each have some type of magic that you can use. The blue one uses ice, the yelow one uses fire, the green one uses poision/poison gas and the red one (the one that i use) uses lightning. You can level each one of these characters up individually and everytime you level up you get some skill points that you can speend on stenght, magic power, health/defence and agility. The strenght upgrade let's you dish out more damage, the magic power will make your magic more powerfull and give you new magic tricks, the helth/defence one gives you more health and defence (duh..) and the agility one makes you faster and do more damage with your bow. The bow is one of the items that you can get others include a boomerang, a shovel, a health poition (up to 5), a super sandwich (up to five, a bomb (up to 5) and some quest items. On your quest to save the kingdom from an evil wizard you can have a flying pet following you. These pets will give you a variety of boosts like helping you level up faster, hit some of the enemies, helping you find new weapons and others. There are so many different weapons that can boost your stats or make some stats go down while the weapon is equipped like for example a weapon might give you +2 in strenght but -1 in magic. I won't spoil anything but when you beat the game the character you beat it with will unlock a new character so if you are more than on person the person who played played blue might get an alien and the person who played red might get a skeleton (i don't know what the different charaters get). I can't really mention the soundtrack and the soundeffects since i didn't have the sound on most of the time but what i heard was pretty good. When you have beaten the game and have a high level charater you will be pleased to find out that you unlocked INSANE MODE which i am curretly playing with my friend. INSANE MODE is the entire game again but much harder. Before you start insane mode you can buy some weapons and pets at a high cost but they help a lot. I forgot to mention the money. In stages you will collect money that enemies drop and these money can be spent on potions, pets, swords and other good stuff. One of the good aspects of this money system is that you don't EVER have to spend any of it. You can collect pets and swords everywhere so you don't have to buy anything. Shops are located al around the map and there is almost always a boss battle close to them. These boss battles are so good. They are really creative and can prove to be quite a challenge sometimes but not to hard. I mean like you had to fight a corncob that when you hit it turn into popcorn that give you health. There is a lot to do in this game and it is really gret but now to the parts that i didn't like so much. The game starts by saying the it is best to play with a controller and sure thats is fine but the game does not show any pc controls ANYWHERE! The controls for pc kind of suck too. Sometimes the achivemets can be such a pain to get and you need a friend to help you get them. On the topics of needing people to play with this game is nowhere nears as fun playing alone as it is playing with someone else. I tried alone for a while and it was not very fun at all so if you don't have anyone to play with then DON'T buy this game, but if you have someone to play with i defintly think that you should buy this game. To be honest this is an amazing game when playing with you friends. The game is so creative and fun and there are so many sword and pets and charaters because you can get more charaters from arenas and  beating the game with new charaters gives you more characters. The graphics are really cool and the gameplay is also really fun. The controls can be a bit stupid at times but it can be overlooked if you have gotten used to them. If you can play with someone else this game is a 9/10 because it is so fun and creative and all the stuff you can do even after beating the game it has high replay value. If you have someone to play with BUY THIS GAME! However if you don't have anyoe to play with the game becomes so much less fun. Alone it is one long grind (if you want to complete it) or just a game you will only beat once and then thats it. Alone i would give it a 6/10 because it is still a great game in my opinion but i would say DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ALONE! I hope this review was useful. It was my first so i would love critisism. Thank you:-)			"

												Warning: This is an old review that has been re-uploaded intentionally to not only fix some false/missing information, but also to remove the ratings this review has received due to the false/missing information. This has been your warning.Castle Crashers is a game where you take the role of one of four knights who have to save the 4 princesses of the land and the king's magical crystal (no idea why it's so special), while fighting the evil wizard's minions, hostile inhabitants, and even the environment at times. It's gameplay is a Beat-Em-Up with RPG elements. Every time you injure an enemy, you gain EXP, after gaining enough you level up (much like any RPG). Every level up grants you a curtain amount of skill points. These can be spent on your attack, magic, running speed (and even arrow shot length as a bonus), and defense. After gaining curtain amount of levels, your character learns a new technique such as the spin-attack or maybe a strong finisher. If you invest enough points onto the magic skill ""tree"", you can learn new magic techniques such as your character's specific magic projectile such as fire or electricity. It is worth nothing that magic attacks differ from all characters. Nobody is a reskin of another in terms of magic.As you progress through the game, there will be lots of things to find & collect. For example: there are many different weapons with different stats and elements, the golden treasures (you require them to continue the story), animal orbs (little cute (or ugly) animal/monster buddies that increase specific stats further, or provide buffs such as being able to pick up items from far away or possibly having health regeneration), and of course money.There is quite a lot to come back to the game for: many secret items hidden within levels requiring specific conditions to be fulfilled, multiplayer, mini-games with multiplayer features as well, DLC adding even more content into the game such as characters and/or weapons, and a hardcore mode after beating the game with even more weapons & animal orbs that were not in the original game. Did I forget about unlockable/secret characters?The music is very well-done, even to today's standards for a classic game. It always seems to keep that ""Epic"" feel throughout the adventure. I must also give credit that the tracks never feel offbeat, especially during boss fights. Sure, some tracks are re-used, but there is enough variety that it doesn't even matter. While the music doesn't sound very medieval, it still stands as a major selling-point for me in terms of buying the game.Enemies in this game aren't that easy to kill, but they aren't hard either. Like other Beat-Em-Ups, enemies in this game head towards you and try to damage you. When you attack them, you can knock them down and they will get back up, unless you kill them. You'll know if their corpse flashes a bit then disappears. The bosses are quite different in terms of taking them down. Like any generic boss, they have a Life Meter (this time displayed at the bottom of the screen). Once it's depleted to zero, you win. What makes bosses special in this game however is actually the character and humor they bring into the chaos that the game already was. The barbarian boss always gave me a good laugh, and I am sure you would too after being used to the head-slicing and many things being killed.The humor in this game. Just the humor. It's just insanely clever, and devious at the same time. The barbarian boss being a good example. The fight itself can be quite humorous. There is tons of humor in the game, mostly violent yet guilty-pleasure kind of humor. Whether it be a pooping owl, a cyclops wedding crash, or even the silliness of the hostile inhabitants.Who's ready for some fun facts?Fun Fact: Did you know before the ""Barbarian Makeover"" update (also is known as version 2.0), there was an old mini-game (that is now exclusive to the Xbox 360 versions of the game) called ""All You Can Quaff""? This mini-game involved you mashing the buttons as fast as you can to beat your rivals in an eating contest. The achievement related to the mini-game was changed to the ""Back off Barbarian"" mini-game achievement. Those who already obtained that achievement previously would still have it.Fun Fact #2: If you own Battleblock Theater along with Castle Crashers, these games actually sync with each other! In Castle Crashers, you can play as Hatty Hattington and unleash the wonders of green gems (and some other fun Battleblock Theater related stuff) at your enemies along with having the golden whale animal orb, which is basically a mini-money generator. In Battleblock Theater on the other hand, you get a Castle Crasher head. Worth quite a lot on the market due to it's rarity and being a promotional item. You don't have to buy the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle to get the promo items, you can buy them separately and still obtain the promo, although it'll likely cost more $ from you.Overall, I feel that Castle Crashers is a blast to play (despite me buying it three times on different platforms), and is worth the 15$ price tag, even more worth it buying the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle. I also must exaggerate bring your friends as this is an awesome game to play with friends, whether it be online or offline. I will most curtainly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun time with their friends (or by themselves..like myself..#ForeverAlone).			"

												This is a nice, fluid, beat-em-up game that is surprisingly addictive. First of all, this game focuses on combat. It only makes sense that this is what the game exceeds at. It offers classic melee combos intertwined with magical onslaughts and slick bow-shooting. As a result, the combat is never boring and keeps you eager to bash skulls all around. The other aspects of the game are pretty decent. The gameplay never lags, the story is shallow yet fun, and the cartoon-like graphics provide scenery that isn't detailed enough to distract you from the gameplay.All in all, I'd recommend it to the casual gamer who wants a little reprieve from the more strategical high-end games available.

												It's a great game to play with your friends. It's defiantly better with a controller. So if you don't have one you wouldn't be getting the full experience. It's also kinda fun by yourself but the downside is you'll be wanting to level up because with friends you can do harder levels with co-op so you should get your friends to play with you as many times as you can with this game. I have not used the keyboard controls so I cannot say they are good or bad. If you have a controller for your PC and almost never use it or need a game that you want to use your controller for get this game. I forgot about the story, it's funny more than serious so keep that in mind. It's pretty solid but if you are fighting your friends it's kinda weird when you are an inch above them and not hitting them. 9/10			"

												This game is simply AMAZING.You pick a character of your liking, finish the game with him and unlock new characters + Insane mode for the character you finished the game with. You got bored repeating the story mode with your usual weapon and animal orbs? Simple, go on a quest to get them all! The Animal Orbs are helpful (and some have secret effects) which will make your playthroughs with new characters far more easier and fun!Considering weapons, there are alot to choose from. Some are hidden, some are picked up from monsters and some are just given after boss fights. There is a variety of weaponary to choose from. Also, you can get a bow and a boomerang (which is hidden and a special pet is required to get it) to boost up your combos and kill everyone with style.The story of the game is quite fun and interesting. Though I warn you the game is not that long, (about 2 hours max) but you have to keep in mind that you will be repeating it for a great amount of time if you want to unlock new characters. (Some are given when you beat arenas SOLO)My final opinion:This game is WORTH BUYING. On sale it's usually 50% or 75% off which makes it more worth the money. If you like fighting, unlocking new play methods and rewards, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!			"

												I remember back then when i played this game around 2009 in Xbox 360, one of my first and best indie games i have ever played. Excellent fluid gameplay that stands up to multiple playthroughs. It's filled with humor added with some blood and gore to the mix with its Beat Em Up gameplay style, level up system which adds a bit more depth to the overall gameplay experience as you can increase your stats or learn new attacks. The game also provides a great multiplayer experience with up to 4 players who can engage to the main campaign which comes in two difficulty flavors or duke it out in a arena type PvP style mode. Play as different types of characters with their own magic style, it's pretty a lot of great humor added throughout the game and Nostalgic Beat Em Up Genre and finally.. Decent plotline. Overall! It's a great Indie game Beat Em Up that contains with RPG and Action, i recommend this game for people who are interested with Beat Em Up and Hack and RPG with Action.Rated: 9.3/10			"

												Extremely funny game, specially with multiple players to share the laughter of... pretty much everything!Everything in this game is meant to cause some chuckles, from the animations, sounds, bosses and even the storyline.The gameplay is a bit retro, 2D mash-to-win (similar to Streets of Rage), but with plenty of weapons and adorable petsto collect (Gotta Catch'em All, anyone?). There are also some basic RPG elements, like stats and level-ups, andsometimes some grinding is advised before moving to certain areas, but nothing unreasonable.The game has a lot of levels and variety, but they're pretty short and once the game is finished, there's little to doexcept the aforementioned collecting. The online modes are pretty weak, just stick to 'coop' the main game.Recommended to those looking for simple gameplay and story, and want little depth but a lot of fun in their game!			"

												Castle Crashers is an amazing battle game sure to make you satisfied with your purchase. Some parts funny, others intense, this game is an allout fight to get back what is rightfully yours, a crystal and bae. This game is a huge production that has been out for years with addons by purchasing the games : Alien Hominid HD, and Battleblock Theatre. The battle aspect is what makes this a winner plus the head to head battling you can do with friends along with the regular story and a food eating contest! I've wasted about 30 hours on this game as of today and im really satisfied with the wasted time :D. I would reccomend buying all DLC because the characters you do recieve are worth it, plus, it's really only $1.99. Thanks for reading and I hope to play some arena games with you sometime in the future!			"

												Castle Crashers starts with a mysterious man snatching a large (and what I assume is also expensive) crystal and four lovely princesses from the King's throne. As one of the knights of the castle, it is your duty to retrieve the stolen goods and fair maidens. There's no dialogue, so you won't get more of a story than that unless you use your imagination. That's not a bad thing, though, especially for a brawler. If you're like me, you probably don't need an excuse to chop enemies up into little pieces.       The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. His unique art style really brings the environments to life, and even the most ferocious monsters are still pretty cute. To counteract the adorableness of Paladin's creations, the game includes lots of potty humor and gore-filled battles.       The four starting knights wield magic powers that are differentiated by armor color -- Red has lightning, Green has poison, Orange has fire, and Blue has ice. Armed with magic and steel (or maybe a stick), you'll hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points, and level up. As you progress, you'll garner more skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you'd like, but that's not the only way you can customize.       On your quest to save the princesses you'll discover two other tools to help you: melee weaponry and animal orbs. You can find new weapons several ways; some will be obviously given to you and others you'll need to dig up or purchase at a store. Every weapon will affect your stats either positively or negatively. A regular sword might take away a point of Strength but add a point to your Agility, so you'll need to make the call on what traits are more important to you. The urge to find a better, cooler weapon never dies, so you can expect to search the many hidden crevices of the game until you find something that suites your style.       Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute. There are 28 creatures (the two DLC animals from the Xbox 360 version are now included) scattered across the lands, and it's up to you to find them. Each animal provides a different boost and comes complete with an endearing name, so Meowburt the kitty increases your agility skill while Owlet the owl can retrieve food items for you. It's fun to battle with a small animal hovering around you, especially if it's Rammy the ram who will ram nearby enemies for you.       The Behemoth is known for making difficult games, most notably Alien Hominid, and that reputation stands true if you try and take on the campaign by yourself. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Since it's designed to be a cooperative game, it's hard to scold The Behemoth for making it incredibly difficult to conquer on your own. There's no ""I"" in team, after all.      Speaking of friends, you can crash castles with the favorite people on your friends list either locally or online. With local co-op mode, you can't sign into multiple accounts like you could in the Xbox 360 version; you can only split up the main PSN ID into quarters. Friends curious about the game can also drop-in and out from the map, but not in the middle of a level, so it's not truly drop-in, drop-out co-op. Despite that flaw, it is nice that you can mix up the local and online co-op modes, so if you and a buddy at your house want to pair up with some other people on your friends list, you can do that.      If you're lucky enough, you can successfully create private matches with your friends, but out of several people only one of my friends was able to host a match without getting an error. Dropping into quick matches, however, seemed to work just fine. While playing online, there was some noticeable lag, but it didn't actually interfere until the worst possible moment -- once I made it to last part of the final boss, the game I was in suddenly dropped. Curse you, wretched servers!!! I can only hope that a patch fixing these issues will become available for the PS3 faster than it did for the Xbox 360 version.      Since the game had to be re-coded for the PS3 anyway, The Behemoth added in some minor differences throughout the campaign along with some major re-hauls. The most noticeable change is that the former mode All You Can Quaff has been removed and replaced with Volleyball. True to real life volleyball, there are two four-person teams playing against each other. The only problem is it's really difficult to figure out if you're on the same plane as the ball, so expect to get scored on a lot until you get the hang of it.      Team Arena has also been updated to include teams. Now you can pair up for some two-on-two battles, or prove yourself against three other people. There's also an Insane Store that's unlocked once you've beaten the game on normal difficulty. All former DLC offerings and the popular Alien Hominid character are included, some are found in the Insane Store, while others have to be earned in different ways.      THE VERDICTThe Behemoth's incredibly fun cooperative beat 'em-up would have been pure brawler perfection if the multiplayer had launched in better form. It's incredibly frustrating that it's easier to play Castle Crashers with strangers than with your friends, but it's still a great brawler that will soak up your time. Between unlocking new characters so you can level them up to finding all of the hidden weapons and animal orbs, there's a lot to do in the campaign mode. If you never experienced the Xbox 360 version, or you happen to have more friends on your PSN list, Castle Crashers is a great game though you might want to wait for a multiplayer patch before investing.

												This game is an outstanding game, I recommend everyone to purchase the game. It is worth the $15, I'd even say it's worth $30! This game is fun to play over and over, and I find it to get old sometimes. But I still find it fun when I get back to the game. Try it! I know you'll like it if you try it out. This game is a very good game and fun to experience over and over, especially with friends. If you have some friends to play with, it'll be a very very fun game. I purchased this game for my cousin and I to play together, and I found us playing it a lot together. We are even going to complete the game on Insane mode (A harder difficulty unlocked after completing the entire game). Well I recommend you people who are reading this review to pick up the game yourself. You'll enjoy it if you want a cool adventure, although the graphics can be bad... I think that it is still outstanding in performance! :P The game can be glitchy at times, like my cousin is playing one level at the same time I played another. So we were basically in the same game, but in different levels? I don't understand how this glitch can occur, but it can be resolved if both players exit the game, wait a few minutes, then start up the game and get back together. This game is worth all the money, and I believe whoever reads this review will have the urge to purchase the game themself. The game is a very good game, I own it on Steam and on the PS3. And if you saw my playtime on the PS3 version, I believe it would say 600 hours. I did get all my characters to level 99... This game is a blast! Try it out right now! You definately will enjoy all of the fantastic levels that the game has to offer!			"

												This game is amazing. I recomend it even if its not on sale. I also recomend playing it with friends, that makes it much more enjoyable than it already is, and thats how its best played anyway. Dont let my short playtime on it for Steam fool you, I played the life out of this game in the following years after its 360 release and I even played a decent amount on my friends PS3. Cant wait to do it all again on Steam with the Remastered update.For those who havent played it I will say its technically repetitive after a few playthroughs with different characters, however, it might be the only repetitive game thats actually fun to replay over and over and over again. Its replayed to unlock characters, characters' abilities, weapons, pets, to level up, to play on the harder difficulty, and just simply because the game is hilarious and fun to play.10/10 If it was on Ouya id consider buying an Ouya to do it again.Consider.

												Decent, but overrated.  The combat and customization is great, and the multiplayer and trademark Newgrounds goofiness makes this a great party game. However, the experience/leveling is too overbearing; it controls not only the player's moveset and abilities, but also their health and damage-dealing ability. This kind of soils the experience by creating situations where the enemies either feel too tanky or too glassy, with rarely any middle ground if you play the game's levels out of order (or, if you play the game's tedious Hard Mode). And while the player character has diverse combat abilities, the enemies you fight start to become a little same-ish after a while.As far as single player gameplay goes, I honestly would prefer to play Turtles in Time for the SNES.  Price tag is ""eh"", your milage may vary.			"

												Castle Crashers starts with a mysterious man snatching a large (and what I assume is also expensive) crystal and four lovely princesses from the King's throne. As one of the knights of the castle, it is your duty to retrieve the stolen goods and fair maidens. There's no dialogue, so you won't get more of a story than that unless you use your imagination. That's not a bad thing, though, especially for a brawler. If you're like me, you probably don't need an excuse to chop enemies up into little pieces.       The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. His unique art style really brings the environments to life, and even the most ferocious monsters are still pretty cute. To counteract the adorableness of Paladin's creations, the game includes lots of potty humor and gore-filled battles.       The four starting knights wield magic powers that are differentiated by armor color -- Red has lightning, Green has poison, Orange has fire, and Blue has ice. Armed with magic and steel (or maybe a stick), you'll hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points, and level up. As you progress, you'll garner more skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you'd like, but that's not the only way you can customize.       On your quest to save the princesses you'll discover two other tools to help you: melee weaponry and animal orbs. You can find new weapons several ways; some will be obviously given to you and others you'll need to dig up or purchase at a store. Every weapon will affect your stats either positively or negatively. A regular sword might take away a point of Strength but add a point to your Agility, so you'll need to make the call on what traits are more important to you. The urge to find a better, cooler weapon never dies, so you can expect to search the many hidden crevices of the game until you find something that suites your style.       Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute. There are 28 creatures (the two DLC animals from the Xbox 360 version are now included) scattered across the lands, and it's up to you to find them. Each animal provides a different boost and comes complete with an endearing name, so Meowburt the kitty increases your agility skill while Owlet the owl can retrieve food items for you. It's fun to battle with a small animal hovering around you, especially if it's Rammy the ram who will ram nearby enemies for you.       The Behemoth is known for making difficult games, most notably Alien Hominid, and that reputation stands true if you try and take on the campaign by yourself. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Since it's designed to be a cooperative game, it's hard to scold The Behemoth for making it incredibly difficult to conquer on your own. There's no ""I"" in team, after all.      Speaking of friends, you can crash castles with the favorite people on your friends list either locally or online. With local co-op mode, you can't sign into multiple accounts like you could in the Xbox 360 version; you can only split up the main PSN ID into quarters. Friends curious about the game can also drop-in and out from the map, but not in the middle of a level, so it's not truly drop-in, drop-out co-op. Despite that flaw, it is nice that you can mix up the local and online co-op modes, so if you and a buddy at your house want to pair up with some other people on your friends list, you can do that.      If you're lucky enough, you can successfully create private matches with your friends, but out of several people only one of my friends was able to host a match without getting an error. Dropping into quick matches, however, seemed to work just fine. While playing online, there was some noticeable lag, but it didn't actually interfere until the worst possible moment -- once I made it to last part of the final boss, the game I was in suddenly dropped. Curse you, wretched servers!!! I can only hope that a patch fixing these issues will become available for the PS3 faster than it did for the Xbox 360 version.      Since the game had to be re-coded for the PS3 anyway, The Behemoth added in some minor differences throughout the campaign along with some major re-hauls. The most noticeable change is that the former mode All You Can Quaff has been removed and replaced with Volleyball. True to real life volleyball, there are two four-person teams playing against each other. The only problem is it's really difficult to figure out if you're on the same plane as the ball, so expect to get scored on a lot until you get the hang of it.      Team Arena has also been updated to include teams. Now you can pair up for some two-on-two battles, or prove yourself against three other people. There's also an Insane Store that's unlocked once you've beaten the game on normal difficulty.

												This is a very good beat-'em-up style game, and a good time-waster at that. There are many fun bosses and interesting enemies, as well as a decent storyline to put it all together. There are a few weird cutscenes where the animals are defecating, though. Very good multiplayer setup and overall one of my favorite games on Steam. I have never gotten bored playing this game. The endgame is a little rushed, but well worth the erratic boss patterns. Insane mode unlocks after the main game is beaten, and that's a gigantic struggle.			"

												This is one of the most awesome games I've ever played. The graphics are amazing with a unigue design and a great style. This game is really fun to play alone or with friends, and is filled with challenging bosses and enemies. It has loads of playable characters from the derpy villager to the Harcore necromancer, as well as tons of weapons with different buffs and debuffs. It's filled with content, and you can play the game over and over again without getting bored, or jump into insane mode. The level design is on point, and the soundtrack is done very well. There's even a pvp or boardgame option if you're that kind of person.The only things I don't like are the frankly immachure humor, and the part in some levels where you kiss the princess. Other than that, this is an amazing game that is definitely worth the $15. I'd rate 9.5/10. "

												Castle Crashers is a very fun single player or co-op experience similar to the good 'ol days Double Dragon and Streets of Rage beatem up style games but with its own unique story line and humor as well as a robust leveling system, weapon upgrades (tiered by lv) and pet boosts.  There is also tons of replayability here and there are secrets all over the map once you have unlocked certain things in the story so the fun is not even close to being done once you beat the story mode.  You can also unlock 20+ characters to play and level up as which also keeps it fun and fresh!The game has been around for quite a while and has had quite the support as well as new stuff added to it over the years.  I originally purchased this on my Xbox 360 when it came out and played it quite a bit.  I re-purchased it on Steam to complete my collection and have had just as much fun if not more fun as I did when it was brand new.If you like beatum up style games with a bit of leveling and weapon progression as well as a funny story, this game is for you.  I recommend it for sure!  Its even more fun with a group of three of your friends as you fight over sharing money while arguing over who should unlock the weapon or pet first and in which order everyone will get it!  Fun times indeed!			"

												The art style is quirky and fun and in a way, beautiful. I like it. The humor of The Behemoth is also something to enjoy, like the pooping owl and the small boss that gets replaced by a bigger boss--not to mention the hilarious unveiling of a certain princess. It took 13 hours for me to complete the game, which is on the longer side. It usually only takes 5 hours (according to what I've seen posted) to complete the game. CC has tons of replayability with so many characters and insane mode, but I'm just not one for doing the same levels over again. All in all, I'd give it 8/10, and say it's worth playing at least once.			"

This game is nice on its own, but play with other players and you will have a blast.It has alot of unlockables (animals, weapons, characters, and pets) which makes the game fun.The campaign is great and filled with humor.You will not regret buying this game.

Intro:I'm not a huge beat 'em up fan, but if I were to play one it'd definitely be Castle Crashers.It takes a common genre and really freshens it up making it a ton of fun to play with a few friends with a good amount of variation and replay-ability.Gameplay:The basic format of the game is progress to the right and beat stuff up! Each character has their own set of attacks and magic abilities. You level up and can allocate skill points, so there is an RPG element to it. You can decide if you want to make your character a tank, glass cannon, speed demon, or a balanced fighter. On top that, there's an absolute ton of characters, weapons, and pets to unlock. The end result makes a team vary quite a lot from each person.Apart from just smashing enemies up, you'll go through other sequences such as traps or riding on things. There's also a bunch of boss battles that can be pretty fun. It doesn't really get too repetitive because of this.The game has a traditional level format with your common stage selection map. Its been a while since I played this game, but if I remember correctly there were some alternate paths and stages you could access.The gameplay is pretty fun, but much better if you bring along a few friends. It has online co-op so you're good to go.Story, Visuals, & Music:As fun as this game can be, I have little to nothing to say here. I can't remember anything about the story. The music was fitting, but nothing you'll remember. The artstyle is done well, but I'm not a fan of how cartoony it is. Just personal preference.PC Version:No performance issues, perfect controller support, online multiplayer with no lag or desync issues. Great port.Conclusion:Its a pretty fun game and there's a lot to do in it. I haven't really played that much of it, but I've played enough to know its a quality title. Its something I'd go back to if friends were ever wanting to play it.Recommended for anyone who wants a fun co-op beat 'em up. Definitely worth it.			"

												Castle Crashers is a cartoon-style adventure game where four knights go on a quest to stop an evil wizard and return the four princesses. Along the way the knights will face an army of barbarians, travel through a forest infested with theives, crash a wedding, fight off a giant troll from the back of a high-speed carriage, fight a dragon who loves sock puppets, get abducted by aliens, play volleyball on a sand castle roof, fight Medusa on a bad hair day, defeat a necromancer, and save the four princesses. All things considered, it's definitely a great game.			"

												This is a game that although I have only bought on steam recently, I have loved for years. It has a charm about it (most of it) that is just great and even better with friends. My only complaints are 1, the stock controls are a nightmare on keyboard for me, I had to go through and change everything, but after doing that it runs fine and two, the second world, the forest, has waaaaay to much crap for me, but that is personal taste. Overall, fantastic game.			"

												If you have friends to play with this game is outstanding, some of the best fun you'll have. If you don't, then I can't recommend getting it just because the online isn't very good when paired up with random people. One issue I had is latency, it was incredibly laggy when we were playing with four people over the internet, but aside from that it was outstanding.			"

												The art style is quirky and fun and in a way, beautiful. I like it. The humor of The Behemoth is also something to enjoy, like the pooping owl and the small boss that gets replaced by a bigger boss--not to mention the hilarious unveiling of a certain princess. It took 13 hours for me to complete the game, which is on the longer side. It usually only takes 5 hours (according to what I've seen posted) to complete the game. CC has tons of replayability with so many characters and insane mode, but I'm just not one for doing the same levels over again. All in all, I'd give it 8/10, and say it's worth playing at least once.			"

												I've only played this a few hours so far, but I must recommend this to any fans of old school beat 'em up / hack and slash games.  While I haven't seen it bring anything particulary new to the table in my play thus far.  It does deliver a very solid performance for the genre.  Already in my play I have seen little nods to classics like Golden Axe and Battletoads that made me smile.  The art work is colorful and crisp and really pops.  The enemies vary as you go along to mix things up a little bit.  It is also rife with cheezy little humourous moments that will make you chuckle.One other neat thing is that you can find different weapons and pets throughout your play.  So you are not just stuck with the same stuff the whole time.  Also, as you play you level up your character and gain new combos along the way.  So there is some progression to the game play.I really can't find anything negative to say about it thus far, except for maybe the fact that if you want to change pets/weapon you have to go back to your home castle and it can take a moment to navigate the map back to where you were, but it is a minor inconvieniance at most.I picked this game up for DIRT CHEAP during the Summer Sale and it is absolutely worth every penny.  Best beat 'em up I've played on PC since Little Fighter.			"

												Castle Crasher just as funny as Battle block theater!What is it about?-In CC you are a Knight(maybe along with some freinds) in the middle of a war and all the beatiful princesses have been captured, your job is to go around kicking the big bad bosses butts...and win, then make out with the princesses :) (cha ching) :)How do I beat the bosses?-Around the little world you can find shop's and in those shops you can buy better sword's and uprgrade your Charactor-In some shops you can buy pets!What do I need a pet for?-Pets are there to follow you around and buff you up-buffs can range from extra health too pooping out GOLD bar's!My opinion...-This game was very fun too play (I like middevil stuff so you know) I do how ever wish that we had that annoyingly hilarious comentater from battle block theater though but whatever.-I do how ever like the fact that you have a secondary power up.Be sure to Follow Me...and my freinds for more reviews and game play!Have a good one Guy's!

Its fun, easy to understand and diversive, there are so many ways that you can play your character.

												I highly reccomend this game you have red knight whwo has lightning attacks blue knight who has ice attacks green knight who can poison enemies and red knight who can burn people. you can get 27 other unlockable characters uncluding hatty from battleblock theater, a bear, and a skeleton.u can put skill points into agility which increases speed and arrow damage stregnth which increases baasic attack damage defense which decreases the damage you take and magic which allowws u to regenerate mana faster use more mana gain more magic damage and even gain up to 4 neww magic attacks for a total of 5. you can get pets like the cardinal which lets u find hidden items rammy u knocks down enemies and bitey who chomps on enemies heads. one pet u can get is the golden whale who comes whith unlockable character Hatty, the golden wwhaale drops golden blocks worth one dollar. there are many fun bosses like a mechanichal ram, a very fat bat, and even a cat who spits furballs at you. this game has 4 player co-op which is very fun and 3 playable modes. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this games even though i have played only 17 hours i am level 21 as of now and the game is $3.74 on sale and $15 when its not worth the buy either way.			"

												This is one of the most awesome games I've ever played. The graphics are amazing with a unigue design and a great style. This game is really fun to play alone or with friends, and is filled with challenging bosses and enemies. It has loads of playable characters from the derpy villager to the Harcore necromancer, as well as tons of weapons with different buffs and debuffs. It's filled with content, and you can play the game over and over again without getting bored, or jump into insane mode. The level design is on point, and the soundtrack is done very well. There's even a pvp or boardgame option if you're that kind of person.The only things I don't like are the frankly immachure humor, and the part in some levels where you kiss the princess. Other than that, this is an amazing game that is definitely worth the $15. I'd rate 9.5/10. "

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.Pros:+ Local game capability and online coop, up to 4 people.+ A lot of unlockable stuff.+ Diversity between knights.+ Humor across the game.+ Cheap to buy.+ Bosses are puzzly, some of them are very easy to defeat if you find their weak spot.+ A lot of unlockables. Some are really hard to find.Cons:- Becomes repetitive after some time, there are over 30 playable characters that you unlock and the only difference between them is the magic spells. Once you beat the game once you can beat it any time.- Not the type of game you play online, but rather the one you play alone or with friends. Doesn't stop you from playing with strangers though.- Has a lot of grinding involved, the experience system is really bad overall.- Some playable content is pay-to-use DLC, but the items they provide are only worth using for the first 15 levels at most.In short, it's definitely a very good game you should try with friends. You will have a good time but don't expect to spend 2000 hours on it.			"

												Castle Crashers is not a new game to me, In fact I pretty much played it non stop when it was released on the Xbox 360. But I’ve finally got round to playing it on the PC and my love affair has started allover again. Behemoth have a history of shall we say quirky but brilliant games, Alien Hominid and BattleBlock theater are the best known of them. Castle Crashers is no exception to this ether, the age old tail ofKnight rescues Princess is turned into the most ludicrous romp you’ve ever seen. You’ll find yourself retrieving weapons from the mouth of a giant toad, battling a Giant Cat Fish that is more cat than fish and even kissinga clown! Castle Crashers is anything but normal in any sense of the word and that’s its charm. The game its self is a fast paced side scrolling beat em up, much like Streets of Rage and Final Fight but completely different at the same time.  It has RPG elements too with characters being awardedpoints for each level they increase that they can spend on various skills such a magic and speed. Weapons can also be discovered through out the game, but with the exception of a few later ones offer very little advantageexcept cosmetics. The starting line up of four characters can be increased as you progress through various means. Pretty much every character in the game if a similar size to the starting line up will become playable. The story is set in medieval times, with your Knight sent off to rescue four Princess’s from an evil Sorcerer who has stolen the Kings prized emerald. As I’ve said, its not exactly original, its theway its told that’s original. Don’t misunderstand, its not Shakespeare but its extremely funny all the same. You will find yourself travelling through enemy encampments, lava worlds, deserts and even travelling on pirateships and alien spacecraft. Castle Crashers isn’t afraid to be obscure or bizarre and we love it for that. The boss battles are imaginative and just as off the wall as the rest of the game. The first boss sets the tone forthis very well, You enter an arena to be greeted by a giant barbarian only for him to be squashed by an even bigger one! Or there’s the Giant Metal Hand, the Cat Fish, Medusa and the list goes on. Don’t get me wrong, its not going to change the way we game or rewrite the genre. Castle Crashers is the ultimate pick up and play game, you don’t need to have played it before and you don’t needexperience with scrolling beat em ups. You just play it, there’s no better way to explain it, you just do it. I could explain to you how holding this button and pressing this makes your character do that. But it would bepointless, the system just works and works well. Its worth pointing out though that although most characters magic ability’s are the same with different effects. Some characters powers really are different and can changethe way you play. The graphics may not be cutting edge or super realistic, but all the same you’d be hard pressed to find a more stylised example of 2D draw sprites. There fun, colourful and unique, if you’ve playedany of Behemoth’s other offerings you know what to expect.See this and more reviews here http://cyberusuk.com/2015/03/03/castle-crashers-by-behemoth-review-be-a-knight/ "

												The best experince is on consoles with all of the bugs and hacks you will run into here BUT, the game hols up VERY well to other PC ports, infact this company knows how to port things over the right way! Don't get me wrong when I say there are bugs and what not, there where only about 1 or 2 I ran into while playing but I still think it's worth a mention. One last note about the hacks, there are SOOO many ways to hack this game it isn't even funny, jsut a heads up incase any of you don't have a friend and want to hop online with a stranger, he might be a glitched level and start flying around the level buy HEY! This is PC after all :P			"

												So far, one of the best hack'n'slash RPG's I have played. It is fun both single player, and multiplayer. If you can, I would play multiplayer with friends, or even just randoms. If not, then single player is just as good. However, It is lacking that bit of competitive spirit in between you and your teammates. The fighting system is solid, and fair (No PVP stunlocks here folks!) and it can be great fun playing the multiple game modes with others. Also, if you can't play online for whatever reason (Like me 99 percent of the time) but you have friends around that want to play, you can do local multiplayer for all game modes. Even all you can quaff. Ohhhhhhhhhh my thumbs...Overall, I would say to buy this game. It runs on fairly low end computers, and you will probably enjoy your time with this game. Pink knight is the best.			"

												Fun gameplay inspired by classic side scrolling beat em ups. There are a variety of characters to choose from, various weapons with different stats, leveling up and choosing what to focus on, magic, items. It's really fun, especially with a friend. It's got a sense of humor and good game play. Interesting boss battles, and a wide variety of levels. My one and only complaint is a complaint I tend to have with all 2D side scrolling beat em ups, is that it can be hard to tell where to hit. If you're standing slightly in front of the enemy, or behind, you miss, and it can be tough to judge. Maybe I just suck though?			"

												Please play this game with a controller please.Castle Crashers is an honestly silly game involving you, maybe three other friends, and sharp objects with which to stab other things with. Each colored knight has this ability which corralates to its color; in a sort of elemental attack or so.Its a fun and zany stab-em-up game with a penchant for mob-based mechanics which in my opinion, is the best and most fun way to do it. The best feeling is when you throw a dude into a bunch of other dudes.The art style is cute, but its unknown to me if its trying to be funny. I laughed anyway.My only real complaint is its rather easy to ram bosses into a corner and keep right on hitting them, and they can't do a darn thing as they're much too busy recoiling from my hits. Bosses are easy to cheese, is what I'm saying.Play it with friends if you can. I got four USB hookups. Let's do this. The green one is my favorite because poison.9/10			"

												Great fun game for the whole family, or just good 4 player sidecroller to mash enemies with your friends. TONS of unlockable characters, and a relatively easy achievement list to 100% if you are an achievement hunter. The DLC packs are cheap and totally great adding two extra Characters, The Blacksmith and The Pink Knight.Insanity mode after game completion offers a new difficulty to play through increasing the amount of playability and extending the level grinding to a more enjoyable and challenging setting. The artwork is great as well. It is very colorful and family friendly. The Game is playable by all ages (with a few poop and fart jokes in the mix).I also like that with my Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows I am able to hook up more than one controller and allow more than 1 player/controller to be supported by a single USB port and play/level multiple characters at once as my friends can choose my other characters and level along with me.Also available on the Playstation Network and Xbox Market. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Loads of enjoyment, replayability, and good laughs.10/10			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Castle Crashers is a 2D side scrolling hack and slash adventure. Easy to pick up and play, I enjoyed playing this game solo and online with friends (up to 4 players).This game is very well put together and the developers have a knack for 2D side scrolling games. Great humour and art styles with a variety of musical artists creating great music for each level.The Game PlaySimple side scrolling game (works best with a controller)with great combo's and intuitive magic system. Simple levelling system and many different characters you can unlock, items you can find and pets you can make love you.DifficultyThe difficulty is pretty straight forward but not restricting there is a harder difficulty that you can unlock after completion, which can be found on the map after the first boss. Can only be done with same character.Controls & InterfaceGeared towards playing with a controller but not limited, as keyboard can work just as well.I just found it much easier with controller.AchievementsThis game has simple and fun achievements that are relatively easy to get and nothing that you would lose sleep over.StoryYou play a knight out to save the princess's and to defeat a dark evil wizard, on your journey you will encounter many hardships. Be brave young knight.Combat System The combat system is simple and fun revolving around a hack slash method with great combos that are given to you along your journey through levelling up.Magic spells are also learnt in the same way which can sway the battle in your favour.Pet companions can also be found throughout, used to give your character unique perks or advantages in battle that can help on your quest.Got to love RammyLevelingSimple levelling system that lets you place points into four attributes that increase your characters stats.The magic spells, can be quite different per character and all have great uses. Try out different characters to find the spells that suit you. Sounds & EffectsThe music for this game was composed by a variety of different artists and I found some of the music to be great and even downloaded a few of them myself from NewGrounds[www.newgrounds.com]for freeFavourite has to be this one but it isn't listed in the list.GraphicsThe graphics are simplistic but I found them very pleasing and suiting to the game. Cut ScenesI found the cut scenes well thought-out and funny, got to love the ending of the cyclops.Humour & TriviaI loved the humour of this game it is brilliant and suited for all ages and retains the same style throughout.MultiplayerThis game has a fantastic multiplayer that lets you play co operatively with friends either locally or online. Castle Crashers offers a small range of fun multiplayer modes where you can go up against friends in a fighting, feeding frenzy and good old volley ball real man's game.Bugs - ImportantNo bugs or issues were found.ConclusionI loved Castle Crashers and would happily go back to it if my friends asked, overall fun and great entertainment for all ages.Great to play with guests or friends at home.Easy to pick up and play and then just walk away if needed.I would say the only downside to this game is, that lately the online community has dwindled, best to play with friends.I will be keeping a close eye on the developers to see if they have any future releases planned as I really do like their style of games.Hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												The game is fun - especially with friends! So don't think I don't like this game. It's got a hefty amount of clever jokes that aren't too far shoved in your face (like I noticed Ceiling Cat watching me from above in the pet store). But the controls for this game are... to put it gently... relatively poor.It recommends an Xbox controller, but it's a PC game so it should assume the majority of people will play it using a mouse and keyboard. It translates it's controls as though you're using an Xbox controller first off - something that was a really bad sign to me at first - but the real thing that crimps the controls is the fact you have to hold some buttons and tap others to activate this or that action. Your starting spell for instance is simply ""Hold Shift, press Strong-Attack"" while the bolt version of it would be ""Hold Shift, Press Use-Item"". Even then to cast spells in the air you have to use different buttons (Strong-Attack or Use-Item) to decide if you shoot horizontally or downwards which is just feels off (why not just let the movement keys press the direction you want to aim?). The fact that you can't even seperate the Item, magic, and the melee commands makes it bug♥♥♥♥ disorienting. It's a keyboard: It has enough buttons to cover the actions without having to resort to playing Twister with your fingers.That said I can't say I've played it and not had a blast yet. Granted I've only been playing it a couple of days so far. It's by no means an easy game, but it's a fun one.			"

												Played it for many hours at first on Xbox 360 and some time after, at some sale, started to play it again on PC. I can say for sure that Castle Crashers is one of most interesting beat 'em up games I have ever played. Graphics might look like some kind of game for kind but don't be mistaken - kids, teenagers, adults, everyone will have great time playing this game. With so many characters (few at start, many to unlock) to play, so many levels to make, many weapons and secrets to find, you won't be bored after beating once, or twice, or until you will reach max level with every character. You can enjoy it alone, or with friends on 1 PC or over internet. Castle Crashers isn't not only filled with action, but also with humour, and what's better, the one that will for sure make you laught, unless you take everything too serious. Sure, some people will say it get's boring quickly or it's repetitive but if you ask me, I didn't get bored even once in those 50 (at the moment I'm making this review) hours. And I'm sure I will play it at some point again, and again, and again... and again. It's really easy to get addicted to this game.In my opinion, it's worth full price but sure, there are people who might not know what Castle Crashers is, or what kind of people made this game. If you are fan of beat 'em up games, then you must grab it at sale. Look at the number of reviews this game have received, and look at what number of those are positives ones - there is high chance that another positive review will be coming from you.			"

I suggest using a controller to play though, as the hack n' slash genre is better felt with a controller than a keyboard.			"

												It's Castle Crashers... seriously? Where have you been living the past 5 years if you aren't even remotely aware of this title by now?This game basically has a perfect mix of brawler and RPG elements with optional 4 player co-op. Plenty of secrets to find and gear to collect. Juvenile humor is abound and plentiful. Great soundtrack as well. Brought to you from the artists over at Newgrounds.com.My only  real complaint about the game is that there are way too many characters to unlock and the amount of content is limited... too many clones of characters, not enough diversity, makes the game a bit stale over time. By the third playthrough it gets pretty obnoxious having to repeat the entire game over again instead of just allowing you to select your favorite stages.I wish they would of added more levels or an extra mode that allows you to unlock / level your characters without having to replay the entire story line over again. I mean once or twice is enough... you can't really skip cut scenes either which adds to the annoyance factor. Other than that, it's a great game to play with some friends.			"

												I would most definetly recommend this game to everyone. This game is amazingly addicting and it is super fun to play with friends. This game does have its defects like being 2D or that some of the music is♥♥♥♥♥♥but still I will always love Castle Crashers it holds a really really special place in my heart, lol. It is a difficult game but it has so much to offer. You don't have to do the campaign you can work on trying to get other characters from arena's or find certain weapons and even play a different character. And if you don't like your level then you should do missions in the campaign over again. It has allot to offer, all the boss battles are different and they all contain different things. This game will get on your nerves but eventually you already beat the game.			"

												I am so glad that this game was on sale. Because if it weren't for the sale I wouldn't be able to come across with such an enjoyable game. It has both humor and action in it. Not to mention the awesome combat style. What I observed in this game, however, it tries to put you to a class like ''take this stick, increase your intelligence and be a mage!'' but being a mage is not really powerful in the game. You end up using your ''stick'' in melee combat and go with it. There could be more options if only the game allowed it, such as being an archer if there were more types of bows. But then again these do not change the enjoyment of the game. I do not yet had the time to play it with my friends but I'm sure that it'd be even more fun like it is possible. And you can have cute pets with nice perks!All in all I just cannot stop playing this game. Both for the funny storyline and the great combat style.			"

												Great fun game for the whole family, or just good 4 player sidecroller to mash enemies with your friends. TONS of unlockable characters, and a relatively easy achievement list to 100% if you are an achievement hunter. The DLC packs are cheap and totally great adding two extra Characters, The Blacksmith and The Pink Knight.Insanity mode after game completion offers a new difficulty to play through increasing the amount of playability and extending the level grinding to a more enjoyable and challenging setting. The artwork is great as well. It is very colorful and family friendly. The Game is playable by all ages (with a few poop and fart jokes in the mix).I also like that with my Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows I am able to hook up more than one controller and allow more than 1 player/controller to be supported by a single USB port and play/level multiple characters at once as my friends can choose my other characters and level along with me.Also available on the Playstation Network and Xbox Market. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Loads of enjoyment, replayability, and good laughs.10/10			"

Lets say you've unlocked all characters and beat the game, probably gets boring but then they have insane mode! Insane mode is great, it's super difficult and if you tihnk you're up for the challenge, then go for it!Overall great game and I reccomend you buy this game, even right now since there is a Summer Sale! $3.00 is all it is for hours on end fun!

(Hatty Hattington, Minion.. and more)..If you are looking for a good Local Co-op game, this is it.You can also fight against enemies with people online. (Multiplayer)You can win/get and find gold on maps.Also, there's very much weapons you could use in fight.Its simple when you play on keyboard... you just use: A,D,W,Space and CTRL, and you move on the arrow buttons.This is a very fun game, I recommend it because I played it myself, and I think it is awesome.Castle Crashers, 11 outta 10 (11/10)			"

												An extremely fun side scrolling, beat'em up, co-op rpg.  While it is nothing that  we haven't all seen before,  Castle Crashers executes all aspects of this  type of game perfectly.   Each character, do to color coordination, is easily identifiable.  Unique special abilities help each player  stand apart, as well as weapon choices, secondary items and companions that add passive abilities and stats.There is an rpg aspect that allows each player to upgrade his or her character's stats separately from the rest.  The enemies are well balanced as well as each type possessing its own attacks and abilities.  Almost every level has a boss at the end.Similar to Diablo, you can play back through after completion for a greater challenge.  I recommend having 4 players when you do this; otherwise, the game might begin to feel off balance.The game as a whole offers solid game play, good re-playability, fun co-op and many laughs.  A good buy if you plan on playing with a group of friends.Note: there  is a bit of lag when using the keyboard; the game is built around the game pad.

												This is an amazing game, with good graphics and smooth gameplay. It is extremely fun when playing with multiple people, and you get to fight so many different bosses and so many different enemies that go with them. If looking for a good game to play with your friends this is probably one of the best games for that. Even if you don't have anyone to play with, it is still a great singleplayer game, and an absolutely fun one at that. Overall, I would recommend getting this game.			"

												Great and fun game to play with friends in co-op mode, though there are sometimes connection issues that cause some major lag. Would've really liked to see better controller mapping as a Steam PC game even though the game was originally an Xbox game.			"

												Castle Crashers is so good, that I bought it twice. once on the xbox and once on steam. It's a great 2D  sidescrolling action and has a lot of replay value. It's fun alone, but is' amazing with friends. Hard to believe that the game came out more than 4 years ago, it still plays well. It's a really enjoyable experience and everyone should play it.			"

												If you don't own this game... BUY IT. Literally one of my favorite games ever, and it's pretty simplistic. Story and playability are through the roof and there's always a way to have a good time with friends. Infinite replay value too. The game is simpl fantastic, with a great soundtrack, a fantastic narrative wityh few words, and of course hilarious fun. What's better than beating up a giant corn omn the cobb? Nothing. Except maybe a sock puppet dragon. Which is also in the game.			"

												If you arent already absolutely sick of side scrollers, then this game is absolutely worth your time. Completed this game on console, tried it on the PC, Equally good on both! The RPG elements of the game will really appeal to you if that is your usual style of play, the crazy cartoon world that Behemoth have created is very pleasing to the eye and the specific niche of humour they bring to the game makes it very enjoyable to play and the fact it doesnt take itself too seriously is refreshing.Great to play with your mates, start to finish its always changing so keeps it fun. Satisfyingly you get oppurtunities to crush your friends in combat so if you buy it first you can thrash them in these small arena battles, very fun. Overall 9/10			"

												As far as mindless, comical, side-scrolling couch co-op games go, this just might be the king. Sit back with up to 3 of your friends, grab some X-input controllers, and get ready for sore thumbs. That pretty much sums this little nugget up. Also comes with a neat little character progression system and some very satisfying attack combos.			"

The game is simpl fantastic, with a great soundtrack, a fantastic narrative wityh few words, and of course hilarious fun. What's better than beating up a giant corn omn the cobb? Nothing. Except maybe a sock puppet dragon. Which is also in the game.			"

												Don't be fooled by it saying I've barely played this, I've clocked innumerable hours on the Xbox 360 version.Probably one of the most fun multiplayer co-op games ever created, filled with magnificent tongue-in-cheek humor that pokes fun at the whole hack and slash genre, Castle Crashers is totally worth the buy (so much I bought it twice!)  If you're thinking ""but it looks so cheesy"" then you need to find someone that has it, and play it for 15 minutes.  I guarantee you'll be wanting it in your collection as well after that.Tons of replayability, with a gajillion easter eggs to find and a diverse collection of characters to pick from, it's pretty easy to want to jump right in again from the beginning seconds after finishing off the final boss.But you don't have to take my word for it!

												I wil surely recommend this for person who's looking for a game with sick♥♥♥♥♥humor, good Co-Op and standard arcade.I will say as a big Behemoth fan that this is as all of their other games, completely funny humoristic and crazy. This is the arcade game that every guy searching for some new things should try.I want to say gameplay basics are nearly complete, you can find some small bugs but nothing big, it's smooth and you can surely tell, that the designers have spent hours on this.Gameplay through can maybe sometimes be a little too simple as you can just smash your keyboard to the table and kill enemys, but at least they have made it nearly impossible just too boost each other because of you need to kill the enemys, and as longer into you go the monsters getting much harder to kill, so you cant just let a lvl 1 guy into a high level area.I do also really like their way of humour through characters you can play as since you can get some really funny and quite suspicious crazy homour like a knight that casts rainbows, and shoots penguins as spells i find the characters really fullfilled, through the lvling process could be a little more creative since it gets a little long in the end.Storyline is complety sick♥♥♥♥♥fun homour, as always as in a standard adventure game you need to rescue the princess, but in difference for many other games they have found a way to make it more funny, like the bosses are not just simple but also a funny sarcastic, like a cat-shark it's quite funny since cats dont like water.

												A classic from The Behemoth that is just so good, people defecate before you character can even swing his/her weapon. Another non biased review despite my enjoyment of The Behemoth game. I re-bought this game after I completed it on my Ps3 and it was just as good... with the exception of volleyball replacing that horrid button-masher ""All You Can Queef(af)"" not included on the Steam version. The gameplay is sort of rough around the edges but is still a pretty good contribution to the beat-em-up genre. The game is also 4-player co-op fun that could be played on one computer/system or online (something that is lacking in the game community now a days pertaining to local co-op). It's a pretty fun game and it's only flaws are the occasional bugs and some online issues. It's an indie game on top of the second game this company has pushed out so don't get all in your feelings if you lag out of a game. It's really good quality for a game that came out in 2008 and sort-of remastered in 2010. CC is also very addicting because if your like me and want to unlock all the characters then your going to have to playthrough like no other game. You may be sick of repeating the game on top of playing the newly unlock insane mode for even more characters but it will be worth it in the end (maybe not). CC is an all around fun game brought to you by Newgrounds and I'd just wish the son from Dad n' Me and the troll were characters.  An all around good time with your friends and an awesome indie expirience. This game is 9.99/10 (Those bugs can get annoying). *On a side note you should also check out BattleBlock Theater (Steam Version of course) and Alien Hominid (On Console Only)*			"

												This game is so much fun. I highly recomend anyone who likes games where you get to wail on anything in sight. it's amazingly fun, the levels are cool and the bosses are too. sometimes things can get tedious, but that's when you get your friends in your game to help you out through those parts! after the game there are so many things to do, you can go around and do a bunch of stuff like try to unlock all the weapons in the game, and go and try to unlock all the characters, and there's even a special ""Insane Mode"" which i haven't tried yet but I would have to guess it's a RIDICULOUSLY harder version of the game, and if so would recomend getting a band of friends to get together and play it. In conclusion this is an amazing game and everyone needs it in their Steam Library			"

												From my experience playing as Green -> Gray, I can tell this game is all the types of awesome combined into one legendary package with sandwiches and knights.So we have our basic Knights, Red Knight aka Darth Sidious. We have Blue Knight aka Phantom Blood Dio, Green Knight or Diarrhea Knight and Orange Knight.You can choose these 4 knights at the start of the game and by completing the game with a certain knight, Beating a certain level to get Gray Knight or the Alien Hominid, or by spending a few minutes in the Arena.I won't get too into the story but the knights party in the barracks behind/underneath the Throne Room, A gray knight gets dead and gets thrown into the party, Everyone stops and gets triggered, Kills some Barbarians and then the princesses get captured...All 4 of them...If you're playing with friends, When you get to saving the Orange Princess and it starts to be a duel for her hand, Let him win. Just...Let him win. Trust me, You'll thank me soon.The Game features 3 Modes. Story Mode (Castle Crashers) and 2 Minigames, Arena and Back-Off Barbarian, Which can be a bit confusing for new players but with a bit of practice, It's easy.Obviously, You can play the modes alone like the lil' basement-dwelling troll you are OR with the friends you have, Mr. Popular.The Animal Orbs are like unlockable passive perks that you can only have one of them. You can buy them or find them.The Weapons you can get can change the stats you have. For Example, The starting weapon Stoveface the Black Knight you can unlock by beating the game with Gray starts with a Gladiator Sword which gives some Attack and Defence but reduces Magic Attacks and has a chance to do a Critical Hit (In my experience of TF2, Is a bad thing for them and a good thing for you.)The Bosses are well done and challening as with the enemies...Except for the Fire Demon, It's evil.Everytime you Level Up, You get 2 skillpoints until 30+ or so where you get only 1. Which is pretty amazing since a 2D-Hack and Slash Beat 'em Up has RPG elements in it too.You can replay it many times you want, There will always be a new playstyle and character waiting for you until you unlock all the elementals.The DLCs (Both Blacksmith and Pink Knight.) Adds 2 more elemental magic and 10 more weapons, So if you're bored, You can always spend a couple of bucks or two.Thats it for the Pros, Let me get to the Cons.It takes too much time to unlock every single thing but none of use here are Completionists anyway, Right?And some bosses require grinding to level up so Speedrunning will be tough.PS : Stoveface-senpai is bae.

												An awesome game. Love it. Though at times it can be stupid, though it may make others laugh. The gameplay is pretty much just button mashing, plenty of things to do in the game, includes 3 different modes like All you can Quaff, the story mode, and an arena mode. There are pets and weapons you can find and keep. The game has nice music, especially the beginning. You can also play with several other people so you can have a great time with your friends and family.Overall, I would give it a 9.5/10.			"

But it's worth replaying it with different characters.At 12€ it's a bit expensive but worth it, if it's below that price, don't even think twice.			"

												This game mixes crude humor, hack n' slash, and co-op into and great game that has a very fun and compelling storyline. Although the story is short, it makes you beg for more. Leveling in the game is not difficult at all, making the gameplay very enjoyable and not stale. No matter single or co-op it's scaled to be challenging but not impossible to beat. Something that bugs me alot personally is that collecting all the animal orb, weapons and heroes can get tedious at time. Definately recommend getting the game if you're planning on having multiple friends buy the game. One of the best co-op games out there today.			"

The game will have you playing for a good time from trying to unlock all the characters,getting all the achivments and getting all the weapons/animal orbs. The bosses range from fun to easy to AWESOME. This game is not perfect however as it gets repetitive and a little easy after a while and most enemys you can juggle in the air with the A and W keys (X and Y buttons for the controler) and in the game's extra mode it becomes too hard as most enemys can 1-3 hit you.

												Great gameplay and really addicting: couldn't put it down when I played with friends. Really funny too. However, lots of farming involved. More than you might expect from a side-scrolling beat-em-up. If you care about achievements, getting every animal orb is nearly impossible, because two are only for sale for 5,500 gold each, which is a ton in this game. Also, getting the achievements for winning 20 online all you can quaff matches (mash buttons to eat food really fast: pretty boring minigame) and 40 online arena deathmatches is hard because it's really tough to find a match. Way better playing with others because if you die other people can revive you: if you die solo, you restart the level, and this game is much harder solo than with friends.tl;dr: 9/10 with friends, 7/10 solo			"

												Castle Crashers is definitely an amazing game, and already an all-time favorite. The beauty with Castle Crashers is that while it is very simple when compared to other games, it is still awesome. The story is simple, bad dudes are taking princesses, rescue them. You just hack and slash everything in your way, while unlocking cool weapons, pets, and characters. The game also has some RPG elements to add some depth to it. Playing by yourself is fun, but when you play with others it is a great adventure. I highly recommend getting this game. I bought it for $4 Canadian, but I think that it is still worth $16.99 ($15 US I think). The game is something that you will never forget.			"

The game was ported from xbox onto pc and the company that was put in charge of  it did not bother to change the display buttons.

												This game is awesome! It has a great sense of humor, though things are still epic and serious. There are many characters to unlock which is always a good thing, and the pets are adorable (well, some of them, anyway o.o). The only cons is that it can, in fact, get boring after a while, but the fun can last forever if you're playing with a good friend. Talking about friends, the Online Multiplayer in this is pretty bad, not gonna lie. But I'll admit that that's because of some people's internet (not everyone's internet can be as fast as mine~).Overall, this game has many pros and very little cons, so I really recommend it. And to make it better, its 4 players! To me, that's perfect (not too less, not too many; though I do think they could of squeezed a fifth player in there.).			"

Though once you finish it, you'll probably not play it again. Recommended if you have some friends to play the game with.			"

												This is a fantastic 4 player smash em' up game!  Reminds me of the old arcade days.  It was awesome that it was on sale during the holidays, it felt like I stole the game it was so cheap and offers so much fun!!!It reminds me of the graphics of many an android arcade style game with the play mechanics and depth of say the Dungeons and Dragons (or for that matter any other) 4 player co-op Capcom arcade games as well as many others from my childhood.  So you could say this is a big hit just on a nostalgic level.			"

												Castle Crashers is exactly what a 2D Beat Em Up should be. It's got good combat gameplay, excellent visuals, a fantastic variety of multiplayer modes, allows up to four players to play the game, great humor, plenty of levels, and a number of playable characters.The game is cartoonish-styled, so expect a lot of over the top humor. Some of it is some mild black comedy, and there is some degree of blood and violence, comparable to TF2, but is slightly more mild.The game has you in a (mostly) medieval setting, with the initial playable characters being four royal knights. There isn't much of a story outside of an evil wizard uniting several other kingdoms to attack yours for some kind of Magic Crystal (that the wizard directly steals) and claim the four princesses for varying reasons (only one is actually known to be held for forced marriage). Honestly though, in a silly beat em up that's as colorful and full of life as this one, it doesn't exactly need a big driving story. It just needs an atmosphere and charm to put on top of it's fun gameplay. And that's exactly what it has. The gameplay is action-packed, wave of enemies after enemies show up constantly as you move forwardi n each level. You learn more attacks and abilities as you level up, and you can also combo enemies through various means, but the main means behind doing that is to jump and knock them into the air, where you can stay airborn for a while by striking your trapped enemies in the air repeatedly. You can use this kind of tactic to trap multiple enemise at once.Of course, not everyone is going to enjoy the genre, so for those that do, the only real downside to this game is that it's gameplay can get repetitive. Sure you learn more moves after a while, and enemies and levels definitely change up, but the core gameplay stays the same, and when the action is so constant, it might get tiring for some pretty quickly. All the more reason to take breaks from the game though, right?Also, there are a HUGE amount of characters to unlock. It can be tedious (some methods are particularly complicated, requiring that you beat story mode all over again with one new character just to unlock another one) so that's one thing about this game I kinda dislike. Not personally, but I can definitely see why other people wouldn't find value in it. If you enjoy the game enough though, you might just see it as replay value instead, especially if you're planning to bring some friends along. And while playing through the main story in singleplayer is definitely enjoyable, this game is most definitely more fun when you're playing with friends. "

I (of course) unlocked/got Hatty Hattington, since I own BattleBlock Theater as well, and I have to say, I would never stop playing as Hattington.You don't just play Castle Crashers.

												Castle Crashers is a game that brings back the fun and excitement of all the flash games that we used to play online. Its hack n' slash gameplay is very well made and gets addictive rapidly. The art style is cartoony and really adds in a sense of humor that just makes the game that much more fun. Along with the vast assortment of weapons and adorable animal companions that can be found throughout the game, there is also an online matchmaking mode that adds a significant amount of replay value. If desired, strangers and friends can fight alongside you and help you complete the main story. Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game. If you want to be generous, consider buying the 4 pack so you and your friends can complete the main story together. This is definitely worth playing.			"

												8.5/10A very fun hack and slash from Tom Fulp, creator of Newgrounds. One of the best hack and slash games around with a wonderful art style, a great sound track, and tons of unlockables. The replay value is through the roof as you'll constantly be telling yourself ""ok, just one more game"". There are 2 pieces of DLC for $.99 each that are unnecessary to the game play unless you are a completeist and want everything just for the sake of having it. The money from the DLC does go 100% to charity so there is that but, I wouldn't bother unless playing a pink character or having horns is incredibly important to you.The game is cheap as it is, especially considering the many hours of play time you'll potentially get out of it but, as with anything that's been on Steam for any significant length of time, I would add it to my wishlist and wait for a decent sale. And like I said, don't feel pressured into buying the DLC as it doesn't add anything of great value to the game (i.e., levels, more story etc.). It's mostly cosmetic with a few weapons that won't make the game any more or less easy for you as you won't be able to use them until you hit the appropriate levels anyways.			"

You can use a Xbox controller, witch really makes the game more exiting. There is a lot of playable characters to unlock, there is also a lot of collectibles, such as weapons and sidekicks. You can only complete the game by replaying it more times and it is totally woth it. You will spend a lot of fun hours playing this game.

												Castle Crashers is a competitive co-op beat-em-up by the minds behind Alien Hominid. You and three friends travel throughout the kingdom ruining lives and crashing castles on your stubborn quest to save the princesses. There are tons of landscapes to traverse, weapons and characters to unlock, and princesses to kiss. You can even gain experience and level up your chosen knight. This has to be the best beat-em-up I've played in a long time, even coming close to beating Scott Pilgrim as my favorite. A great time alone, and even better with friends, Castle Crashers isn't getting outta here without a recommendation.			"

												Absolutely designed to be played with a controller.  Before purchasing, make sure you have some sort of controller support.  Also I will say that this game is best played with friends or online.  Although I have played it a ton without anyone else, so it is possible.Beyond that, it is a great game.  First played this game on the Xbox 360 and remembered how much fun I had so when I saw it again on Steam, I knew I had to buy it.  Every area in the game is repetitive, but they make up for this by adding in tons of different weapons and animal orbs to collect.  This adds some desire to replay the game multiple times in order to either experience everything or simply do a bit of collecting (took me until my second playthrough to find the dang boomerang).  You start out being able to choose from four different characters, but just like the weapons and animal orbs, there are many other characters to unlock as you play through the game.  Some require you to beat the game with certain characters, and some simply require you to do certain things or progress to certain parts of the game.All of this combined adds replayablility to the game and definately makes this purchase worth every penny.

												It reminds me of the classic arcade games we used to play with my friends back in the day as Knights of the Round, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The Punisher, Double Dragon, Dungeons & Dragons, Metal Slug etc. The gameplay is similar, the feeling while you playing is similar. Colourful, cartoonish environment, interesting and funny combos, weapons, enemies, bosses, power ups and mini games and many hours of fun with your mates. All these with 2,99 € only! I love this game and you will love it too no matter what!!!! :D			"

												Before I reveiw this game i'd like to give some backround as how I came across this gem I first heard of this game when a well known youtube channel called ""Game Grumps"" started playing it on there show steam train and I fell in love with this game and I knew I had to get it so I decided to get this game along with a few extra copies for a few of my friends and this game is an absolute blast Castle Crashers was originally realesed in 2008 later getting a steam port in 2012 Castle crashers is a 2-D beat-em up with some Rpg elements thrown in such as leveling up stats yet what sets this game apart from the standered beat-em up is 3 things the art style the music and its amazing humor the art style is very simplistic and colorful and it fits perfectly with the games over the top humor the music is truly something to behold an interesting thing is that the games music was made by people submitting there music creations on the flash site Newgrounds and lets just say it did not dissapoint the music seems to fit in so well with every situation in the game my personal favorite peice being Simple Sight by ""Real Fraction"" or the music when you fight the necromancer it really gets you pumped for a fight the games online is nearly flawless yet I wish the game would make it so it would make so the other players that join you would be the same or close to the same level as you  but thats just a minor nitpick i'd say that castle crashers has become one of my biggest gaming guilty pleasures and is well worth a second playthrough the game has great replay value and playing through the entire game from start to finish with one of my best friends is an expeirence I shall not forget I think that Castle crashers is a instant classic and deserves to be as popular as it is I highly recommend it			"

												Castle Crashers has always been one of the greatest games I've held dear to me for so many years. It's easy to pick up and play, and with quirky characters and unforgettable bosses you can't help but come back for more. Playing with friends makes the experience all the more fun. The music is amazing and easily immersable with the game.  I recommend to those looking for a time-killing game with some humor added to the mix. It gets a 10/10 from me. (:			"

												The game with the weirdest animations I've ever played.  Diarrhea deers, what?  And that ending.  It's a great game to play with friends and easy to get too.  The game goes on sale often enough for $4 or sometimes even $2 and there's a 4 pack bundle.  I think the only downside is that there's not much left to do after beating the final stage.  At that point, you've seen everything there is to see in the game.  If people are still wanting to play, they end up grinding to raise their levels.			"

You just button mash and beat the living hell out of enemies. The graphics are great and the game runs real smooth on my computer. The only I don't like about this game is the multiplayer. I can't find a single match to play online or it doesn't work correctly. For example if I want to play an Arena match with my friends it won't work correctly, it will put the person who made the match into the Arena but everyone else will be put into the beginning of the campaign. Other than the multiplayer this game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it.			"

And I hate it when people say ""this online community is dead"" yet when I open up a public lobby it becomes full in a matter of seconds, and yes you can button mash through the game, but that doesn't take away from the fun! I mean.. comeon who doesn't like the usual fairy tail; save the princess{s} and defeat the evil wizard plot/scenario. (there isn't a ""story"" but you can follow along the actions of the characters, for example the princesses are being dragged away, stuff like that) I also have one more complaint: Sometimes in a lobby with my friends, and in game the game will just freeze up and that is a problem for me seeing as my computer has an i7 4th gen processor and a 690 in it.  I'm positive it isn't my internet because it doesn't happen on other games! It always fixes though, it isn't gamebreaking at all. Another thing, some reviews might say you NEED a controller for the game but that isn't true at all! None of my friends, including myself, don't use our XBOX360 controllers in the game. Yes, the game is a completely unchanged port from the XBOX360, but I mean comeon why does it matter if it says ""press x or y to attack"" etc., you can litterally press ESC and go into the controls, click keyboard and mouse, and change (or leave) the controls to your liking. What is keeping me into the game is the characters, pets, and weapons. You can unlock 31 characters, 79 unlockable weapons, and 27 pets that you can unlock. Each new character has a new design, a new magic, and sometimes a new weapon. Weapons are abundant throughout the game, whether you buy them, dig them up, have pets find them, or kill enemies. They also have buffs and debuffs depending on the weapon; for example it might raise your strength and magic but minus your defense. They also have ""special abilities"" which can do a multitude of things; shock your enemies, set fire to your enemies, increase critical hits on your enemies, etc. Now onto pets; Pets are REALLY cool, just like weapons they can buff you, or debuff you. They also have special abilities, such as; finding buried treasure, defeating enemies at low health, bringing you food, etc. etc. That's about all I have to say about this AMAZING game. I totally recommend that you buy Castle Crashers! I now leave you with the best sidescrolling beatem up to date! BYEEEEE			"

												I really liked this game for many reasons. I like to farm on my own but have fun with my friends, so this game was perfect for me. I liked that you had unlockable abilities that you could get from leveling up. I also liked that the plot was relatively straight forward but if you looked closely at the levels, there was a lot of humor hidden. I also enjoy the challenge of getting some of the achievements. The only thing I don't like about this game was that it was very difficult to figure out where you were (depth perception).			"

												Game is very good, played it back when it was first released on xbox360 days, and also, it runs very well with no lag, don't know why people with the negative reviews are complaining, but the online multiplayer does take a while to connect with someone, and even when it does, it cuts out, probably internet connection, but do play with a controller instead of using a keyboard for castle crashers. Also there are some bugs to the game, but it's barely noticable to see it anyways.Ps- This is my very first review to do.			"

												It could just be that I picked up this game early on so my childhood memories are clouding my judgement, but I greatly suggest you get this game. Its cartoony graphic style is clean and sustained throughout. As a game, it doesn't take itself too seriously and is more a comedic game than anything. Controls are simple and responsive. Tons of characters and an online mode (even though nobody uses it). This game is just great! Don't have cash? Not to worry as its most likely going to be on sale in a couple days! And I mean a couple days from the time you read this, not the time of this being posted. It goes on sale like every other sale rotation.			"

Even more fun multiplayer, wether you play locally, on one machine, or online.. Okay, the latter maybe not that much heh.

												I had never actually heard of Castle Crashers until one night at a friends house where he introduced it to me on his Xbox 360.  Castle Crashers was also one of the first Indie games I had ever played, before I actually knew about Indie games, so I was really confused as to how such an awesome game had not been on my radar.  Not only did Castle Crashers introduce me to the magic that is Indie games, but it also gave me so much entertainment with its funny, and yet at times intense gameplay.  The Beat'Em Up/Action game not only offers excellent gameplay for a single player experience, but Castle Crashers truly shines due to its amazing Local Co-op.  The amount of laughs and entertainment my friends and I received from sitting on the couch together playing Castle Crashers is just to high, and are a few of the reasons why I love this game so much.  With refreshing animations and art style, classic gameplay and a mix of comedy, you end up with a game that is not only fantastic, but quite possibly one of the most entertaining Co-op games I have ever played.  In Castle Crashers, you assume the role of a knight who will be searching the land for the kidnapped princesses.  Starting off, there are a few knights at first to choose from, but as you progress through the game you can unlock many more.  Each character has four stats, attack, defense, magic, and speed, that you will upgrade as you level up throughout the game.  The most characterizing feature of each character, other than their appearance, is their spells.  If you choose to level up the magic stat, every few levels will grant you a new spell to use.  This alone will give a lot of replay value for the simple fact that each of the spells are unique and have different effects in battle. The stats make for a lot of customization when leveling up your character, as you can choose to be a tank, mage, melee damage, or a combination of multiple stats.   Throughout the campaign, you will face several different enemies, that will become tougher as you advance, as well as some very memorable boss battles.  The plot of the story is a simple one, but in Castle Crashers, gameplay and fun is heavily favored to a intriguing story.  Fighting tons of enemies in a classic Side-Scroller Beat'em Up be it alone or with friends, provides a lot of fun, as well as a lot of replay value.  The combination of addictive gameplay and multiple unique characters, make for numerous playthroughs without ever feeling bored.  I truly cannot recommend this game enough, especially due to Local Co-op.  My playtime on Steam does not show even a quarter of my actual playtime, as I spent majority of the time playing on Xbox 360 with several friends as once a week we would get together after going out for dinner and then play Castle Crashers for a few hours.  If you have a few friends who are looking for a great Co-op experience, then look no further.  Pick up a four pack of Castle Crashers and get ready to be heavily entertained for a while as you and your friends play through this absolute gem of a game.			"

												Great gameplay and really addicting: couldn't put it down when I played with friends. Really funny too. However, lots of farming involved. More than you might expect from a side-scrolling beat-em-up. If you care about achievements, getting every animal orb is nearly impossible, because two are only for sale for 5,500 gold each, which is a ton in this game. Also, getting the achievements for winning 20 online all you can quaff matches (mash buttons to eat food really fast: pretty boring minigame) and 40 online arena deathmatches is hard because it's really tough to find a match. Way better playing with others because if you die other people can revive you: if you die solo, you restart the level, and this game is much harder solo than with friends.tl;dr: 9/10 with friends, 7/10 solo			"

												After a short burst of playtime, this game just brought me the memories of playing golden axe back in the time.There are things that I don't like but the as a whole, this game is just awesome. Play it with friends. Behead enemies. Run away from terrifying creatures on the back of a deer. Slam your axe on your friend's face and get the kiss from the princess. All in the name of good fun.The game is easy to learn, control and play. It's hilarious and you'll be laughing a good part of the game.There is an issue though. Although the game is easy to control with the keyboard it should be more specific to the people who are playing it for the first time.The game will tell you what you need to do in certain occasions but it will do it with the controller buttons signs.If you don't know what the LT or Y o B are in your keyboard shortcuts then you might end up a bit frustrated and failing in something important... like reviving someone. The game should give you the hint with the key you choose, I don't think it would be that hard.If you have a controller, use it. You will save yourself some disapointments, at least until you know where everything is because after that you will do things automatically  Other than that, thumbs up and, in the end, stick your axe in your friend's face.(If you can get the 4-pack and spread the love... with your axe)  "

												Fun and addicting 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up antics with tiny magical knights. Tons of unlockables. Visual style is cute and appealing and full of jokes and references. Played it till my fingers hurt. Meant to be played multiplayer but I had a blast just playing solo.Controller highly recommended.			"

												Great Game, Cute graphics, nice gameplay although theres not much replayability after going through the game twice. The kind of game you want to play with 3 friends on the couch. Love the fantasy medeival theme and the animations. Artwork is exemplary. Nice loot system, not the best but nice, Lots of costumes, pets, charachter progressions is okay could be better. Overal some simple RPG elements that work well with the comic style. Enemies are widely varied and fun to fight. Bosses are INCREDIBLELove the catfish.  Overall well worth $5-10 if your going to be playing with friends. Solo gets lonely			"

												I am an animator that started from Newgrounds and this game was made by the fellow animators from Newgrounds.Of course I have to get the game and I can't believe it was ridiciously cheap during sales. +1 points from there, the gameplay was fun too although it can get pretty stale and grindy when you are playing it alone. It's a fun game to play when you have friends to play with otherwise, it's a so-so game.Anyway, still good 8/10			"

It's funny and has many different characterss, areas, weapons, pets, etc. There's a lot to it.  But where it really shiens is multiplayer. Playing this game with 1-3 friends is absolutely hilarious, and can provide some great times. Castle crashers is great, and is totally replayable. Definitely should be grabbed if you have any interest in funny beat em ups or funn multiplayer games.			"

												This game is a great beat-em-up with or without friends. The game tells a hilarious silent story and any of the characters can be built to have a different playstyles.I suggest playing with a controller as the pc controls are a bit iffy. Also I don't know if it is just me but at times I have trouble hitting enemies due to depth perceptionThe DLC is not worth it in my opinion unless you like the look of the new characters, these characters are average mechanically speaking compared to the others in game.

												This game is really fun to play especially if you are playing with friends. The Story mode is great and fun,Have not tried Arena or Quaff because there is not enough players to play with.The problem that this game has is the preset controls. The game was ported from xbox onto pc and the company that was put in charge of  it did not bother to change the display buttons. It's not a major problem but when you are first starting out you'll have to take sometime to figure out what botton is what if you are using a keyboard if you are using a controll great you have no problem.

												Probably one of the best local coops I have played for a while. To be honest I don't know if this game would be so much fun to play alone, but I still would give it a shot if you cannot get anyone to play with you. PvP was pretty (or completely) dead, but I wouldn't buy this game because of PvP anyway. To me, this game was all about PvE. I made a short list below to point out some things why I would recommend to buy this game:- Smooth gameplay. Controls answer well and didn't see any bugs/crashes.- Variety of different characters.- Boss fights which might actually take a moment to realize how their mechanics work, but stil pretty easily beatable.- Funny graphics.- Leveling your character.- Replay value comes with harder difficulty and different characters.

												A great game. Really simple to learn but still challenging. This game was made by the same company that made Battleblock theatre so you are in for a really well made and funny treat. If you own both games you actually get a special char pet and weapon here.Really fun to play in coop, online or lan. I actually play it in lan coop. 1 person using 360 controller and myself on the keyboard (pc gamer lol) (both feel really fluid). No late reaction, button, portability, or any problems really. Its actually just as smooth on the keyboard and mouse as it is on the controller. The whole concept is simple, yet it is deep and character progression is really well reflected on each level. Char variety is also really awesome, powers are different and it allows for a legit online experience.Seriously, this game will be fun playing it casually or hardcore, so its a great game to play with non-gamers GFs and gamer friends alike.9/10			"

There is only 1 flaw in my mind. I believe that the final boss is much to long. I think that the battle should stop after the spider stage.			"

Highly recommend to buy it even if it doesn't look very enticing.			"

												I can't say I finished entirely, I even got carried from the beginning by a high level !I could anyway analyse the biggest points of this game :It's very very fun, to be honest we have a good time, we rekt mobs, we die (not that much though). By the way it's also a downside. It's way too easy, we complete the game in one or two days if we play seriously. Moreover, you can complete it only by smashing the attack button, the combos are here but not too useful.To conclude we can say that it's a game to relax, to kick some asses, but you won't find a game with a complex background for example.

												Let me tell you a story.Playing this game with 4 friends on Xbox. We were semi good people so we were trying to give one friend the ""Kiss all the princesses in a multiplayer game"" achievement.  I was the Blue Knight, and had a fairly balanced build between Magic and Damage, with a little bit of health and dex thrown in, and I was using the Bi-Polar Bear animal orb.  The friend getting the achievement was the Orange Knight, and he put every point he earned into magic untill he maxed it out.  No hp or damage or anything.  We had another friend, playing the Fire Demon character and using the Rammy Animal Orb.  Incase you didnt know, rammy will randomly knock people down (I dont remember if it does damage or not).The final boss has just been defeated and now we must fight for the last princess. We planned on letting Orange knight win, but rammy had other plans. The second the fight started Rammy knocked down our Orange knight. I hit him once and because of his build it did more damage than expected and pretty much half healthed him.  I was backing off now, to let him win, but Bi Polar Bear went over and executed Orange knight. He was mad, and I got 15 minuets of straight laughter. 10/10			"

												This game is pretty good..... If you have a controller. The games that this company makes (The Behemoth) were clearly made for console gaming. But anyways the game is almost a button mashing game. Almost, but on a controller it's smoother and makes sense.Now onto the actual gameplay. The graphics are really nice, and the sound with it makes it better. The game is a little cheesy such as almost every animal poops, whether it makes it move or just a bird poop shower. The boss fights are fun and really do make the game challenging. I recommend playing this game with a friend, or just some random person in quick match.Overall I give it a 8.5/10.			"

			Berty reviews Castle Crasher. Here's how the scoring system works. Golden 5- You MUST own this game/game franchise 5= I loved it, 4= I liked it, 3= It was OK 2= It was below average but had its...		

 What's Castle Crashers? Castle Crashers is a 2d platform indie Beat'm Up game. After playing so many hours of this game on the Xbox 360, I was very happy to see this game made it to steam so I could enjoy the whole experience all over again. I would recommend playing this game with a controller though. Pros  Amazing Soundtrack Loads of replay value   You never know where each level will take you, one minutes you'll be fighting each other to kiss a princess the next you'll be running away from a giant troll on a deer that has some bowel problems.  Enemies are unique and fun to fight.  21 boss fights  RPG level up system  Animal Orbs & Weapons to collect.  Rammy is life, Rammy is love.  Insane mode if you're feeling brave  Many moments that make you laugh  Can be played and completed in single player if you prefer but I'd recommend bringing friends for a more enjoyable experience  The ending is one of the funniest I've ever seen and completely random.  The most fun coop game I've ever played.  Lot's of characters to unlock  Max level of 99  ""All you can quaff"" a button mashing mini game where you have to eat your food faster than the other players   An arena game mode, where you compete in a variety of team and free for all game modes, including melee fights, archery fights, treasure hunting and more.  When you eat a sandwhich you become massive and really strong  Lots of different environments to fight in, including a forest, a lava world, the dessert, a snowy mountain, a swamp and many more.  The price! £10 is a steal!   Did I mention you ride a deer that has bowel problems?! I mean, you should buy it just for that.  Cons   None  Final VerdictSo is this game worth it?  I feel like this is a rather unique game, at least from every game I've personally played and  I've never played something like this, a game where one minute you're fighting ninja pirates and the next you're playing a friendly game of volley ball. Each level felt exciting and new, the bosses were fun, the enemies were unique to each area, the game has a way to make you laugh at the silliest of things. The replay value is incredible, the soundtrack is amazing, the memoires you'll make from the game will stick with you, you'll have so much fun with your friends and you can get all of it for just £10! This game is worth every bit of money you'll spend on it and then some. So grab your friends, kill some barbarians and fight each other for a princess! 5/5	 "

												This game should be a must on everyone's Wishlist, it's that good. This game is great if your really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and you want to releash your rage. You just button mash and beat the living hell out of enemies. The graphics are great and the game runs real smooth on my computer. The only I don't like about this game is the multiplayer. I can't find a single match to play online or it doesn't work correctly. For example if I want to play an Arena match with my friends it won't work correctly, it will put the person who made the match into the Arena but everyone else will be put into the beginning of the campaign. Other than the multiplayer this game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it.			"

												I think this game is fun and is exactly what you expect it too be. Personally i could not sit and play it for a long time as yes it is repetetive but it is simple. You do not have to be an expert to complete this game just have patience. I would personally recremend a control to play as i have used both controller and keyboard and the controler is much easier to use, plus all of the game controls are in xbox controler language. This game is even more fun if you manage to gather 4 people and it doesn't recuire a gaming pc and has a short download time. I can say i completely enjoyed my time playing this game and have no clue how people got to lvl 100(like how keen do you have to be?)			"

												I /think/ this game is great, but the XBOX 360 on-screen control listings are so.. irritating.. that I can't really stand to play it for very long :) Can we get some button-icons that actually reflect the bound key??Additionally, the ""button-mashing"" mini-games are /very/ unfriendly to laptop keys :> I'd rather see something Guitar Hero/quick-time-event-ish, with timed button presses, instead of the person who doesn't care about murdering their laptop/controller buttons winning ;)Other than that, everything felt pretty solid, from the little I played :> I just can't keep a running memory of what keys I've got bound to what when ""PRESS A!!!"" pops up during gameplay, and my ""A"" button (which isn't colored at all!) makes me walk left, bahaha ;)			"

												Really fun game that you can get for pretty cheap during sales. I'll try to make this review short and sweet.PROS:-Lots of characters that are somewhat different from one another.-High replay value.-Nice soundtrack.-Awesome gameplay from a pretty rare game style nowadays(beat em' up).-Really great art style that didn't age.-Almost no DLC which means that you get the FULL game without having to buy any extras(there are only two dlc that are characters/weapons and you don't need them at all to enjoy the game 100%).-Lots of fun to play PVP with some friends.-Nice combat system.CON:-Pretty short story.Even though it's best played with some friends, it's still an excellent game to play by yourself. If you're a fan of beat em' ups or you've never experienced that type of game, I suggest you to wait for a sale, grab some friends and a controller and enjoy.Side note: After you beat the game, you can play on a higher difficulty (much like ratchet and clank) which gives the game more replay value.

												Multiplayer on this game is dead, have never found a single match on, and nobody has ever joined a a match i have created, does not feature a drop in multiplayer so if you cannot player a level or 2 while waiting for others to join which is why it is dead.Playing with friends was impossible for me, while trying to play with a friend it kept pausing the game for roughly 5-10 seconds saying ""Waiting for players"" then 3 seconds later it would do it again over and over.Singleplayer is a bit challenging at times, you can tell this game was built around 4 people playing and does not scale difficulty what so ever so a lot of rage sections, if you don't mind a singleplayer game and raging now and then it is a fun game, a lot of humour in it.

												Castle crashers is a game best played with 4 players with all of them using xbox 360 remotes. It's hard [and sad] to play this game by yourself. Worst part is i have to use the keyboard. YES GAME I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO USE A 360 REMOTE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE ADAPTER. Fun game, great beat-em-up, but without friends and stuck to using the keyboard is just awful. I recommend this game to people with friends and an xbox 360 controller adapter.			"

												Castle Crashers is a good game but not without it's flaws. The base game is short and easy to complete, and their isn't alot of replayability. Sure you can repeat the same campaign over and over again if you want to unlock all the characters, but that is repetative and boring. If your going to play this game, you need friends. The Co-op is what really gives this game its stride. Rushing through waves of enemies and fighting over who levels up the fastest is the best way to play. The online co-op does have one major issue though. LAG. If even one of your friends doesn't have the best internet connection, the entire game will stop and reconnect everyone. When you are connected, the frame rate really tanks. However, their is alot of good about this game too. You can play insane mode, were your objective changes from out-leveling your friends to survivng with them. The two mini gamemods are a good way to kill time with your friends as well, but they also suffer the same problems with lag. I have never tested the local co-op but I would imagine this fixes the lag issue. The game has a fun story with a humorous art style, and good animation. The gameplay is fun, with lots of combos for you to perfect, but it can also get repetative. Depending on the difficulty, games can seem boringly easy, or stupidly hard. If you have friends than you should definitly give this game a try.			"

												I wil surely recommend this for person who's looking for a game with sick♥♥♥♥♥humor, good Co-Op and standard arcade.I will say as a big Behemoth fan that this is as all of their other games, completely funny humoristic and crazy. This is the arcade game that every guy searching for some new things should try.I want to say gameplay basics are nearly complete, you can find some small bugs but nothing big, it's smooth and you can surely tell, that the designers have spent hours on this.Gameplay through can maybe sometimes be a little too simple as you can just smash your keyboard to the table and kill enemys, but at least they have made it nearly impossible just too boost each other because of you need to kill the enemys, and as longer into you go the monsters getting much harder to kill, so you cant just let a lvl 1 guy into a high level area.I do also really like their way of humour through characters you can play as since you can get some really funny and quite suspicious crazy homour like a knight that casts rainbows, and shoots penguins as spells i find the characters really fullfilled, through the lvling process could be a little more creative since it gets a little long in the end.Storyline is complety sick♥♥♥♥♥fun homour, as always as in a standard adventure game you need to rescue the princess, but in difference for many other games they have found a way to make it more funny, like the bosses are not just simple but also a funny sarcastic, like a cat-shark it's quite funny since cats dont like water.

												It's a great game ! it  funny , it has good gameplay ect . Sadly it is hard to play on a laptop but all in all a great game.to be precise this game has : fun boss fights , tons of secret items and animals : 5 fun arenas to fight in , a funny ( but weird ) story line , the golden door , a variety of characters to unlock ectI would rate it 9/10 because it's a great game , good story line but  a bit short , good replay value but bad laptop controls.

												I really enjoyed this game, I've put way too many hours into it.Pros:-Lots of replay value from the versatility of how you build your character, and with lots of unlockable characters, you'll be experimenting with all of them. The game really encourages this.-Tons of collectables and unlockables if you're into that thing (like I am)-Online co-op is really fun, and a great way to get friends startedCons:-I'm not a huge fan of the immature humor so it's a con for me, but it's a pro for some people-If you play online with random groups you'll often just do the last boss over and over again, don't do if you don't want spoilers-Hard to find people to do hard mode with online-DLC required to unlock all the characters, which isn't good for people like me who like to %100 games.Overall, get this game on sale and get a few copies to give to friends if you'd like. It's more fun with people you know, but still really fun by yourself.			"

												Castle Crashers is a fun game. The gameplay is simple, yet entertaining. Combos become available as you progress your character and each new move fits in nicely with the other mechanics. You level up each character separately which is both tedious and a reason to play even more. There's a decent leveling system and some interesting weapon stats. Each character plays through the story mode separately.The story is really nothing of note. It's the classic ""Damsel in Distress"" plot and none of your characters really differ from each other besides the element their magic takes the shape of. Most of the humor is juvenile at best and, from my experience, tends to annoy rather than entertain. All the cutscenes are unskippable, which means the game forces you to watch animals take a dump every time you load up that level. It's a good time-waster, but it's unlikely that you'll be able to invest any emotion into the characters or events. I sugest getting it to play with friends. 7/10			"

												Really fun game that you can get for pretty cheap during sales. I'll try to make this review short and sweet.PROS:-Lots of characters that are somewhat different from one another.-High replay value.-Nice soundtrack.-Awesome gameplay from a pretty rare game style nowadays(beat em' up).-Really great art style that didn't age.-Almost no DLC which means that you get the FULL game without having to buy any extras(there are only two dlc that are characters/weapons and you don't need them at all to enjoy the game 100%).-Lots of fun to play PVP with some friends.-Nice combat system.CON:-Pretty short story.Even though it's best played with some friends, it's still an excellent game to play by yourself. If you're a fan of beat em' ups or you've never experienced that type of game, I suggest you to wait for a sale, grab some friends and a controller and enjoy.Side note: After you beat the game, you can play on a higher difficulty (much like ratchet and clank) which gives the game more replay value.

												******* SPOILER ALERT *******         This game was so good when i played it the first played it i was confused with the controls at first and how to pause it but i got through that. the player i recomend you use is the red knight he stuns the enimies with tons of damage if your magic is at the halfway mark. Now lets talk about unlockable characters those are like godsends so you dont get bored with the game with only 4 characters. You got the king the necromancer and that other person forgot his name no judge plz. The king if you want a healer you want the king  his magic is not great but if you are at low health and low defence he heals pretty good. Stats attack how much damage you do with weapons like your swords, defence how much health you can have and raises the damge you recieve,  magic self explanitory, agility how fast you run and how fast you can run if you want to unlock other characters you wanna beat the arenas and the final boss. some people you are gonna have to buy with real money but thats not worth it unless you wanna complete the whole game im not judging that. You can also play with other peple wich can sound nice but if you want to do that be prepared they are not gonna go easy on you. I also have a freind who wants this game so bad but does not have the money for it i introduced him to this game he wants it but i dont have any more money for him to get the game so if you want to donate money to him for this game go to  thekakapoopoohead twitch broadcasting channel i will have the link ready for the people who want to give him the stuff he needs to get the best game i ave ever played in my years anyway so goodluck there is alot more to tell you guys but you have heard enough goodluck.                                                                                   Go to the bottom of his stream and there is a little donate button and scroll down the steam thing you will see the donate and the game goodluck :)http://www.twitch.tv/thekakapoopoohead "

												Castle Crashers is a great game, an instant classic. Pros-Simple-Easy and Fun to Play-Funny and Light Hearted-Suprisingly Good GraphicsCons-Lack of smoothness and balance in some areas. For example, on some levels you get all the way to the end for a boss fight. It takes, say, 10 minutes to get there. You die at the boss fight and you have to restart the whole level. It gets annoying to be stuck on one part over and over. -It can be inconsistent or unclear. For example, to break open a treasure chest or a wall to continue a level, you need to be in an exact position or spot for it to work. Sometimes this means you'll get stuck in an area swinging your sword around blindly because you weren't in the right spot to bust a wall open. Nonethelessthis is a really fun game. The developers of this game are awesome imo. They know how to just make a good old fashioned video game that's fun, has levels, boss fights, a story and a little bit of humor.			"

												A great game. Really simple to learn but still challenging. This game was made by the same company that made Battleblock theatre so you are in for a really well made and funny treat. If you own both games you actually get a special char pet and weapon here.Really fun to play in coop, online or lan. I actually play it in lan coop. 1 person using 360 controller and myself on the keyboard (pc gamer lol) (both feel really fluid). No late reaction, button, portability, or any problems really. Its actually just as smooth on the keyboard and mouse as it is on the controller. The whole concept is simple, yet it is deep and character progression is really well reflected on each level. Char variety is also really awesome, powers are different and it allows for a legit online experience.Seriously, this game will be fun playing it casually or hardcore, so its a great game to play with non-gamers GFs and gamer friends alike.9/10			"

I don't think I could handle the comedy! Overall, this game is great and very unique, but it would be pretty cool to have more characters and maps in it, for it just straight up feels too short to be worth 15 dollars.			"

												I can't say I finished entirely, I even got carried from the beginning by a high level !I could anyway analyse the biggest points of this game :It's very very fun, to be honest we have a good time, we rekt mobs, we die (not that much though). By the way it's also a downside. It's way too easy, we complete the game in one or two days if we play seriously. Moreover, you can complete it only by smashing the attack button, the combos are here but not too useful.To conclude we can say that it's a game to relax, to kick some asses, but you won't find a game with a complex background for example.

												Not getting this game is like saying you hate yourself. Wait, no, people who hate themselves would still play this game because it's amazing. Co-Op is the main focus of this game but it's still a lot of fun in single player for those who don't have many friends. A  must get!			"

												This game mixes crude humor, hack n' slash, and co-op into and great game that has a very fun and compelling storyline. Although the story is short, it makes you beg for more. Leveling in the game is not difficult at all, making the gameplay very enjoyable and not stale. No matter single or co-op it's scaled to be challenging but not impossible to beat. Something that bugs me alot personally is that collecting all the animal orb, weapons and heroes can get tedious at time. Definately recommend getting the game if you're planning on having multiple friends buy the game. One of the best co-op games out there today.			"

Castle Crashers was really fun. Really, really fun. For a simple hack-and-slash game, it's actually very impresive that Castle Crashers did not get stale, repetitive, or boring during the entire time I played it. Maybe it's because of the game's many, many unlockables. Maybe it's because of the gameplay's excellent execution. Maybe it's because of the kooky sense of style that permeates the entire experience.Developed by the Behemoth, Castle Crashers opens with your character (or characters, if you're playing co-op) dancing to the worst tavern music ever concieved, only for the party to be cut off by a lone knight, who tumbles through the door riddled with arrows and proceeds to die immediately. You go out to see what's up, only to discover that your castle is under seige and the four princesses have been captured!Thus begins one wild ride, with increasingly impressive boss fights and set pieces, all with a sly sense of humor. You'll fight your way through the land, searching for each princess, slaying fearsome beasts, and accomplishing great acts of derring-do.One of the most memorable and entertaining sequences has you crashing a wedding to save the Green Princess, only for her to be kidnapped again (by a mechanical cyclops, no less) and taken away. Not if you can help it! Your characters jump out of a window to land on top of the horse-drawn carriage carting the princess off. There, you engage in thrilling combat with several of the cyclops' cronies. But wait! During the battle, a humongous troll with laser vision begins chasing the carriage, gunning for you!I won't tell you how that ends, but rest assured, the entire game is epic and hilarious. There's a large variety of enemies, some easier to fight than others, and your strengths and weaknesses will be determined by how you choose to level up your character. The bosses are all carried out on the grandest of scales, and each one brings a different challenge to the table. The world is expansive and filled with interesting locales. There are tons of weapons hidden throughout the game, and players going back through some of the levels to explore will be well rewarded.Castle Crashers is an excellent entry in the Behemoth's game catalogue, and it delights from start to finish.9 out of 10.

												really awesome game! the title is true to itself as you crash into castles to save the princesses! there are other locations too like forest,fortress,temple etc. it a side-scrolling fighting game bit like streets of rage side scroll kill all enemies & move on to next part! it 4 player co-op locally or online or both which is good as it combines the 2 together! the boss stages aren,t easy & tht makes the game challanging which i like in games! :) you have 4 knights but can unlock more /buy alien homaid being an example.the 4 knights have their own magic powers in the game and they are effective! fun in single & co-op & its an awesome game.the same creators made battleblocks theater on platforming Xbox 360 & it looks similar to this only platforming/new concept so obviously its probably going to be really awsome and sucessful! it coming to steam soon aswell which i can,t wait to play :D p.s. This game really deserves a sequel, i'd buy it in a heartbeat! XD			"

												This game is honestly one of my favorite gaming experiences from the last decade.  I grew up playing 2D side-scrolling beat 'em ups in arcades (yes, those still existed in my day), but it has been quite a long time since I've played anything new in that genre.  Enter Castle Crashers.  This game had a ton of hype after its success on consoles, and luckily it lived up to that hype.  Castle Crashers is a beat 'em up with a couple of twists.  It adds combos to the combat system, which mixes things up and adds variety.  In addition the characters level up and have stats that you can put experience points into, as well as you're able to equip different weapons with different stats.  These RPG-like additions mean that you can play the game in different ways (rely on speed, heavy damage, magic, etc.).  This really adds to the game, and ensures that you have a unique experience.  While the story is a bit weak, the overall length of the game and the variation in game levels is phenomenal.  The game even offers a new game+ mode after you beat it.  This game screams multiplayer, but I played it predominantly as a single player due to a lack of friends interested in playing.  While I ran into no problems playing the regular mode as a single player, about halfway through the new game+ mode I found it too difficult to progress.  I suppose I could have grinded my character's level at that point, but instead I chose to start a brand new character and play the game in a different manner this time (I would rely on magic).  Overall this game is a joy, and builds upon and improves on the formula set out by such classics as Double Dragon and Final Fight.  This game is so good that it makes me wonder why it took so long for someone to rejuvenate the beat 'em up genre.  This game is fantastic and I would rate it a 9.5/10.			"

												Castle Crashers is exactly what a 2D Beat Em Up should be. It's got good combat gameplay, excellent visuals, a fantastic variety of multiplayer modes, allows up to four players to play the game, great humor, plenty of levels, and a number of playable characters.The game is cartoonish-styled, so expect a lot of over the top humor. Some of it is some mild black comedy, and there is some degree of blood and violence, comparable to TF2, but is slightly more mild.The game has you in a (mostly) medieval setting, with the initial playable characters being four royal knights. There isn't much of a story outside of an evil wizard uniting several other kingdoms to attack yours for some kind of Magic Crystal (that the wizard directly steals) and claim the four princesses for varying reasons (only one is actually known to be held for forced marriage). Honestly though, in a silly beat em up that's as colorful and full of life as this one, it doesn't exactly need a big driving story. It just needs an atmosphere and charm to put on top of it's fun gameplay. And that's exactly what it has. The gameplay is action-packed, wave of enemies after enemies show up constantly as you move forwardi n each level. You learn more attacks and abilities as you level up, and you can also combo enemies through various means, but the main means behind doing that is to jump and knock them into the air, where you can stay airborn for a while by striking your trapped enemies in the air repeatedly. You can use this kind of tactic to trap multiple enemise at once.Of course, not everyone is going to enjoy the genre, so for those that do, the only real downside to this game is that it's gameplay can get repetitive. Sure you learn more moves after a while, and enemies and levels definitely change up, but the core gameplay stays the same, and when the action is so constant, it might get tiring for some pretty quickly. All the more reason to take breaks from the game though, right?Also, there are a HUGE amount of characters to unlock. It can be tedious (some methods are particularly complicated, requiring that you beat story mode all over again with one new character just to unlock another one) so that's one thing about this game I kinda dislike. Not personally, but I can definitely see why other people wouldn't find value in it. If you enjoy the game enough though, you might just see it as replay value instead, especially if you're planning to bring some friends along. And while playing through the main story in singleplayer is definitely enjoyable, this game is most definitely more fun when you're playing with friends. "

Lots of replay value.My only big complaint is that the game doesn't work well with a keyboard.

												An awesome game. Love it. Though at times it can be stupid, though it may make others laugh. The gameplay is pretty much just button mashing, plenty of things to do in the game, includes 3 different modes like All you can Quaff, the story mode, and an arena mode. There are pets and weapons you can find and keep. The game has nice music, especially the beginning. You can also play with several other people so you can have a great time with your friends and family.Overall, I would give it a 9.5/10.			"

I almost gave up in trying to play it because I had trouble using a Xbox controller on my PC. Luckly I didnt and I still played this. I currently just played for about 2 hours straight and its still fun.

Also features Online mode if you lack couches and/or friends.I should also mention this is another one of those PC/Console bad control ports so keep in mind that this game is really difficult to play with a keyboard.

												It's good if you play by yourself, and great is you play with friends. It is vibrant, cartoony, and there's quite literally a lot of poop in it. Your eyes might lose your character on the screen if enough is happening. One character can prevent the screen from scrolling, which can get really annoying. It is the worst on timed segments such as the alien ship. Overall, though, if you like killing things in games, Castle Crashers is for you. ***(A controller is HIGHLY recommended)***			"

												I remember myself playing Dad n' Me at my younger ages, when I was mastering this flesh-game, Castle Crushers was released. I didnt knew what Steam is, I only knew that Dad n' Me was awesome =). This game is really underrated in it's popularity, so I didnt pay attention to this game. Not so long ago, I was searching for some good game, that will remind me what means a really ""good"" game. I passed all the CoD and AC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and saw Castle Crushers. I watched some gameplay and it immediatly remined me about the game I was playing long time ago. Last summer sale, I've got my hands on this game and started playing.   Nostalgia... the gameplay had the same style as Dad n' Me but a bit better. Now, in Castle Crushers you can use diffrent types of swords and magics, diffrent characters, enemies and locations for our fun. I'm putting 10/10 because this game is one of the best that I've seen in my live! thank you Behemoth!			"

												This game is pretty good..... If you have a controller. The games that this company makes (The Behemoth) were clearly made for console gaming. But anyways the game is almost a button mashing game. Almost, but on a controller it's smoother and makes sense.Now onto the actual gameplay. The graphics are really nice, and the sound with it makes it better. The game is a little cheesy such as almost every animal poops, whether it makes it move or just a bird poop shower. The boss fights are fun and really do make the game challenging. I recommend playing this game with a friend, or just some random person in quick match.Overall I give it a 8.5/10.			"

												This game is awesome! It has a great sense of humor, though things are still epic and serious. There are many characters to unlock which is always a good thing, and the pets are adorable (well, some of them, anyway o.o). The only cons is that it can, in fact, get boring after a while, but the fun can last forever if you're playing with a good friend. Talking about friends, the Online Multiplayer in this is pretty bad, not gonna lie. But I'll admit that that's because of some people's internet (not everyone's internet can be as fast as mine~).Overall, this game has many pros and very little cons, so I really recommend it. And to make it better, its 4 players! To me, that's perfect (not too less, not too many; though I do think they could of squeezed a fifth player in there.).			"

												+ Really fun in multiplayer+ Lots of weapons to choose from and unlock+ Pets are a nice addition, and each one has a different effect+ Runs smoothly (in singleplayer, at least)+ Badass victory music by Waterflame- Not a lot of replayability- You must redo EVERYTHING if you want to select a new character (level and items are seperate for each character, rendering  unlockable & DLC characters useless if you beat the game already)- Weird de-syncing glitch in multiplayerOverall, a nice game. Though once you finish it, you'll probably not play it again. Recommended if you have some friends to play the game with.			"

You can level up if thats your thing and there is plenty of weapons.  The whole game isn't very complicated, but thats a good thing because its easy to pick up and play!  The game is also really funny.  Recommended!!			"

												Great gameplay and really addicting: couldn't put it down when I played with friends. Really funny too. However, lots of farming involved. More than you might expect from a side-scrolling beat-em-up. If you care about achievements, getting every animal orb is nearly impossible, because two are only for sale for 5,500 gold each, which is a ton in this game. Also, getting the achievements for winning 20 online all you can quaff matches (mash buttons to eat food really fast: pretty boring minigame) and 40 online arena deathmatches is hard because it's really tough to find a match. Way better playing with others because if you die other people can revive you: if you die solo, you restart the level, and this game is much harder solo than with friends.tl;dr: 9/10 with friends, 7/10 solo			"

			Berty reviews Castle Crasher. Here's how the scoring system works. Golden 5- You MUST own this game/game franchise 5= I loved it, 4= I liked it, 3= It was OK 2= It was below average but had its...		

 What's Castle Crashers? Castle Crashers is a 2d platform indie Beat'm Up game. After playing so many hours of this game on the Xbox 360, I was very happy to see this game made it to steam so I could enjoy the whole experience all over again. I would recommend playing this game with a controller though. Pros  Amazing Soundtrack Loads of replay value   You never know where each level will take you, one minutes you'll be fighting each other to kiss a princess the next you'll be running away from a giant troll on a deer that has some bowel problems.  Enemies are unique and fun to fight.  21 boss fights  RPG level up system  Animal Orbs & Weapons to collect.  Rammy is life, Rammy is love.  Insane mode if you're feeling brave  Many moments that make you laugh  Can be played and completed in single player if you prefer but I'd recommend bringing friends for a more enjoyable experience  The ending is one of the funniest I've ever seen and completely random.  The most fun coop game I've ever played.  Lot's of characters to unlock  Max level of 99  ""All you can quaff"" a button mashing mini game where you have to eat your food faster than the other players   An arena game mode, where you compete in a variety of team and free for all game modes, including melee fights, archery fights, treasure hunting and more.  When you eat a sandwhich you become massive and really strong  Lots of different environments to fight in, including a forest, a lava world, the dessert, a snowy mountain, a swamp and many more.  The price! £10 is a steal!   Did I mention you ride a deer that has bowel problems?! I mean, you should buy it just for that.  Cons   None  Final VerdictSo is this game worth it?  I feel like this is a rather unique game, at least from every game I've personally played and  I've never played something like this, a game where one minute you're fighting ninja pirates and the next you're playing a friendly game of volley ball. Each level felt exciting and new, the bosses were fun, the enemies were unique to each area, the game has a way to make you laugh at the silliest of things. The replay value is incredible, the soundtrack is amazing, the memoires you'll make from the game will stick with you, you'll have so much fun with your friends and you can get all of it for just £10! This game is worth every bit of money you'll spend on it and then some. So grab your friends, kill some barbarians and fight each other for a princess! 5/5	 "

												Before I reveiw this game i'd like to give some backround as how I came across this gem I first heard of this game when a well known youtube channel called ""Game Grumps"" started playing it on there show steam train and I fell in love with this game and I knew I had to get it so I decided to get this game along with a few extra copies for a few of my friends and this game is an absolute blast Castle Crashers was originally realesed in 2008 later getting a steam port in 2012 Castle crashers is a 2-D beat-em up with some Rpg elements thrown in such as leveling up stats yet what sets this game apart from the standered beat-em up is 3 things the art style the music and its amazing humor the art style is very simplistic and colorful and it fits perfectly with the games over the top humor the music is truly something to behold an interesting thing is that the games music was made by people submitting there music creations on the flash site Newgrounds and lets just say it did not dissapoint the music seems to fit in so well with every situation in the game my personal favorite peice being Simple Sight by ""Real Fraction"" or the music when you fight the necromancer it really gets you pumped for a fight the games online is nearly flawless yet I wish the game would make it so it would make so the other players that join you would be the same or close to the same level as you  but thats just a minor nitpick i'd say that castle crashers has become one of my biggest gaming guilty pleasures and is well worth a second playthrough the game has great replay value and playing through the entire game from start to finish with one of my best friends is an expeirence I shall not forget I think that Castle crashers is a instant classic and deserves to be as popular as it is I highly recommend it			"

Castle Crashers was really fun. Really, really fun. For a simple hack-and-slash game, it's actually very impresive that Castle Crashers did not get stale, repetitive, or boring during the entire time I played it. Maybe it's because of the game's many, many unlockables. Maybe it's because of the gameplay's excellent execution. Maybe it's because of the kooky sense of style that permeates the entire experience.Developed by the Behemoth, Castle Crashers opens with your character (or characters, if you're playing co-op) dancing to the worst tavern music ever concieved, only for the party to be cut off by a lone knight, who tumbles through the door riddled with arrows and proceeds to die immediately. You go out to see what's up, only to discover that your castle is under seige and the four princesses have been captured!Thus begins one wild ride, with increasingly impressive boss fights and set pieces, all with a sly sense of humor. You'll fight your way through the land, searching for each princess, slaying fearsome beasts, and accomplishing great acts of derring-do.One of the most memorable and entertaining sequences has you crashing a wedding to save the Green Princess, only for her to be kidnapped again (by a mechanical cyclops, no less) and taken away. Not if you can help it! Your characters jump out of a window to land on top of the horse-drawn carriage carting the princess off. There, you engage in thrilling combat with several of the cyclops' cronies. But wait! During the battle, a humongous troll with laser vision begins chasing the carriage, gunning for you!I won't tell you how that ends, but rest assured, the entire game is epic and hilarious. There's a large variety of enemies, some easier to fight than others, and your strengths and weaknesses will be determined by how you choose to level up your character. The bosses are all carried out on the grandest of scales, and each one brings a different challenge to the table. The world is expansive and filled with interesting locales. There are tons of weapons hidden throughout the game, and players going back through some of the levels to explore will be well rewarded.Castle Crashers is an excellent entry in the Behemoth's game catalogue, and it delights from start to finish.9 out of 10.

												This game mixes crude humor, hack n' slash, and co-op into and great game that has a very fun and compelling storyline. Although the story is short, it makes you beg for more. Leveling in the game is not difficult at all, making the gameplay very enjoyable and not stale. No matter single or co-op it's scaled to be challenging but not impossible to beat. Something that bugs me alot personally is that collecting all the animal orb, weapons and heroes can get tedious at time. Definately recommend getting the game if you're planning on having multiple friends buy the game. One of the best co-op games out there today.			"

												Pros Castle Crashers is a 4 player, local beat em up brawler and is the game most people think of when they play brawlers. i have played Castle Crashers on both PC and Xbox. I rate the game very highly and it is the best of its genre of 4 player brawlers. this game is a great game to play by yourself but it is much more fun with friends and you can meet good people on servers of this game. the game has 2 difficulty modes normal and insane mode, and insane mode is very challenging. If you think hard isn't hard enough you can play the game without spending any level up points making it more challenging and this game is very fun when you set your own goals. the game is full of content with tons of weapons, characters, pets, and other unlock-ables to make the game worth replaying multiple times. the graphics on this game are great, it looks like a beautiful flash game and this version has great options for its sound, display, controls, rebind-able keys, and it has excellent controller support. if you on other games owned by the same company you unlock a playable character in that game example if you own battle block theater you can unlock hatty hattington. Cons The game is kinda short but its not a big problem because its replayable but still, you will get sick of playing the same levels so many times new levels would have fixed this problem  Leveling up to 99 takes too long, previously there were tricks to level up like the boomerang glitch, the 256 glitch, and other tricks but they have been patched and that HUGELY take away from the game, when i had played castle crashers on the xbox 360 the boomerang glitch was partly patched where the exp rewarding glitch would only work in the industrial castle and that made it easier to level up you could really level up fast if you did the trick with insane mode on but sadly that has been patched. in my opinion patching games are really good, game breaking bugs need to be fixed obviously, i had no problem with the 256 glitch being removed, making the boomerang glitch work on only one boss was alright, but i think that taking out makes leveling up stupidly long without out of game cheats. A few of characters use the same ability's example the grey knight and the cone head knight have the exact same magic ability's, and you need to beat the glitch specific characters to unlock other ones. ConclusionOverall its worth it and really enjoyable to play but the level up system needs at least a few more easy ways to level up it takes quite a long time to level up making the game very hard to fully complete. i would recommend a console version over the PC version because the level up system is simply better. i also recommend all the DLC it is worthwhile to pay for the new content, the pink knight DLC is worthwhile and the purple knight DLC is not as interesting as the pink knight DLC mainly because of one weapon (put simply because the broccoli sword is the best starting weapon), but still worth it. Castle Crashers is a must have in my opinion, worth every cent and is the definitive game of its genre.			"

												- game is little hard if you play it alone and you have to do several missions again and again- for a first time little bad kayboard settings - prize+ COOP max 4 people+ game modes, + Many characters, weapons+ Level system+ funny story+ Achievements+ fighting system (combos, magic etc.)So, my friend buy this game for me and for some friends and we tried it. For a first time I though it will be something like sh*tty online game on internet, but it was fun! Yeah, the story was good and every minute in game we were discovering new things. We were laughting all the time, It is like a parody of narrative. The level up system is nice thing, you can make 100 level for each character and there are lot of characters. Every character have their own special magic and weapon. But I won´t be only positive: My friend bought me it for 1 euro in 90% sale and I think 10 euro is too much. And second thing is that if you are planning to get this game, have minimal 1 friend to play with, because is more fun, and randoms are randoms... Well, It´s good game for group of bored poeple, who should buy it for suitable prize.All in all:  72%			"

												Although I found it a bit weird that it took 4 years after the initial release on the Xbox 360, for it to come out on PC, it still doesn't really matter, because I finally have it, and I have finally enjoyed it. Castle Crashers for PC is just like the Xbox 360 and PS3 version. Fun, medieval sword fighting against evil knights, monsters, and strange creatures. The game is very nicely done, with good graphics, and fun, addicting levels and gameplay. Castle Crashers is best enjoyed through online multiplayer with friends or strangers. That said, the game lets you enable voice chat for a more fun multiplayer experience. I seriously think it's a powerful, and engaging fighting experience. Even if it is very cartoony. It's still a good game			"

Its just a simple beat em up but it feels just to play randomly you can just jump into a level and jump out, without like 5 menu between each one. its fun is what im trying to get at. only 10 pounds where i live and it was worth it. it an be played with a xbox controller since it was on the live arcade at one point and the psn store. theres so much to say and i hope it gets good reviews from now on. bye bye.

												Castle Crashers is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I've played through the entire game at least 5 times to date on the Xbox 360 so when I saw it on sale on STEAM I had to get it. The controls are so easy to learn that my 6 year old brother has played through and beat it with me once. As for the story, it is a satisfying length and funny as all get out. I highly recommend this game for the playability, story and the fact that it offers local co op as well makes it well worth the price.			"

												Very entertaining Beat em' Up game. Also has some aspects of an RPG. Although the game is somewhat short, it is the kind of game you are going to want to play over and over again as different characters, each with their own unique magic attack. Even though the game is very fun and perfectly possible single player, it is still even more fun playing with friends (or random people online) Therefore, I recommend this game to anyone wanting an action Beat em' up RPG game, ESPECIALLY if they have other friends to play the game with.

												The game with the weirdest animations I've ever played.  Diarrhea deers, what?  And that ending.  It's a great game to play with friends and easy to get too.  The game goes on sale often enough for $4 or sometimes even $2 and there's a 4 pack bundle.  I think the only downside is that there's not much left to do after beating the final stage.  At that point, you've seen everything there is to see in the game.  If people are still wanting to play, they end up grinding to raise their levels.			"

												Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, let me be brief here.  Castle crashers is simple, pure ridiculous fun. It’s  side-scrolling beat-em up formula may not be that different from games of yore like Streets of Rage, but that doesn’t stop it from being one of the most hilariously fun multiplayer games I’ve had the pleasure to experience in a long time.  Cute graphics, cheesy soundtrack, combos galore and just enough depth (weapons, animal helpers, magic) to keep you interested makes one merry pie of a game.  Go buy the four pack, give copies to your friends, and have a blast on this.			"

Posted: February 15, 2016
												There's no doubt this game deserves a positive review.Why?Well, I'll just put all of my reasons down into this one review.--------------------------------------------------------------Number 1) Creative idea.There's no doubt that when you look at Castle Crashers, you see no resemblence of any game out there. That, my friend, is the beauty of Behemoth. Their games are all origanal ideas, and Castle Crashers is no exception. This is only one reason I recommend Castle Crashers, you never know what might happen next.Number 2) There's always something to play forWhat do I mean by this? What I mean is that whenever you play Castle Crashers, you always have SOMETHING to do on it.For example, you might be trying to unlock a new character out of about 31 of them. You may be trying to own everybody in an arena match, or playing the mini games included in Castle Crashers. You may be grinding for a larger level and more gold, or trying to beat Insane Mode for the beautiful golden skull.Number 3) StratagyNow, first off it's important to note that Castle Crashers is a button mashing game. It seems like there's no stratagy involved, when truely, there is. There's times when you have to cast a magical spell, or times when you need to sling an arrow. Times when you have to bash rival's skulls with weapons, times when you need to dodge all of their attacks.This is a small reason I recommend this game, but I think it's sort of worth mentioning in this review.Number 4) Simple controllsNow, when I say this, I also want to note that Castle Crashers is SO much easier with a plug-in controller. That being said, this number is all about the simple controlls with a CONTROLLER.Here are the only controlls you need to memorize: Light attack button, hard attack button, use item button, scroll item buttons, and toggle magic button. Oh yeah, and jump.It seems like alot, but it is SO easy to memorize.  Number 5) Large amount of playable charactersWhen I say this, I mean LARGE. Well, about 31, including 2 cheap DLCS and an unlockable character you can only get if you get Battle Block Theater.The others are unlocked by certain paths, beating arenas or levels, and beating bosses in Insane Mode. There's all different character paths you can do, such as the Red Knight being Red knight > Skeleton > Bear, each one unlocked by beating the game with another. Each character has their own looks, names, and unique magic abilities that makes the player really want to unlock each one.Number 6) (Final) Very creative rivals, bosses, and playable characters.When I say this, I mean very creative. Some of them may have some inspiriation, but for the most part they are all orgianal ideas. They all have their different attacks, and the bosses are each hard and annoying in their own ways. These make each different boss and characters unique as can be, a small reason I recommend this game, but still a reason.I hope you enjoyed this long review, and I hope that I made up your mind whether or not to buy this game if you haven't already. It is an amazing game, well worth the 10-15$ it was priced with.~TheRetrieverArmy "

												It is an old game but since i primarily game on a laptop I'm always looking for good games that can run on my system.Castle Crashers looks really good, play really well. The controls are easy to use both on the keyboard and xbox controller (although i keep accidently using my items from the tiny inventory) so this is great to play with friends with little or no gaming experience. Theres tons of weapons and all the upgradable character abilities are equally important which makes it a challenge to prioritize your skill points. The game is a good balance of difficulty, not too hard or too easy and theres a wide variety of enemies and bosses in an art style i really dig. After completing the game the first time round, Castle Crashers still has more to give. The addition of insane mode and secrets all over the map like weapons to dig up and animal orbs in the store makes sure you never get tired of this game. Very worth my money. Get it if you're bored, get it if you have friends coming over, get it if you haven't.			"

												Multiplayer on this game is dead, have never found a single match on, and nobody has ever joined a a match i have created, does not feature a drop in multiplayer so if you cannot player a level or 2 while waiting for others to join which is why it is dead.Playing with friends was impossible for me, while trying to play with a friend it kept pausing the game for roughly 5-10 seconds saying ""Waiting for players"" then 3 seconds later it would do it again over and over.Singleplayer is a bit challenging at times, you can tell this game was built around 4 people playing and does not scale difficulty what so ever so a lot of rage sections, if you don't mind a singleplayer game and raging now and then it is a fun game, a lot of humour in it.

												I really liked this game for many reasons. I like to farm on my own but have fun with my friends, so this game was perfect for me. I liked that you had unlockable abilities that you could get from leveling up. I also liked that the plot was relatively straight forward but if you looked closely at the levels, there was a lot of humor hidden. I also enjoy the challenge of getting some of the achievements. The only thing I don't like about this game was that it was very difficult to figure out where you were (depth perception).			"

												Game is very good, played it back when it was first released on xbox360 days, and also, it runs very well with no lag, don't know why people with the negative reviews are complaining, but the online multiplayer does take a while to connect with someone, and even when it does, it cuts out, probably internet connection, but do play with a controller instead of using a keyboard for castle crashers. Also there are some bugs to the game, but it's barely noticable to see it anyways.Ps- This is my very first review to do.			"

												Great game! Only problem I have with it is that it is very, very, boring if you don't have a friend to play co-op with you. And I hate it when people say ""this online community is dead"" yet when I open up a public lobby it becomes full in a matter of seconds, and yes you can button mash through the game, but that doesn't take away from the fun! I mean.. comeon who doesn't like the usual fairy tail; save the princess{s} and defeat the evil wizard plot/scenario. (there isn't a ""story"" but you can follow along the actions of the characters, for example the princesses are being dragged away, stuff like that) I also have one more complaint: Sometimes in a lobby with my friends, and in game the game will just freeze up and that is a problem for me seeing as my computer has an i7 4th gen processor and a 690 in it.  I'm positive it isn't my internet because it doesn't happen on other games! It always fixes though, it isn't gamebreaking at all. Another thing, some reviews might say you NEED a controller for the game but that isn't true at all! None of my friends, including myself, don't use our XBOX360 controllers in the game. Yes, the game is a completely unchanged port from the XBOX360, but I mean comeon why does it matter if it says ""press x or y to attack"" etc., you can litterally press ESC and go into the controls, click keyboard and mouse, and change (or leave) the controls to your liking. What is keeping me into the game is the characters, pets, and weapons. You can unlock 31 characters, 79 unlockable weapons, and 27 pets that you can unlock. Each new character has a new design, a new magic, and sometimes a new weapon. Weapons are abundant throughout the game, whether you buy them, dig them up, have pets find them, or kill enemies. They also have buffs and debuffs depending on the weapon; for example it might raise your strength and magic but minus your defense. They also have ""special abilities"" which can do a multitude of things; shock your enemies, set fire to your enemies, increase critical hits on your enemies, etc. Now onto pets; Pets are REALLY cool, just like weapons they can buff you, or debuff you. They also have special abilities, such as; finding buried treasure, defeating enemies at low health, bringing you food, etc. etc. That's about all I have to say about this AMAZING game. I totally recommend that you buy Castle Crashers! I now leave you with the best sidescrolling beatem up to date! BYEEEEE			"

												I have spent nothing short of hundreds of hours playing this on the xbox 360. Although quite repetetive, and essentially requiring a controller on the pc, this is a fantastic game. It is reasonably cheap, essentially a giveaway during sales and is absolutely worth it. I have no playtime online in this game, but coop with friends is some of the best fun I've ever had playing video games, some of the humour could be considered childish but the gameplay is funny and engaging, and the story holds some interest during the first playthrough. I could never give this game enough praise, at the time of this review it was 3$ and I see this as a game everybody and their pals should have.I would honestly give it a 10/10, years of play later and it never fails to entertain me.

And The Second The Steam Winter Sale Started I Rushed To The Store To Get It! Got The Portal Bundle For Only 5 Bucks! And Castle Crashers For Me And My Friend And We Played It That Night! So Yes I Do Reccomend This Game BUT! Wait For A sale This Game Is A Bit Pricey! But Other Then That Perfect! 5 Stars! :)			"

I (of course) unlocked/got Hatty Hattington, since I own BattleBlock Theater as well, and I have to say, I would never stop playing as Hattington.You don't just play Castle Crashers.

												Let me tell you a story.Playing this game with 4 friends on Xbox. We were semi good people so we were trying to give one friend the ""Kiss all the princesses in a multiplayer game"" achievement.  I was the Blue Knight, and had a fairly balanced build between Magic and Damage, with a little bit of health and dex thrown in, and I was using the Bi-Polar Bear animal orb.  The friend getting the achievement was the Orange Knight, and he put every point he earned into magic untill he maxed it out.  No hp or damage or anything.  We had another friend, playing the Fire Demon character and using the Rammy Animal Orb.  Incase you didnt know, rammy will randomly knock people down (I dont remember if it does damage or not).The final boss has just been defeated and now we must fight for the last princess. We planned on letting Orange knight win, but rammy had other plans. The second the fight started Rammy knocked down our Orange knight. I hit him once and because of his build it did more damage than expected and pretty much half healthed him.  I was backing off now, to let him win, but Bi Polar Bear went over and executed Orange knight. He was mad, and I got 15 minuets of straight laughter. 10/10			"

												Okay, Pros: Co-op, arcade style, fun with friends, fairly good animation, several different types of enemies, think outside the box art style, epic music, uniqe and old school style boss fights, and beleive it or not REALLY good story. Two more additional things, Behemoth, and I think Battle Block Theater should be on steam.Cons: CONTROLLER OR DIE, playing without friends is boring, difficult playing alone.Overall: Buy the game when its full price. If you have a friend (or a few) that want to play too, buy a copy for each of them too. Endless hilarity insues amongst your friends, the game itself, and soon you will be cackling over the micrphone about the endless laughs and enjoyment this game will bring to your life. End note: I wasn't kidding about ""CONTROLLER OR DIE"" if you want to NOT be confused by the game's UI, get a WIRED Xbox 360 controller. Trust me, it'll boost your gameplay experience by about hmmmm: 25%-60-ish%.			"

												This game is really fun to play especially if you are playing with friends. The Story mode is great and fun,Have not tried Arena or Quaff because there is not enough players to play with.The problem that this game has is the preset controls. The game was ported from xbox onto pc and the company that was put in charge of  it did not bother to change the display buttons. It's not a major problem but when you are first starting out you'll have to take sometime to figure out what botton is what if you are using a keyboard if you are using a controll great you have no problem.

												Castle Crashers is definitely an amazing game, and already an all-time favorite. The beauty with Castle Crashers is that while it is very simple when compared to other games, it is still awesome. The story is simple, bad dudes are taking princesses, rescue them. You just hack and slash everything in your way, while unlocking cool weapons, pets, and characters. The game also has some RPG elements to add some depth to it. Playing by yourself is fun, but when you play with others it is a great adventure. I highly recommend getting this game. I bought it for $4 Canadian, but I think that it is still worth $16.99 ($15 US I think). The game is something that you will never forget.			"

												I love this game, if you haven't played it, it's best to try and play it with others who also haven't tried it yet. Going through it your first time as a group is extremely fun. It's fairly simple and short, but highly replayable, and the little cinematics remain enjoyable, and you may notice something you didn't before while doing another playthrough. It is a pretty button mashy beat-em-up, so if you want gameplay with a lot of variety, this may not be the best choice, Otherwise, hitting x a bunch of times and juggling enemies in the air from one side of the screen to the other remains fun. My only issue is the experience system. You get experience for hitting enemies (except when they've died and you're not letting their corpses rest peacefully), regardless of damage. If you are stronger than the other players, you will level up slower. This sort of inhibits magic users from leveling decently, since you deal high damage in few hits.If you look at the negative reviews, most of them are people complaining that the game is unplayable on keyboard. I first played the game on Xbox, loved it, eventually got it on PC and still loved it. Recently the A button on my controller got jammed after hours of a little game called Ys Origin...so now I use the keyboard. Guess what? I'm completely fine, the game is still entirely playable, fun, and not really any harder. The people complaining probably just suck...ignore them. The instructions do only show Xbox controls, making you have to test to figure out the controls, but you can map the keys you want to use anyway.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Castle Crashers is a fun, qwerky rpg with a unique artstyle. The gameplay will require you to work with your team and at times, allow you to become competitive. The game allows you to play with friends easily, and allows you to level up each individual character you unlock separately. A fun game, but can lag. It's as unique as it is challenging.			"

												Castle Crashers is a good ol' fashion beat 'em up with small twerks like magic and other things.A good idea is to not play alone, even another person with you will make the game more fun and easier. Another nice feature is having pets, pets give you a boost in something whether it be agility and damage, defense, increased xp gain, etc. Everytime you level up you gain 2-1 skill points but sadly its not a skill tree function. Instead you upgrade 4 stats, Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility.I'd like to also point out the interesting art style that makes all the colors easier to see and more vibrant even though it is such a simple one.I have gotten into a bit of the game myself but I haven't beaten it yet but I shall reveal a small bit of the story.The story follows you/the knight you chose, and while you are rocking out in a castle a large scale invasion has happened by an orcish like creature and the 4 princess are captured. It's up to you and 1-3 other friends to rescue the princesses. Pets, level ups, new weapons, and gold will help you along your way.If you do decied to buy this game (It's 14.99 on steam store) I hope this review helped your choice!I rate this game 9.5/10			"

												This game has a nostalgic vibe of a classic beat 'em up arcade game. Its cute and memorable characters made the game amazing with each stage shows us a comidic foreshadow of an upcoming scene. It has a near perfect multiplayer mode as it enables us to play with friends both local and online. Although we aren't able to play online with oter people, it gives us an arena map where we play and elimate our friends and be the last man standing. Overall, the game is brilliant to play even in singleplayer mode, but more like to play multiplayer with friends.			"

												Castle Crashers is a great game, an instant classic. Pros-Simple-Easy and Fun to Play-Funny and Light Hearted-Suprisingly Good GraphicsCons-Lack of smoothness and balance in some areas. For example, on some levels you get all the way to the end for a boss fight. It takes, say, 10 minutes to get there. You die at the boss fight and you have to restart the whole level. It gets annoying to be stuck on one part over and over. -It can be inconsistent or unclear. For example, to break open a treasure chest or a wall to continue a level, you need to be in an exact position or spot for it to work. Sometimes this means you'll get stuck in an area swinging your sword around blindly because you weren't in the right spot to bust a wall open. Nonethelessthis is a really fun game. The developers of this game are awesome imo. They know how to just make a good old fashioned video game that's fun, has levels, boss fights, a story and a little bit of humor.			"

The RPG elements of the game will really appeal to you if that is your usual style of play, the crazy cartoon world that Behemoth have created is very pleasing to the eye and the specific niche of humour they bring to the game makes it very enjoyable to play and the fact it doesnt take itself too seriously is refreshing.Great to play with your mates, start to finish its always changing so keeps it fun.

Give it a try!

												The game has all of the original version and multiplayer feature allows you to play with friends all around the world. The game sets it up so that is's fun to play a level again and again. The bosses are memorable and exiting. You can play local or over wi-fi. You can use a Xbox controller, witch really makes the game more exiting. There is a lot of playable characters to unlock, there is also a lot of collectibles, such as weapons and sidekicks. You can only complete the game by replaying it more times and it is totally woth it. You will spend a lot of fun hours playing this game. I would recomed this game for gamers or casuals who like classic NES games or if you liked battel block theater (but they are totaly different). I wuld give it 4 of 5 stars.			"

Posted: February 15, 2016
												There's no doubt this game deserves a positive review.Why?Well, I'll just put all of my reasons down into this one review.--------------------------------------------------------------Number 1) Creative idea.There's no doubt that when you look at Castle Crashers, you see no resemblence of any game out there. That, my friend, is the beauty of Behemoth. Their games are all origanal ideas, and Castle Crashers is no exception. This is only one reason I recommend Castle Crashers, you never know what might happen next.Number 2) There's always something to play forWhat do I mean by this? What I mean is that whenever you play Castle Crashers, you always have SOMETHING to do on it.For example, you might be trying to unlock a new character out of about 31 of them. You may be trying to own everybody in an arena match, or playing the mini games included in Castle Crashers. You may be grinding for a larger level and more gold, or trying to beat Insane Mode for the beautiful golden skull.Number 3) StratagyNow, first off it's important to note that Castle Crashers is a button mashing game. It seems like there's no stratagy involved, when truely, there is. There's times when you have to cast a magical spell, or times when you need to sling an arrow. Times when you have to bash rival's skulls with weapons, times when you need to dodge all of their attacks.This is a small reason I recommend this game, but I think it's sort of worth mentioning in this review.Number 4) Simple controllsNow, when I say this, I also want to note that Castle Crashers is SO much easier with a plug-in controller. That being said, this number is all about the simple controlls with a CONTROLLER.Here are the only controlls you need to memorize: Light attack button, hard attack button, use item button, scroll item buttons, and toggle magic button. Oh yeah, and jump.It seems like alot, but it is SO easy to memorize.  Number 5) Large amount of playable charactersWhen I say this, I mean LARGE. Well, about 31, including 2 cheap DLCS and an unlockable character you can only get if you get Battle Block Theater.The others are unlocked by certain paths, beating arenas or levels, and beating bosses in Insane Mode. There's all different character paths you can do, such as the Red Knight being Red knight > Skeleton > Bear, each one unlocked by beating the game with another. Each character has their own looks, names, and unique magic abilities that makes the player really want to unlock each one.Number 6) (Final) Very creative rivals, bosses, and playable characters.When I say this, I mean very creative. Some of them may have some inspiriation, but for the most part they are all orgianal ideas. They all have their different attacks, and the bosses are each hard and annoying in their own ways. These make each different boss and characters unique as can be, a small reason I recommend this game, but still a reason.I hope you enjoyed this long review, and I hope that I made up your mind whether or not to buy this game if you haven't already. It is an amazing game, well worth the 10-15$ it was priced with.~TheRetrieverArmy "

												I really liked this game for many reasons. I like to farm on my own but have fun with my friends, so this game was perfect for me. I liked that you had unlockable abilities that you could get from leveling up. I also liked that the plot was relatively straight forward but if you looked closely at the levels, there was a lot of humor hidden. I also enjoy the challenge of getting some of the achievements. The only thing I don't like about this game was that it was very difficult to figure out where you were (depth perception).			"

												It is an old game but since i primarily game on a laptop I'm always looking for good games that can run on my system.Castle Crashers looks really good, play really well. The controls are easy to use both on the keyboard and xbox controller (although i keep accidently using my items from the tiny inventory) so this is great to play with friends with little or no gaming experience. Theres tons of weapons and all the upgradable character abilities are equally important which makes it a challenge to prioritize your skill points. The game is a good balance of difficulty, not too hard or too easy and theres a wide variety of enemies and bosses in an art style i really dig. After completing the game the first time round, Castle Crashers still has more to give. The addition of insane mode and secrets all over the map like weapons to dig up and animal orbs in the store makes sure you never get tired of this game. Very worth my money. Get it if you're bored, get it if you have friends coming over, get it if you haven't.			"

												Jogo muito bem feito, que roda em qualquer torradeira sem placa de vídeo (tipo a minha) a pelo menos 30 fps, não exige internet potente pra jogar online e bem...sobre, o jogo mesmo...10/10- Uma ♥♥♥♥♥da de cavaleiros diferentes- É difícil zerar sozinho na primeira vez, o que pode incentivar um co-op dos brother- Humor de bosta (literalmente)- DLC's tem um preço aceitável, mas que não afetam em absolutamente nada a gameplay (como uma verdadeira DLC deve ser)- Diversos combos que você pode fazer com personagens e armas diferentes (fora os pets que sempre buffam alguma coisa dos seus atributos)- Acho que o único ponto negativo é a falta de comunicação com pessoas online, caso decida achar alguém aleatório pra jogar online. Fora isso, continua 10/10Recomendado pra qualquer um que tenha dinheiro sobrando na carteira ou esteja procurando por um jogo divertido em promoções.			"

												I found this little fun game on the XBL market about a year ago. Played it for about 20 hours and almost completed it, but I kept starting the game on a new character to level as the game is that good. It has amazingly fun aspects - 4 player co-op in story mode (also All You Can Quaff, so good) and Arena. It's gameplay is never repetative, and the story mode just seems to go on for ever, with challenging bosses and tougher enemies. I honestly cannot think of any negatives for this fantastic indie game, it has many weapons, characters, bosses, lots of humor and tons of fun to be had. A must buy.			"

												OMG THIS GAME IS GREAT! Play as one of the few starter characters work your way up and unlock new characters spells and even more. Battle your way through each level with tons of bosses for pretty much all the levels. Fight your way in pvp arenas in multiplayer and smash buttons till you break all of them. It's like flappy bird where flappy bird is annoying because you keep loosing but it's so addicting, Except this game isn't annoying, but you might get a little bit annoyed if you keep losing at pvp. Hope this review was helpful and everyone, HAVE A GREAT DAY :D!!			"

			Berty reviews Castle Crasher. Here's how the scoring system works. Golden 5- You MUST own this game/game franchise 5= I loved it, 4= I liked it, 3= It was OK 2= It was below average but had its...		

 What's Castle Crashers? Castle Crashers is a 2d platform indie Beat'm Up game. After playing so many hours of this game on the Xbox 360, I was very happy to see this game made it to steam so I could enjoy the whole experience all over again. I would recommend playing this game with a controller though. Pros  Amazing Soundtrack Loads of replay value   You never know where each level will take you, one minutes you'll be fighting each other to kiss a princess the next you'll be running away from a giant troll on a deer that has some bowel problems.  Enemies are unique and fun to fight.  21 boss fights  RPG level up system  Animal Orbs & Weapons to collect.  Rammy is life, Rammy is love.  Insane mode if you're feeling brave  Many moments that make you laugh  Can be played and completed in single player if you prefer but I'd recommend bringing friends for a more enjoyable experience  The ending is one of the funniest I've ever seen and completely random.  The most fun coop game I've ever played.  Lot's of characters to unlock  Max level of 99  ""All you can quaff"" a button mashing mini game where you have to eat your food faster than the other players   An arena game mode, where you compete in a variety of team and free for all game modes, including melee fights, archery fights, treasure hunting and more.  When you eat a sandwhich you become massive and really strong  Lots of different environments to fight in, including a forest, a lava world, the dessert, a snowy mountain, a swamp and many more.  The price! £10 is a steal!   Did I mention you ride a deer that has bowel problems?! I mean, you should buy it just for that.  Cons   None  Final VerdictSo is this game worth it?  I feel like this is a rather unique game, at least from every game I've personally played and  I've never played something like this, a game where one minute you're fighting ninja pirates and the next you're playing a friendly game of volley ball. Each level felt exciting and new, the bosses were fun, the enemies were unique to each area, the game has a way to make you laugh at the silliest of things. The replay value is incredible, the soundtrack is amazing, the memoires you'll make from the game will stick with you, you'll have so much fun with your friends and you can get all of it for just £10! This game is worth every bit of money you'll spend on it and then some. So grab your friends, kill some barbarians and fight each other for a princess! 5/5	 "

												This game is fun and I would highly recommend it. on my hand, I see one flaw. In the Xbox/playstation, you unlock others packs like The King pack and Cultist Pack, But on computer, this doesn't work. I hope this feature of other packs will come in the future. Also, This game is so kawaii with the pink knight. XD			"

												******* SPOILER ALERT *******         This game was so good when i played it the first played it i was confused with the controls at first and how to pause it but i got through that. the player i recomend you use is the red knight he stuns the enimies with tons of damage if your magic is at the halfway mark. Now lets talk about unlockable characters those are like godsends so you dont get bored with the game with only 4 characters. You got the king the necromancer and that other person forgot his name no judge plz. The king if you want a healer you want the king  his magic is not great but if you are at low health and low defence he heals pretty good. Stats attack how much damage you do with weapons like your swords, defence how much health you can have and raises the damge you recieve,  magic self explanitory, agility how fast you run and how fast you can run if you want to unlock other characters you wanna beat the arenas and the final boss. some people you are gonna have to buy with real money but thats not worth it unless you wanna complete the whole game im not judging that. You can also play with other peple wich can sound nice but if you want to do that be prepared they are not gonna go easy on you. I also have a freind who wants this game so bad but does not have the money for it i introduced him to this game he wants it but i dont have any more money for him to get the game so if you want to donate money to him for this game go to  thekakapoopoohead twitch broadcasting channel i will have the link ready for the people who want to give him the stuff he needs to get the best game i ave ever played in my years anyway so goodluck there is alot more to tell you guys but you have heard enough goodluck.                                                                                   Go to the bottom of his stream and there is a little donate button and scroll down the steam thing you will see the donate and the game goodluck :)http://www.twitch.tv/thekakapoopoohead "

												Possibly the best multiplayer game I've ever played.The gameplay is incredibly fun and fast-paced, the combos are satisfying, there are multiple different character builds you can make using the level-up system, and there are  tons  of unlockables, such as new characters with different move sets, new weapons with different stats and special effects, and animal orbs (essentially pets) granting you lots of different bonuses, from increasing your character's strength, through ramming down enemies, to pecking away at knocked down enemies.The remastered edition (the edition available on steam) re-balanced lots of weapon and animal orb stats, and added a new mode called ""Back Off Barbarian"", in which you escape from constantly spawning enemies and get a rating based on the time you managed to survive.Although the game is intended to be played in co-op, it's perfectly playable and enjoyable in singleplayer.The game's controls work very well with a gamepad, but with some rebinding, can also be quite good on a keyboard.The only larger flaw the game has, in my opinion, is the lack of randomly generated levels and enemies, which would add a lot to the replay value. However, the game is still very replayable thanks to tons of hidden content, such as weapons or animal orbs, making you discover something new every run.The game's soundtrack is fantastic as well, with each area having a very fitting and enjoyable track.The game's art style might seem basic to some, but actually works very well with the game's gameplay and feel.Overall, the steam edition of Castle Crashers is a solid 8.5/10 for me. Would recommend to nearly everyone, even if multiplayer isn't necessarily your thing.tl;dr: The game is very, very good. Buy it. Worth it even at full price.			"

The art style also allows people with lower performance computers (Like myself for my first 15ish hours) to run it seemlessly. Throughout the game you'll keep finding new weapons that you can swap at will to gear towards the playstyle you want, but their stats and discovery locations are carefully built so that you'll have a hard time feeling overpowered (Even with the jump/light attack combo that allows to fly around the stage invincible beating the stuffing out of an enemy or two)			"

												This game sponsored me my friend for which I'm thankful.What can I say about Castle Crashers? I wish that this game wasn't so short (like every good game seems to be too short) but because of cooperative it give us a big opportunity to back here and play again and again in different squads.The plot is simple - something has been stolen and we have to get it back. Game is not difficult... Ok, sometimes you have to play again because of dead but this game is more to chill out than to ""Arghh I dead 20th time! It makes me so angry"". What I like in Castle Crashers is that it's simply funny. On every step there are things that make you smile or even laugh (especially when You are playing with somebody). Cartoon graphics and animations looks really good. Soundtracks are also very well, great suited to each level. It's good game to relax and check out if you can still play games in which the mouse is not necessary.			"

It may sound strange to you, but it's mechanics are fun and they're working suprisingly well; espescially with friends! I would definitely recommend it anybody searching for a 2D platformer! It is great fun and with it's cartoonish style, it won't get boring very fast. You should play it with a controller though, playing this game with a keyboard is just more frustrating.			"

												This game is AMAZING.I bought this game for a second time (first time on PS3) just to play it more oftenWhile this game is significantly more fun with others, that doesnt mean you cant play alone and have just as much fun as i did. Not to mention that you can get a 4-pack of this game, for the price of 3. BUT WAIT! THERES MORE! Castle crashers is just one game from The Behemoth.I would definitely recommend their other game 'Battleblock Theater' as well as this.Mild spoiler: By the way. Don't pick the orange princess "

												Overall Castle Crashers has a great and unique artististic direction, which The Behemoth is well known for at this point. Castle Crashers also delivers a great game to play with some mates, some of the mini games can be glorious. The game I might add is certainly worth the price, even more so when on sale.Now with all those positives out of the way I'll move onto the main flaw of this game, this flaw being the game falls into ultimate trap for any beat-em up, the game turns into a keyboard or controller button spam murder fest, which certainly gets a bit old after awhile. And almost intolerable for anyone you might be sharing a voice chat with.			"

												Behold. Castle Crashers. Run around at the speed of sound playing as physically mutated knights with the power of Methane, Incineration, Cyrogenic Freezing, and Thor's wroth. There are certain methods that can be undertaken to unlock characters such as, Satan, Darth Maul,♥♥♥♥♥♥Face, and Snowy♥♥♥♥♥♥Face. It is also rather relishing to capture and enslave and innocent animals that may be lurking within the maps many crevices and secretions, such as the BiPolar Disorder bear, and a lump of feces. The online capabilities, however, are more laggy than Susan Boyle's buttocks. Other than that, I reccomend this game for people who can't run Runescape. Like me.			"

												A friend of mine said it best, it's like goldenaxe with pvp elements. Typical medival fantasy story where a black mage comes into the castle stealing all the princesses and the white crystal and you being the knight must go and return peace to the land (and the crystal/princesses). Up to 32 playable chars, 83 weapons to find and pets lots of pets. Nice simple controls and a classic beat em style gameplay, this is a fun one regardless of solo or team play.			"

I really liked the gameplay though some parts are challenging on your own. So if you think your ready to put your blade to the test, go on and slaughter creatures, saves princesses, and make out with them hardcore style. Then would you be a real knight.(8/10) Very fun and humorius. Love to play it, but can be a bit challenging			"

												This game sponsored me my friend for which I'm thankful.What can I say about Castle Crashers? I wish that this game wasn't so short (like every good game seems to be too short) but because of cooperative it give us a big opportunity to back here and play again and again in different squads.The plot is simple - something has been stolen and we have to get it back. Game is not difficult... Ok, sometimes you have to play again because of dead but this game is more to chill out than to ""Arghh I dead 20th time! It makes me so angry"". What I like in Castle Crashers is that it's simply funny. On every step there are things that make you smile or even laugh (especially when You are playing with somebody). Cartoon graphics and animations looks really good. Soundtracks are also very well, great suited to each level. It's good game to relax and check out if you can still play games in which the mouse is not necessary.			"

												Personally, this game is one of my favorites, and I would 100% recommend this to anyone who likes having a good time when playing games. The story is a bit ridiculous, but in a good way, and the levels manage to stay interesting throughout the whole game. This game is perfect to play with friends.			"

Only downer is when you replay the enemies take ages to kill even the trash which just feels like its eating your time.

												The cartoony 2 1/2d revives that old nostalia that I sincerely hope you have for games like LOZ and Street Fighter. The art style also allows people with lower performance computers (Like myself for my first 15ish hours) to run it seemlessly. Throughout the game you'll keep finding new weapons that you can swap at will to gear towards the playstyle you want, but their stats and discovery locations are carefully built so that you'll have a hard time feeling overpowered (Even with the jump/light attack combo that allows to fly around the stage invincible beating the stuffing out of an enemy or two)			"

												This game is the definition of ""F**k yes! Let's play (insert game title here).""Castle Crashers offers a widespread of dark comedy, poop jokes, and just flat out fun. Like other reviews said, this game is definitely perfect for having 3 buddies over, pizzas and soda. Last night I gave out two CCs to two other friends, we played for three hours and we never realized until one of us said ""Holy s**t it's 2:00 am.""Castle Crashers has a variety of characters, weapons, animal orbs, and just s**t jokes.My favorite character is essentially the Peasant, but he's not unlocked on here. Many people say ""Let's look at reviews and see how great this game is."" You can see after you visit the store page, in somewhat top right corner, it will show the overall of unrecommended and recommended reviews. As you can see, it says ""Overwhelmingly Positive.""This means that people ALL AROUND THE WORLD have reviewed this game on this application we call Steam.It means that (those who have discovered this game and have played and made reviews about this) they love this game, and they should showcase it to the world and recommend it to those who in the future visit the store page and want to read other players' reviews.All in all, this game is very solid, has few bugs and glitches, a very selective variety of characters, animal orbs, weaponry and humour.I'd give it a solid 8/10This game never gets old, unless you're stuck on a level, then you ragequit.

												Loved that they made this game available for PC play. The default key bindings are wonky and I feel they were poorly chosen for someone without a controller. This game really isn't difficult without a controller, I'm not sure why they are pushing for one so hard. An easy recustomization of your key bindings isn't too hard. Fun overall old gem of a game. It was great for the era it came out in and is still fun to replay to this day.			"

 ✓ My Rating ✓ :   9/11    8.5/10	  PROS: ✓ Fine Selection of Starter Characters✓ FinER  Selection of Unlockable Characters (which you will unlock as the game progresses & also work for)✓ XP Leveling System which will take a high level to fulfill all attributes (if your into completing the game 100%)✓ High Replay Value! (To Unlock more characters/ Playing with  Filthy Casuals	 n00by friends)✓ Story Mode Co-op (4 players max) / Minigame Co-op (4 players max)✓ Multiple Game Modes (The reason I'm nominating this game during 11/23/2016 for ""Best Game with in a Game"" Award)        Multiple Game Modes Include:  Back - off Barbarian:  A minigame styled as a board game that contains enemies to avoid at a constantly faster rate with more enemies to avoid spawning (Best done with friends so you can ""volunteer"" them to sacrifice themselves for your life)  (Also Contains a butt-clenching, soul torturing, undeniably difficult   ♥♥♥♥ING ACHIEVEMENT THAT I CAN NAY GET)    Arena Mode: A game mode that sounds exactly how it's named: Ya fight to the death with random people or your friends online.  Story Mode: Main Hack & Slash styled video game with some minigames & funny cutscenes.✓ Animal Pets that can actually help to boost your performance (Choose Rammy, trust me)✓ Free DLC if you own The game: Battle - Block Theatre (Sword & Character)✓ Unique swords with lovely designs and unique attributes/ weaknesses✓ Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich Steroids✓ Low Price (especially during sales)✓ Achievments & Trading Cards✓ Great Story Development  Also if you look in the background of every level there are Certain things that add on to the Lore of the game   CONS: ✘ Community has decreased in size (due the game being old)✘ The 1 ♥♥♥♥ing Back - off Barbarian Achievement✘ Minimal Horse Riding✘ Infinite Jump Combo (TOO OP IMO)✘ The 2 Paid DLC's don't add too much to the game, just 2 new characters with more swords✘ The Story is kinda short compared to other games✘ Some Repetitive movesets between characters			"

												CC is one of the best co-op games currently available, there's a story like every other, save the princess blah blah but the levels you come across are amusing and the enemies are for the most part challenging. There is so much replayability to this because once you finish it it just gets harder, like Borderlands, and you can start a new character and continue starting again as much as you like because you won't get bored if you're playing this with friends. If you are alone you probably won't have a grand time.			"

												The combat and characters are awesome and really fun to play with (finally a king from a video game who actually does somthing to save thier country!). All the enemys and levels are cool and the bosses are fun to fight (especialy the deer/barn chase section).However a problem I had was post-completion content. After you finish the game with one character you can unlock new characters to play with (actually you can do this before completing the game in arenas but that's besides the point). When you unlock the characters, all you can do with them is play the entire game with no differences all over again. What's that? you wan't to unlock ALL the characters? Well good luck  because that means playing the ENTIRE game 7-8 TIMES with different characters AND ABOSLUTELY NO CHANGE IN THE STORY OR GAMPLAY WHATSOEVER (you also play a different mode using a character you've won the game with but it's literally the same thing except the enemys are stronger). I just personally find this really annoying but I know of people who like this format.Aside from the whole ""replay with new characters thing"" it's a really fun game and actually one of my favourite Behemoth games (but you can't beat Battle Block Theatre).

												a really fun game with funny, quirky and just wtf moments. like when you go into a forest, where animal poop themselves and somehow jet propell themselves with their own faeces. or when you get abducted by alien homnids, and intterupt a large one while he's lifting, which then causes him to self-destruct the ship. and who could forget the moment you ride A MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAUR TO ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS EVER- oh sorry got carried away. overall, the game is fun too, with combo moves, magic and even different weapons and characters, like hatty hattington from battleblock theater, or the mediocre gray knight. the combat system is good, but i tend to juggle enemies. either way. its a good beat 'em up game with memorable moments, fun game modes, and a kickin' soundtrack (JUMPER AND CHAOZ JAPAN ARE THE BEST JUST SAYING). brilliant game for multiplayer with friends *cough* eddie pls *cough*. really reccomended from me, and the other 1 million people who own this gem of a game.

If ihis game is funny alone, multiply it by up to 4 when it comes to multiplayer, be it local or over internet.

												This game may not look much at first glance but what it lack in new age it excel in gameplay. But be warn tho, I've only played this on a game controller and, boy, let me tell you that it is fun. All my hours spent on this game feels like a lifetime of fun. Also, It also excel at coop roots. I've only played it solo and it can be frstraiting and hard at times but not impossible. Sometimes imagine playing this with a friend, and it seems like the best way to fully enjoy the game but this does not make it a bad game. Overall, a must try from me! 8.75/10			"

												Simple controls, simpler goals, mini-games, and loads of amusing weapons to collect. This game looks like a joke, and it kind of is -- a hilariously awesome string of trope-mocking trope-usage. The greatness of this game cannot be put into words, nor can the simple joy of playing it. Whether you want to hack and slash alone, with friends, or random people online, this game is just loads of fun. Especially if it goes on sale for cheap, you must crash the castle.			"

												This game is rather short, and even with a wide array of characters and secrets to find/unlock ultimately boils down for somethig repetitive after playing it for a good while. However, if you're a fan of Hack-and-Slash/Beat em' Up games, I will think that you will have a rather fun time on this game alone, and it's just a blast to play with with a full party of 4, or just with another buddy/brother/whatever. The gameplay is simple and easy to understand, and the the leveling system is in my opinion a lot more friendly than the usual since any and all hits gives you a certain amount of XP. This allows anyone to get stronger even if they're succesful or not with their current area. The bosses are more memorization than reflexes, so while it will be hard on your first tries, it will get much more easier to the point that it may get a little, how should I say boring? To me, anyways. While I do think leveling system is friendly in terms of grinding, I don't think it's friendly for builds. While cool, does not allow for hybrid builds on the get go. You want to max out a certain skill asap, and to me I just don't find much fun in specialization. This game also features a ""hard mode"" but it really is just enemies with more health for the most part.Finally, this game also got ported rather badly. All tutorials, button inputs are shown to only the 360 setup regardless, and default KB controls were awkward. I don't think it's /awful/ or comparable to others ports like Dark Souls, but I would absolutely reccomend to play this with a 360 control if it's possible. I also think that the default price tag may be a little to much for anyone remotely skeptical, but I do highly suggest giving it a go if you catch it on sale.			"

												Well folks what can I say about Castle Crashers that its ""fun"" that it's ""good"" well those words can be used to describe one of the best games I have ever had the fortune to play but they are poor . Castle Crashers is a ""beat'em up"" style game where you run around beating the snot out of hordes and hordes of baddies by yourself if you dont have any friends or Shouting profanities at each other for stealing the Bounce . With a very Chanllenging game style and a very clever Exp system this game will keep your enthralled for hours upon hours lvling your Multitude of ""knights"" did i fail to mention there are about 15+ diffrent knights to choose from each with their own Magic style .So in short a Great console game come to the greatest platform of all .GO AND BUY IT ...

												This game is a pretty solid game, where you need to either be patient or go in Leeroy Jenkins.Of course, like many games, there is a tier list and the character power difference from the best and worse is so horrid that i'm afraid I will never be able to finish Hard mode with Hatty, because Hatty in all essence just sucks.Until you meet the Ice King.Then you start to ask yourself ""Was this Bungie's prototype for Destiny?"" Because he ISNT HARD.HE JUST HAS SO MUCH  HEALTHJUST LIKE THE ENTIRETY OF DESTINY.Overall, pretty good game.

												Castle Crashers is very fun when you have a control and are playing with a friend or two. Other than that, I don't like it that much. But as I stated before, it is very good if you want something cheap to play with your friends, and with more controllers, 2 or three people can play on one computer, which is very fun. My brother and I spent an hour or so just playing the game, and we both had a blast. I would recommend this as long as you have friends to play it with, but other than that, don't spend your money on it.			"

It's largely cooperative and reminds me of the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game with over the top side-scrolling action.  Players fight over coin and weapon drops while tearing up the AI mobs of enemies.  There is an overview map that you slide along ala Mario 3 to play different stages.  There are pets that you can purchase who follow you on the battlefield and grant you bonuses.  There is a weapon shop where you each choose your favorite weapon.Play with a controller!			"

												Castle Crashers. Okay, it looks pretty comical, but I assure you, it's just as paced as the next fighting game.Now I want to start off not by listing things that you might already know, but by listing things that you might not know.For example, (and spoilers ahead, you've been warned)You get to kiss a clownJam sandwiches are this game's steroids. Litterally.You fight to the death with your was-comrades over a princess.You get to decapitate enemies with a broccoli stem.You get to ride a pooping deer. Actually, no. A deer that propells itself forward using said feces.One word: Aliens.Also, it's got witty inside-jokes. Thanks, Behemoth!Overall, I'd give an 8/10. If you're looking for some fun with friends, get this game. But be warned, the online community is a bit... empty. Only buy if you have friends.			"

												(this will be updated as we play) Castle Crashers has been a fun hack and slash adventure that really is best played with friends one key feature of the game and one a lot of people don't mention  is just how diverse each level of the game is so far we are about half way through the game and the amount of difference between the enemies and the levels is amazing! is the game worth its fifteen dollar price tag? depends if you play it with a friend and like the games sense of humor than i would pay 15 dollars for it definitely. if you go single player then the games laughs are still very much enjoyable and the combat is good and fun enjoyable and as mentioned above the diverse level design is amazing so yes to both single and multi-player. if you want to see our play through and (coming soon) official review of the game you can find the play list here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXtyQPPvmXBELWzJFQvn9cAwzGf5Xme4W "

												OH BOY do i have a lot to say!Let's follow the positive: You start with 4 knights, red, blue, green, and orange knight, each having their own elementred-lightning/electricity, blue-ice, green-posion/acid, orange-fire. You may also upgrade either defense,strength,magic, and agility. Including the skills and the knights, this gives multiplayer lots of possibilities, you can have a level 11 red knight and a level 20 orange knight. but there srent just 4 knights, you can also unlock other knights and also dlc, so it would be hard to call this game repetetive! This is a realistic game like battlefied, more like a cartoony hack and slash, but the visuals are still pleasing. Unfortunately, thats all the positive things i have to say.BUT there arent a lot of negatives, but multiplayer has WAY too much lag. And remember the upgrades? Those are use a skill mechanic, every time you level up, you get 2 skills, but once you reach the level 10 and up, it takes way too long to level up. and no matter what, you will always get only 2 skills, this makes it so that it takes way too long to upgrade, if we were to get 3 or 4 skills once we go over level 10, i wouldnt mind.So there you have it, MY PERSONEL OPINION of castle crasheroverall i think it deserves a 6, 7 or maybe an 8/10, but the multiplayer lag really provents it from getting a 9/10			"

												You and 3 of your friends looking to play something, but  you're tired of same boring fpses? You want something comedy/adventury? Well, this game could give you that! It's 2D sidescroller sword-em up. It is second The Behemoth's game and it's nicely done for their 3rd project (Because their 2nd project was just HD remake). Yes it has glitches but what games don't? For controls i'd recommend ya using controller. A.I isn't always smart but sometimes it's good, because even with bad A.I. Hordes of enemies can kill ya. The game is reccomended to play with 4 players but you can play it by yourself (which is less interesting because there's some mini-games that can be triggered with 2,3 or 4 players and boss battles are easier) Even DLC's are fair enough, the art style is well fitting with nice set of music. Sometimes the jokes are offtop. (Did i mention shitjokes? That's one of the Cons)8\10			"

												Dont know what to say about this game so here is a recipe for chicken curryRoughly chop the onion, transfer to a small food processor, and add 3 tablespoons of water - process to a slack paste. You could use a stick blender for this or coarsely grate the onion into a bowl – there’s no need to add any water if you are grating the onion. Tip into a small bowl and leave on one side.Put the chopped garlic and ginger into the same food processor and add 4 tbsp water – process until smooth and spoon into another small bowl. Alternatively, crush the garlic to a paste with a knife or garlic press and finely grate the ginger.Heat the oil in a wok or sturdy pan set over a medium heat. Combine the cumin and fennel seeds with the cinnamon and chilli flakes and add to the pan in one go. Swirl everything around for about 30 secs until the spices release a fragrant aroma.Add the onion paste – it will splutter in the beginning. Fry until the water evaporates and the onions turn a lovely dark golden - this should take about 7-8 mins. Add the garlic and ginger paste and cook for another 2 mins – stirring all the time.Stir in the garam masala, turmeric, and sugar and continue cooking for 20 secs before tipping in the tomatoes. Continue cooking on a medium heat for about 10 mins without a lid until the tomatoes reduce and darken.Cut the chicken thighs into 3cm chunks and add to the pan once the tomatoes have thickened to a paste. Cook for 5 mins to coat the chicken in the masala and seal in the juices, and then pour over the hot chicken stock. Simmer for 8-10 mins without a lid until the chicken is tender and the masala lightly thickened – you might need to add an extra ladleful of stock or water if the curry needs it. Sprinkle with chopped coriander and serve with Indian flatbreads or fluffy basmati rice and a pot of yogurt on the side.			"

After you beat the game you do insane mode which is extra hard and is a chalenge if you like to have a chalenge. The demo's alright but you can't do some stuff in the full game, but it's still good.

												Great game for everyone, it is quite an addicting game with many characters and many things to upgrade for each character. You can play with your friends, or alone, both is fun but multiplayer makes it easier to complete the game, but you'll have to compete each other for the princesses' kisses. I would give it an 8/10... well, maybe 9/10. I don't know, it can get boring sometimes - but definitely worth to buy! The developers (The Behemoth) also haven't updated the game for PC yet, the controls guide and new combos are still showed in the controller version, so you'll have to find out the combos by yourself or search it up.

												I am going to be Frank here. I have grown out of mindless games that only is about leveling up and hitting buttons (or keys) as much as possible. I get bored after five minutes with most games like that.A lot of Beat 'Em Up games (which this basically is) are like that. For mostly nostalgic reasons I can now and again play classics like Golden Axe, Final Fight or TMNT: Turtles In Time. But other than that... No. Beat 'Em Up is nothing that interest me anymore.This game though is very enjoyable. There is lots of humor in it. The game never takes itself too seriously which I enjoy. While some humor is very childish I bet most people will laugh at least a few times during the game or smile frequently.It isn't all about hitting buttons either. Whilst not being that difficult there are places where you actually have to use your brain to get through. I like that. The replay vaule is quite big mostly because of two reasons: 1) You can play with up to four people which make the game more fun (but a bit more chaotic). I would say the game is easier alone though in some ways. Which leads me to 2). 2) The system to upgrade your character. There is four elements you can upgrade during the game.. Depending on which you upgrade the game can get easier or harder. It's also fun to choose different strategies. You get experience directly for all hits you do on enemies in the game. So if you friend get fifty hits on an enemy and you one. You still get one experience. It isn't always much.. But it keeps the game in a good flow and is very fair. The more you level up the longer time it takes. Getting all upgrades will definitely demand more than just playing the game through once without going back. Playing alone, you will upgrade faster.From what I noticed the diffculty playing with friends or alone is hardly notable. But there is minor differences like more enemies in different spots. The diffculity goes up and down in the game. Some places you just run through and others will take a few tries. The game is quite long for a Beat 'Em Up but not compared to other genres of games today. You won't finish it in one hour the first time you try it though.. *cough* Final Fight 3 *cough*.All in all. It is a fun game if you want a break from the longer more serious games you got. Comes recommended all the way from Sweden!			"

												If your looking for a funny multiplayer birds eye view game. Your search is at a end. I played this game and busted up laughing at it's humor. I really liked the gameplay though some parts are challenging on your own. So if you think your ready to put your blade to the test, go on and slaughter creatures, saves princesses, and make out with them hardcore style. Then would you be a real knight.(8/10) Very fun and humorius. Love to play it, but can be a bit challenging			"

												Best game Ever...Nuff said.  Well Almost enough said... I would like to give this game an honest ""Review"".     Anyways the game at its current state in my OPINION is fantastic I have Beaten The Game on Ps3 and Xbox 360 and working my way on pc at this time! Iff you like 2d Castle Crashing awesomeness then this is a game for you.Gameplay: 2d action while being a knight fighting Barbarians,Ninja Pirates,Skeletons ETC topping that you get stats to upgrade with each level =Magic= =Agility= =Strength= =Defense= all changing over all fun and gameplay Wether you like using a bow magic or sword! ... Or a Shovel! WITH pets that grant you bonuses or even find items for you! And a ""heart"" touching StoryLineGraphics: Cartoony gorey awesomeness ""Nuff Sed""Fighting: This is similar to gameplay but who cares. So although it may a bit difficult on PC its still very fun not to hard to get used to Smacking enemies with a sword shooting people or even Burning someone! I hope this made you change you're mind on getting the game OR not never the less i reccomend IT.			"

												OH BOY do i have a lot to say!Let's follow the positive: You start with 4 knights, red, blue, green, and orange knight, each having their own elementred-lightning/electricity, blue-ice, green-posion/acid, orange-fire. You may also upgrade either defense,strength,magic, and agility. Including the skills and the knights, this gives multiplayer lots of possibilities, you can have a level 11 red knight and a level 20 orange knight. but there srent just 4 knights, you can also unlock other knights and also dlc, so it would be hard to call this game repetetive! This is a realistic game like battlefied, more like a cartoony hack and slash, but the visuals are still pleasing. Unfortunately, thats all the positive things i have to say.BUT there arent a lot of negatives, but multiplayer has WAY too much lag. And remember the upgrades? Those are use a skill mechanic, every time you level up, you get 2 skills, but once you reach the level 10 and up, it takes way too long to level up. and no matter what, you will always get only 2 skills, this makes it so that it takes way too long to upgrade, if we were to get 3 or 4 skills once we go over level 10, i wouldnt mind.So there you have it, MY PERSONEL OPINION of castle crasheroverall i think it deserves a 6, 7 or maybe an 8/10, but the multiplayer lag really provents it from getting a 9/10			"
