												I wanted to like it and love it so bad. I really did. I even picked it up on complete faith, based on the description and such, touting it as being ""inspired by classics such as Jak and Daxter and Banjo-Kazooie"". It's plainly using nostalgia to sell. The visuals, characters and soundtrack sure do, but something that went unnoticed during development phase, something important that all platformers need, that i don't think Mimimi figured was a big deal. But it is. The gameplay and controls of the game, totally clash with what it's trying to be 'inspired by'. A 'classic 3D platformer' has jumping puzzles, jumping skills to traverse difficult sections, and tight controls. This game has none of that. Instead it went for the 'Assassins creed' approach. Or as i like to call it, the ""Lazy platforming' approach. You hold a button to auto-jump off of platforms. Yes. That's right. Not only that, there are literally no jumping puzzles you can't solve just by holding the button and a direction. This makes the entire game and indeed, the entire selling point, totally moot. The game treats you as a platforming idiot. Unable to simply time your jumps. This takes all the fun out of the game for me, and probably, alot of you. There is no exploring by platforming or doing tricky jumps here, no sense of reward by finally landing that perfect set of jumps. They give you a beautiful looking world to explore, but limit and hand-hold you into every little thing you do. I wish i could get my money back, but as i said, i really tried to like it. The entire game is just one huge slap in the face to my nostalgia, its like the developers didn't even play the games that 'inspired' them. I felt like the game was treating me like a total idiot that needs to be hand-held. I hope this doesn't become the norm for modern 3D platformers. Don't be suckered in, just play the old 3D platformers, and let this modern garbage rot on steam.			"

												The Last Tinker: City of Colors is a 3d action-platformer similar to Banjo-Kazooie and Wind Waker (Zelda) with an unique art style (think DR. Seuss) set in the gorgeous world of Colortown. The color palette consists of reds, blues, greens, purples, oranges, yellows, and whites. The video settings are standard PC options- VSync, Texture Quality, etc. The game runs great on almost all PCs and looks great with any settings option. The Last Tinker runs on the Unity engine, showing us the versatility of the engine and how good games look on it. The engine and graphics are great and are NOT outdated by any stretch of the imagination.The Last Tinker's story is pretty straightforward and even sometimes ""childlike"" in it's presentation which is a downside, dealing with issues like racism, sadness, anger, and fear which is good for kids but doesn't feel the same for adults. But it makes up with funny and cute characters. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and some of the characters are really annoying and cliched to the 'T'. But I absolutely LOVE the world and the lore of this universe. There are three spirits in The Last Tinker, each has a different punch, a different special move, and a different problem to solve. You will find them throughout the story. There is the Red Spirit- Anger, the Green Spirit- Fear, and the Blue Spirit- Sadness. Each spirit is in charge of their own districts. Red Lizards (Red District), Blue Bears (Blue District), and Green Turtle-things (Green District). Which has torn Colortown apart and it's your job, as a Tinker, to bring them back together and to defeat the Bleakness (White).Sound is top notch, music is phenomenal, and the voice acting is comprised of oohs, awws, chirps, and other noises. I don't like the VA but you can easily turn it off in  the options menu and still have SFX and music on. The music is your typical PS2 platforming game OST with some groovy and immersive songs.Now to the gameplay! Platforming is done by pressing forward 'W' and 'Space' will allow you to automatically jump to a specific platform. Combat is really interesting. So you punch with 'LMB', 'MMB' up, and 'MMB' down and you dodge with 'RMB'. (There are also combos and different moves to unlock; for ex: 'RMB'+ 'LMB') The Red Punch ('LMB') can defeat the enemies in game, the green punch ('MMB' up) can make enemies scared and run into deadly traps, and the blue punch ('MMB' down) can immobilize enemies and are weak from the back. The Red Power is a, for lack of a better word, 'Berserk' mode where your DMG is up and your speed is up. The Green Power lets you freeze time to solve puzzles, platform across fast moving objects, and position yourself in a tough fight. The blue power gives you invincibility against anything including the snow-like bleakness. There are also light puzzles which can be solved with your powers/ punches or with Biggs and Bomber. Biggs and Bomber are mushroom folk that use abilities to solve puzzles and to get collectables. Using different punches shows off their different abilities. There are also amazing boss fights.Additional Notes: There are many collectables to get throughout Colortown. While some story levels are bigger, the majority are quite linear. The game is also really easy. And the rail sections of the game are completely annoying and are really blurry so you can't see obstacles up ahead. I finished the game in 10 hrs. and there is a total of 14 Steam achievements.Final Thoughts: I recommend this game to anyone looking for an old-school 3d platformer reminiscent of Banjo Kazooie and Sly Cooper. With that being said, the game suffers from childlike dialogue, story, and presentation. But overall it's a wonderful experience that's worth playing through a few times!*Review copy was provided by Mimimi Productions; Thank you!*			"

												Not liking what I'm playing so far. Sure it's a beautiful game and even though it claims inspiration from great 3d platformers\collect-a-thons of yore, a platformer in the strictest sense of the word it is not as it doesn't have a jump button. There's way too much automatic nonsense happening in this game for me. For instance, to run across some platforms on water you hold RT and watch an animation play out. To climb a rope\vine\ladder you hold RT and watch an animation play out. To swing across some gaps in the air...take a guess at what you do, if you said carefully time your swings and press jump at the height of your swing you'd be fkn wrong as all you're doing in this game is holding RT and watching some animations play out.I'm glad that this game was inspired by the games listed on it's marketing description however it does very little and I mean very little with those inspirations. Now I was not expecting a clone of those game because that'd be extremely stupid, but I was at least expecting an enjoyable 3d platformer but all I get is a mountain of dialogue (which may be good who knows), dodgy controls, boring\repetitive combat and some automatic platforming.Verdict:I doubt I'll finish this game so buy at your own discretion. Hopefully A Hat in Time delivers.			"

												The Last Tinker is a colorful 3D platformer that succeeds on many levels, but, as always, there's definitely room for improvement:+ Parkour running feels and works great+ Just long enough (7-9 hours) before it becomes (too) boring+ Has a bit more variety in its objectives/Tries to mix things up 3/4 into the game+/- Combat tries to mimic the combat from the Batman games but partially fails because it doesn't work as fluently+/- Graphics are colorful and abstract, but there's too little variety in the environments, except for certain colors+/- The puzzles are casual and therefore on the easy side, but still fun to solve- The parts that are on-rails are sometimes awkward to control and you sometimes can't see too far ahead which results in the character getting hit or even dying- Story and characters are a bit childish sometimes[Rating: 74/100]			"

												This is a very good game, don't expect something like Jak & Daxter or Banyo Kazoiee because it's very different and I'm not sure that this game should be called a 3D platformer (I think this game is better described like an action adventure game).This game delivers some platforming(sadly, with AC controls), some combat and some puzzles, none of them is done great(all  of them works well), but every one is delivered with the perfect  pacing that makes a very satisfying game, even if none of the gameplay parts are very good.Now, the things where this game is oustanding: it's very good written, the music is awesome, and. like I said previously, the pacing of this game is very  good.FInally, I have to praise its writting: this game presents very mature themes in a simplistic and kids friendly way, have well developed characters and a consistent storyline.

												EDIT: Whoa, okay. I had no idea the narrative would be so…affecting. There’s some very unsettling cues to civil war and unrest (it would go unawares to younger players), but the mature audience will surely feel as shocked and surprised as I do? Did not expect this, at all/10Pros Gorgeous, rich visuals Atmosphere reminiscent of ‘90s-era platform titles Solid character designs Movement feels neither jerky nor clumsy; controls are tight  Narrative appeals to young and older audiences alike Enjoyable music  Exploration is rewarded   You can punch every NPC in the face Ladybugs are crack—uh, paint fiendsCons Some might take offence to the ‘one-button-does-all’ approach to platforming Has somehow flown totally under the radar "

 This game made me feel like an 8 year old playing Spyro on the PS1 for the first time, all over again. This is a really good game!If you have any love for games with a charming world like the old Playstation and N64 platformers, this game is for you.I felt that spirit i have been missing for a long time while playing the game.It might have small flaws but i can easily oversee them considering the joy i currently have with it.The Last Tinker absolutely oozes classic Sony platformer charm in a way that I haven't seen for a long time. Yes, the game is easy and the puzzles are simple but that's not a bad thing, it makes it a relaxing and purely enjoyable game to play through. The low difficulty level also means it's accessible to kids which is great because this is exactly the type of game I would want my kids to be playing. So glad I didn't miss it. Also this game is a lot longer and has way more gameplay in it than i thought I would see.*Edit 23rd November 2016 --> i nomated this game for the autumn Sale :-)			"

												Has everything you could want out of a 3d platformer, except for good platforming :(I kind of felt like i was tricked in to buying it, Comparing it to banjo kazooie in its description and from what i saw in videos it looks awesome but unfortunately the platforming is extremely simple, and controls like assassins creed where you just hold down a button and the guy platforms automatically, such a letdown because the world, characters and story have all the charm you could want out of a 90s style BK-like game.

												The Last Tinker: City of Color might as well be a response to my silent yearnings for a generation of games that have all but died off. A vibrant 3D platformer, it aligns with both my love of games such as Super Mario 64 and Sly Cooper, as well as my disappointment with so many modern games’ dull pallets. But although outwardly it appears to have every element needed to position itself as a modern classic in a dying genre, when broken down it would be hard to mistake it for more than a facade; a game that at times looks and feels like those it tries so hard to emulate, but will never stand among them.Colortown is, as the name suggests, a world full of and built on color. Everything is crafted from paper, glue, and the creator’s imagination, creating a wonderfully bright and lively place to inhabit. But the citizens of Colortown don’t see it quite the same, having become disquieted with those who do not share their same color and splitting off into rival clans. The last bastion of unity resides in a slum of sorts, where we find Koru, the last of a race known as the Tinkers and the only one who may be able to bring Colortown back together after he unknowingly calls forth a bleakness that threatens to rid the world of all color permanently.The Last Tinker doesn’t attempt a very ambitious plot, and its racial undertones and messages against othering are about as subtle as a brick careening through your window. It’s a simple narrative that nonetheless proves unexpectedly entertaining for reasons I can’t quite describe. Characters are flat yet quirky enough that I didn’t dislike talking to them, and the dialog while basic is didn’t annoy me the way so many kids games tend to. The end segments unfortunately descend into a thick coat of heavy handed racism and the power of friendship with about as much grace as you would expect from this sort of game, but I was still surprised by how much I enjoyed the story despite it having every reason to fall on its face.While I call it a platformer, the actual platforming isn’t quite what you might expect. Utilizing an auto running/jumping mechanic similar to the Assassin’s Creed series, you aren’t required so much to jump from platform to platform as you are to hold down a button and direct your character which way to go. It’s extremely simplistic in nature, but to my surprise actually works well for the game more often than not. It’s fluid and very forgiving, which for a game presumably aimed at kids works well and makes it even more accessible than most of the genre. The levels you run through however are far less satisfying, rarely putting the excellently designed mechanic to anything more advanced than you’ll see within the first few minutes of the game, often relying on long tedious segments of empty terrain occasionally broken up by an impromptu enemy encounter (from which spawn further problems).If the platforming is an example of how to make uncomplicated mechanics interesting, the combat system is the exact opposite; a dreadfully monotonous lesson in repetition and over simplification, that although never difficult proved frustrating merely because of how often it intruded on the other elements of the game. It easily ranks among the dullest button mashers I’ve encountered, and the input lag took a considerable amount of time to adjust to (by which I mean to say I got used to it, not that it ever became enjoyable). You gain a handful of powers through the course of the game, but these rarely amount to more than a novelty (a power to make enemies run away, become frozen from sadness, etc) that rarely work when executed outside of areas purposely designed to show you how they function.Platforming and combat are easily the most prominent components to the game, but they aren’t what you will be doing most of the time. Instead of running through obstacle courses or beating up baddies, you’ll spend a majority of the 5-6 hour experience running from one place to the next, only to find when you get there that you need to continue running to an entirely new area. This is my biggest gripe with The Last Tinker; it builds up an amazing world and sends you running through it as if its building to a point where you’ll finally see the mechanics expanded upon (or at least put to greater use), only to have it end and leave you realizing how little time was actually spent doing anything of interest. It’s tedious and almost feels dishonest, but most of all it’s just a shame that so much time was put into crafting the outstanding presentation for the gameplay to not get anywhere near the same sort of attention, which ultimately makes the former rather superfluous.Be that as it may, I couldn’t end this without mentioning the truly fantastic art design and soundtrack Mimimi Productions has created. Color bursts out of every inch of the world, spilling over the Dr Seuss like landscapes and twisting architecture, filled with bizarrely cute characters that each feel distinct for the region they inhabit. It’s like someone went absolutely crazy during arts and crafts, and built an entire city out of clay and cardboard, which would actually be rather fitting given that’s essentially what the lore tells you happened. The soundtrack was the surprise highlight though, with an eclectic collection of styles ranging from soothing accordion pieces to catchy guitar riffs and sweeping orchestral tracks. It ranges a huge spectrum of sounds and surprisingly nails each one with more finesse than most games manage with a single style, and somehow makes them all sit naturally next to one another.The Last Tinker isn’t a hopeless mess by any means, but I was left disappointed by what could have potentially been so much more. I appreciate the developers making it accessible to kids, but doing so in such a way as to make it actively dull for those out of that stage of development makes it a hard game to recommend to anyone over the age of ten. Even putting the mechanical shortcomings aside, the unengaging and empty level designs make it a game that feels hollow; clearly missing something even when you can’t quite figure out what it is. It’s a lovely game to look at and features an excellent audio accompaniment, but it amounts to little more than smoke and mirrors once you realize how much was sacrificed in other areas of the game to make it possible.Full disclosure: this game was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer "

I've played through the full game in two long sessions and enjoyed every moment. I was amazed by the beautiful landscapes. I loved the musical cave. I had goose bumps when closing in on the game's finale. If you are looking for a great ride, an awesome emotional experience and a bunch of fun action gameplay then go get The Last Tinker. It's worth it.			"

												The Last Tinker is a charming game which quickly got me emotionally engaged and made it really easily for me to relate to the protagonists on my journey.The story is an all-ages adventure with exciting characters which all have their own motivations and place in the game world. I really liked the colors and the animations. There is no jump-button. All you need is to step off a ledge for example and your character will jump automatically. Similar to the jump mechanics in Zelda games.Almost all of the negative reviews of this game are complaining about this aspect because buyers were not aware of it beforehand.It is a solid game with some easy puzzles, a bit of character leveling, some secrets placed around the levels and enemies to fight. This kind of game is rarely found on the PC and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I suggest this game to players that are open towards all-age stories that come with lots of humor and some popculture references.It is uniquely charming and gave me a warm fuzzy feeling inside.Buy it cheap on a sale or at full price. You will likely not regret it.			"

												Very colorful game! The style reminded me of Tak & Banjo Kazooie (that's a good thing!). While the graphics and music may be nice, I felt like the game was far too easy. It wasn't challenging in the slightest, but I still had fun playing it nevertheless. I can recommend the game for its charm alone.

The colours are gorgeous and the story is really quite sweet! Exploring the dichotomies of strength/anger, curiosity/fear through these little spirit elemental guys as you adventure through Colortown was super enjoyable, and I'd totally recommend it if you're after something fun and easy to play through.

												Not surprising given the name I guess, but this game is so remarkably colourful and vibrant that in a sea of games that go for muddy browns it was a welcomed breath of fresh air. The character designs of the weird and wonderful people and enemies you meet also show a lot of creativity went into it. This is a rare type of game these days. As the developers themselves say - if you liked Jak and Daxter and/or Banjo Kazooie you'll probably love this.I was asked by the developers to take a look at the game in my first impressions series, if you'd like to see it in motion as well as hear some more thoughts consider looking at the video below.

												I may have liked The Last Tinker more if I had gone in with the correct expectations. This was supposed to be a platformer in the vein of Banjo Kazooie, but it is nothing like that game. There isn't even a dedicated jump button! Gameplay centers mostly around the primitive fighting mechanics which become tiresome very quickly. I want to love this game.

												First impressions are very important when it comes to making a game, and when it comes to this one, it isn't hard to see why a lot of people dismiss it as a ""meh"" game: Combat is rather simplistic, the story clearly is about the evils of racism and how it ruins communites, and infamously about how it feels nothing like what it claims to be paying homage to.But then you play a little more, and you see that the game touches down on more than just racism during your 5-7 hour adventure. It will delve into the dangers of excessive paranoia and fear of the unknown, tell the story of a man who wastes his life away at the bar instead of trying to solve all his problems like a man, and of course that there is nothing wrong with helping someone that you normally aren't really friends with.. In dark times, even the bullies that pester you need your help, and in turn can become a close friend.Combat, while it still is button mashy, at least gets a bit more interesting as you progress through the game, getting new powers that allow you to switch it up a bit, such as the power to stun a large enemy so you can deal a critical blow from behind, or even cause them to suddenly start running in fear off of a cliff or into spiked bushes of death. Late in the game there is even some enemies that require you to vary your attacks in order to beat it, so you can't just button mash your whole way, as well as the fact that sometimes you need to use a later-earned ranged attack to deal with other threats, giving you something different besides jush mashing the left mouse button.However, the game most certainly is no Banjo & Kazooie or Jak and Daxter, what with the collection element of the game being completely optional and only used for small bonus content, nothing really big (unless you like lookin at concept art), and the platforming being mostly simplified (I say mostly, because there still is a few segments that require your input, such as jumping during rail grinds and the general timing of platforming). Rather, this is more of a 3D semi-platformer bawler of sorts, and for the kids, I think it is a fairly decent little game. Not only does it leave you to ponder a few things afterwards about the content it tackles, but it also is a fun title full of life and personality, and a few chuckles here and there.. For the hardcore sort, however, maybe you might wanna look elsewhere, because while there is some challenge in this game, I don't think it'll be enough to keep more serious gamers engaged for long, as indicated again by the negative reputation this game sadly has.

												Story: 9/10The story really shines in the game with lore throughout the levels, and a great main narrative. The only downside is there's an opportunity for a sequel/post-endgame that ties into the lore pertaining to what a Tinker's role is mentioned in the game that they never take advantage of.Presentation: 10/10Wonderful cohesive visual style throughout the game. Bonus points for alterable visuals through unlockables. Sound: 9/10Good soundtrack overall, definitely worth picking up.Controls: 7/10The controls are a bit challenging, however it's forgivable due to the amount of attacks and skills loaded into the gameplay.Gameplay: 8/10This game is just very fun to play. One of the biggest criticisms is the semi-automatic platforming but it's not so much a platformer as it is puzzles and fighting. The gameplay has a great feel, the puzzles are fun and diverse, and even the enemies gradually level to require new strategies to take down. Lasting Appeal: 7/10There are collectables, unlockable graphic modes, cheats, and concept arts, hidden secrets that unlock achievements and more. Aside from adding DLC or more story elements once the game is completed, it has more content than you would expect and plenty to keep gamers returning. A level select mode lets you return to your favorite parts, each unlocked upon completion.Overall: 9/10Definately pick it up. This unique game is worth it, especially if you're a fan of N64 and PSX era adventure games.			"

												For two dollars (got it on sale), this is was one hell of a bargain!As almost every other review has stated, this game reminded me of Banjo Kazooie and Crash Bandicoot. Even though the game has a childish nature to it, there are many deep rooted themes that reflect today's society in America. I usually write lengthy reviews with in depth reviews, commentaries, and discussions, I'll keep this one simple and short, much like the game. Pros: Visually nice, reminded me of those old school games, and stuff like Paper Mario.Interesting storyMoral themes reflecting current life and views in AmericaCons:Combat is a little repetitiveShort game (quality over quantity though)Little to no replayabilityOverall, I read quite a few reviews that says the game is perfect to play with a young gamer. I am inclined to agree, however, there are small tidbits where adults will have just as much fun playing it as a kid would. It's like a Pixar movie: designed for kids, but perfectly playable and enjoyable for adults.The only real downside for me is that I do no think the game is worth $20. If it's on sale, I highly recommend you pick it up. Hope you all enjoy it!			"

												This was a wonderful game. It has a light hearted story but still has an important theme that it shows in ways that haven't been seen much since the beginning of the ps2 era. Playing through this gave me a lot of nostalgia for the original Spyro, Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, and Sly Cooper games. The controls are nice, even with a mouse and keyboard and it has a pleasant, even if somewhat youngish art style which just makes me remember the games that I mentioned before even more. As you can see from my play time, it is not a super long game, but I also didn't attempt to get 100% completion. The amount of time it takes does not take away from the fact that it is a very nice game to play. And during the 2016 Summer Sale it is only $4, which for those that worry about amount of play time compared to price, this should put that worry to rest.I definitely recommend it!			"

												With all the depressing and dull-colored games out there, it's great to find a positive and brightly-colored one.  This game is not only that, but has created a fascinating world to explore filled to the brim with weird and whimsical creatures.  The player is drawn into this fantastic world, and then forced to watch as it is brutally disemboweled.  Of course, it all works out in the end, but still it's quite the gut-punch.Most importantly though, it not only tackles a moral not often touched on in games, but it tackles it really well.  There's an interactive flashback sequence that lays it on the line, but doesn't hamfist it down your throat.  I'm probably not doing it any favors describing it so vaguely, but I don't really want to spoil it for anyone.  Just know that you'll be thinking about it for quite a few hours after you play it.While the game shares the same tone as the classic 90's 3d platformers, it definitely doesnt play like one.  It's pretty much the indie game scene's answer to Assassin's Creed.  Whether this is awesome or awful is totally up to the player.  I personally didnt mind it, but people looking for a straight-up platformer might be disappointed.But if you're looking for a gorgeous world with neat characters and a sweet story, then you should give The Last Tinker a try.

												I dont know even where to start, so much creativity here!This game reminds me and was inspired by Banjo Kazooie which is a good thing, level design is great, cities are filled with life, almost every citizen has something unique to say, sound is good, artwork is awesome, the developpers even got to the trouble of implementing a color blind option for disabled people.Overall it's a hidden gem that every platformer player should try out!Rating: ★★★★★			"

												An unbelievably beautiful game with great gameplay, but the level design is at times infuriating. Infuriating to the point of hating the game. I never found the game even remotely difficult, but I did find myself trapped because I managed to get on the wrong side of a gate, or wall, or be otherwise separated from something important that forced me to restart the level.This didn't happen once or twice.EDIT: There is a menu function that I was not aware of at the time of writing that lets you reset the player.I also think that the game needs to think about how it pitches itself. I bought the game based on the description, and the games that it mentions in that description. It isn't sufficiently reminiscent of any of those games for the references to be anything other than misleading.EDIT: The description has been changed.Patch the glitchesRewrite the description			"

Game for being unitedI originally got this for my yougest to play, she's 8yrs old, but after watching her play it seemed really interesting.I play it now and it is really cool.\Controls are very smooth and use full controller support.Graphics are very clean and crispAudio is very niceGame reminds me of a different era when games were about fun. Not about how realistic it is but gaming enjoyment.    It's not supposed to be real. :)Has an amazing message about racism in game. I personally agree with this games message do to the fact i'm white and my woman is black and we have 'mixed' kids.    (Don't like that word 'mixed').The game is actually fun and has a color-blind mode that really does work. (I'm color-blind myself)So if you are looking for something kid friendly and still can be played by all, this is the game for you.			"

												The Last Tinker: City of Colors is very unique and creative. There is a lot of love put into this game even its still being worked on. As far as Gameplay it's pretty standard. Combat is pretty smooth, and sometimes can be too easy, but if you put the game on hard you'll have a good challenge anything higher will make you go nuts trust me. Characters are cute and remind me and couple of my buddies of viva pinata, but with much more color hence the name no pun intended. However be aware that sometimes you will run into things like bugs, that has happened to me yet knock on wood, but the developers are very active as this game grows. As you get more and more items or powers challenges become really interesting and sometimes tedious. Might be because I suck at this game, but keep playing it because I the story is abstract and something I would've never expected especially for a game like this. There is a lot of light humor and it's great for a game like this. I would hope that this game gets released on a console like playstation, xbox, nintendo consoles because it would really work well.This game is solid and for all ages. If I had to rate it this game is 7/10 and although it's still in working progress there is enough content for you to play for hours.			"

												Well, I enjoyed that a lot. It's a bit of a PS2-era game in a PS4 world, especially in terms of the sparsely-populated world, but the imagination on display is satisfying, the story is quite sweet, and for a team of nine people, this is an excellent piece of work. The downsides are a slightly sticky control system (with a dodge which never quite works), and a very shaky framerate. But the upsides well outweigh those downsides. Recommended for a gentle weekend of nostalgia.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Mimimi Productions Publishers: Daedalic Entertainment Initial release: May 2014Genre: Adventure, Platformer. Action #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationIts so vibrant!The Last Tinker: City of Colors is a character action platformer with light puzzle elements. You play as a totally adorable monkey. The city you explore is wildly colorful and vastly vibrant. This is game developed by a small team and is styled in the vain of older style platformers such as Banjo Kazooie. While exploring and traversing the main areas the game does not actually have a jump button. Its more of a run at the ledge and it'll auto jump. Mildly Zelda-esk. And because of that it makes me a feel a little weird calling it a platformer however it's still relatively apt. This is a nice little casual game with a lot of character. Each area of the city and its citizens has a specific color that represents an emotion. The issue is some of the colors are absent and everyone is getting a little too into their own color. Its up to you to bring back balance. The puzzles are not terribly difficult, nor is the platforming. The combat is little shallow but there are upgrades to give it a little zest to keep it from becoming tedious. THE GISTAll in all, a very nice short fun casual game great for that time in between larger more intricate titles.Follow my curation for more "

												If I were to describe this game in 2 words, they would be: Spyro Nostalgia.Yes, this game is simple, easy, short, limited and childish; but the same could be said for most classic childhood games. It has small subtle elements of games like Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank, and Crash Banidcoot but more than any other game, it reminds me of Spyro. The gameplay, the progression, the story, the characters, the enviroment, the little annoying squeaky follower that talks on your behalf because your character is either a mute or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The list goes on...Back in the day when games were short and simple this could fly but nowadays it is much harder to compete with modern games. There I both recommend and not recommend the game based on the following:-IF you never had a childhood (Probably adopted by sterotypical overachieving Asian parents) and never got to play Spyro or other games like it then this game is probably a waste of your time and money. -IF you did have a proper childhood (Thank your parents) and/or still are a child AND played similar games such as Spyro or whatever then I definitely recommend this. Let's face it, the older games seemed like classics because there was nothing better to play then and in many ways are just plain and simple great fun. In many ways those games are arguably better than The Last Tinker and actually have more to them BUT they don't make them anymore. If you're anything like me you've milked those childhood games dry over time through Playstation 1, Playstation 2, Playstation 3 HD remakes and even Playstation emulators. The Last Tinker is the closest you'll get to reliving those types of childhood games.That nostalgia aside (the main selling point), the graphics aren't bad. The game has a very colourful, vibrant look but that is also due to the story line. No framerate issues that I've noticed nor any pixelation. No bugs or glitches. Simple controls, enemies and powers to learn. Decent soundtrack. Replayable missions if anything was missed. Easily completed steam achievements. Fun unlockable visual modes (Small heads, Big heads, Black & White, Colour Reverse, Mirror World, God Mode, Arena). No real overall downside to this game, only things that not appeal to your game tastes.P.S. This is my first review. Sorry if it was unhelpful, unagreeable or too long.			"

Overview:  This is one of the best spins on adventure games i've played in a while. It reminded me of ye ol' Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank, where you have just a simplistic complication, but don't let that fool you as there is more to this game then it seems.Story:  Being one of the few members of the town outside the major districts, your little community takes in all kinds of color'ed people and the town acts as a neutral settlement for people afraid of their own districts. Majority of the game revolves around the complications each of the 3 colors present to one another;Red most commonly known for anger and rage is well represented through the Red characters.Green, the curious types of people who turned coward, have more of a technological side with their robust defenses and how they live boarded up in their homes away from all the outsiders.Blue was the trading hub of color, which in this world was the biggest product that everyone needed and used. Although due to complications they all turned sad and depressed.At the very start it may seem slow, but if you pull through the excellent tutorial that is given and move towards the big twist that even I did not see coming, the game draws itself a quite nice narrative.Gameplay:  The combat after you reach the fighting part of the tutorial seems very bland, sort of a button mash really to kill most of the enemies early game. But I digress as the further in the game you play you can purchase upgrades and combo's for your attacks and also increase duration of abilities. This allows for people with different playstyles to work more efficiently and perhaps change the gameplay to suite individual people.The parkour element, a MAJOR part of the game is very well produced. The smooth maneuvering of jumping around on boxes and planks really feels fluent. It may be hard to understand at first but once you get through the basic of how to jump around without stopping to look around it becomes a fun experience jumping around and exploring to find collectibles.Controls:  A combat/parkour game must have a big majority of the focus on the controls, without doing so it could make the game feel troublesome to control and overall a bad experience. From what I have played of the game using my Xbox 360 controller (Yes it supports xbox controller which is a big plus for me) it is very difficult to get used to from the average buttons. The interact button is what would strike most people as the most unusual, as on the 360 controller it is (Y), and you will see why it is as you progress through the game.The combat portion of the controls amongst the parkour is also very fun to play with. It has a dodge mechanic which seems very functional when needing to dodge attacks, and can also be used to initiate combos and reach platforms if performed correctly.Sumarrising Statement:  This game may not be as extensive as the old PS2 games that this game seems inspired off, it does bring a nuance in this genre with its unique parkour concept and the difficult combat found later in the game. I greatly feel this game is well worth the $4 spent and is a must pickup if it goes on sale for lower.8.5/10			"

												This is a fun and peaceful game.At first I wasn't sure if I wanted it.But I took the gamble and it was worth it.The story is about reuniting the colors that once lived to gether red, blue and green.Something has changed them and you must fight the evil that has done this.The game has allot of parkour in it and it's mechanics work very smooth.Do I do wish they had added voices as it doesn't have that.

												One of the promises of the next generation of video games has been a departure from the grimdark gray color scheme that has seemed to permeate a good majority of the industry since Gears of War premiered way back in 2006. Titles like Sunset Overdrive and Titanfall have reminded gamers that there is a gloriously varied color palette out there. The story told in The Last Tinker: City of Colors seems to coincidentally mirror this emerging trend. The Last Tinker is a fully featured platformer set in a beautiful fantasy world with stunning graphics and CG characters that could easily be on Nickelodeon instead of fully controllable with a gamepad. It seems to be geared for kids, but N64 era fans of all ages will find something to like the world of Colortown.Read the rest of my review over at Geekenstein.com! http://www.geekenstein.com/the-last-tinker-city-of-colors-review/Hours played do not reflect time spent with a non-final build of the game.

												Overall, tremendously enjoyable- recommended to all who appreciate unique efforts in game design.  You will get your money's worth and support a worthy independent developer in the process.Pro:-Outstanding visually - the artwork and coloration are second to none;-Family oriented- utilizes a kid-friendly story to punch home adult themes;-Challenging at times, but maintains a casual feel with a great respawning system and fun upgrades.Cons:-A bit too childish at times - slightly corny with some elements of the dialogue;-Fights can become repetitive and mundane;-Control structure is basic and thus defeats some elements of challenge in traditional platformer titles- jumping, exploring becomes deceptively linear.I would have enjoyed the world to become open upon completion to track down the remaining paint brushes to achieve 100%.  The option exists, but you have to replay the game in stages, which will likely not happen for this player.To the developers- thank you.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time with your creation.			"

												Ignoring the fact that the game is falsely advertised as a platformer (read- there is no actual platforming in this game), the actual gameplay is pretty mediocre- too dumbed down for adults (brainless button-mashing combat + no actual platforming, again) and too annoying for kids (the rail-grinding parts and the part with the security robot really could have done with more play-testing). The writing's pretty lame (for kids though so it's not that big a deal), the soundtrack's decent, the presentation and look of the game world's actually quite good for the most part although the hero himself has probably one of the ugliest most unappealing character designs ever.While the game's pretty short there's a bit of replay value in the form of (mostly useless) upgrades and unlockable concept art, and despite it's short length it still feels dull and padded-out in places (eg. the level where the game suddenly becomes Diet LA Noire for a brief moment).Overall it's not a horrible game but it's not good either, and from a price standpoint, it's one of those games you should probably get while it's on sale since £16.99 for a 5 hour-long game is kind of a rip-off.

Do not buy this game because you enjoy easy games, there is a line between an easy game and completely unchallenging and this game is the latter.The only good thing about the game was that I got a refund on it			"

												Today, I’ll be talking about The Last Tinker: City of Colors. The Last Tinker is a puzzle/platformer for the PC from developer Mimimi Productions, which up until now has only developed mobile games. It’s the first game of it’s kind that I’ve played since my childhood with Spyro on the PS1. It’s completely different from the FPS games I play today. It was delightfully entertaining and easy to enjoy. The gameplay harkened back to the days of Ratchet & Clank or Banjo-Kazooie. The childlike art style was colorful and calming, as was the music.

												They claim this game is crafted in the `image` of classics like Jak and Daxter and Banjo Kazooie.The thing is, both of those games are fluid action platformers where you can jump.  This game is a clunky brawler where navigating any set piece with a gap involve holding the easy button until it works.So the image of those games are just bouncy visuals wrapped around a Zelda like game with minimal interactivity and mediocre design.  It would have been a lackluster introduction during the time of it's inspirations, and hardly a rebirth of the magic of yesteryear.  It's just a mediocre game that tries to oversell itself by mentioning big names undeservedly.			"

												Fun little game here. I enjoy it and the kids love it! It's not really anything like what it says it's inspired by game play wise.(There's no jump button. You auto jump like you would in Ocarina of Time and any other recent Zelda title, so you wont get any true platforming like you would in Banjo Kazooie or Jak & Daxter.) Due to that reason alone I think it's regulary priced a little too high at $19.99. It should probably be more around the $10-$15 price range but it was definitely worth the $1.99 I paid during the 2016 Black Friday Sale! "

												This game needs more attention, therefore this review.The Last Tinker tells a story of a town where people of different colors live seperated from each other, because of distrust and prejudices. It is the players task to overcome the differences and bring the city back together. The game is very atmospheric, colorful, funny and is adressed to younger players, although adults can have fun with it too. Besides the vivid colors, there is a great soundtrack which reminds me a bit of Bastion.The greatest weakpoint is the gameplay. I would not call this game a ""platformer"" because the jumping is done automatically. Combat is okay. Your punches can have different effects on the enemy, which opens up some variety.Overall this very kid-friendly game tells a nice story about problems, that we all encounter on a daily basis. If you can bear the lack of gameplay you will enjoy the game.			"

												TL;DR : Description gives wrong expectations, but the game is still fun. This is more an adventure game than a platformer.Many people complain that this is not a difficult/challenging platformer. But it's not meant to be. It's a kid-friendly, easy platformer. So of course most of the platforming and combat is easy, and a lot of things are automated. The problem comes from the ""inspired by"" part of the description. This proves once again it's rarely a good idea to say your game is inspired by this or that because people will expect a very similar game and be disappointed.The game may be wrongly advertised, but that doesn't mean the game is bad. You just have to expect a fun and colorful, kid-friendly (both in terms of content and difficulty) adventure game with platforming elements. Not an actual platformer like the two games this one is said to be inspired by.			"

												A fantastic and charming little game that reminds me a lot of N64 era platformers that I enjoyed immensely. The game has a very colourful world and a linear as well as a somewhat childlike story but was still a pretty fun experience. The gameplay consisted of some simple platforming which mostly took the form of holding a button as well as some combat that loosely reminded me of the Arkham series combat, though not nearly as fluid. Overall if you are looking for a colourful and feel-good game I'd definitely recommend this hidden gem!			"

												Let me start by saying that you need to play this if you have the slightest interest in platform games. The further you get into the game the more inspirations you can see the developers adapted and put their own spin on it. If you like Psychonauts, Mario Sunshine, Banjo Kazooie, Jak and Daxter then this game is a must play. Everything feels nostalgic and really great.The story itself is surprisingly good and it was enough to keep me interested throughout. There wasn't a point when the story got in the way or pushed it in your face, it was subtle and benefited strongly from that.The visuals are super colourful and the art style is impressive also. The character and world designs never got boring. The game also supports colourblind mode in case you need that.The only negative I can think of is the combat, the game kinda forces you to use certain moves to kill certain enemies. Some of them will be shielded, some will just kill you in 1 hit. While it adds a lot of variety in combat it sort of gets repetitive. It has a combo system that's hardly implemented which is a shame. And seeing as fighting is what you do 80% of the time it kinda slows the pace down.You should highly consider playing this tho. It took me around 8 hours to finish on and off. Aside from the story there are collectibles to find also, you can go back to areas at anytime in case you missed them giving it more replay value.			"

												Fantastic little casual game if you are a fan of the older exploring platformers like Spyro / Jak and Daxter.

												People that give a negative review are way too overly negative. They complain about the game not giving you the ability to jump whenever, or the game not being collectathlon enough. What I have to say about that is: This game is it's own game, not something based off of the old games we know of. It is inspired, sure, but at the core it's it's own game. It has really clever level design and the music + atmospehre is just superb. The fact that you don't have to manually jump whenever it's needed makes the platforming in the game so much easier, as well as pleasant.This game really brought back good old nostalgia feelings - that you can find in games such as ""Ty The Tasmanian Tasmanian Tiger"".I was almost scared away from this game because of how utterly abhorrent the negative reviews on this game were. I'm really glad I didn't though, because this game is a hidden gem and I am SUPER HYPED FOR THE SEQUEL!Though some moments were actual BS, but maybe that's just because I played on ""Insta Death"" mode. Though the rail-parts can be improved, because some moments the moment you need to jump isn't obvious or difficult to nail down and the camera sometimes disorients you like crazy.But they were simply minor annoyances.I rate this game 93/100. It made me smile almost the entire time I played it (On the HARDEST difficulty possible, I might add)			"

												I got this game in wintersale 2014 and just played recently (mid 2015). First, I already saw the demo of this game from casual connect Asia 2014 but I didn't have chance to try it. Ok, here is my first impression after 30 minutes of playing:- first opening scene is great. The narrator explains the current world and who you are- art is amazing, but too colorful..  I meant I got dizzy after half hour playing it. They put color blind mode but that's not the one I was looking for, maybe something to put the texture back to ""less color"" would be nice- music is great, the guitar is kinda repetitive though.  It might be just my preference - the visual effect is greatI recommend this game if you like 3D action adventure (can't say it's a platformer without having a button to jump)But if you have problem with too many colors, I don't recommend this game for you. Let's see if I have some other time and able to play longer, I'll edit my review about getting dizzy "

												It feels kind of harsh to judge a game on what it isn’t rather than on it’s own terms, but like many others I bought City of Colours on the strength of the description. Inspired by Banjo Kazooie and Jak and Daxter. If you’re going to namedrop to sell, then you can’t be surprised when you’re compared directly to those games.This game shares almost nothing with those classics except for a twee art style. Those games are defined by platforming, collectables and an open structure, where players can take on challenges in whatever order they wish. The Last Tinker is an entirely linear game with no jump button. Platforming challenges consist of nothing more than holding a trigger and moving the stick forwards, similar to Zelda games – it’s almost entirely automated and thus entirely unengaging.The rest of the game consists of tepid, unchallenging puzzles punctuated by perfunctory batman style combat. Occasionally there’s an utterly rote boss fight. I know this is a game aimed at children, but even by those standards the game is coddling and witless. It falls in that uncomfortable middle ground where it’s far too childish for older kids whilst being too mechanically complicated for little ones. If you’re wanting a 3D platformer of old, give this one a miss – it is not what you want it to be.			"

												An absolutely beautiful game that has a lot of love put into it. I've played quite a few hours now and have really enjoyed the bright colourful, great controls, and lovely story. If you love 3rd person platformers like Banjo Kazooie, check this game out! I have some gameplay of the game here:

												There was not a single thing I liked about this game. The camera movement is jerky due to high mouse sensitivity, most of the audio is totally grating, the controls are awkward, and many actions are automated (such as jumping and climbing) so you feel limited. The guidance during gameplay is unbalanced, with too much at times and none at all others. But probably the worst thing is the health system. Though it claims you have a health bar and that after so many hits you die, when you take any damage at all, you respawn back at the last checkpoint. This makes progression maddening in certain areas. Even after fiddling with the settings and switching to a controller, any improvement was minimal at best. It definitely isn't worth full price; when I bought it, it was on sale for $5, but it isn't worth even that.			"

												Whoa!  This is probably one of the best games I've seen in years.  The attention to detail is amazing, and all the elements work together perfectly.  I played this with my flatmates for a bit and the story and colour make it a great game to watch as well as play.  It brought back memories of those old 3D games Nintendo brought out - Zelda, Banjo Kazui, etc.  A lot of fun, and well worth the price.  There are a number of different difficulty settings, including one for kids.Sorry this review is a bit all over the place.  The game isn't.  It's slick and beautiful, and still light and fun.  Awesome fun.			"

												Though the game is a bit lacking in gameplay it has a good amount of creativity and was an enjoyable experiance to say the least. The biggist issue with The Last Tinker is that it focuses a lot on it's combat which, in my opinion, is the worst part of the game. Check out my Quick Peek for more information on the game.

												Repetitive, tedious and frustrating.Okay, this is not a *horrible* game, but it ain't too great either. The most positive things I can think of are good graphics and it seems to have a decent storyline (I guess). But the camera views are difficult and frustrating. The part of the game I am currently on features very bland, repetitive, boring combat. You have to run half a mile (slight exaggeration) away from an enemy, then quickly turn around to face him and then shoot beams at him. Problem is, by the time you've turned around and aimed at him you only have two seconds to fire beams at him before you have to run away again. Those beams are your ONLY way of fighting the enemy and you have to hit him a whole bunch of times, so these battles are lengthy and tedious. Mind you, there were earlier parts of the game that had better combat in which you punch and physically hit enemies, and this might just be a phase I'm on now. But why include this phase at all? And will this phase return later on? The poor camera controls add to the tedious and frustrating nature of the game. One final flaw I'd like to mention is that the whole game seems just a little laggy and jumpy. I'm using Intel HD Integrated graphics (no dedicated graphics card), but Mass Effect 2 runs perfectly on my computer and this game runs... sluggishly. It's as if the camera cannot keep up with the action and some frames are skipped.I have enjoyed parts of this game but there are flaws which cannot allow me to recommend it.			"

The Last Tinker: City of Colours is an incredibly enjoyable title that I personally had a huge amount of fun with, although it lacks in depth and many of the mechanics feel overly simplified and out-dated. The visual style is absolutely fantastic and the game does exactly what it sets out to do, that being capturing the charm of old-school adventure games.Final Verdict:+ Charming visuals.+ Well realised and detailed world.+ Nicely designed puzzles and challenges.+ Relatively simplistic but enjoyable narrative.- Minor optimisation issues.- Out-dated mechanics and gameplay.Below is an old video ""preview"" of the early preview version:

												A very joyful and colorful 3D Platformer, that honestly anyone, at any age can enjoy. It wasn't a very long game, nor was it very hard one, but when I finished the game, it left me with a overall good experience, and it makes me want to go back and find the remaining collectables and get the last few achievements.The game isn't very hard. Which allows for anyone, at any age to play and enjoy the game. There is no precision platforming, because it is removed by some ""almost automatic"" jumps. There are a ton of save stages, which means if you die, you don't have to start all over again, and if you ever get lost, then you can always ask your little helper to show you in the right direction. Some people would say that this makes the game too easy, but I honestly don't mind.The game has a good story, with perhaps some very stereotype characters, but this doesn't matter, because they fit very well into the whole world and the story. The game has a very good progression system, by constantly adding new abilities, mechanics, areas and new enemies. Atleast it never really got dull for me. The game also had some very good humor, which made me chuckle quite a bit.Finally the game also tries to teach you about a few things, that translates very well into the real world, but that you must discover for yourself :)I bought the game during the autumn steam sale and I certainly got my moneys worth. So if you are into 3D platformers, and don't mind one of the easier ones, then you should honestly consider picking up this game.			"

												It's okay, and the art style is really neat, but all the platforming is automatic. You just hold the ""parkour"" button and hold forward. Therefore I am dissapointed, because I was expecting a more traditional 3D platformer that actually has a jump button (it is currently advertised as being inspired by jax and daxter and banjo kazooie, both of with have actual platforming). Also, I know this is an idie game, but the music is extremely bland and repetitive. Investing a bit more in the sound is really needed considering it is not very skill based and more of an adventure game.			"

												IN SHORT: This is a wonderful game if you like colorful worlds, a nice (and surprisingly touching) story and easy-going gameplay. It is a smooth ride with the occasional challenge here and there. Clearly the makers put in a ton of love and it shows this everywhere.Full review below.Pro+ Vibrant and colorful world, bitesize levels which fit together coherently.+ An easy and relaxing ride.+ Nice story with some clever morals (great for kids as well!)+ If you look carefully, eastereggs + collectables.+ Good mechanics around fighting and solving puzzles.+ Amazing soundtrack!Con- Not for people who look for the ultimate challenge.- Not exactly ""platforming"", this is automated platforming.Playing The Last Tinker was a great experience. It reminds a lot of the platform games of old, like from the N64 period. But let's get one thing out of the way straight away: this game took a simpler approach to platforming. In terms of gameplay this means 2 things.1: It removes all challenge for the real platforming fans out there.2: this means the game needs to deliver in different areas to make it up.In my humble opinion I would say it does the latter nicely. The charm of this game is unmistakeable. The game is set in one big colorful world split up in bitesize levels and is really fun to explore. At some point in the story the world is attacked by the ""bleakness"" which is draining all colors. This means you usually get to see 2 versions of a level. One filled with bleakness and one where it has been cleansed. It is rewarding to return the world to its original looks.The game has a great story which dares to touch our world's problems (racism for one). Also I could not help but start caring for the inhabitants. Even though communication is done via simple text clouds, it manages to convey the message how the creatures feel about all the happenings. Some are scared, others angry, others sad and hopeless. Not only does this fit with their colors, but it also makes sense and is relatable.Apart from the ""platforming"" the game offers just enough combat varience and puzzles to be entertaining. Think along the lines of opening doors by pressing buttons, lowering bridges, guiding helpful creatures with their own abilities (like exploding), finding keys or items, etc. Nothing new, but entertaining anyway.I also like how the creators experiment with different genre types (even trying ""noir"" at some point), and how they created some mini-games which actually complement the story.To top it all off, this game has an amazing soundtrack. Each part of the world is complemented by its own instrumental style. I especially liked the music from the noir level and the blue world in general.I would say this game is just long enough for what it tries to accomplish. I have had a great time and even felt some genuine emotion here and there. Technically this game also performs great. I had no bugs or issues at all, had steady FPS (though to be fair my pc is quite strong), and found the controller support excellent.As I wrote above, this game clearly shows the creators invested a lot of love.Therefore I would recommend The Last Tinker to any gamer looking for a relaxed experience.

												The Last Tinker is a very imagnitive and fun game with some issues.At the beginning I wasn't a huge fan of the platforming, as you just hold down a button and then run towards the directions you want to jump, but after a while it felt natural. It just made the platforming easier. You don't have to worry about making the jump, only the timing.The combat system is really weird to me. It felt like a less polished version of the Assassins Creed combat maybe. I never really figured out how to block/evade attacks and at some point the combat got really hard for me. But then you gain powers which completely change how combat works and suddenly it was too easy.The setting is a world, where the colors are divided into their own parts. So there's a red area, a blue area and a green area. Then in the middle, there's an area where they mix. I have to say I got the idea of the story, that there's different tribes for each of the three colors, but only having such strong colors on the screen at all times made the visuals a little tiring to me. The design of the world wasn't 100% to my taste. Some characters didn't look very polished and a little uninspired.But despite these flaws, I kept coming back to the game until I beat it. It's a very unique experience. The gameplay is mixed up frequently so it never really gets boring, I especially liked the boss battles. While the story wasn't all that gripping, I thought the dialog of the NPCs was quite funny. I just wanted to keep going to see what would happen next.			"

												Disclaimers:I'm a pessimist.I lack much of a sense of humorI dived into the game on the hardest difficultyI play on LinuxIt's really hard for me to give the pros of a game, so I'll just list the cons. Don't take it as a bad thingAt first, the gameplay turned me off. It immediately felt really on-rails with its jumping system (pretty much automatic, uncontrolled). But it didn't bother me much after a short time.It took some time to learn that there were even enemy projectile impact indicators on the ground, and even when I learned it they were often difficult to see, especially when I didn't explicitly notice the enemy creating them was around.There were occasional performance problems. They took away from it only a little, but there was only one point where I felt I could blame death on it (The first double sign on a rail).There were only two points in the game where I felt a little cheated.First, when fighting one of the spawner mini-bosses, especially the first one as I did not have a ranged attack at the time, the boss would hit me very soon after I threw the last punch before they retreated and started spawning enemies again. It wouldn't have been an issue if I wasn't on the hardest difficulty, but I was, so I would die instantly and have to restart. Once I got the ranged attack I'd just avoid using melee attacks against it, though.As a rail was curving upwards and I'd jump too early, feeling like I should reasonably make considering the angle.On that note, cutscenes were generally unskippable (at least, as far as I can tell while playing), so dying repeatedly on some areas felt especially tedious.For being on the hardest difficulty, the game didn't feel too difficult. Maybe it was immediately getting used to the mechanics like that which made me feel that way. But there were only a few points where I would die (though usually at least a few times before I got through).The story was fairly predictable, but considering the generally childish theme of the game, my expectations were low. There was a single 'swear' that took me a little off guard.The game was pretty linear, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Despite all of that, I enjoyed playing the game (especially the boss fights) and learning about Colortown and its inhabitants. I certainly didn't regret my purchase and would recommend it if these issues aren't too much for anyone.			"

												Rating 6/10Overview: Third Person PlatformerThe Good:+ Vibrant, colorful graphics+ Charming story + Easy Achievements+ Controls well+ Over 20 levels The Average:Boring main character Level Design is linear and basic.  Combat consists of punching and dodging. You can punch enemies with different colors producing different effects. Dodging is somewhat useless as you can just run away before the enemy attacks. ""Platforming"" is done automatically holding down a button  Conclusion:According to the description ""A joyous action adventure lovingly crafted in the image of all time classics such as Zelda, Jak and Daxter and Banjo Kazooie""...except this game is nothing close to any of those games mentioned. On the one hand this is an indie game that appeals to a younger demographic, on the other hand this game is very average compared to so many other games on the market. In the end, it's hard for me to recommend this game when there are so many other great games in the genre you should be playing. "

												First Steam game from developer Mimimi Productions and there are only a few questions where can i get a DLC with PURPLE/ ORANGE/ BROWN/ YELLOW/ RAINBOW TOWN PART? This game is from a small developer studio (look the credits and see how small the team was) so i can only hope they work on a second part (maybe this time we get more colors for our team and 2 enemies like black and his little brother white? I cant await it like white has ice levels where you take care to run not to far (ice effect) and stages with lighnings, care that you dont get blinded from mini suns and black which gravity black holes, traveling black holes, black holes that let fall things on you, earth traps like walls that close because chainging grativiyies or something else. I couldnt await a 2nd part <3. So this game has a really epic story core (sure its not so much story, but it has a great message and the end is really suprising. I LOVE JUMP AN RUNS AND I LOVE THIS CHARMING GAME. Its reminds me on good old times. Sure this game could be bigger but its fine and it could have more achievements (10 golden brushs, 20-70, cleaning a level and/ or cleaning a level total, more collectible items, some rare items to find or spots (easter eggs) but that one it has, has its charme). So sure its not a 100 % jump and run (jumping is more an automatically part) but for most fans it should be good, the game has i think 4 difficulties so for some i has a challenge too. Since i really enjoyed this game i give 92 %. If you rush the game you can get it trough in 7-8 hours so think about if you need a disocunt of 33 % or higher, but its worth the full price. Thx for reading.			"

												I've played a lot of games with simple combat, but they usually have something to make up for it. This game doesn't. There is no actual platforming, which I was aware of before I purchased this game, which I can forgive if there was something to make it engaging. The game is too simple and handholdy. It's closer to an interactive claymation movie than a proper game. The anmations range in quality from ""A potato beating like a heart looks more natural than this"" to ""This is smoother than my cleanly shaven face""			"

												Super colorful and fun puzzle game for all ages! Some of the puzzles are difficult, some of them are super easy to solve. Characters are enjoyable and really shares unique personalities, just like the color-spirits of Tinkerworld. Boss fight was for me, bit challenging, but in the end even I manage to defeat it.Highly recommended to players of all ages.			"

												What is there to say about a game like this. One that apes nostalgia so much and one that really does bring back that feeling of classic PSX/N64 platforming? Anyone that knows me, knows that some of my favorite games growing up were Spyro, Gex, Sly Cooper, and Banjo Kazooie just to name a few. I absolutely adored 3D platformers when I was a kid. Seeing something like this pop up on steam out of the blue was a very real, very welcome surprise. In a world of countless dark, edgy brown and grey, dirty games, Mimimi Productions picked the perfect time to put this game out there. It's strikingly bold color pallette was enough to catch my eye, and after not only watching the start of a live stream with the dev, but speaking to one of the devs herself/himself who was nice enough to answer my many questions on the game, I knew this was a company that deserved every penny. Let's be extremely clear on this: This is a kid's game. There is no deep rooted meaning and the colorism ""Seperating of colors being bad"" undertone is about as subtle as a brick through a plate glass window. On the upside, it's not so overbearing that a young child could easily grasp it at first. There are plenty of references for long time gamers and a lot of enjoyment to be had with this title with little ones if for no other reason than it being a colorful distraction for a few hours.THIS PART CONTAINS A SPOILER...Now onto the one gripe that struck me right at the very end. Once you reach the end of the game, there's no going back to a fully united colortown to complete side objectives and such. To pick up all the brushes and ""complete"" the game. This is a pretty big gripe unfortunately because it kind of undermines all that you went through to get the town united. Not being able to see the fully realized colortown with all the districts means you don't really feel fulfillef at the very end. Sure you CAN go back to previous chapters and collect the brushes, but you'll be replaying the game essentially with the bleakness still around, again, undermining all the work you put in and the adventure you just went on. I don't know if this was a conscious decision or if it was a limitation, but it's the one gripe that I had to really dig down to see if it was worth mentioning, and I feel it is.NO MORE SPOILERS...So what are my final thoughts on the game? For the demographic it was made for, and for long time fans of classic 3D platformers I highly suggest picking it up if for no other reason than nostalgia. Unique character designs, bright and colorful color pallette, overall upbeat game with an interesting twist about halfway in. It's a really good game, and to hear that it's not only from an indie dev, but this being their FIRST indie game released? I fully support this group going forward and I can't wait to see what they make in the future!			"

												I am not normally one to write reviews for games, just not that great a gamer and don't think my input would mean much to  others out there, but this game? this game I HAVE to. This is an amazing game! Not perfect, no it has its flaws I will get to, but something everyone should try.First it reminds me of my old platform days, playing Jax and Dexter or the like, bright colors, silly sounds for voices, all of it is here. The plot is cute, and kept me involved with just enough story. And the story, well thought out and didn't end how I thought, very nice from start to end. Its controls are easy to pick up and get going too, no long drawn out tutorials needed here.Now as I said the game DOES have a few small flaws, but other then a making me frown a few moments, didn't stop me at all. The camera can get a tiny bit annoying in spots, like in some of the tight fighting areas. I did get lost a few times, and its a little dark on the 'inside' areas. Also, it felt a little short, and I had wished for a little more variety in enemies. TL:DR: get this game, its a fun throw back to older platform days that will have you smiling through it all, with a fun plot lesson to learn. It does have some control flaws, but they won't stop you from playing through this amazing game.			"

												I know it's a ""kids's"" game, but I don't think that it should stop the game from playing decently. It's a platformer akin to Banjo Kazooie, but there's absolutely no challenge to the platforming; the combat is bland and there's no the only real variation until near the end of the game; controls are bad, and especially horrible with an XBox One controller.Aside from that, the moral of the story is good, though it takes a really long timeI (about 4 hours) to get to the good part, which is near the end. What's also good is the soundtrack in a very few places. This game could have been much better, and I'd love a game that deals with this topic that isn't for children.So--if you're okay with slightly frustrating and repititive gameplay, and want a mediocre platformer, then--by all means--get this.

												This game gave me a very bad impression from the trailer and the description. It claims to hark back to 3D platforming collectathons such as Banjo Kazooie and Jack and Daxter, but collectables are not important at all, and are sparsely hidden as well. Also, there is no jump button, so it's hard to call it a platformer. The majority of the focus appears to be the combat and light puzzle-solving. The pacing is really slow, and the combat is simple. Early on a quest is for a (15?) hit combo, which can be done with a single button. Later on, attacks do get ""color"" added and become more complex, even if just by having three varients of the same punch (to be clear though, I only have one color right now, so while I have no reason to believe it will get better, or that other colors will be more varied, I can't for certain tell you that it stays boring.)  You can also use the game's currency to buy upgrades, but from what I've seen, it isn't anything exciting, nor anything I found more usefull than to mash the normal punch buttons. Maybe I'd like it better if I knew what I was getting into from the start, but even taking that out, the game isn't engaging to me as most actions are completely automatic, such as platforming ""assassin's creed"" style, I guess you could call it.

You dont even jump you just roll and it is so finicky to land on to the next spot has to be perfect, worse than in Assassins Creed I, Coudnt get past the tutorial.

Posted: September 20, 2014
												The Last Tinker is, perhaps, one of THE best games I've played in the past few years. The entire game somehow managed to mix a bunch of different things -- the old quirky feeling of games like Banjo-Kazooie and Spyro, the free-range parkour of Prince of Persia, an almost whimsical setting/look, an utterly terrifying villain/force, and a serious plot -- while still feeling like something completely fresh and brand new rather than just rehashing old nostalgia. Everything about this game is good, and the mistakes it makes are few.Let's start with the music. The music is amazing and well-made, and absolutely catchy at times. There is a point where the music goes utterly harsh and terrible (as in badly done), but that is a completely plot-related reason. All of the tracks fit their areas fairly well, and if there was any unfitting combinations, it was subtle enough that I never even came close to noticing it. In fact, the music is so important to the game that there are sections where you have to jump or move in time with the beat in order to progress, which makes you really feel immersed in it!The graphics are absolutely amazing. They tie well together with each other, and they look unique. Unlike a lot of other realistically-styled games (which could almost be interchangable), the whimiscal, I'd say almost coloring-book-and-culturally-designed-look of this game stands out; it reminds me of designs and artwork used for things like pinatas almost, with every character and area having multiple patterns. Every stage and character looks unique (group-wise, if not individually) on its normal design... until the Bleakness runs through and makes it all monochrome and same-looking. However, rather than detract from the game, it adds to it, showing you just how terrifying the force you're up against is and just what the world is when you strip away its individuality and destroy everything that made it unique.The plot and writing is some of the best I've ever seen. Like any writing, it can hiccup a bit at times, but overall it's absolutely fantastic, the characters are amusing and quirky and tend to feel unique, and even though he never speaks a word your main character feels just as unique as the rest of them. The plot, itself, is actually quite terrifying, and deeper than it first appears to be. Without spoiling anything, it's just as good as the rest of the writing, but stands with it rather than against it despite all the differences.Now for the negative parts.Firstly, the game can be very confusing at times. While you do have a way to show where you're supposed to go, it can be outright unhelpful at times, leaving you without knowing where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do when you get there. Usually, a mix of that direction system, backtracking, and exploration can help you find your way, but it's definitely something that can be a bit frustrating at times.Secondly, a few of the battles can be incredibly frustrating to outright unfair. Small platforms with shield-generating enemies and tons of normal enemies (that you can't hit until the shield-ones are gone) are not unknown, and a lot of the more difficult battles you can't actually run past and skip. Additionally, if you die, you have to start the entire battle over again. On top of all this, enemies can be placed very nastily and with far too many numbers, making just running through areas as fast as possible sometimes the best course of action, which detracts from the experience as you're missing out on the beautifully-crafted areas.Thirdly, the Color Spirits' powers feel vastly underused. While it does give you more in-battle powers and even a small handful of out-of-battle-powers, the game hypes up Koru and the tinkers in general as some powerful, creative force, yet you so very rarely feel like such a force when your powers are mostly just used in fighting enemies. This is especially true for the last Color Spirit that you get, which is only used for a single thing and only in the final boss fight.Overall, I would say that The Last Tinker: City of Colors is an absolutely amazing game. They do so much RIGHT with it, and it feels like an amazing, enjoyable, and -- unlike many games -- unique experience which is sure to stand out against the crowd of samey-old-type games.Pick it up. If you like platforming, or unique games, or fun plays, pick it up. Trust me: you won't be sorry.			"

												I went into this looking for something along the lines of the Nintendo64 games I grew up on. I was not disappointed, it plays like Banjo & Kazooie or the first Jax and Daxter game. It is a solid action-adventure game with good combat mechanics and a wonderful art. The story, if a little tried works well and the worlds unique nature and setting carries it well. As to the art, it feels perfect for the game, the cardboard, paper and ink fit the story so well. My only real dislike was the short length of the game, I was just starting to get invested in the game and the characters when it ended. Overall, it is a nice little tribute to the classic era of 3D games and a fun nostalgia trip worthy of a try. 7/10			"

												I found this game as I looked under the description Banjo-Kazooie and Collect-a-thon and things of that nature. I guess that would've been my first mistake, because I should've assumed that it wouldn't live up to my expectations of Banjo-Kazooie. However, I was dead-wrong. The Last Tinker: City of Colors has this sense of uniqueness that you just don't find in many other games. The heavy use of colors as the symbol for the entire storyline really spoke to me on a deeper level. The interactions between each color group pre- and post-unity is really spectacular, and going through Purple's memories really sealed the deal for me.Also, plenty of props to the music team on this one. You all really know how to get a mood flowing in each stage of the game. Excellent job.			"

												Not sure how I missed this one. Just picked it up on sale and am enjoying it a lot more than some of the reviews would have you believe. Me and my nephews are having a blast with it.I've read a lot of people complaining about the jump thing, which isnt really a huge deal. I've seen some reviews stating that the autojump goes against everything they were trying to recreate, but you can use something as inspiration without copying everything that thing did down to every little detail. The auto jump while not ideal works in this game and thats important to note. I would say this game set out to recreate the feeling of games of old and in that respect they certainly succeeded.While I have yet to get anywhere near finishing the game I can say without a doubt this will be a title I enjoy until the end. From a development team I've never heard of this is an amazing job on a great game.			"

												If you want a cute game you can relax and play for 6-8 hours and get a cute story in a cute setting this is a game for you. I think it does this job very well, it doesn't overstay its welcome and is pretty good at giveing you a new mechanic or puzzle every now and then to keep things interesting, and i even got a few chuckles from some of the jokes. Its a quality game for a fair price in a category of games (3rdperson adventure with platform like mechanic?) that doesn't often have this level of polish (in my humble opinion).However, if ur expecting a platformer with the depth of and Collectablity (is that a word i dunno) of banjo or mario 64 (or incert ur favorite 3d Mario) ur probably gunna be dissapointed.....or not...mabey u'll be like me and just find the world charming enough you forget about why you bought the game and start throwing red colorballs and bunnies to make them angry...or throw blue♥♥♥♥♥♥at lizards to make them cry....i dunno i'm not you though.....also if you wanted a jump button there isn't one.....but hey if u're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about not being able to jump i'd like to remind you that windwaker doesn't have a jump button and ♥♥♥♥ you if you don't like windwakeri'd give it a solid 8/10....its a safe game that acomplishes what it sets out to do and never seems like a slog...but i didn't feel like it did anything too impressive to stand next to the 3d adventure games of Lore			"

												The Last Tinker may not be THE best platform game ever made. However, it sure is one of the very best platform games so far this year. And it´s with no doubt (Whatsoever) the most colorful one as well. Feel the love people!Pros:+ Beautiful graphics+ Super nice Zelda and Jak and Daxter vibes+ A very colorful world+ Positive in-game messagesCons:– Sometimes it feels like you´re on a train– Auto jump, you can´t jump when you feel like it– Not very challengingGameplay: 3/5Graphics: 4/5Sound/Music 3.5/5Controls: 4/5Replay value: 3.5/5Verdict: 3.5/5

												I took a look at The Last Tinker and came away a bit less than impressed.  While the aesthetics of the game hit the mark dead on, gameplay falls far short in my opinion.  Hear my full thoughts and watch a bit of gameplay in the video below.

			We take a look at this bright new platformer from Mimimi Productions, supposedly in the vein of such classics as Banjo-Kazooie, but is it really? Is it even a platformer?

												This game claims to be a platformer inspired by games such as Jak and Daxter, which it is neither. I can't help to compare it to Jak, and it comes up short. First off, if you're looking for platforming it's not really here. The game does pretty much all of it for you. Second, the story is mind numbingly boring. Characters are boring and uninteresting. Third, the gameplay and combat suck. It's just unfun to fight enemies. Missions are do this or that and seemed boring. Overall, just a boring game. I've beaten Jak and Daxter 5 times and I could play it again while still having fun. This game isnt worth trying if you like old platformers, because it doesn't accurately give the same feel or fun. It does have a good soundtrack and art style though.			"

												My only complaint is ""jumping"" is rahter automatic. You hold forward and space bar and he jumped from place to place automatically.  Still gratifying.  The battles with the white enemy guys can be difficult (quite) and I'm only on normal mode.  The color and artwork is awesome.  The 3D feel is also great - very much feeling line the old nintendo games of their day.  There is so much going on and so much detail that seems to go on foreever.  I bought about 80-90 games in the past 1.5 years off steam.  Borderlands (1, 2) clearly my favorites, but this is a close contender) really since I got this I haven't been able to play anything else.  It's A LOT OF FUN. There is a lot of game play.  I THINK I'm about 1/2 way through it and I've played for several hours.   Less than 7 bucks on sale?  SNATCH IT.  Actually I'd be pleased at 9.99 even maybe 19.95. "

												Please do not be deceived as I was by the promises of Jak and Daxter and Banjo-Kazooie, which I believe only inspired the developers to make A game, not a game like the ones they mention. As you can see, I only played 30 minutes but that was enough to tell me that this description is false advertising and that is why I really dislike this game.Other that that, here are the bullet points:- I can see ""inspiration"" from LittleBigPlanet, which this game's art style and overall theme feel like a cheap knock-off of.- I was not looking forward to several more hours of the story, which I imagine would be like watching a cheap after-school special on racism on a loop for hours. Koru seemingly has no personality, he's just automatically great because every person you see says so, except for the antagonist.- THIS IS NOT A PLATFORMER!! It's a somehow more boring version of the traversal system from Assassin's Creed. Hold a button and move the joystick.- Combat is not at all challenging. It's button mashing and it feels weak.Summary: I feel like this is a game designed for younger players, but the developers are trying to cash in on the nostalgia of people that are a lot older than that. If it hadn't made this comparison, I wouldn't judge it so harshly. And I miss Rare so much.Just wait for Yooka-Laylee folks!			"

												Let me start off by saying this:If you're a PC player with an X-Box 360 controller, or a Mac player with a PS3 controller, this warning doesn't apply to you. I hope you enjoy the game!Unfortunately for those of us playing on a different gamepad, this game will not work. I tried work-arounds to get it going, with no luck. Looking at the Steam forum for this game, there is a large quantity of other buyers that faced the same predicament, and a number of them just chose to hide the game from their library. I guess this is what I'll do.The devs apologize, but haven't found a way to accommodate these players, and seem to blame buyers in the forum for not looking at the fine print of the support details. Fair enough.Aside from the fact that I won't be playing it, the game does seem interesting, and the visuals are very nice. Hopefully if these developers put out another game in the future, they won't make the same large oversight.			"

												Practically a walking simulator.Jump just happens automatically. So much is scripted. So, I guess it's pretty standard for 201x gaming :(Camera is difficult to control. (Would be nice to have a 100% manual camera with fixed movement ratio).IMHO somewhat repetitive music. YMMV. I just turned it off.Wierdly low framerate on RX 480 (on linux, 4.9 kernel, radeonsi, mesa). Needed to play with low settings just to get above 40fps. Again, YMMV. Other more demanding Unity games run fine. (However, even if performance was flawless I'd still thumbs it down).Written at ~100 mins, soon after I got red power. I guess it has to get more complex later on.On the plus side, the world is kinda inventive and so far the story has some potential.			"

												Unfortunately bland and boring. Also broken as hell. I experienced a game breaking bug making it impossible to play through.Pros:+ the story is okay, its more likely something for younger kids+ some variety in gameplay+ okay soundtrack, nothing memorable+ controller works fine and has a nice layoutCons:- I constantly came across bugs, it went as far as not being able to progress anymore, ( a security robot keeps shooting me as I spawn, no matter what I do, you are supposed to avoid cameras that will detect you, but its impossible)- this is a plattformer without plattforming. Everything is automatically done a la Assassins Creed, which is a bad thing- fight system is rather pointless, as there is no punishment for dying whatsoever, making it boring and giving no challenge at all- there is only one boss battle that is recycled multiple times......just lazy and boringI think even kids will find this underwhelming as its so boring and dumbed down. It could have been a cool game, but without any challenging gameplay whatsoever its not much of a game.			"

The combat was soooo boring and repetitive, should have more combos or another animation. Was thinking a lot of interaction in the game but yea again, not much.

												This is NOT PLATFORMER, even despite it try to look like it! Im so dissapointed, i was looking for old school platformer like in old good PS1\PS2\Xbox days but this game cheated me with false advertising, it just looks like old school platformer, but does not feel neither old school nor platformer. So much of wasted potential!Game looks nice, has creative art direction and ideas, i want to love it, but cant, because for frack sake - a platformer without JUMP button with automatic jumping and sticking to hotspots? Very very very bad typical modern yourh oriented brainless approved (y.o.b.a) design decision that ruins all the fun of game and makes it feel monorail and restricted, basically all you do is walking and holding ""context"" button, game does the rest for you. Reminds me a lot recent Thief reboot in terms of restrictions. I really wish devs to redesign it and give us freedom of vertical movement, but im pretty sure this will never happen, most of game devs never admit and correct their mistakes. And its a shame, game really has potential to be a Spyro, Crash, Jax, Banjo etc, but it lacking challenge and vertical freedom of movement, which is what makes platformer a platformer.			"

												The Last Tinker is a gorgeous, harmless romp of a game with lots of charm, but this may be a game best suited for children old enough not to re-enact Koru’s fighting moves on their siblings. I found the game very easy (except for the rail segments) and between the lack of a challenge or a gripping storyline, I had difficulty staying engaged to the end. However, this would likely be a fantastic game for parents to play with their children, and as such, it gets a solid recommendation from me.			"

I would have preferred a full 3D platformer instead of the free running, and more open exploration instead of the linear structure, but the puzzles and combat ended up being interesting. The developers created a very nice world to spend some time in.			"

												The creators of The Last Tinker attempted to create a 3D-platformer like they were in the good old days about ten or fifteen years ago. The intentions are good, but unfortunately the creators must have thought the development of this genre during the last few years was a massive improvement. There certainly were improvements like ditching the classic live system or autosaving. But for me, on-rails-platforming is not an improvement.On-rails-platforming means that the protagonist, Koru in the case of The Last Tinker, jumps automatically. You just walk around while holding a button and overcome the obstacles automatically. Some games like the AC series have an excuse for such a simplification: a lot of background stuff is going on which you have to keep track off, focussing on precise jumping all the time would be too hard. However, this excuse is not valid for The Last Tinker. Even though he refers to something slightly different, I would like to quote Ben Croshaw here: ""[...] there's no challenge to this! This is not platforming, this is just walking down a very unusually-shaped corridor."" Source (NSFW) Fortunately the developers of The Last Tinker made this observation as well and included timing sections to add some challenge to the platforming. (For the record, the same holds for the developers of Enslaved.) Enough about the ""platforming"", let us look at other aspects of the game. It is rich in variety after all.  There is some combat, of course, the common button-smashing combo-based combat. There are some railsliding sections, where you have to continuously switch between rails to not smash into obstacles. And there are many puzzles of various types which are usually nice, but not diffifcult. What I really like about The Last Tinker is that it tells its story not exclusively by the means of cutscenes and dialogues, but also by the environment itself. You can literally see how the city is estranged and united again.Conclusion: The Last Tinker has its weaknesses, but it shines in other aspects. It is not challenging, but also doesn't get boring easily. Overall The Last Tinker offers a very nice experience.			"

												I notice that The Last Tinker: City of Colors is often compared to Banjo-Kazooie and said to be a platformer. I don't think this is an accurate comparison. This isn't to say that The Last Tinker is bad. Only that other games bear a better comparison. I think that a better comparison is to a game like Beyond Good and Evil, or perhaps 3d Zelda titles. I hope the reason for this comparison will become clear through the review.First of all the platforming in The Last Tinker is context based and not free. You cannot actually jump at will in this game. You run at edges and leap to the next designated spot.  The challenge is not based on jumping onto difficult platforms, but on timing your leaps between platforms. The platforming is more a puzzle than a test of dexterity. The platforms can be considered more a mode of transport than the main challenge.   What you do spend a lot of you time doing is fighting. The combat is basically puzzle based. You have a couple of unique strikes, which are useful against certain enemies. You often have to choose which enemy to defeat first, and use your skills to keep the other enemies off you. The combat feels a little strange. You can approach the same battle in slightly different ways, with one time earning your death and the next trouncing everyone quickly. I believe this may be the result of the puzzle emphasis on combat. If you abuse your somewhat very powerful abilities you will win. If you go in as a traditional brawler and don’t abuse your abilities, you won’t do well at all. What I mean is that the combat is not nuanced. You solve the combat, you don’t win through strength or dexterity. This would make it similar to the platforming in that the challenge is solving the situation. Enacting your solution is usually quite easy.The checkpoint system is generous, and unlimited. So any frustrations that may be felt are reduced to very minimal levels.Puzzles are the fundamental challenge of the game. This is experienced through both the above mentioned combat and platforming, and also normal puzzles you would normally encounter during an adventure game. Challenges are usually not highly dexterity based.  You quite often interact with other characters to solve puzzles. The puzzles are quite varied. While no puzzle is particularly difficult, each puzzle meshes very well with the universe. In a sense, you learn about the world through solving puzzles.The overall story is very important to the structure of The Last Tinker. Every level feels like it advances the plot, and feels like a natural extension of the previous events. The exploration is linear. There is no hub and there are no levels that branch off. There is a continuous story. The levels are chapters in a story.  This means that the gameplay always feels wedded to the world you are exploring. I never felt like anything I was doing was game logic or ‘just because’ you needed something to be in the way. You spend a lot of the game surrounded by other inhabitants, and this goes a long way towards making the world feel believable. You interact with, if not every inhabitant of the world, what feels like enough inhabitants to understand and care about the world. And the main character feels like his contribution to the world is defined by a heroism of spirit, and not of being the strongest person around. The other characters you interact with achieve a balance of being very defined, and in a sense extreme, but also being human and relatable.The story is very well told. It has a fairy tale quality, which means that while the story is not complicated, it does demonstrate something fundamental about humanity.I highly recommend this game to people interested in an adventure built on a fairy tale style story and immersion in a fantasy world. If you are looking for a intricate gameplay based game then it is better to look elsewhere. "

												I do recommend the game highly. I have played it for two hours total, and that's all the game might get out of me.That sounds hypocritical to you? Let me explain.The games environment is wonderful, the combat is simple yet fun. The characters are also fun and I just had a smile on my face for the most part. The game mechanics are fun and has a bit of relaxation to them yet it gives you a bit of adrenaline from time to time. I enjoyed the story thus far too.The problem is, if you have any controller other than the 360 controller, you're going to have a bad time starting this fun game. The first time is fine, second time maybe too. But after that, you won't be able to load your game. They have a major bug with other controllers (Xbox One for me) that forces you to scroll through the menu to the left constantly. Also any other settings you'd want to change with the controller are impossible. I set my controls in the beginning to controller only and even if I pull out my Xbox One controller, to try and navigate, I won't have much luck. Some button placement is also not properly linked with any controller other than the 360.So if you have a 360 controller, you'll love this game. If you have any other controller, it's better to skip the buy and wait for the company to fix it. I will just hope they'll fix it. Because it might be a game I'd want my future kids to play, but there won't be any 360 controllers around anymore by then, so they game would literally die out at one point.			"

												I had really low expectations going into this game, but I was surprised by how good it actually is. There is a lot of variety and cool ideas in terms of gameplay, it doesn't really get boring. The story is definitely not the best thing about this game; it's a bit inconherent and simple (it's a kid's game after all), but it does convey a nice message and is definitely heartwarming. The controls and especially the camera can be a bit annoying at times, I too would have liked if there was actual platforming, but I think the movement is done well enough overall. One thing that's also worth mentioning is that this does have its infuriating moments, where you will die seemingly for no reason until you understand the unintuitive logic of the game, but these are quite rare and usually the game is rather easy (thought there is a difficulty setting).All in all it's a great game that reminds me of games I really liked on my GameCube and that just don't really seem to get made for PC.

												This is probably one of the more interesting titles I've played this year. The concept is fun, the idea of color spirits affecting emotions is really neat (there are few things funnier that I've found than terrifying an enemy into running straight into an instant-death-trap), and its all done in a cartoony papercraft style that I'm finding really endearing.Controls are tight, combat is good, and the puzzles are fun (while a couple can be a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to do). If you want something to tide you over until Yooka Laylee this is a good buy. I nabbed it on impulse when I saw it on sale and I find I'm quite glad I did.			"

												The Last Tinker is definitely reminiscent of the vibrant and lush adventure games of the past in both it's look and feel.  It doesn't quite fit under the genre of a free-range adventure game like Zelda, nor does it fit strictly under a 3D platformer genre like Crash Bandicoot- it's somewhere in between.  The game is on the easier side, but it's still enjoyable.  The developers did a nice job of mixing up the gameplay between puzzles, exploring, fighting, and other more unique gameplay features such that they're all easy, but you don't get bored from doing the exact same thing the entire time.

I played it with a keyboard and mouse, which took a few minutes to get use to, but after that I had no problem with the controls. The game did a nice job of introducing something new throughout the game so that the gameplay never bacame boring, and it offers extra bonuses to players that want to explore a bit. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. Took me about 7 hours to complete and I hope the developers create more games like this!			"

												This is an intriguing little game that starts simply and progresses nicely.  The story is very enjoyable for all ages.  The use of color in the game shows a developer with serious creativity and a desire to create something non-cookiecutter.The controls are easy and very linear progression.  However I did have some difficulty with the Steam Controller (see the discussions to determine if your controller would work).  But, I needed to revert to Keyboard/Mouse in only a couple situations.I would recommend this game to others who enjoy games for their beauty or story.  This game is similar to Jak & Dexter and Spiro.  Thank you to the developers for making a great game.			"

												As many people did, I bought this game thinking it was a 3D platformer akin to the games of old, the games it was inspired by. I was severely disappointed to find that I am glued to the ground and that the platforming is simply holding down a button. The game is incredibly simple and easy. Combat is braindead, the path is extremely railroaded, and collectibles aren't very difficult to find for the most part. Because you are glued to the ground and the paths are railroaded, you will often find the collectibles right in front of your face. The ""specials"" I have gotten have mostly gone unused, as they are unnecessary (unless the game requires them to be used). Your ""life"" and ""health points"" are pointless considering you respawn about 2 feet from where you once were due to generous checkpoint placement, and the fact that there isn't a ""gameover"".However, the game isn't a bad game. Being simple and easy does not mean that the game isn't fun. Contrary to this, I have been thoroughly enjoying the game once I got out of the ""This isn't a 3D platformer"" mindset. The designs of the characters are very interesting and cool (you can't tell me that Koru's scarf isn't awesome). The art and music both are beautiful! Colors are vivid and lush, sound effects are satisfying, and the story is interesting enough to me that I want to know what happens. And even though the combat is incredibly simple and easy, I still have fun with it due to the sound effects, colors, and animations. The animations being incredibly fluid and fun to watch.Some complaints, other than ""too easy"" and ""not a platformer"":The sound that Lil Bomber makes when affected by Green is incredibly uncomfortable and disconcerting. Especially the ones he makes while still being held.The whole meeting with Blue Spirit is incredibly abrupt and jarring. There's only a couple lines of text before he joins you, with nothing being said by Green or Red Spirits.The lack of using dodge to get off of jumping puzzles being used. RB allows you to dodge off of ropes, spires, pillars, and other such things that you autojump on to. However, not once did I find this ability effective in finding a collectible or advancing along. I have yet to complete the game or even beat the game, but I doubt it will come in handy in the future...Most other complains fall under the ""too easy"" and ""not a platformer"" categories. But once again, this game is still good. It's fun, it's relaxing, and it's pretty to watch as you play. It's a great game for a younger audience as well as those not very skilled. I can definitely recommend this game to those who can sit back and enjoy a simple romp through an interesting and beautiful world. "

												A cute silly game with well made enviroments and characters. The game is very forgiving with death while keeping up enough a gradually escalating challenge at various sections to prevent me from falling asleeping. Outside of those challenges, navigating the enviroments and panning the camera around to glimpse the way forward has an intrinsic joy to it. Things are pretty, and the layout of places themselves remain interesting. I got it on sale for $4, and I'll say it has probably $20 of worth. It might depend if you audibly ""aww"" everytime the baby goat pinata speaks and wiggles its nose or not. I mean look at him. LOOK. AT. HIM.			"

												First let me state, this isn't the first game I'd played that uses a wide range and depth of color.When I first came upon The Last Tinker: City of Colors, my though was this would probably be a fun game to play. Well, I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's not a bad game at all. If it wasn't for the not so minor issues, it would have definitly been better.What issues may I be refering? The main problem has to do with the camera sensetivity combine with the amount of colors in the game. For some people, it may not be a issue. For those of us whom falls well within the realm of percieving every darn possible colors and more, at once, it is quite painful to look at this game with it's rapid camera movement. Lowering the senstivity didn't help much at all. Droping the senesitivity all the way down would made the game impossible to play since the camera rotation becomes too slow. If I was to suddenly turn Kuro around and walk in a differnet direction, there would be several second of not seeing where the charater was going due to extremely low camera rotation. Puting the sensitivity up just by one click from the lowest is still pretty fast. It rapid speed isn't only in the camera rotation, but it in every motion you make. Come on, why is there no inbetween impossiblely slow and omega fast.I understand the Kuro is suppose to be fast, but that camera movement causes all the colors to vibrate more than it needs too.The second issue, I ran into, was the delay from the players excuting the Input to the event being perform by the character. For example, after pushing the jump button or key I would expect it to jump right away and not 1 second later. I can understand giving a bit of delay for various reason, but 1 second of delay is too long. This makes the game less enjoyable when you know you need to jump or rotate to dodge, but nothing happens and you took damage.Those were pretty much the only issue I had. It took awhile to complete the game since I had to stop playing, quite often, to readjust my eyes.As for the story, is pretty much a familar story. A story of segeration, and how an insprational figure helped unified the people. The approach to the story was a intriguing one. There seems to be an hidden messages in the story base on how the story was told. Of course, this message may not have been intended, but it some how worked it's way in.Oh Conspiracy! Would I recomend this game? Sure, why not, it's a good game after all. Plus, you  get to see the concept art for the game if you unlocked them.			"

												A beautiful, charming, and fun ""platformer"" game... But why the quotation marks?Most complaints seem to be that it has no real platforming, as it is all done automatically while holding the jump button, and that apparently makes it a bad game because it's not like the games it says it's inspired by.However, that is pretty much the only thing missing, but even then, it's only a problem if you're closed-minded enough that it stops you from caring about everything else the game does right.The world and characters are beautifully colourful and varied. Cartoony looking, and yet still so detailed and smooth. Playing this game is like eating candy with your eyes!The gameplay is fairly linear and easy, but addictive. While I can appreciate the desire for the accurate platforming of old (I love the PS1-2 classics myself), the auto-jumping helps the game flow nicely, while you focus on exploring, and figuring out how to proceed through obstacles, with occasional small puzzles and alternate paths. There are also multiple collectibles hidden in the levels, which unlock fun little extras, like big head mode, concept art, and more!The combat, while simple on the surface, grows more complicated and fun as you learn different attacks and powers, and encounter new enemies that require different strategies to defeat.And finally, the story is light hearted without being childish, yet the theme is deep in ways that are very clear.So don't focus on what it isn't, look at what it is. When a game is inspired by something, it doesn't need to be 100% like that something in every way in order to be a worthwhile and memorable experience. "

												I enjoyed this game and will come back to it to finish. I have made it far enough into the game to feel I would comfortably recommend this game. It's a fairly inexpensive title which I wasn't sure about in the beginning. It feels like a Jack and Daxter as far as the silent protagonist, loud mouthed best friend, colorful levels, and quirky supporting characters. However, it's sort of a platformer with no controlled jump and Arkham Asylum style combat. This makes for more of a beat em up with a few flaws but overall a quirky story, solid combat, and a fun world.Graphics: They set out to create a specific style and succeeded beautifully. For the overall aesthetic, they nailed it. Everything looks like it's painted and when the world starts going ""bleak"", the lack of colors is very apparent. As you take damage, you seem to be drained of color which is a nice effect. The speech bubbles are actually cut out signs on cardboard which are only written on the front of. I do have a problem with the speech bubbles, as fitting as they are. Sometimes, they don't appear until you are right next to a character. They are large enough that I find myself having to move the camera to read them. This could have been corrected by making them pop up a bit further out, but then it wouldn't feel like the characters were talking to you. Overall, it's my only gripe about the graphical presentation.Music: This soundtrack is amazing. From the stealth areas where the music changes dynamically when guards are getting closer to you to the standard area themes being unique and fitting. The music you get on the farm feels very twangy and laid back while the combat music is more up beat and intense. Every area's music is not only appropriate, but also something I would go out of my way to find and listen to while relaxing at home. It's a stellar example of matching the visual aesthetic to the auditory aesthetic.Gameplay: The game offers a variety of difficulties without forcing you to unlock them which seems less common these days and I am glad to see it. The difficulties range from Kid, where most attacks are one hit kills, to One Hit Death, where every hit you take kills you and HP means nothing. That being said, all the difficulties seem to be arbitrary increase in damage against you and damage enemies take. There are no AI modifications or spawn rate modifications which I noticed. The AI, in general, is very basic, but this is not a bad thing. Each monster acts it's own way and never react based on other monster's movement. It's a very NES/SNES style of programming AI. The smaller melee guys just rush you. The larger AI guys rush you. The ranged guys stay ranged and never move. The shield guys disappear and reappear waiting for you to stun them. No monster will surprise you by doing something you don't expect. But it works Trying to time your attacks so you hit the small guys, dodge the big guys, ranged attack the ranged guys, it all adds to that chaos that made those earlier games fun. The issue I have is the checkpoint system. It doesn't maintain a state that the game is in, merely a respawn point. What this means is, if you are in a particularly nasty fight, you can run in and kill as many guys as you can until you die, respawn near by, run back in and the only monsters there are the remaining monsters of that wave. Every fight can be done like this, including boss fights as far as I can tell. There are no numbered lives so there is no way to lose the game. As far as the platforming with no jump button, it works. There is a run button. If you are holding it and you reach a ledge with something you can jump to, it will jump. They work in a lot of timing systems into when to progress to the next platform and when to stay back. With ranged enemies covering these platforms, sometimes you find yourself bouncing from one platform to the next and back again while waiting for another platform to come up and trying to not get hit by the ranged guy. The challenge is there if there was an actual reason not to die.Overall: I really do like this game and would recommend it, if only as an example of a game with a fully fleshed out concept. My issues are generally surface level. It could use a life system or a full respawn of enemies on death. As it stands, maybe playing it on One Hit Death can serve some challenge, but I see it ending up as more of a test in ones patience, really. Ultimately, a fun experience, albeit an easy one.			"

												Yes, as some reviews state the game is ""easy"". But difficulty is not what this game is about.It's an eye candy platformer for kids and adults alike. The art style is beautiful, colorful, and vibrant. If you like eye candy and causual gameplay this game will be right up your alley.			"

												I do recommend the game highly. I have played it for two hours total, and that's all the game might get out of me.That sounds hypocritical to you? Let me explain.The games environment is wonderful, the combat is simple yet fun. The characters are also fun and I just had a smile on my face for the most part. The game mechanics are fun and has a bit of relaxation to them yet it gives you a bit of adrenaline from time to time. I enjoyed the story thus far too.The problem is, if you have any controller other than the 360 controller, you're going to have a bad time starting this fun game. The first time is fine, second time maybe too. But after that, you won't be able to load your game. They have a major bug with other controllers (Xbox One for me) that forces you to scroll through the menu to the left constantly. Also any other settings you'd want to change with the controller are impossible. I set my controls in the beginning to controller only and even if I pull out my Xbox One controller, to try and navigate, I won't have much luck. Some button placement is also not properly linked with any controller other than the 360.So if you have a 360 controller, you'll love this game. If you have any other controller, it's better to skip the buy and wait for the company to fix it. I will just hope they'll fix it. Because it might be a game I'd want my future kids to play, but there won't be any 360 controllers around anymore by then, so they game would literally die out at one point.			"

												I got through this game with all the achievements in about 10 hours so it's one of the shorter games out there. I must say though that I enjoyed every minute of it. This was a pretty fun game with a unique concept. It kinda reminds me of Epic Mickey. It's very colorful and a great game for kids.			"

												The Last Tinker is definitely reminiscent of the vibrant and lush adventure games of the past in both it's look and feel.  It doesn't quite fit under the genre of a free-range adventure game like Zelda, nor does it fit strictly under a 3D platformer genre like Crash Bandicoot- it's somewhere in between.  The game is on the easier side, but it's still enjoyable.  The developers did a nice job of mixing up the gameplay between puzzles, exploring, fighting, and other more unique gameplay features such that they're all easy, but you don't get bored from doing the exact same thing the entire time.

Great music, a charming story and good controls. This deserves defintely more attention than it currently has.			"

												This is an intriguing little game that starts simply and progresses nicely.  The story is very enjoyable for all ages.  The use of color in the game shows a developer with serious creativity and a desire to create something non-cookiecutter.The controls are easy and very linear progression.  However I did have some difficulty with the Steam Controller (see the discussions to determine if your controller would work).  But, I needed to revert to Keyboard/Mouse in only a couple situations.I would recommend this game to others who enjoy games for their beauty or story.  This game is similar to Jak & Dexter and Spiro.  Thank you to the developers for making a great game.			"

												A cute silly game with well made enviroments and characters.

Outside of those challenges, navigating the enviroments and panning the camera around to glimpse the way forward has an intrinsic joy to it.

												tl;dr: A solid gaming experience!Ps & Cs:+ Good graphics+ Decent controls+ Cute story+ Clever ideas+ Great for kids- Very easy- N64-Zelda-esque jumpingThis is a great kid's game.  I'm a 33 year old man, and even I'm enjoying it, kind of harkens back to the old N64 days.  The story isn't great, but it's fine for a game about a monkey brining color back to the world.  My biggest gripe is the lack of a jump button, as the game uses the auto-detect ledge jumping ala Assassin's Creed / Zelda 64, however it performs just fine.  At $20 it would be fine.  At $2.99 like I found it, it's a MFing masterpiece.			"

												As many people did, I bought this game thinking it was a 3D platformer akin to the games of old, the games it was inspired by. I was severely disappointed to find that I am glued to the ground and that the platforming is simply holding down a button. The game is incredibly simple and easy. Combat is braindead, the path is extremely railroaded, and collectibles aren't very difficult to find for the most part. Because you are glued to the ground and the paths are railroaded, you will often find the collectibles right in front of your face. The ""specials"" I have gotten have mostly gone unused, as they are unnecessary (unless the game requires them to be used). Your ""life"" and ""health points"" are pointless considering you respawn about 2 feet from where you once were due to generous checkpoint placement, and the fact that there isn't a ""gameover"".However, the game isn't a bad game. Being simple and easy does not mean that the game isn't fun. Contrary to this, I have been thoroughly enjoying the game once I got out of the ""This isn't a 3D platformer"" mindset. The designs of the characters are very interesting and cool (you can't tell me that Koru's scarf isn't awesome). The art and music both are beautiful! Colors are vivid and lush, sound effects are satisfying, and the story is interesting enough to me that I want to know what happens. And even though the combat is incredibly simple and easy, I still have fun with it due to the sound effects, colors, and animations. The animations being incredibly fluid and fun to watch.Some complaints, other than ""too easy"" and ""not a platformer"":The sound that Lil Bomber makes when affected by Green is incredibly uncomfortable and disconcerting. Especially the ones he makes while still being held.The whole meeting with Blue Spirit is incredibly abrupt and jarring. There's only a couple lines of text before he joins you, with nothing being said by Green or Red Spirits.The lack of using dodge to get off of jumping puzzles being used. RB allows you to dodge off of ropes, spires, pillars, and other such things that you autojump on to. However, not once did I find this ability effective in finding a collectible or advancing along. I have yet to complete the game or even beat the game, but I doubt it will come in handy in the future...Most other complains fall under the ""too easy"" and ""not a platformer"" categories. But once again, this game is still good. It's fun, it's relaxing, and it's pretty to watch as you play. It's a great game for a younger audience as well as those not very skilled. I can definitely recommend this game to those who can sit back and enjoy a simple romp through an interesting and beautiful world. "

												Nice game.Enjoyed because it remembered me of my PS2 games, going arround, exploring things, good story, has some puzzles and nice collectibles...There's only one thing though, the game doesn't offer quite a challenge for the ""normal"" difficulty (wich I am used to), and it is easier to die confronting normal enemies than the bosses, but I think is part of the gameplay, ""let the flow guide you"" or something.Otherwise, nice game to chill and get some glimpses of my childhood.

												First let me state, this isn't the first game I'd played that uses a wide range and depth of color.When I first came upon The Last Tinker: City of Colors, my though was this would probably be a fun game to play. Well, I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's not a bad game at all. If it wasn't for the not so minor issues, it would have definitly been better.What issues may I be refering? The main problem has to do with the camera sensetivity combine with the amount of colors in the game. For some people, it may not be a issue. For those of us whom falls well within the realm of percieving every darn possible colors and more, at once, it is quite painful to look at this game with it's rapid camera movement. Lowering the senstivity didn't help much at all. Droping the senesitivity all the way down would made the game impossible to play since the camera rotation becomes too slow. If I was to suddenly turn Kuro around and walk in a differnet direction, there would be several second of not seeing where the charater was going due to extremely low camera rotation. Puting the sensitivity up just by one click from the lowest is still pretty fast. It rapid speed isn't only in the camera rotation, but it in every motion you make. Come on, why is there no inbetween impossiblely slow and omega fast.I understand the Kuro is suppose to be fast, but that camera movement causes all the colors to vibrate more than it needs too.The second issue, I ran into, was the delay from the players excuting the Input to the event being perform by the character. For example, after pushing the jump button or key I would expect it to jump right away and not 1 second later. I can understand giving a bit of delay for various reason, but 1 second of delay is too long. This makes the game less enjoyable when you know you need to jump or rotate to dodge, but nothing happens and you took damage.Those were pretty much the only issue I had. It took awhile to complete the game since I had to stop playing, quite often, to readjust my eyes.As for the story, is pretty much a familar story. A story of segeration, and how an insprational figure helped unified the people. The approach to the story was a intriguing one. There seems to be an hidden messages in the story base on how the story was told. Of course, this message may not have been intended, but it some how worked it's way in.Oh Conspiracy! Would I recomend this game? Sure, why not, it's a good game after all. Plus, you  get to see the concept art for the game if you unlocked them.			"

												Wish there was a ""maybe"" feature (again)This game is beautiful - has it's own unique and stunning aesthetic. And the story is interesting enough! I like that it plays similar to games like Zelda & Banjo & Kazooie. I should stress that it only plays similarly, but not that similar. I also like how it's a platformer that doesn't rely on you pressing jump at the right times - it adds a nice fluidity to the game that zelda got right! jumping can be stressful in a 3D platformer. You're either going to hate this mechanic, or welcome it.What I DON'T like about this game is how incredibly easy it is, with random spikes of ""wtf do I do?"" thrown in. Where you're not sure if it's the difficulty, or a bug. I feel like this game is aimed at a much younger audience, so I can't be too critical of the level of easyness. But I kept getting stuck at 1 or 2 parts - the first was because I didn't look around enough (fair enough!). the 2nd is what made me uninstall because it seemed to be impossible.... and in my mind, if what was waiting for me after that was another long stretch of ""ho hum hold r trigger"" then I just can't stay motivated to see it through.Buy it on sale. Buy it if you have kids. The quality is definitely present in this game... just not 100% throughout			"

												Allow me to explain;You play as ""Koru"" a human-like being in Colortown, who is also a Tinker, the last of his kind.You play through many levels where you use familiar styles, such as Sonic, Mario and Zelda.The Sonic aspects consist of: Running, slowing down time/speeding yourself up, grinding on rails.Mario aspects: Platforming and very uplifting.Zelda: A story that goes deep and is worth playing through, with puzzles and different forms of fighting other than using your fists.On the surface of this beautiful game it looks peaceful, like a child with a kind heart drew it and put it on the fridge door.But beneath the surface lies a dark and twisted truth, one that resembles real world struggles, such as racism, steriotypes and generally just how our world is, blue is sad, green is afraid, and red is always angry, they dislike the other colours, much like some of us dislike other races and people's beliefs.The Bleakness may seem evil, but Bleakness is what resides in us all, the feeling of no hope, like there's just no other way, so you destroy, just to start anew...When others would ask; ""Why start over? It's already perfect how it is.""Listen to the story and you will most likely relate to some of the problems going on, don't let the surfaces of this world fool you...			"

												Mimimi, mimimi, mimimi. + Very nice graphics. + Lazy kids learn to read. + Combat system is suitable for casual gamers and kids. + A little bit caring about the situation is necessary. + Nice story. + Sex and gender free so that women shut up at least once (just kiddin´: homophobes can suck my ice-cream). + It´s not about racism (as many racists claim...muahaha) in specific but more general:  some want freedom and get angry (red ones), some want security and get paranoid (green ones), some want peace and get sad (blue ones) - no matter because of what. And then there are those who are a mixture of let´s say red and blue, get purple - and when green pops in this gives white (as well as black since white and black aren´t colors but equal mixtures of all three colors). Basically the last boss would´ve been black but in today´s times this would be racist - because the white scum - ah - man is the problem today. Thus the final boss being white is appropriate for the actual context if one wants relate those colors to skin colors. But this motherlover really should´ve been black as no human skin can ever be (except if being burned...but then there´s no more skin there, isn´t it...). I got the game from a bundle and was pleasantly surprised - at least it has controls that also work with mouse and keyboard (looking at you Dark Souls...). Only downside: you can´t jump.			"

												TL;DR: Play this for the atmosphere. ~8 hours. Worth the 2 bucks(xD) I got it for during Winter sale.Numerous games come to mind playing this.Everything by Rareware, Psychonauts, Little Big Planet, Paper Mario. Yes, I'm using the ""it's like <all these great games>"" description that's usually a bit scammy. I'll pick one then, it's like Beyond Good and Evil. Linear, not terribly complex, but downright fun.- It's not a platformer.- Don't expect puzzles. It's just lever-pulling and repeating a sequence.- A bit of (self-)referential humor at times, don't expect a lot.- Linear as all hell, except for a single optional collectible. There's also gems to buy moves with(or as a key item at start), but that happens automatically. There is no backtracking whatsoever. ~8 hours.-- Possible because of this, an excellent hint system. Just ask your buddy and he will fly almost the exact route you need to go.- Combat is not difficult,except for the unlockable, optional arena. I went for the ""instant death"" difficulty, thinking it to be a cooler name for ""nightmare"". It is not. Things will gib you continuously, even things that only knockback on other settings. Does not make the game more fun, just more annoying. No achi either. Just don't.-- The cargo rails. What I thought was a scenic trip through the wonderfully crafted world was instead a quick time event in disquise. Especially on instant death. Bah.-- Enemies(outside of boss adds) do not respawn. Even instant death is quite doable, the regular levels. Bosses still require a lot of trial and error until you completely know the attack pattern.-- You gather three colored powers over the course of the game,but they are simply damage, fear and stun. The first quarter of the game is simply""hit it until it dies, dodge if it attacks"". They also give a superpower usable once a bar is filled. But this doesn't add any depth to boss fights, as they still need to be hit X times in the weak spot.Power, Time Stop and Invulnerability. Bosses remain vulnerable until a third of their hp is damaged, so Power nor Time Stop work. Layme.- It's cartoony. Some people use that as a pejorative, but it's simply a description. Like romantic comedy. Some people never like romantic comedies, most people need to be in a mood for it. Just like with cartoony. It feels cell-shady, everything is bright and un-brown.- ""Everything in this world is made of paint, paper and glue"", and it shows. Text balloons are in gamespace, some are static, so you can view a textbox from the side to see that sinusoid cardboard thing, and you can view them from behind where they're blank.- The world is beautifully made. There's dissapointingly much lore, as you don't ever see e.g. the inside of a dust refinery, or a rainbow factory where colors are made. On the other hand, you can often peer in a random direction and see detail without the quests ever taking you there.- The characters. Banjo-Kazooie-like creatures just ramble on in their voice, gesturing, no matter their actual text. Each race has a ""voice"", and some unique characters have their own. There's quite a few different expressions. The three races look nothing alike, not just their bodies but their districts as well, each has their own architecture. Especially the spirits look great, Green was amazing.It was a fun experience. I loved the characters, I giggled, I facepalmed at the cheesy story, I enjoyed the scenery, I raged at instant death(just don't).			"

												The last tinkerer is a rather short game, but packed with tons of charm. It is clear throughout the whole game how the previous era of platformer games has influenced this game in its design. While it at times really did remind me of games like Spyro and Ratched & Clank, it still managed to keep an own sense of style and expression. Despite me having a bad first impression during the first hour of gameplay, the game managed to charm me over and I really enjoyed playing the rest of the game. Pros Absolutely charming game with charming characters and charming environments.Love how the game used the contrast between chaos (sensory overload) and calm to help pace the game and setting the mood.Love the way the story as well as the visual story was developed and told during the later parts of the game.I liked the level progression. I didn’t feel like I was backtracking and the levels, although rather confined, always allowed for some extra exploration. Cons Bad first impression. You, as the player, was dropped into a confusing place of sensory overload, utter chaos and fetch quests. The lag! I had some serious frame rate drops and had to toggle the graphics settings and turn some stuff off to even have the game in a playable state. Clunky camera and controls which lead to some frustrating situations.Initial combat felt clunky and unresponsive.Game was not consistent in telling the rules. Sometimes when you die, all defeated enemies will respawn and sometimes not.  "

												I enjoyed this game and will come back to it to finish. I have made it far enough into the game to feel I would comfortably recommend this game. It's a fairly inexpensive title which I wasn't sure about in the beginning. It feels like a Jack and Daxter as far as the silent protagonist, loud mouthed best friend, colorful levels, and quirky supporting characters. However, it's sort of a platformer with no controlled jump and Arkham Asylum style combat. This makes for more of a beat em up with a few flaws but overall a quirky story, solid combat, and a fun world.Graphics: They set out to create a specific style and succeeded beautifully. For the overall aesthetic, they nailed it. Everything looks like it's painted and when the world starts going ""bleak"", the lack of colors is very apparent. As you take damage, you seem to be drained of color which is a nice effect. The speech bubbles are actually cut out signs on cardboard which are only written on the front of. I do have a problem with the speech bubbles, as fitting as they are. Sometimes, they don't appear until you are right next to a character. They are large enough that I find myself having to move the camera to read them. This could have been corrected by making them pop up a bit further out, but then it wouldn't feel like the characters were talking to you. Overall, it's my only gripe about the graphical presentation.Music: This soundtrack is amazing. From the stealth areas where the music changes dynamically when guards are getting closer to you to the standard area themes being unique and fitting. The music you get on the farm feels very twangy and laid back while the combat music is more up beat and intense. Every area's music is not only appropriate, but also something I would go out of my way to find and listen to while relaxing at home. It's a stellar example of matching the visual aesthetic to the auditory aesthetic.Gameplay: The game offers a variety of difficulties without forcing you to unlock them which seems less common these days and I am glad to see it. The difficulties range from Kid, where most attacks are one hit kills, to One Hit Death, where every hit you take kills you and HP means nothing. That being said, all the difficulties seem to be arbitrary increase in damage against you and damage enemies take. There are no AI modifications or spawn rate modifications which I noticed. The AI, in general, is very basic, but this is not a bad thing. Each monster acts it's own way and never react based on other monster's movement. It's a very NES/SNES style of programming AI. The smaller melee guys just rush you. The larger AI guys rush you. The ranged guys stay ranged and never move. The shield guys disappear and reappear waiting for you to stun them. No monster will surprise you by doing something you don't expect. But it works Trying to time your attacks so you hit the small guys, dodge the big guys, ranged attack the ranged guys, it all adds to that chaos that made those earlier games fun. The issue I have is the checkpoint system. It doesn't maintain a state that the game is in, merely a respawn point. What this means is, if you are in a particularly nasty fight, you can run in and kill as many guys as you can until you die, respawn near by, run back in and the only monsters there are the remaining monsters of that wave. Every fight can be done like this, including boss fights as far as I can tell. There are no numbered lives so there is no way to lose the game. As far as the platforming with no jump button, it works. There is a run button. If you are holding it and you reach a ledge with something you can jump to, it will jump. They work in a lot of timing systems into when to progress to the next platform and when to stay back. With ranged enemies covering these platforms, sometimes you find yourself bouncing from one platform to the next and back again while waiting for another platform to come up and trying to not get hit by the ranged guy. The challenge is there if there was an actual reason not to die.Overall: I really do like this game and would recommend it, if only as an example of a game with a fully fleshed out concept. My issues are generally surface level. It could use a life system or a full respawn of enemies on death. As it stands, maybe playing it on One Hit Death can serve some challenge, but I see it ending up as more of a test in ones patience, really. Ultimately, a fun experience, albeit an easy one.			"

												I enjoyed this very much.  The Last Tinker ist not only a game but a very clever designed parable about tolerance and mutual respect and a strong statement against racism and exclusion. Great music, a charming story and good controls. This deserves defintely more attention than it currently has.			"

												This is an intriguing little game that starts simply and progresses nicely.  The story is very enjoyable for all ages.  The use of color in the game shows a developer with serious creativity and a desire to create something non-cookiecutter.The controls are easy and very linear progression.  However I did have some difficulty with the Steam Controller (see the discussions to determine if your controller would work).  But, I needed to revert to Keyboard/Mouse in only a couple situations.I would recommend this game to others who enjoy games for their beauty or story.  This game is similar to Jak & Dexter and Spiro.  Thank you to the developers for making a great game.			"

												I should open by saying, do not be fooled by the 'inspired by Jak & Daxter and Banjo Kazooie' line in the description. The devs openly say that the game is an Action-Adventure and not a Platformer. Anyone who felt that they were lied to shouldn't feel that way since the devs didn't say they were making a clone of that game.Ultimately though, this game is essentially a Batman Arkham game for a younger audience.Pros:Amazing aesthetic. This is a great example of art direction over fidelty.Excellent soundtrack.Cute story. This is a game aimed at a younger audience and the story is something that teaches the power of friendship and sharing.Neutral:The game slowly feeds you upgrades. Some aren't useful at all and some are given to you far too late.Combat depth is pretty low, you will manage to get through almost all encounter just be mashing the attack button despite have TONS of other options. That being said, this is a game for a younger audience, so that's acceptable.Cons:The games uses the Assassin's Creed method of platforming, this is something I don't like especially when to find certain secrets you have to just fall off ledges.

												The Last Tinker: City of Colors makes a powerful statement with its original level design, its beautiful music, hilarious and unforgettable characters, and its final message to the player. Although the era of plot-driven action adventure games seems to have been in its peak during the heydays of Nintendo 64 and the original PlayStation, The Last Tinker has most certainly raised the bar. After all, the world would be a pretty dull place without colour.Full review here: https://kkatlas.com/2014/07/15/game-review-the-last-tinker-city-of-colors/Full game guide here: https://kkatlas.com/2016/03/13/game-guide-the-last-tinker-city-of-colors/ "

												This game is absolutely wonderful. It looks great, it runs great, it's fun, it's entertaining for all ages, it sends a positive message, and above everything else it's a very interesting game. If you're a parent looking for a good game to play with your child this was great dispite being single player.			"

												Nice game.Enjoyed because it remembered me of my PS2 games, going arround, exploring things, good story, has some puzzles and nice collectibles...There's only one thing though, the game doesn't offer quite a challenge for the ""normal"" difficulty (wich I am used to), and it is easier to die confronting normal enemies than the bosses, but I think is part of the gameplay, ""let the flow guide you"" or something.Otherwise, nice game to chill and get some glimpses of my childhood.
