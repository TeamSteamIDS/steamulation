AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Year Walk Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags:; Minimalist; Puzzle; Atmospheric; Casual My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 1-3 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Puzzle game aficionados; Casual gamers REVIEWYear Walk is one of those abstract games that more closely resembles a piece of art than a video game.  The gameplay is extremely minimal, while the true soul of the game lies in its ambiance, art direction, and core concept.  This is the type of game which won’t appeal to everyone.  For those who appreciate the occasional artsy game with minimal gameplay, then you will probably find Year Walk interesting, relaxing, and enjoyable.  If you are looking to play a traditional video game, you shouldn’t be looking here.The gameplay is roughly 3 parts “walking-simulator” and 1 part puzzle game.  Navigating the area is your primary “challenge,” with the addition of a few puzzles you will have to solve.  The answers to these puzzles can be a bit obscure, but there is a competent hint system if you want to avoid being stuck for too long and just want to enjoy the zen of the game.The core concept of the game is also quite interesting.  Year Walk is based on the Swedish folklore of Årsgång, which I had never heard of before playing this, and which I found to be interesting.  After learning a bit about it, I was able to see that the developers did an outstanding job bringing the idea to life in video game form, even despite its inherently simplistic design.The art direction, soundscape, and overall ambiance of the game make for a mysterious atmosphere which is very well aligned with the core concept.  Admittedly, the graphics are quite simple; but the simple graphics fit the simple game.Short, interesting, and atmospheric: Year Walk makes for a fun little experience that is well-produced and should be easily enjoyed by anyone who truly appreciates the genre.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Descending through Year Walk is liking having an ice cube put down the back of your shirt, then being pushed into the Artic Ocean. It's chilling and unnerving in a way that messes with your head, transcending its own existence into something that feels tangible; too close for comfort and so well crafted it causes you to second guess your own instincts that this is nothing but fantasy. As I sat staring at ""The End"" plastered across my screen, I could still feel my quickened pulse as I tried to shake the feeling of being on edge, something no piece of entertainment in any medium has managed in what feels like a very long time.Year walking is a practice (largely found in Sweden) in which a ritual is performed by the walker through which they are given a glimpse through time at what the future holds. However, it comes at a grave cost, and there is no guarantee the walker will  even make it through alive.Walking through a forest at midnight, snow blanketing the ground around you, you come face to face with the horrors that befall those that dare to year walk: The Watchers, twisted and greedy spirits, who demand their sacrifice for showing you what is to come. The deeper you get, the more vile and disturbing these encounters become, before you finally enter the church and see your fate.This is when the game first ends, but it also marks the point at which the game truly begins. Up to this point you've been bustled along through this story with little in the way of explanation or reason. It's artistically brilliant and frightening to be sure, but all the same largely disconnected and without any real purpose, meant to alarm but ultimately lacking any substance. It's not then until you begin to walk again and the curtain is pulled away that the pieces fall into place and the true meaning behind your circumstances become clear. Terrifyingly so.Year Walk is a master at what it tries to be. It lets nothing on and leaves you wandering in the dark for a good while, which only makes it more unnerving when it finally lays its cards on the table. The expert use of Swedish folklore ties its world and ours together as it attempts to break the forth wall as it weaves together fantasy and psychological horror into a brief but immensely compelling narrative. If you've gotten this far you've likely realized I've said a lot of nothing in all these words, and that's entirely intentional, as to say what makes Year Walk so brilliant would be to completely ruin it the experience. No, this is one walk that you have to take for yourself, though I promise you won't regret it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Year Walk is one of those rare bits of media that lingers in your mind long after you've finished it. It makes you feel like a part of you is missing after you've finished it and, like a junkie, you become desperate for more. Don't let the ""ending"" fool you. There's more. Find the Journal. Open the box. It's not too late. You know what to do.			"

												It's been months since I first played Year Walk on iOS and I still think about it regularly. The Steam version of this game is as beautifully made as the original, and the changed puzzles feel at home on the PC. The atmosphere is greatly enhanced in this version of the game, providing a creepier mood than the iOS version - so much so that surprises I knew were coming still got jolts out of me. The story behind this game is so intriguing and mysterious that I wish there was more information about it online; Year Walk is an amazing introduction into Scandinavian folklore that everyone should play.

												First off, there are two things I must mention: one, I have had absolutely zero experience with the iOS version of Year Walk; this review is based 100% on the PC version currently available on Steam. Two, I almost exclusively dislike ""puzzle games."" I find them annoying and tedious. That being said, I found Year Walk to be a mesmerizing and enjoyable little game.In terms of its gameplay, Year Walk doesn't break the mold - there's nothing revolutionary to be found here. The puzzles are relatively simple and only required me to doodle a few things down on a scratch pad to help me solve the majority of them. They're not overly difficult. And if you do find yourself stuck, there's a Hint system in-game that's actually useful.The controls for the PC work well overall, and I had no problems or confusion in how to do anything. So, as a port from a touch based device, this aspect is done fine.So, then what makes this an excellent game? As I said, the puzzles presented in the game are not challenging. In fact, as I finished this game I came to the realization I had been tricked. This game wasn't about the puzzles at all. It was about the experience; the visuals, the music, the story, and the atmosphere it all creates. The puzzles are just a way to move you along.Year Walk is ultimately all about the experience. And it's definitely quite the experience. It's visually striking - the art style is unique and hauntingly beautiful, and the music fits perfectly in with it. Together they enhance a weird, dark, and rather sad story.In the end, Year Walk feels fleshed out and solid. It creates a unique atmosphere that's hard to compare and even harder to forget. Despite not liking puzzles games, I really found myself engrossed in the world that Year Walk so successfully creates. Addendum (3/19/2014) - After playing through the game completely, twice, and also messing around with extras and some achievements, I feel that I have to make note that this is a short game, and more importantly one that lacks replayability. I'd still recommend the game, it's just something to bear in mind when making a purchase.  "

												What a surreal experience. Year Walk can essentially be described as a classic adventure game played in first peson. You move around the forest as you go on your 'Year Walk' and slowly piece together the puzzles and obscure story. It won the iOS GOTY award last year from many publications and I can easily see why it deserves the accolades.Year Walk is heavily based on Finnish Swedish folklore and has an amazing art style. You will run into all kinds of creepy demons throughout your adventure. The game does have a few jump scares, but, overall, is more unsettling than scary.I would mention that I found the atmosphere quite breathtaking. The mood is set by the oppressive musical backdrop that never distracts as you crunch your way through the snow of the forest.The puzzles are where I really dove into the game. I assembled a full piece of paper covered with drawings, notes, and clues over the course of my travels. There is an in-game map, encyclopedia, and hint system to help you through the game and learn about the Swedish background.The game is quite short, your first play through should take you about forty five minutes to an hour and a half depending on how quickly things click for you. Multiple play through are encouraged and, in fact, half of the story and the true ending are hidden away in subsequent play. The method of unlocking that ending and reading through the story is quite the ride.It is unfortunate as the game has been looked over on Steam entirely. Possibly due to the stream of trash that has been coming down as part of Valve's policies lately. I hope that it gets some more attention going forward as it is a great title.http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/595907053911022538/97EE52E11467DB99B64375A0F67863F9FF2CD941/http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/595907053911021776/E37C57A854D089254D0BBE943EE2493554DA4930/ "

												***MADE TO BE PLAYED >TWICE< - THE FIRST ENDING IS NOT THE ENDING***I wonder how many people miss that part. At any rate, I walked into this game with no insight into what I was going to experience.  The ""first"" playthough was short (about 90 minutes or so) and compelling, but then you are invited to walk again.  Do it.  The true ending is at the end of the ""second"" playthrough.  Non-spoiler tip: After your first paythrough. Read the journal. Read the journal.***NOT A HORROR GAME***While Steam has this listed as a Horror game; it is not. There are a few moments that may take you by surprise or have some troubling imagery, but this is not a scary game.  It's a mindful journey through Scandinavian folklore.  I enjoyed this experience, and would recommend it to others.			"

												Year Walk is one of those games that can stick with you for longer than usually. Between the tragic story, dark world and haunting atmosphere it's a very unique experience. With gameplay and other technicalities pushed aside, there's nothing to distract you from immersing yourself in the game. And when you think you're finished, in a very self-referential twist the game reveals another layer of itself to complete the story. Striking and distinct audiovisual side perfectly complements the setting and folklore elements, making the game just as beautiful as it is grim and unnerving. Some criticize it for being quite short. While this is true, it doesn't have to be seen as something negative - the game is polished to the point of being virtually perfect, with no unnecessary content to better capture the essence of its meaning. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. It left me astounded and reflective. I have a feeling I'll be thinking about it for quite a while.			"

""Year walking? I hope you are joking!""Stina Nilsson__________________________________________ IntroductionPersonally I have no clue about swedish folklore or mythology and grabbed the title simply because it looked kind of unique: setting and visuals seemed to be fresh and interesting and I expected a nice little title that I can play on my tablet and relax along the way.  (Okay, did I seriously miss the ""Horror“ tag on the storepage?)Oh man was I wrong.However, I have to say that I regret nothing - the game’s fantastic but for scary people probably not the best thing to play at 1 a.m..__________________________________________ Year walking…The story of the game is mysterious, kind of creepy and mature. At the beginning you are greeted with a short introduction and some small dialogue before starting your 'Year Walk' in attempt to unravel the mysteries of the future. On your journey you will encounter several beings of swedish folklore, creepy places and many puzzles and secrets.The game is a mixture of 2D- and 3D-Textures, you play in first person view, travelling from left to right through different parts of the forest, but at some spots you are able to go up or down to change the location. The forest consists of different areas and you will need to backtrack a lot (or you make notes along the way) to find the solution to some riddles and gadgets. These puzzles are quite interesting but nothing new or unique in the genre, especially for people that already played lots of adventures.Luckily there is a map and some hints to make your journey easier from time to time and there’s also some kind of information section that will tell you something about the history behind Year Walking, the folklore and the mysterious appearances. It was surprisingly interesting to read all the available information, especially due to the fresh setting that was not already used a hundred times in different games and stories. There’s also a very mysterious journal that requires a username and a password for access and stays a complete secret until you have finished the game at least once.The visuals and the interesting design of 'Year Walk' are definitely the strongest part of the game, but in combination with an interesting story and the great soundtrack (albeit there’s not that much music, mostly in intense situations) the game's able to create a fantastic amosphere. Out there in a dark forest inhabitated by strange beings that are neither entirely good nor bad there’s a lot of potential for sending chills down your spine.__________________________________________ ContraUnfortunately the games‘ lenght is from my point of view also the games' biggest downside: your first run will take approximately between two or three hours and as soon as you understand the puzzles and know how to solve them without searching for clues you will be able finish the game quite fast. There’s an achievement that wants you to finish the game in less than 20 minutes and in the end it’s not that particularly hard to get.Another thing that I would like to mention here are the jumpscares – I simply don’t like them as an element to 'inflict' horror, they feel a bit... cheap. From my point of view the game has a strong atmosphere by itself and does not really need these „SURPRISE: spooky face riiiiiiight in front of the screen‘-moments to scare you. Luckily there are only a few of them.The last negative point would be the implementation of touchscreen controls. At first I thought that the touchscreen of my Surface Tablet would be enough to play the game (because the game itself was ported from iOS to PC) but unfortunately you need a keyboard to move (and to solve one puzzle). __________________________________________ ConclusionIn the end I can say that the game surprised me a lot and the positive qualities of 'Year Walk‘ outweigh the short length by far. Sure, the games‘ charm is mostly created by the interesting visuals and the fresh setting but it succeeds nonetheless in building up a dense and mysterious atmosphere. There are some sparse horror elements – e.g. unexpected jump scares - but overall it’s the fear of what may happen and what lies at the end of your walk that will give you some chills, the story within the story. It's definitely an interesting little horror-adventure that may entertain you for two up to three hours. Luckily there's some replayability due to a secret ending. In the end I would rate the game 8 out of 10 points and especially during sales it’s a great little title to grab.__________________________________________ This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.

												this game, oh man.heads up, i played this on ipad almost a year ago and it still holds up really well even on pcits super creepy and has a vibe not many puzzle games have. the best way i can describe it is that it feels like a popup book rendition of a super creepy swedish folklore version of myst. everything feels dream-like but you soon start seeing that not everything is as it appears.+great art+great soundtrack+captures the feeling of being lost in the woods+lore is polished really well+puzzles are outstanding and mostly nonlinear, and without spoiling you have to dig pretty deep to solve some of the more arcane puzzles-relatively short for a pc game...its almost midnight.

												Holy Gaben, this is some really hard hitting stuff!Year Walk is a extremely strange game, that may be obtuse at times, but still generates so much genuine suspense and fear that you will be TERRIFIED to play this game for more than few-minute sessions. Interestingly enough, this isn't a pure horror game. While there are some jumpscares, they are not very common. They won't throw you out the experience. A really, REALLY CREEPY experience.The subject matter is extremely interesting. Swedish folklore is used here to the full extend and it's really fascinating. You are often encouraged and rewarded by checking game's implemented mini-encyclopedia, which is full of interesting reads. As for gameplay itself - it's mostly a point-and-click adventure game, but very unorthodox one. Control scheme and feel is very unique and hard to explain, but it definitely works. Puzzles are also pretty imaginative. They sometimes are a liiiitle too hard for my taste, but I didn't bother to much...With the High Octane Creepy Atmosphere, wonderful yet terrifying soundtrack and artstyle and some pretty mind-blowing tricks under the sleeve, I can easily recommend this game for all of you artsy indie-hipsters that dare to make a Year Walk.There will be consequences...

												Year Walk is best described as a sort of stylistic adventure horror game. It's not really a hidden object game, but more focused on atmosphere and puzzles. The story of Year Walk is that you play as a man named Daniel, who lives deep in the woods. You are about to perform something known as a Year Walk, which is an old Scandinavian legend to starve before the midnight of New Years and wander into the forest and night to seek a glimpse of the future. However, there are trials, and strange beings that are said will try to apprehend you, as the very act of Year Walking breaks the two truths of our world, time and space. As you play you have to overcome these trials, explore the deep and progressively strange and unsettling woods, and over it all maybe piece together why Daniel is so concerned about the future to risk his life.The atmosphere of the game is great. It's more unsettling, surreal, and strange than scary, but I had a constant uneasy feeling and yet fascination to events as they transpired around me. Everything dips into legends and myths from Swedish and Finnish tales, with a helpful encyclopedia if you're interested in knowing more of the origin of things around you. The whole atmosphere is backed by a fantastic soundtrack that, like the game, is appropriately off-kilter.Year Walk strikes me as one of those games that sticks with you long after you beat it. The story isn't entirely surprising in how it plays out, but it's executed very well, and the details are a lot stranger and help make the whole situation far stranger than what actually happens. It's sort of like a classic folk-story in that what happens is somewhat predictable if you have any experience with stories of a similar kin, but that's not what makes the story interesting, it's how it's told and how everything comes to that natural conclusion. And Year Walk has a lot of depth, things to look into, and intriguing mysteries that stay in the mind long after you find out what ultimately happens.Gameplay is pretty simplistic. You move left and right along a first-person 2D plane, and occasionally can walk forward or backward to another 2D plane. You interact with objects, and solve puzzles. The game isn't stylized like many other adventure games, with hidden item to find, as what you can and cannot do and interact with is very visible and clear, but some of the puzzles are a bit tricky. My tip is to sometimes think outside of the box. Most of the answers are often more obvious than they may seem at first, none are too challenging, but some aren't pushovers either. I also heavily suggest you keep a notebook and pen handy, it helped me a lot.It's a game with great atmosphere, an interesting experience that'll last you about two hours, and for many I'd imagine an interesting introduction to Scandinavian myths and folklore. If you have an interest in atmospheric horror experiences, folk stories, or games with a surrealistic edge, I'd definitely give it a recommendation.			"

												Year Walk is a great atmospheric horror puzzle-adventure game. It is not a very long game, for I finished this in under 2 hours (was expecting 3 hours based on the iOS users comments), but then again I think I missed out on some secrets and feel like there's more to it. (Update: Yes, there indeed is more to it. But I'll just leave it at that!). The puzzles here are fine. They're not very difficult, but just requires you to pay attention to the environment. Some of them I sorta ""accidentally"" solved by just clicking here and there, but otherwise the rest of them can be solved by looking at the environments and taking notes (yes, I actually mean taking notes as in using a pen and paper). Fear not as those that I accidentally solved were early into the game....the latter ones are complex enough that they're no fluke. One puzzle was particularly not obvious for me because it uses an input method that is not used in the entire game otherwise (don't wanna spoil too much). Should you be stuck, you can use the in-game hint system, which is kinda like a guide but not always 100% direct. Try not to over-use it, which is exactly what I did initially sadly. In hindsight, I regret succumbing so quickly when I got stuck. But at least this ensures you don't find yourself stuck for prolonged periods of time and needing to Google the solutions becomes moot.The atmosphere is well done. It is spooky and there are lots of unexpected things you can expect to see. I played the game in two sittings, the first of which was at around 1am. And my, did it raise my goosebumps! There was one particularly unexpected jump scare which made me say to myself ""Ok I'm gonna continue this in the morning in daylight"". Having played the second half in the morning, I feel the game's best played at night (past 12mn). Just so much more atmosphere then that cannot be replicated in daylight. Sound is great as well. Kinda what you expect from top-notch atmospheric indie games. It ranges from calm to downright eerie, and complements the game at every turn respectably.Controls are good too, though I would frankly have loved a keyboard shortcut for the map at least. Lost count of the number of times I needed to use the mouse pointer to get to the map screen. The area covered by the game isn't that big though, and there's a fair amount of backtracking required.  All in all, this is a nice little horror-puzzle-adventure game. The sound design that perfectly complements the haunting visuals sets a great atmosphere for the game. Year Walk received many accolades on iOS so it's good to see it make it to Steam. The $6 price seems reasonable for a two to three hour game that does not overstay its welcome.			"

Haunting. Were I to sum up my feelings on my time with Year Walk, I could think of no other term or phrase that better exemplifies my experience. In the brief time that it takes to complete this surreal journey, I could barely pull myself away from my computer.Year Walk is a story of a Love that cannot be, and a man who seeks to know if his love may ever be returned in kind. What follows is a bizarre foray into Scandinavian folklore, of moving through time itself to see one’s future, and facing the terrifying creatures that block your path.You’re limited to a two dimensional plane, from which you can move left and right, and to and from connected planes . The entirety of the map is relatively small, with around a dozen or so total planes from which you can move about freely. Given the game’s previous touch screen interface, it’s important to remember as such while trying to figure out puzzles. The game expects you to move your cursor like you would your finger, often quickly and in succession. Mind you, this never becomes a problem, as there are no reflexive puzzles to speak. I just feel it’s worth keeping in mind, as first starting out, it felt a bit odd solving puzzles in that manner using a standard mouse. Given this title’s origins on mobile platforms, it is important to know that any limitations this may bring to its mechanics do not extend to its presentation. The world you explore is gorgeous, and the orchestral score and sound design is superbly unsettling, to the point where I could visibly see goose bumps forming on my arms. The visual design itself is equally divine, and combined, make even the occasional jump scare give me a notable fright. While I would recommend this for the score alone, several of the puzzles require you to recognize subtleties in sounds, and so headphones are a must.The experience is short; it took me two hours to finish everything, and that was with plenty of incompetency on my part in regards to what I should be doing. Luckily, new to the PC port, there is a map system that always pinpoints your exact location. And there’s a hint system should you ever become lost on what you should be doing next. There’s also a series of journal entries that better explains the horrors you experience. While I would personally recommend waiting on these reads until after finishing the game, at the very least, you should refrain from looking at individual entries until you’ve successfully passed their respective portions of the game.In fact, the journal provides something I often find lacking in other similarly surrealistic titles: explanation. The journal provides a background on the Scandinavian mythos that you will encounter in the game, and the entire experience is better for it. Even given the very short length of the journey, I wholeheartedly recommend it as one that any interested in the bizarre and the macabre should pick up. It is spectacular, and I was glued to my computer screen for the entire duration. My time spent in these woods will remain with me for some time.			"

What would you give to see your future? And what would you do if you knew what it held?Enter Year Walk. YW is a short game, but a very haunting experience. It's unique, it thinks outside the box, it's something you ponder over well after the game ends. Let's dive into what people are looking for in a review, shall we?Story: Pay attention. That's all I can say without spoiling too much. The post-game content contributes a lot in this aspect!Gameplay: Original. This game does require you to do thinking, so don't expect to walk in (hah) and romp through all the puzzles- you won't. Puzzles can involve anything: memorization, sound recognition, unexpected controls, you name it. Solutions are never convoluted- you might be surprised!Graphics: Beautiful. Simply gorgeous, even when you're looking at a bloodied doll. Love it!Sound Effects: Headphones on, volume up; the sound is superbly done. Everything sounds perfect- the snow crunching under your shoes, the creaking wood of a windmill, the water running in the creek. Is that a woman singing in the distance? Is that a baby wailing... wait. Is that the plippity plop of blood I hear as well?Soundtrack: The soundtrack is beautiful and immersive. It can range anywhere from ""Wow, I could meditate to this!"" to ""Holy fudge I'm going to die!"" Like I said: headphones on, volume up! Lose yourself in Year Walk.Replayability/Post-Game Content: Only finished one walk so far, but definitely looking forward to jumping back in! After you beat the game, you get access to a nice fat journal in which clues are scattered for you to find. The clues unlock the true ending- it's unsettling.So is it scary?: To be honest, YW is not necessarily scary, but it's downright creepy. The atmosphere is done very well! There are a few jumpscares, so players with heart conditions beware!The Bad: Just a tad too short (~2-3 hours). A wee more content would be nice!Year Walk is a solid puzzle/pseudo-horror game. If you could see the future, then you'd know it's in your best interests to buy it![8/10] "

												Year Walk is a very interesting Adventure horror game. But will you want to play it ?Year Walk story is really hard to explain. You play as a man trying to do a year walk on New year's eve. It's based on Swedish mythology. It's one of those games where you piece the story together when you play it. Gameplay is really simple. You use the keyboard to move around and the mouse to click on stuff and the goals vary on the cycle you're on. It can range from trying to find ghost to trying to find a way to a church. The art style is amazing to say the least. The hand drawn environments and characters are really amazing to look at. The style is really well drawn. Audio is amazing. The soundtrack and sound effects are both really well made. It makes you feel tense and relaxed. It really makes you immersed in the world. The game isn't difficult. Some of the puzzles are difficult but nothing too head scratching. The game gives you clues  and even then you have hints which are helpful. The map layout is the only bad thing about this game. It get's confusing really fast and it doesn't help when all environments look the same. I wish they could have given more indication where you need to go.Game is really short. It took me 1 hour to finish it. There is an alternative ending which can be unlocked, but overall don't expect much replay value. The game didn't have bugs what so ever. Any rig could handle this game. Don't expect to run into bugs while playing this game.Year walk is a really tough game to review and to explain why you need to play it is even tougher, but you must play it no matter what. Year Walk was an amazing experience and the whole lore behind it is really interesting. Adventure game fans must own this little title as soon as possible. It's worth it at full price without a doubt. I give Year Walk a 8.5/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Year Walk is a game that I first purchased about a month after it's release here on Steam, over two years ago. I mainly just wanted a quick horror fix, and what I got was a lot more. This game focuses on the very obscure ancient Swedish tradition of Årsgång, or Year Walking. After playing this game, I was awestruck by not only the way the story was presented, but also by the amazing visuals, and how even though there was certainly horror elements in the game, I felt completely comfortable. Upon completing this game, I felt like I needed to know more about this tradition that was Årsgång. This feeling sent me on a two year journey through Swedish sources and 20 year old dead internet forums that helped me conclude a whole blog and thesis on this subject. Never has a game compelled me so strongly to find out more, and to know all I can possibly know, and in April of this year, I had done it. I had found out all there was to know about this once obscure tradition that now found itself as common knowledge.This is why I am asking everybody who could be reading this to BUY THIS GAME. You will be intrigued, terrified, curious, excited, mystified, and much more over this 2 or so hour journey, maybe three if you read the excellent encyclopedia. I've played this game 5 times now at different speeds and settings, just to make sure I found every little thing in this game. Now that I have, I must say it was completely worth it, and I'm sure I'll be going back to it again soon. Some people may find this game boring, and I understand that, it's not necessarily for everybody out there, but please just try it. This game is $6.00 (£4.10), when it should easily go for twice that price. if I had to give this game some sort of overall rating, it must be a 10/10. I feel ridiculous giving a rating out to a game that has changed the way I see things so much but I feel it's justified. Just play it.			"

												This game is hard to describe. At once serene, surreal, and disturbing. Unexpected and unnerving. And yet somehow delightful. I won't soon forget this one.It's not a very long game, but after you've finished it... it's not over. You'll see.			"

												Year walk starts as a puzzle game, only to reveal a backstory that is inspired heavily upon scandinavian folklore and depending on your immersion to the game and your general way of thinking, has the potential to haunt you for days. You start off as a mysterious person who has decided to try what is called ""year walking"" in order to predict your future. This entails staying alone in the dark without food/water during new year's eve, and when the clock strikes midnight, you take a walk in the forest surrounding your cabin. As you explore, you meet strange creatures, that taunt you with puzzles which you have to solve in order to be allowed for a glimpse of what the future holds. Little do you know that this knowledge comes with consequences.Year walk's art looks beautiful and in combination with the soundtrack, it creates a haunting and creepy atmosphere. You essentialy walk around in a 2d first person view environment, trying to make sense of the strange things you encounter. Many of them have a meaning towards solving the creature's riddles, so make sure to note down important stuff. Depending on your puzzle skills, you can find them easy or difficult, but there are hint and guide options for the latter, and I believe your overall experience will not be ruined either way. Also, the game's duration is rather small, probably under 3 hours, however I strongly recommend it, especially to avid puzzle gamers and anyone who enjoys a particularly well set backstory.+ Great art style+ Creepy atmosphere+ Great story+ Simple, but cryptic puzzles- A few jumpscares (might be a + depending on your taste)- Short duration- Puzzles can be frustrating without hint use for some people			"

												I only read about Year Walk days before its release on PC and I initially thought this was a point-and-click adventure game. And in a way it is, but not in the traditional sense. Yes, there's clicking involved and yes, there are puzzles to be solved (some of them are really hard, by the way) but it's more of a thriller/horror game with point-and-click adventure mechanics.I do have to say that I expected more horror here. The game is dark, and there are a couple of moments that are creepy but nothing truly scary. This disappointed me personally, because I like to be scared from time to time.Then again, I guess I shouldn't play this game for just that. There are tons of other games that *will* scare you.But Year Walk does have a good story and it looks pretty good for an iPhone port. It should be played if you like adventure games, or dark and creepy stories. I thought it was 'just ok', and nothing spectacular. But that's me. You might just have a different opinion. Give it a shot.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												""In the old days man tried to catch a glimpse of the future in the strangest of ways. Experience the ancient Swedish phenomena of year walking through a different kind of first person adventure that blurs the line between two and three dimensions, as well as reality and the supernatural.""This is hands down my favorite game of 2014. Perhaps ever. First of all, there is an achievement that requires you to beat the game in under 20 minutes. It can easily be done. I'd say it took about an hour my first run through. The music/sound effects are perfect --haunting and soft. There are a few ""Ahhh!"" scares, but only a few and that makes them even more special. The artwork is amazing - ethereal is the word that comes to mind. I found myself really interested in the folklore presented. I'm usually not big on reading, but it was really interesting and not overdone. There are some tastefully done creepy scenes. Again, not overdone. For someone who really struggles to stay focused on one thing for too long, this game was perfect. I was able to beat it three times and get all ten of the achievements without too much difficulty. I simply can not reccomend this game enough.			"

												This game is lovely and creepy and smart and relaxing and depressing and pretty and scary all at the same time. You should play it. Pros: I may just be a dummy, but I actually found the puzzles kind of hard. They are very much ""think-outside-the-box"" type puzzles, and my brain don't always work that way. I had to use the hints a lot. Fantastic atmosphere and visuals. Clever story-within-a-story that will make you question reality itself... Achievements that you will actually want to try to unlock because they are a major part of the game. Cons: There were a couple cut-scenes that felt very jarring and out of place because they were in a completely different visual style from the rest of the game.			"

												If you're into creepy mythologic stories, (this one touches swedish/scandinavian folklore) you should give it a go. The game is rather short, but it does its job. I had a jump-scare at some point, but the rest is just chills down the spine, ""oh my god did stuff like this really happen"", kind of game. I loved it, the only SHORTcoming being its length. The artwork is wonderful and so is the music. 10/10 no regrets!			"

												Year Walk is a (somehow?) cute and short horror-game. It's kinda like a point and click-adventure with quite some challenging puzzles, neat artstyle and disturbing background-story. The main goal of this game is to complete a so-called year walk, an ancient swedish ritual to predict ther future, and while you're playig the game gets pretty immersive and tense, though there ain't a constant cause of danger as in most horrorgames. It pulls all of it's horror-elements from immersion, through noises and the story. I bought it on sale and would certainly recommend it, even though it's short and not your typical horror-game.			"

												Published by: SimogoDeveloped by: SimogoGenre: Puzzle, Indie, HorrorRelease Date: 7 March, 2014Time to complete: 1.5 hoursIntroductionA puzzle game with a twist; Year Walk is a horror interpretation of the Ancient Swedish folklore ‘Årsgång’.GameplaySet in the 19th Century, you venture through the woods full of unsettling creatures and a dark foreboding atmosphere, taking part in a Year Walk. The scenery starts off pleasant enough, a picturesque snowy woodland. As you walk further and further, more secrets unfold and the eerie surroundings become more and more intense (and in some cases, outright disturbing). A lot of navigating and exploration is required to work out the puzzles; there is a map to help with this however, and also hints should you find yourself stuck. The story unravels as you unlock more puzzles, often adding to the mystery rather than solving it. I rather like both puzzle and horror games, and enjoyed the creepy combination of the two in this very well-made folklore rendition. There’s plenty of reading material (especially at the ‘end’, don’t skip the end credits!) which I enjoyed going through.Though the puzzles were really well formulated in my opinion, my favourite part was piecing everything together in the end and discovering the story myself; seeing all the initially puzzling scenes come together to tell the whole story. I like how subtle the clues were, encouraging me to unlock all the secrets and dig deeper into the background of the story.Graphics & ArtThe game is beautiful, that much can be observed by looking at the store page; it’s set in a dreary yet alluring snowy woodland. Even the disturbing aspects are somewhat beautiful in a twisted way. The art is bright yet dark, pretty yet depraved; a perfect amalgamation of two opposite forces creating something so very captivating.Replay ValueBeing a puzzle game, once you’ve worked out all the clues there is little point playing it again. The entire purpose of Year Walk, or at least in my opinion, is slowly allowing the clues to unfold as you play. SoundtrackThe instrumental soundtrack is pleasant to listen to, with unsettling tracks and effects throughout to accentuate certain scenes. AchievementsNot all achievements are obtainable by playing the game through (one being ‘Year Run’ which is essentially a speedrun, and fairly impossible to do on the first playthrough). There are guides available to help with the trickier achievements if you are stuck. Difficulty & ChallengeThe mechanics are very simple, but don’t let that fool you; some puzzles and their corresponding clues can be terribly vague. At times, the clues can be found before you even realise what puzzle they are for. For this reason, I suggest you take note of your surroundings (potentially even writing them down). A lot of the puzzles do seem simplistic, but because of the ambiguity of the clues (and the fact that you often find them before even knowing what to do with them), they seem a lot harder and did leave me somewhat perplexed on a few occasions. Overall VerdictI find that horror games are often lacking in the narrative department, being more about a few jump scares here and there and a few bloodied creatures lurking around the place, rather than venturing into the domain of why (e.g. sure having a random creature jump out at you as you explore is frightening, but it’s irrelevant to the story). This is where Year Walk stands out from the rest; not only does it have unsettling visuals and audio, it proves that a well-written story is enough to send chills down your spine. Year Walk doesn’t rely on the standard scare-tactics of your average horror game, because it doesn’t have to. Overall Score: 9/10 "

												In terms of concept, this game is aimed at people who appreciate the darker side of folk heritage. Being based on Swedish folklore that intertwines with a personal drama and a musing on time & space continuum (it's actually less pretentious than it sounds), it offers a haunting and rewarding playing experience.The soundtrack is excellent (kudos to Mr Daniel Olsén) and the graphics are good enough for this type of game.  The game features one of the most interesting lore pages and in-game diaries I have had the opportunity to read.Gameplay-wise, it is an atmospheric combo of the point and click, adventure and horror genres. I have expected a more disjointed experience, but its strong concept keeps the strings of the gameplay together.From a purely technical point of view, the game still feels like a port from a mobile device, but, to its credit, it handles the job rather well.Overall, a solid one!8.5/10			"

												Year Walk is a great game that is well worth it's price.  Though the game is short, it is packed full of content and you'll be entertained from start to finish.  The game mechanics are simple and the puzzles are challenging but not irritatingly so.Where this game really shines is the incredible atmosphere.  Few games that  I have played have really drawn me into their world the way that this one has.  The scenery and the music work together in a way that make you truly feel the game as you play it.  I honestly felt that  I was wandering through a supernatural forest seeking answers to questions that only the spirits knew.  Don't even get me started on how eerily creepy the game was, especially since when  I first started playing I hadn't been aware that it was a horror game.  Your second time through the game only adds to this as you learn A LOT about the events of the game through a second individual's eyes. If you're looking for an atmospheric, creepy puzzle game with a deep storyline, look no further.  Year Walk is worth a playthrough!			"

												At first, Year Walk seems like a simple point & click adventure, but as the game progresses, hints and puzzles are revealed. As clues piece together and the story unravels, everything takes a dark turn with elements of horror and Swedish folklore leading to many questions left unanswered. It's haunting, atmospheric, interactive, and definitely creepy. I honestly can't think of anything to criticize other than the game being a bit short. but when playing for the first time, it takes a while to backtrack and write down clues for puzzles. Helpful things to know before playing:write down everything! copy down patterns, symbols, and anything else you think would be helpful. some things will only appear on the screen once and are necessary for solving puzzlesread the encyclopedia! the game comes with a mini encyclopedia explaining things that will appear in the game. I would do this before (or while) playing because it helps understand what's going on if you don't know much about swedish folklorethe game isn't over when you think it isWould definitely reccomend! Especially if you like adventure games, puzzles, & dark stories!  "

												This game manages to take mythology, folklore and tales from Sweden's past and weave them into a pilgrimage of sorts with an interesting narrative with nothing more than simple puzzle mechanics. It's a lot more fun than many other games of similar ilk and it's clearly down to a lot of care and attention during development as well as a knowledge and emphasis of the lore. I found it short, quite different and refreshing and interesting to play through.HighlightsThe things that carry Year Walk are most definitely the simple ambient design and the weaving of the story and lore into the world while staying true to the subject matter. It's carefully and smartly done and often feels as though you're part of a fairy tale or dark bedtime story as much as a video game.Mistakes and AnnoyancesBeing a port of a mobile game, it suffers from a lack of depth from the gameplay, and while the hands off approach definitely works well with the narrative and story, it's still an issue when compared against other longer, deeper titles at the same price. Having said that though, I feel like had the game been any longer it may've run the risk of adding less enjoyable puzzles for the sake of length rather than story and ultimately, while short and simple, everything is fun to experience and discover.RecommendationsPriced at $5.99/£4.79/4.99€ on the Steam Store at the time of review, Year Walk isn't expensive and probably isn't overpriced, but there may be better alternatives around the same price range on Steam and mobile. Due to the interesting world, atmosphere and content though, and the simple enjoyable play-through, there's no reason to avoid Year Walk and it's worth a play for anyone looking to waste an hour or so.* Note: Purely by coincidence I seem to have played Year Walk at the perfect time and picked up a free achievement for my luck. Happy New Year everyone!* Simogo, the developers of Year Walk, have a fantastic website full of Apps, Music, Art and other interactive projects. Their blog and work portfolio[simogo.com] in particular are very worth a look.Unedited review notes 31/12/2015 for Year Walk

+Style and scares work well with the mythology and lore, even if I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥scared of jumpscares
+Nicely thought out puzzles with plenty of clues
+Good staggered hints system
-Puzzles are often too easy to misinterpret or hard to spot in the world
-Puzzles often require backtracking "

Year Walk is a beauty. It’s a vague, elusive game, the sort that drops a player in the atmospheric snow with no instructions apart from forward back left right mouse, and says, Go find the Mill. And so we do. The art is papery in a palette of rich and pale red-browns and grays, and everything is cladded in snowdrifts. We move through small wintry areas on a sketchy, spidery map, dotted with bleak features: a dead campfire, a rickety fence, a frozen pond, a bit of snow-streaked path. There are secrets to find, and a small encyclopedia describing a few of the Swedish mythic creatures we may encounter along the way. It’s a hushed world, reluctant with its discoveries. Some of the puzzles are outright puzzling, and on my first ending - at about 90 minutes, and I’m not all that game-clever, if you’re looking for a measure - I wasn’t sure what had just gone down. But this game isn’t over until you see the words “The End,” which in my case was at the finish of my third cycle - more alert players may finish it in just two. I played without hints, apart from the in-game clue system, and am really glad I did, because when the hidden story is revealed the experience is rich and exciting.I LOVED THIS ONE, and recommend it highly if you’re mystery-tolerant.

												The only thing that bothered me was the short lenght of the game, other than that I'd say its pretty much worth the tiny heart attacks that occur every now and again even when its really nothing especially scary. The art style is pretty simplistic, but it really is beautiful and, to me, it really does help the game pop and settle it in its own, distinctive thing. The puzzles aren't really that difficult if you're used to this type of game (though the musical sequences don't apply to this). There are several bits which can be a bit nerve wrecking (e.g. the safe just outside your cottage) and many of the throphies require you to play the game once or twice again.All in all it really is a solid, little piece of work which is well worth the money. I don't want to spoil anything, seeing how it really is gratifying when you figure something out on your own. Buy it, play it again and again, lose your mind over (what are essentially) really simple tasks and ease into the unsettling, unnerving atmosphere that will make you jump at your own shadow.			"

Year Walk was game I had in my library for quite a long time. I was always sure, that eventually I get to the point of playing it ... Well, I finally reach that point.Let me say from the get go - this is one BEAUTIFUL looking, sounding game, with great atmosphere and lore behind it.There is not much into the mechanics, you walk left-right-forward-backwards, interact with things, but that doesn't matter at all, because story is the meat of this game. You wonder around, doing back and forth to progress, to reach the end, that is maaaaaaaaaaaaybe kinda predictable, but still will leave uncomfortable feeling inside you.I enjoyed myself a lot, but without proper guide (thanks  Hen City guest ) I would be completely miserable and wouldn't know what to do in preper manor and full sanity levels - I'm really dumb like that with puzzles in game and IRL.You, Dear Reader should definitely pick this one from your library when you are not sure what to play. I'm sure Year Walk will leave you in awe, and wanting explore more with journal and second ending(!), and maybe to go on a Year Walk by yourself - who knows?And please do one more thing: Don't expect horror. Just don't. Grade: A "

												A minimalist, atmospheric, pretty, challenging horror puzzle game.Year Walk captures the eerie essence of a supernatural Scandinavian forest by night, and really succeeds in the horror aspect. There is a tension that accompanies the cold sounds and bleak environs. I was very impressed by the artistic style of Year Walk. It was minimalist, bleak but also beautiful. The colours aren't vibrant but they needn't be - hell they *shouldn't be*. This is the snowy wilderness of Scandinavia. I expect white, greys, blacks. Purples and reds are also used sparingly and effectively. The puzzles can be difficult, which I find helps the game a lot. It's a bit of a throwback to when games just sort of left you to it, with few or no hints. You're pretty much on your own in Year Walk, and I had to consult a walkthrough a couple of times. Some puzzles require some thought, and I found myself utilising the whole map to complete the puzzles, so no wasted space there at all. The story is a difficult aspect to critique because I feel the gameplay tells the story itself. So to critique the way I play the game is to critique the story. That being said, there is some backstory, which is told through some basic dialogue at the beginning of the game, and there is an encyclopaedia which accompanies you in the game, which is pretty critical to completing the game - but the information in the (very small) encyclopaedia helps give background also. I find this method of story telling to be quite innovative and also found it really help immerse me in the game. The controls are basic - arrow keys for navigation, mouse for point/click. Can't really go wrong there.In conclusion, Year Walk is a quirky, beautiful little game. Not particularly long, but it achieves a lot in that short time, particularly in regards to puzzle solving, immersion, horror and artistry.			"

												As I read in another review and fully agree, this game is not about how intricate the puzzles are or how hard it is to beat. It is about the experience. It is enjoying your walk, hearing your footsteps in the snow, the scenes, the art and the little story. How good you are at this game is not how fast you can finish it or how easy you found the puzzles (and yes, it is short and yes, the puzzles are rather easy).To new players, I would recommend to take your time and explore everything, read everything and avoid the temptation of hitting the ""clue"" button. Walk with the poor guy and feel the creepy and sad atmosphere  while you hunt after souls of murdered babies or chase after a mysterious voice in the dark .The artwork is absolutely wonderful and the music is perfect.About playing it again... I certainly will. Some of the Steam achievements could be a good excuse to go back inside (like finishing a walk without using the map or skipping clues, which you can easily manage after playing it once). I think that this game could be played more than once, because it is not about solving puzzles or being startled. So, you can do yet another Year Walk, now that you know what you have to do and how to do it, and focus on other things this time! And I am not talking about the second ending, after you finish the year walk and receive the clue to open the journal; I mean even after that.  "

												This game is an experience.It may be a dumb thing to say. After all, playing any game is an ""experience. But while I can recommend many games for their rich story, challange they provide, interesting gameplay mechanics or simply beacuse they're entertaining, Year Walk is one of few games that I think should be played just to be experienced.The atmosphere is amazing. Persanally, I took interest in this title because it had ""Horror"" in it's tags, but it's so much more than that. The world, while not big, feels rich, magical and mysterious. Inclusion of things based on the Swedish folklore in the major reason for that.Still, I can't say that it lacks in the horror department. It can be unnervingly creepy at times.Game's art style is just gorgeous to look at and intensifies the tone of the game dramatically.Gameplay is fairly simple. It focuses on exploration and solving dofferent puzzles, which are not too hard nor too easy. It shouldn't be the problem for any time of gamer.If this game peaked your interest, you love a good atmosphere, and you like solving brain teasers while traveling alone in the woods filled with strange creatures, then you should give Year Walk a try. You won't regret it.			"

												Absolutely love this game. At first it seems simple, but as you progress it becomes a twisting enigma of questions left unanswered. The artwork is amazing, the style and creepy atmoshpere this game delivers kept me on the edge of my seat through my entire first playthrough because I just didn't know what to expect. Sometimes the puzzles were a little redundant, but no game's perfect. There's really not much to complain about, other than it's short. I love these kind of games, but they're just so hard to find these days. I've played a lot of indie games (LIMBO, The Cat Lady, others), so i've been through a lot of the independent gems out there, and this one's definitely one I won't soon forget. Definitely recommend this game to anyone, especially if the artwork/atmosphere catches your eye.			"

												Every once in a while, I find myself in a mood that makes me want to experience something different; when such a thing happens, I take a peek at a game that doesn't look like a typical game; that neither plays, nor feels, like one; a game such as Year Walk.A chill and dark venture into Swedish folklore, Year Walk consists of a series of pleasant and simple puzzles, all set under the frame of a forest; but as the title suggests, the core of the game is rather in the walking and immersing yourself in a very unique acoustic and visual landscape, and in the story that unfolds as you progress. Do not let yourself be fooled by the ""horror"" tag some people have put the game under; this is anything but a horror game despite - or rather because of - its exploring of a dark folklore.Year Walk isn't just another video game, in that you won't have fun going through it. You will experience something.Have you ever encountered an Owl in the middle of a forest, at night? Stood silent in the dark, your breathing suddenly becoming less of an automatism, while these two bright eyes were staring at you? It is a very precious feeling; one that games such as Year Walk try to convey... and sometimes succeed in doing so.			"

												This is a real horror game. It's not like all those crap jump scare filled mainstream horror games. It has suspense that actually makes you scared to continue playing. It's paper like art style really adds to its creepy atmosphere. I also really enjoyed the story and Scandinavian folklore. All in all this is a very original and interesting game and it deserves its high praise.			"

												Year Walk is a gorgeous, atmospheric game based around folklore from Sweden. Originally published for iOS, I feel the game translates well to the PC platform. The game itself has controls that, while different than the standard WASD, are simple enough to get used to after a minute or so of walking around the forest. Overall, the game is short, creepy, educational, and worth playing multiple times because each playthrough reveals yet another layer of story to an already well-written and immersive game.Highly recommend this; it's on sale during this year's (2014) Summer Sale! You should pick it up ASAP.			"

												Year Walk is based on Swedish lore about vision quests. You embark on a long walk in the woods, looking for signs and meanings, and you come across some very strange stuff. There's a very dreamlike quality to the game where the odd glyph or ghost you run into feels almost expected, but it also serves to take you out of the real world and immerse you with very simple, beautiful graphics. This makes the horrifying bits all the more effective, because they come in rough contrast to the feel of the rest of the game. I won't lie, there have been a few jump scares, but the feel earned instead of cheap. It's like a nightmare intruding on the edges of a pastoral dream.Gameplay is simple, moving left or right through pretty landscapes, moving forward or backward to different areas, and clicking on things to interact. You have a useful map and an encyclopedia that helps flesh out the legends and signs you encounter. The game also has a very clever way of getting you to use the encyclopedia later on, which I found very effective. The puzzles are pretty simple as well, so don't go in expecting a lot of gameplay. It's mostly exploring the woods and delving into the myths you encounter, which for the price, I think is well worth it. An entertaining, chilling experience.			"

												I'm not normally one for puzzle games, I don't have the patience, but I thoroughly enjoyed getting to the bottom of this title. The game in itself is very short so how much you'll get out of Year Walk really is down to your skills in problem solving, I'm rubbish so it took me ages! Once you do know your way around, the game can then be finished very quickly but getting to the end credits is just one part of the puzzling goodness.There are yet more mysteries to unravel on completion of the game and even the achievements themselves are conundrums that need to be solved. The art style is excellent and the music is wonderfully unsettling. Highly recommended.			"

												I did like the art style, the concept and the story. I'm convinced that this game would have been a very enjoyable experience on a tablet. But played on PC, without a touchscreen, it wasn't. It just felt horrible to control, every puzzle that needed more than simple clicking was extremely tedious, to the point where I had to look for a walkthrough for a puzzle that had a very simple solution, because what would have been intuitive on a touchscreen was tricky and counter-intuitive with a mouse. Almost no puzzle felt rewarding due to bad controls and tedious backtracking/notetaking.If you can play it on a tablet, I'd say go for it, but definitely not on PC, unless controls and puzzles are changed considerably. Which is a shame, because apart from that it is really beautiful and creative.Spoiler/Hint considering the ending: You don't have to do a complete second play through to get the real ending. Just wait for the credits to end, note the clues, start a second run. Then you read the journal, which I found quite entertaining, go to the box and open it. That's it, unless I overlooked something. I did get ""The End"" this way. "

The game is short enough to be beaten within an hour (I don't like games that take too much time), but after all there is enough potential left to play it a second, third or fourth time: Different endings and additional, more challenging, puzzles, that don't have to be solved when playing it the first time.And apart from that is 5,99€ an excellent price for a game I have so much fun with!Congrats, Simogo.

												This is a really great game if you like horror games with atmosphere rather than gore. There is a bit of blood, but it serves a greater purpose. And there are a few well-done jumpscares. (I counted three that really made me jump, but I haven't seen the whole game.) The game is based off of old Swedish folklore, so there's a handy encylopedia in game if you have any questions about what you see. (It's better than going in blind!) The puzzles are very insightful, and they require some thought. There are hints, so use them if you get stuck. Some of them require unusual means to solve. (One uses ""keys"" and even the game's interface to solve.) I really have to applaud the dev's creative thinking for these puzzles! Oh, and pay attention to your surroundings. Those hold the key to some of the puzzles. Especially in places you don't want to tarry too long.The art is amazing, no lie. It's beautifully done, and the monochrome pallete sets you in a very somber mood. (There are splashes of color here and there, though)The music is wonderful, and the song they play during the credits especially is both eerie and soothing, which ups the creepy factor by about ten. However, there is a part (In an old tree) where the music gets kind of loud, but don't mute your sound because you need it on to solve that puzzle.)And don't forget there's a new game plus feature! That box you can't open right near your cabin at the beginning of the game? Ignore it. You can only get to it after you've already done one walk.This is hands down one of the best indie horror games I've ever played. Go get it right now!			"

												A hazy and dreamy exploration in Swedish folklore laced with some thematic horror. No, year walking is not a a real thing, but as we learned to write down our tales all to late it’s all quite blurry anyway. A few of the puzzles are infuriatingly hard and the overall game map is small enough to get away with the disorienting way of movement along it. I never missed the lack of narrative while playing, but the excellent writing in the ending showed a glimpse of what the game could have been with a bigger budget. It’s a couple of hours long, short on story but great on ambience. Probably only recommended for hardcore adventure fans and those interested in the peculiarly dark tales of Swedish folklore.			"

Year WalkThis review was last edited when I had completed the gameShort ReviewA very original, highly stylised 2/2.5D adventure/puzzle game with excellent puzzles. Often I had only a vague idea about what was actually going on but somehow that was all part of its charm. Highly recommended.Long ReviewThis is certainly one of the most unusual games I've played in a long time. Essential it's a 2.5D adventure game with puzzles & an interesting if abstract storyline. The game is played in relatively limited area of forested Scandinavia but don't let the limited area put you off. The scenery is full of detail with, often abstract, clues.The 2.5D gameplay is unique in my experience. You move smoothly to the left and right but depth movement is a sudden rush that moves you between 2D sections. There are prompts on the top and bottom of the screen in the form of arrows that indicate when forwards or backwards movement is possible. There is a map that can be brought up at any time which shows the links between the 2D sections as well as prominent features in the landscape.There is no hand holding. You are told to use WASD keys and the mouse button to interact and then you're on your own. In fact you're on your own to the point that after the initial intro I really hadn't a clue what I was supposed to do so it was a case of wandering around exploring intially until slowly but surely after visiting places several times the penny dropped on what the puzzles actualyl were.One of the things I liked about the game is that I often found it more difficult figuring out what the puzzles were than actually solving them.Whilst I didn't actually find the game outright scarey (with a couple of exceptions when things flashed unexpectedly on the screen) I always had a feel of unease playing it. The fear of the unknown, the strange encounters and the eerie music fed into this.I certainly recommend reading the integrated Encyclopedia before/whilst playing as it explains what the game is about. It is a good, interesting read.The game progress saves each time you quit.ProsBeautiful, stylised graphicsWell thought out puzzlesHint systemConsI found it pretty difficultThe control to interact with objects is pretty trickySometimes the hint system just told me stuff I already knew but not what I needed to knowMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freeWhere I got the game fromBought at  Bundle Stars [www.bundlestars.com] as part of the All Stars 6 BundlePlatform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse & Steelseries MERC keyboard.

												Year Walk is a sidescrolling adventure game. Weird thing is that you will play the entire game strafing from left to right and then only moving up or down to different areas through authorized corridors. This makes the whole movement scheme feels rather clunky and not very immersive. This game could also severely be improved by accessing the map through TAB since you already navigate with WASD. Unfortunately this keybind was absent. I had to beat the game in one go since I could not see any way to save my game. I had about 3 hours of gameplay but I did rather poorly. There is a lot of running around in circles in this game, and you should definitely play with headphones on as this game relies a lot on its music score and on musical clues as part of its immersion strategy as well as an additional way to provide clues in solving puzzles. The toolbar icon can be hidden and the already rather nice graphical direction is improved with occasional use of old film grain styled black spots which is kind of neat. The story revolves around a re-rendition of old scandinavian myths, since basically no one knows anything about Scandinavian myths anymore, they included a miniature in-game encyclopedia to help give you context. There is nearly no dialogue per say in this game but most of the time the non verbal language of the creatures you meet are often enough for you to guess what you need to do. Failing that there is an in-game hint system which also comes in very handy. All in all the use of myths, and the setting are very nice, however the clunkyness of the engine, and the guesswork nature of some of the puzzles detract from the experience and I had to consult metagaming sources to avoid frustrating stalls and keep the story moving. I will therefore offer a careful recommendation since by the time i was all done with the game it still left me with the feeling that I had gone through a rather unique and satisfying experience. Be advised that the game has some grim undertones to it			"

												This is a desolate, surreal walking simulator adventure game with jump scares and ARG elements. Its tone is both wondrous and depressing, dictated very firmly by the Scandinavian folklore on which the game heavily leans. The game uses all the tools at its disposal rather impressively, creating auditory puzzles as well as visual ones and hiding relevant information in plain sight. Unfortunately, this may make some puzzles come off as obtuse and force people to look up solutions outside of the game proper.I'm giving this game a ""thumbs up"" despite the fact that I don't want to play it again. True to the folklore that inspired the game, there is no happy ending to be found in it. From the perspective of someone who appreciates game-world lore consistency, I love this, but it still does not compel me to replay the game (for achievements or otherwise).Personally, I find the experience to be worth the full admission price, despite the tone. You may disagree, but I still recommend picking this game up while it's on sale.			"

												Year Walk is a beautiful horror game that takes place in the cold, Swedish winter landscape. I just have to mention how glad I am to see the Swedish folklore being presented in such a visually enchanting game, I hope that we will get to see more games with this theme in the future. And also it is really cool to see a modern horror game that relies on a haunting atmosphere rather than cheap tricks such as constant jumpscares. I would recommend any horror fan to pick this up right now, it is definitely worth the money. All in all this is probably one of the greatest interpretations of Swedish folklore that I've ever seen.+: Amazing atmosphere and beautiful design, very reasonable price considering that it's a pretty short game, Unusual theme and setting.-: Some of the puzzles are rather frustrating. One could consider it to be way to short.			"

												Year walk is a unique and charming experience. While largely a point-and-click puzzle game, the mechanics are a lot more interesting than that in terms of gameplay, movement and interaction. Built around a collection of Swedish mythology, the story is strange in the most compelling way, with themes, characters, and creatures that will have you reading the in-game encyclopedia out of genuine interest rather than absolute necessity. While a relatively short game, it's the perfect length to keep the ideas behind it fresh and the narrative dynamic and engaging.			"

The game is short, and the puzzles some are obvious while some are meh, the ones I did solve without cheating I did not feel that much success, simply because I just brute forced them. The one that stumped me, was because the object I was looking for was hiding, in a part of the game that was not actually part of the game, which made absolutely no sense.The game has next to no dialogue. While I like folklore and mythologies, it seemed to focus on all of the dark and negative aspects of those mythologies. The ending of the game is miserable, and the so called true ending is even more miserable. Jump scares are annoying, and some of the scenes just did not even make sense at all.I played it, I beat it, but I simply can't recommend it. This simply is not my type of game.			"

												For me, this game was impossible to play without a walkthrough. Therefore I don't enjoy it that much. It's too hard to figure what you'll have to do without using the walkthrough. The hints are the game are just too vague, or don't make any sense at all. Something postive to end this with: the art style is really simplistic, but beautiful. Nothing to complain about.			"

												This is a great game, although I recommend getting it on sale because it's so short. As you can see in the achievements section, one of the achievables is a ""Year Run,"" or getting through a full year walk in 20 minutes. Granted, there's almost no way to do that the first time round unless you're using a walkthrough, but it's useful to illustrate how quick the story can be. Without giving too much of the plot away, a full experience of the game requires a minimum of two year walks.In terms of genre, I'd sooner call this game ""dark fantasy"" than ""horror,"" as there are only three total jumpscares, even using the most expansive definition: moments that succeed in startling chihuahua-like individuals such as myself. As far as actual scary moments, there's really only one. Still, the game is stylistically horror-tinged throughout. It's not so much a bloodbath as it is blood slowly soaking through cloth. Both have their benefits.The puzzles are fairly simplistic, but without the use of a walkthrough, the game is still surprisingly difficult, if only because it drops you in the middle of snowy nowhere without holding your hand and pushing you in the right direction. Luckily, there's a happy medium between muddling through it alone and full-on cheating: in-game hints. They're actually really helpful if you get stuck. It's sort of like falling asleep partway through a documentary on Swedish folktales and having a sick nightmare about it. Didn't your mother ever tell you not to do lucy while watching PBS?			"

												Year Walk is definitely an interesting game, maybe less so 'game' but huge emphasis on interesting. I would call this a visual story (not to be confused with a visual novel) and while most games are obviously 'visual stories', I'll try to give a reason as to why I call it that. I'll start with the gameplay as that will help me get my point across. Your character (never given a name) is put into this beautiful snowy landscape. The only movements you can make are to walk left and right, or forwards and backwards on paths. You have a cursor so you can click on objects here and there, but there aren't a ton of things to interact with. Hence, why I say this is more of a visual story. While you do have control, I feel more like you're just watching through their eyes.Onto the gameplay/setting. The term ""Year Walk"" (Årsgång) refers to a Swedish ritual that was believed to be done by people from the medieval times to the 19th century. The Year Walk was done on either Christmas Eve, or New Years. The idea is that you lock yourself in your house, void of light, no eating, drinking, or interacting with others. After which of 24 hours, the year walker is tasked with heading to their church in order to have a vision of the coming years future. There, they will have to pass the tests of supernatural creatures in order to be granted that vision.The premise alone is very intriguing, and I knew nothing of it while diving into this game. Let me say this, I played through Year Walk in one sitting. Now, it only took me about 2.5 hours, but that time alone was very gripping and I couldn't wait to progress further along. The atmoshpere of the game is mind blowing. Play this with headphones on and in a dark room for full immersion. The game is also genuinely terrifying through it's use of the lore. Added that the soundtrack beautiful and the art is amazingly well put together, you've crafted a very serene yet eerie world that can totally draw you in and make you lose sight of things.While I would love to tell you much more about this game, I really need to leave it up to you to discover what it holds. It's not terribly hard, puzzle wise, but there are some here and there. Also, in game, if you'd like to read up more, they provide an encyclopedia that provides some descriptions of what you'll encounter. I've also heard you need to play it more than once to really get the full picture. So, I hope you will play this as I highly recommend it. It's something that will stay with you long after it's over.P.S. Don't worry about the box. Yet.			"

												Year Walk has a way of leaving one wishing for more of the story, and wondering where the lines between game and academia lay. It is one of few games where following the clues after your first playthrough leads to larger revelations of the story, rather than bells and whistles. But in a true twist, leaving the world of the game to do your own research leads to a surprising discovery. Though similar to Never Alone in its ability to extend cultural lore to a wider audience, Year Walk is not built with the purpose of accurate celebration of ancient Scandanavian folklore. However, it is a lovely game full of lonely visuals that harken to a time when people believed in the things that go bump in the night. If you enjoy folklore and visual artistry, this game is worth the few hours of your time it will take to complete.			"

												Year Walk is a game that requires and rewards obsession. This isn’t saying  so very much. It’s about two hours. You only have to work up a little obsession, a little checking and rechecking, a few scribbled notes, light diagramming. Year Walk is not difficult. It only asks mindset enough to engage with its premise. Yes, engage in minor self-deprivation, fast, avoid festivals, and set out into the night to find the future, if you can only face everything within these woods.I am not always the greatest player of games like this, due to impatience and a tendency to try to solve even straightforwardish puzzles by overthinking, but the strength of Year Walk is its dark folklore tone, its eerily blocky art, the loneliness of the forest until you’re suddenly not alone. This is 90% atmosphere, but it’s great atmosphere. And you do have to read the encyclopedia, which contains my favorite style of game lore, all mildly oblique supernatural rumor contextualized with cultural rooting.The story framing the Year Walk itself relies on some tropes that I won’t spoil, but don’t do much for me. However, it’s also beside the point. The presentation is creepily fantastic, the mood is perfect, and what else are you playing for?			"

OverviewOriginally released as a mobile app in 2013, Year Walk is a short puzzle horror game developed by Simogo involving the journey of a young man experiencing the act of, well, yearwalking. The player will learn about the various Swedish folklore as they traverse through the winter landscapes and try to glance into what would become of the future. ReviewVisuals: Let's begin with the graphics. The art style is designed around geometric shapes and straight lines, being quite well polished and creating a unique artstyle and brings the atmosphere of this game to life. The colors used in the game consists mainly of black and white, which is greatly compliments the aesthetic tone of the setting. At the end of the game, the artist includes a section where the artstyle is very geometric and focuses on the simplicity of shapes, of which I thought was very interesting choice for the finale. Overall, the graphics are very pleasing to look at and crafted thoroughly. Rating: AMusic/Sound: As a horror game, Year Walk provides its fair share of suspensful sound effects that fits well into the player's experience. The jingles that play after completing certain puzzles are also quite rewarding and a nice touch added into the game. The soundtrack is composed by Daniel Olsén, in which he sets in an amazingly atmospheric mood with each of his tracks, based upon the instruments found in Swedish folk music. Definitely one of my favorites in video games and one I find myself returning to. Rating: AStory: The story of Year Walk is quite simple and easy to follow, although there is definitely a twist in the end that I choose not to spoil for those who still have not played the game yet. A young man wants to gaze into the future, in which he decides to perform an ancient ritual in upon Nordic history, known as the yearwalking. The game goes in depth upon yearwalking as you progress with the game, but I find it rather fascinating along with the rest of the Swedish mythologies that the developers have implemented into the game, each with their own overviews. There's really not much to complain, as the story keeps you emmersed into the very end.Rating: AGameplay: As a puzzle game, Year Walk provides a display of interesting puzzles that utilies many varieties of techniques. The player will have to be both observant and think outside the box for each one, and they definitely provide a new challenge each one you stumble upon. It flows quite well and weaves into the story, both complimenting each other through, holding up the atmosphere of mystery along with horror. The creativity that are used within the puzzles are probably my favorite aspect of this entire game, and is a wonder to play through.Rating: AFinal VerdictYear Walk shines through all of the aspects of an enjoyable game and brings it to a new level. Its uniqueness and lore-filled gameplay will have the player interested in finding out more about its Nordic origins. The twist ending provides the player with an even stronger sense of determination to truely find out about what the yearwalking is all about. I suppose the only complaint would be that this game is definitely on the short side, which is both a positive and a negative attribute, depending on how you look at it. Final Rating: A			"

The puzzles are loosely based on the characters in your encyclopedia (make sure you read these to get more out of the game).

												Year Walk is one of the most interesting and unique experiences I have had in gaming for a very long time. It's a first person adventure horror game based around the little known Swedish folklore of the ""year walk"", a ritual where individuals go without food and drink all day and then wander the woods at midnight, hoping to gain visions of the future but also potentially encountering dangerous supernatural beings. As such, the setting and story are fantastic and really draw you into the game. The great soundtrack, creepy sound effects, and unique visual style that looks like a mix between a pop-up book and a silent film help to enhance the setting even further and make this game a very emotional experience. While playing Year Walk, I truly felt the sensation of being all alone in a dark forest. In this way, the game was simultaneously comforting and terrifying in a way that I can't quite explain. Another enjoyable aspect of the game is that it essentially drops you into an open world and leaves you to explore and solve puzzles on your own, much like Myst or The Witness.Overall, I highly recommend Year Walk. It's an experience not easily forgotten and best played on a dark snowy evening with a good set of headphones.			"

												This is a casual point and click/puzzle games with horror elements.   Its more of a creepy feeling brought about by the ancient swedish folklore that the theme of the game is based around.  It is not challanging in the traditional way of puzzle games but in combonation with the bleak and cryptic backround, the goals requiring thinking beyong what is right in front of you.  You may want to carry a pen and paper while playing this game! I like that.  Not exciting, but rewarding and original.  Crisp art, information about the folklore and a few jumpy/scary moments it was worth the few hours it took to play through twice...  Its not a happy game :) 7 of 10.  Interesting game			"

												It seems like Year Walk should be a hard game to recommend. Scary enough that people who aren't horror fans might not like it, but probably not scary at all to horror diehards. And it's short - finished my playthrough in about 2 hours, and aside from redoing one puzzle (that I can't go into detail on because spoilers), there's not much replay value.But, I was impressed by how they used a somewhat cartoonish, paper cutout art style but still evoked a sense of dread. Puzzles were occasionally tricky but usually made sense after a few minutes of thinking about it. And I enjoyed the story and the various methods they used to narrate it. If you don't mind the price or can wait to get it on sale, it's worth a try.			"

												I really like the developer and him making this game delving into a real topic in Nordic history. The game did have a few jump scares, although for the most part I did not find the game to have a scary atmosphere, until after playing the game the second time through to get the final ending. I liked the story and found my self interested in it, more so in the second walk. I do think the mechanics weren't very good. The puzzle with the  box was clever and inventive. But the rest of the puzzles sucked. They were usually super ambiguous, and many people needed to use walkthroughs and help such as myself because you were supposed to write down all these different symbols in random places, and if you missed one you couldn't solve it. You didn't know when to use what, and one even made you use a keyboard to solve which hadnt been implemented before the entire game. Also I didn't like navigating, as it felt kind of sloppy with all of the linear paths you had to find. The game had no direction either, and you never knew which one of the 15 spots to go to next. If I hadn't used a walkthrough I would have wandered around a lot, as the game wants you to, but I find that dumb and artificially inflating the game. Some people love how ""existential"" the game is and how smart that makes them feel, but I just thought there could have been more direction. Overall it was poor gameplay, with an interesting twist with the second playthrough, and a story that picks up. Better, more interesting gameplay with direction and puzzles that make sense, and this game would have been a recommend. 5.5/10.			"

												If you're into art, horror, and mythology, this is the game for you. The puzzles in the short (but effective) game are at a perfect difficulty level for someone who may not be too experienced with solving them. There are also many secrets under the surface of the game, waiting to be cracked into. Overall, Year Walk is equally a game as it is an artform, and I highly recommend it.			"

												This was more of an experience than I thought it would be. Year Walk definitely doesn't hold hands. You're dropped right in with no instructions and are left to figure it out. The game plays out like assembling a story through puzzles. I would suggest having a pen and paper for notes. My friend and I beat it in 2 hours. One of the achievements suggests it's doable in 20 mins. Very interesting Scandanavian Folklore, great presentation, eerie and sometimes frightening. I give it a ""thumbs up"".			"

												Nice little game we have here. It may be quite short (maybe around 60 mins for the 1st playthrough), but for the price you pay you'll get great visuals, enjoyable puzzles (not too many), an interesting story and a haunting atmosphere. Definitely grab it while it's on sale.			"

Excellent writing, and fascinating presentation of myth, combined with a very unique and engaging graphic design create one of the best offerings in the horror genre I've experienced in a long time. The designers did an fantastic job in the writing, sound and graphic design, and execution of the game. The steam achievements are an excellent addition and reward additional exploration.

												I'll admit it: I'm downright terrible at puzzle games. I have never once gotten through one without extensive help from walkthroughs. Then why do I love them so much? I realized the answer after finishing Year Walk. I adore the stories. I delight in the synergy of art and music and immersion. And this game delivers.Year Walk is a haunting trip through Swedish folklore. At times it is peaceful, if lonely, as you wander across the snow. At other times it is incredibly unsettling, such as when you must carry squirming bundles through the woods or the few jump scares. The reigning atmosphere of the game is one of uncertainty, unease, and foreboding; It is a fitting tone for a foolhardy quest to break Nature's laws and peer into the future.The controls are simple enough. There are no save or load buttons, as this will automatically be done while leaving or entering the game. A pen and some paper will help with some of the puzzles, as will reading the included information about the various spirits. The hint feature was wonderfully done (there was only one clue that failed to enlighten me), which I am ever so grateful for.Your journey will be a fairly brief one, but the experience will linger long afterwards. I always sit in a stupor through the credits after a good movie, still caught by world I've just witnessed. After your Year Walk, you just might feel the same.			"

The puzzles aren't too bad, though the developers provide hints, which was nice in a few cases. Definitely jumped a few times, but I loved the art, feel and gameplay. you can definitely tell it was made for tablet/mobile though, based on the amount of ""touch and drag"" mechanics.

												A short puzzle/adventure game based on Scandinavian folklore and the dangerous act of year walking - wandering out into the woods at midnight in an attempt to interpret your future. Before you even play, take a look at the in-game encyclopedia to read up on what creatures you'll be encountering. The puzzles aren't incredibly difficult, but I would recommend having a piece of paper handy. If you do manage to get stuck, the game has a built in hint feature that should help out. The game is a bit spooky, but not anything that would really bother anyone.The game itself is pretty good. Be sure to read the journal once you've unlocked it at the end. Doing so adds to the lore and lets you reach the actual ending.			"

The ending is satisfying, and quite creepy. This games driving point is the swedish folklore, and how well it integrates the mythology within the game. The game is a bit short, but for $1 from a humble bundle, it was worth the experience. Heck I would pay $5 dollars for this game,  because overall I had a fun time playing it, and I learned a little bit about another culture!			"

 Never going to attempt to Year Walk in real life... I got this game as a gift, yet  I have to say it's worth every damn penny..!Usually I'm the type of guy, that stays far, far away from everything belonging to the ""horror"" genre.Heck, even ""Alan Wake"" scared the sh*t out of me..(Dat Atmosphere, bruh).Year Walk?! That's another story, a great one to be exact. Suspenseful, hella scary at times and yet it leaves you longing for more. You just have to find out how the story goes. I caught myself writing notes, covering my eyes, cursing, growing an extra pair of balls and loving this game..Swedish folklore combined with beautiful and fitting graphics, wonderfully eerie music and just the right amount of horror and puzzles.To wrap things up: Get this masterpiece!!    ""31/12""  - would buy/play/recommend again			"

But, my oh my, even though it felt at times my heart was going to burst through my chest (thanks to the awesomely haunting sound effects and music!) I couldn't stop playing. This game is fascinating! Early on I caught on that I should be writing down the cryptic signs sprinkled across the landscape to help me progress and that enriched my gameplay experience even further. I felt totally engrossed scribbling in my notebook like a mad man. When you finish your first year walk it becomes apparent that your journey is just beginning. Everything about this game is just beautiful. I can't recommend this game enough, especially to all the scaredy cats out there, it's worth the experience!  "

												Year Walk is a game that first came out on iOS, but it caught my attention very early on. Above all else, you have to know what you're getting into, to properly enjoy it. This is not a game, in the traditional sense, but it certainly requires player input! Even more than many games, somehow.It's a very unique experience, certainly worth trying! Plus, you might learn a bit more about swedish folklore.ContextI find it very similar to Fez, in a way. Year Walk is a riddle in and of itself. Its challenges rely on concepts more than anything the game directly teaches you, but all the clues are present for you to succeed. Also, it was clearly designed for multiple playthroughs (at least 2.5 - 3), and it was brilliantly made, with that in mind.I'm a sucker for mythology and folklore in general, so I had been interested in this game for a while. If you're trying it just ""because"", you might be lost for a while, and find it frustrating.Going back to the Fez point: Fez was much harder and more cryptic, because its clues were very spread apart.

Then, in a puzzle, they have you use ""u"" and ""n""! It was the hardest puzzle for me, haha! It clearly said ""u"" and ""n"" on the screen, but it felt so out of place that it took me a while to try it.

These two aspects have been in my mind for a while, on how to make creepy music... So there you go. Of course, I found it great! But honestly, I think it works, and gives it a very natural feeling. Good job!There's a problem, though:No sound on the menusWhenever you open the map, or the encyclopedia, the music stops. That... is a problem, and a big one, in my opinion.In a game that relies so much on atmosphere, a continuous flow of sound is critical. If you need to open the map (which should often happen, especially during your first playthrough -- a the one that relies the most on atmosphere!), the music stops, and it completely breaks immersion. I seem to mention this in a lot of games, recently, but it's really important! Having the music cut-out when you have to do something as simple as opening a map... that's bad. Furthermore, it makes those menus seem completely out of the experience that the game was going for. I'd like to see this changed, at least in future games, but hey... it's not game-breaking, I guess.Game MechanicsTo start off, this is an adventure game. Instead of being a point n' click, however, you can walk in 2D, in several lanes set in 3D. You can go back and forth to change lane, at specific points.

These skills are mostly learned outside of the game, and makes what could be ""puzzles"", mostly unrelated to one another. This is why I say Year Walk is more of a riddle. There are clues inside the game, of course, but it never teaches you anything. It never starts easy and gets progressively harder. Not at all. Every riddle is like a self-contained puzzle, reliant on combining the clues, and skills you have acquired outside the game. Some of the puzzles are based on listening cues, some are based on softcryptography, etc. But I think it's balanced. I managed to go through my first playthrough without getting stuck  at any point, and without using Hints. But again, you need to be in the right mindset to enjoy it! These riddles are based on the mythological creatures you'll find in the game. You won't, of course, know what these creatures are, or why they're there. And that's normal. To complement the game, there's an Encyclopedia. This is merely a collection of texts, one about each creature or event you're playing. It's not a direct guide for the game, as it doesn't really help with the solving a puzzle, but it gives context to what you're doing! And may also give you some clues on where the solution may lie.I've found it very interesting, but it's still about reading outside the game! It's the same problem that Type:Rider had, the way it never taught you through gameplay, but through wikipedia-esque articles.Year Walk doesn't function this way! But it has some similar problems. Still, the creatures are stillin the game, but it would have felt much better to have some more integration of the Encyclopedia in the game. Maybe some more clues to the puzzles... I believe the Encyclopedia was a companion app for the iOS game, so that's it doesn't quite feel a part of the game, unfortunately.Symbolism in the gameI think this is the best part of the game, by far! Every encounter has some meaning. It will not be apparent at all, the first time. However, the game always gives you slight clues on what to do next. On your second playthrough, it's quite different. I don't want to spoil it, but it's about reading an Historian's ""diary"" while he was investigating the tradition of Year Walk. It's all reading (and there's a lot of it), and also taking notes to solve the last puzzle in the game. Again, it's completely detached from playing the game, but it's as interesting as it makes you feel like a detective!This diary tells the actual story of the, as if it happened a few centuries ago. While you're reading this, everything you encountered in the game starts making sense. This is the first part of the journal. The second is far more conspiracy-like and esoteric, but due to the very believable first part, you start questioning everything that's happened in the game, up to that point! It was one of the most compelling experiences I've recently had in a game! Every symbol is explained in the game! Not initially, but it is. And that's the way to do it! You won't leave it feeling like it was just pretentious gibberish. It's genuinely interesting, and the questions extend the game itself!Already out of words...

												Year Walk is a game that first came out on iOS, but it caught my attention very early on. Above all else, you have to know what you're getting into, to properly enjoy it. This is not a game, in the traditional sense, but it certainly requires player input! Even more than many games, somehow.It's a very unique experience, certainly worth trying! Plus, you might learn a bit more about swedish folklore.ContextI find it very similar to Fez, in a way. Year Walk is a riddle in and of itself. Its challenges rely on concepts more than anything the game directly teaches you, but all the clues are present for you to succeed. Also, it was clearly designed for multiple playthroughs (at least 2.5 - 3), and it was brilliantly made, with that in mind.I'm a sucker for mythology and folklore in general, so I had been interested in this game for a while. If you're trying it just ""because"", you might be lost for a while, and find it frustrating.Going back to the Fez point: Fez was much harder and more cryptic, because its clues were very spread apart. There were lots of different areas, and it also relied on many skills completely unrelated to the game.Year Walk is not like that. While the game is mostly a riddle, you can get everything you need inside the game. I'd advise either taking notes, or screenshots and being very aware of your in-game surroundings, otherwise you'll probably be walking in circles.PresentationThe game is certainly fairly minimalist in its design, but I think it knew exactly what it needed to be.

												This game is highly atmospheric, sometimes even horrifying.Delves into old Swedish mythology, most of which I was familiar with already. Some I wasn't, and it was very interesting reading the encyclopedia that comes with the game, while it added to the haunting feeling of something being eerily wrong. Especially if you read the journal after finishing the game.It's a short game, but excellent.Play it late at night with headphones for the best experience.			"

												as it is new year's eve, now is a most appropriate time to write a review on year walk...year walk is a strange tale, set in northern scandinavia on new year's eve.  it blends fragments off folk-lore with a little bit of horror, some surrealism and detective work.  your role in the story is not clear at first, but you soon find yourself unravelling a curious mystery.  the basic interface is point-and-click, with puzzles to be solved.  although this sounds simple enough, the reason why this game is a gem is because of the atmosphere.  the art-style, movement and sounds all combine to give this game an amazing feel.  although only drawn, and with only a few scares, the style and items you uncover will give you the most creepy feeling.  it is cleverly done and from me it is highly recommended.but the time is getting on and i must go.  at the stroke off midnight i will venture out into the night through the dark woods where strange creatures roam.  i will make my year walk to see if i will be wealthy, to see if i will be happy, to see if i will live, to see if i will be loved...

												This game is beautiful and genuinely disconcerting. Fair as far as puzzling goes: subtle but simple, and everything makes sense if you investigate enough. And you will want to investigate, because the lore, art, and music involved are wonderful and otherworldly. I am impressed by the way the in-game encyclopedia & journal were integrated into the gameplay and story (I understand that the mobile version had those included in a companion app, which seems like an interesting way to experience this as well). The nature of the true narrative surprised and intrigued me, and I can see myself thinking about this for a long time to come. I would really recommend this to anyone who can appreciate a well-crafted atmosphere in a game, whether you like puzzles or not.			"

												A very unqiue game.

While sure there are some ""creepy"" moments within the game. Honestly you will completely forget about that because you will be staring at the beautiful artistic visuals for the entire game. The controls are simple, and easy to understand. Lastly, the dialouge is also unqiue, while sounding so simple you have to really understand the context behind the dialouge if you don't you will get lost within the ""story"".I would recommend this game, if you want a different spin within story telling, and also if you love artistic work in games such as these.

												An odd game, or rather mini-story, that I would recommend, but DO NOT pay the full price. Here is a time where I wish Steam would have an ""OK"" recommendation instead of Yes or No.Length-wise, Year Walk is rather disappointing. I do not understand that some people can take hours with it. Just by wandering around helplessly, and using only 2 hints, I ended up finishing in around 30 minutes, and that's with seeing everything that you can see except for the alternate ending. Immediately afterwards, I got into the journal, and I racked up my game time from sitting there at different pages--because I saw how many entries there were, I started cooking myself dinner while going back and forth to the journal. In reality, you can probably read and fully engross yourself in the journal within about 20 minutes, and I picked up on what I was supposed to do and got the alternate ending immediately. After that, there is no replayability to the game at all.Now, when I first started the game, I sat down and read the Encyclopedia without going anywhere, and I was greatly interested in the folklore as it was described there. Afterwards, I ran through the whole game in one sitting. To be honest, nothing special seemed to be happening the whole game other than ""Hey, look, you're encountering everything you just read about!"" But besides solving a puzzle or two for each being, nothing really happened. Then you get to the end of the game and you're like ""What just happened?""By going through the alternate ending, you understand what happened. And as some people seem to argue that the ending means that the story can change, I argue on the other end. The alternate ending implies that everything is completely fixed and has no leeway.What I liked about the game, essentially, boils down to the Encyclopedia, the Journal, and the alternate ending. I was rather okay with the first ending being this weird ambiguous mess, but to be honest, I didn't really like much of your first playthrough. You're given all of the beings you just read about... but it just felt somewhat cheesy and slopped together. The atmosphere overall was alright though, but I never once got a scared feeling from the game (even with my headphones and the dark).I didn't pay full price for the game, and I am rather glad. Altogether, it is an interesting idea, but it is not much of your time. I understand everything in the game, but it's not going to engulf me and fill my mind forever like some people are posting on the forums. Rather, it's just a one-shot story that, while I did enjoy the story, could have used more development in the actual experience of the Year Walk itself.			"

												Now this....THIS is a game. Year Walk harkens back to the days of HTML/flash games that were exclusivly in browser, like the Bionicle one that used to be on the LEGO website. While starkly simple, YW capitvates its player with a completley unique sountrack and quite obscure historical and mythical items. I can't possibly explain the story line, but the premise is that you, in your crazy swede mindset, decided to follow the traditional avenue of the ""Year Walk""; a ceremony of sorts where the person in question isolates themself for a whole day in a dark house without food, water or exposure to anything whatsoever, then ventures into the remote woods at nightfall to encounter beasts, magic and possibly see the future.Before you ask, yes, this was a real thing that people did. I'm proud to be swedish, but good grief are my people wierd.Anyway, I would recommend this for PC, not for a phone though - I can forsee some dificulties trying to navigate if you would have to use your fingers instead of a mouse.

												It's a very short and simple puzzle game more suitable for free Flash games market. The folklore of 18 century Sweden is quite unfamiliar and so interesting. But there is very small amount of this foklore. The game is worth the time you spend on it, but I won't recommend spending any money on it. If you are so inclined, $1 is more than this game is worth.			"

												Year Walk is a game with an extremely unique presentation. So much so that I am unsure whether I consider it to be a traditional adventure game, a walking sim, or its own tiny subgenre. If it is a walking sim, it is one of the best I've played.The plot is simple, or at least straightforward. You want to see the future, so you perform an ancient Swedish folklore ritual that lets you see the future, called the Year Walk. During this time you will walk around the forest surrounding your cabin, helping the various spirits that live there. Once you have helped them all, they let you see the Church Grimm, who shows you the future. The climax of the game is abstract, maybe unfittingly so, but at the end it shows you that your friend will get injured and might also die. Incidentally, this friend is the one that told you not to perform the Year Walk. I suppose that we are supposed to learn a lesson about not messing with powers beyond your understanding, but I had so much fun that I would be tempted to year walk anyway. The most immediately apparent aspect of Year Walk is its art direction, particularly its color palette. This game contains many horror elements, and it can easily be classified as a horror game. Despite that, the color palette is quite bright, with a strong emphasis on cyan and white. It's also very desaturated, creating an atmosphere that is usually serene and peaceful, but can instantly change to be scary and desolate. The characters have similarly stylized designs. They are awe-inspiring and spooky, but also approachable, even cute (except the Huldra). The Brook Horse and Church Grimm are the standout designs, and I think the designer knew this, as the Church Grimm's icons are used frequently throughout the game. In fact, the game is icon-heavy in general, with each creature having a distinct symbol, almost like a hieroglyph.I only have three complaints, so I will just list them. First, the navigation of Year Walk is unusual; it's from a first person perspective, but movement is restricted to 2d planes. The player scuttles from side to side like a crab, and can only walk forward and backward onto new planes in certain spaces. This is fine, even fun, but on certain screens I could get a headache if I walked too fast from side to side. I don't consider this to be the game's fault necessarily, but if a game causes me physical distress I want to note it. My other two complaints have to do with two specific puzzles. Most of the puzzles are actually very good, and the hint system is one of the best I've ever seen, but there are only two notable exceptions. The first puzzle is when the player is trying to open a furnace. The furnace door is locked, and the only way to open it is to press the corresponding keys on the keyboard to what is engraved on the locks. This might sound obvious in retrospect, but since those keys are not used before or since, it bothers me that the solution is so strange. The last problem I had was with the Huldra's maze: it is a puzzle where the player is expected to listen to aural queues, and the background music of the section is about as loud as the queues.I don't really have much more to say about Year Walk. The art design is great, the mechanics are finally crafted, and the story is unique and educational. Even the achievements are meaningful. Anyone who is a fan of atmospheric horror, mythology, or adventure games in general should absolutely check it out.			"

												This is, yet again, another game that I could talk for about an hour about; not because of how amazing it is, but because of the strange circumstance I find myself in. I enjoyed this game, more or less. I cannot, however, recommend this game. Year Walk is short. Very short. You may think you know what I mean by that, but you dont. No game Ive ever played has been this short. Should the puzzles prove intuitive to you (hint: they wont) you could theoretically beat this game in about ten minutes. 'But wait!' you say ' the same could be said of Myst, and that game is amazing'.  The difference in this case is that Year Walk just isnt that good. It is, in essence, a primer on the concept of a Year Walk (the scandanavian tradition of, as far as I can tell, fasting yourself delusional then wandering around until you can see the future) and the sorts of critters and monster's you're likely to encounter on such a journey.  In basic point of fact, Year Walk is a bad puzzle game, with most of its puzzles revolving around draging things around the environment in ways you wouldnt normally assume possible. That, combined with the jump-scare horror and the fairly short runtime, makes this game fall short of a recommendation.HOWEVER. If you have a massive boner for any sort of mythology, and want to spend 20 minutes reading the game's codex, then a walkthough for the game, its not half bad. The real sticker is the price; there are much better things to be had both real and virtual for $5.  "

												Like the Jaws of video games, dare you go into the winter woodland after playing this ? This thing can realy get under your skin, however i felt the jump scares cheapened it alot.Very pretty, fragile and minimalist in design.Its full of twisted, Swedish occult folklore that quite frankly doesn't do the country justice :P, This might make some people (ie: Christians ) VERY uncomfortable but thats a compliment to how convincing all this is.Didn't take long to do the base game (with a couple of hints at that damn kiln) but its Very inspiring.

Can be done in less than 20 minutes, but my first run took about an hour         - Story is a bit confusing         - A pen and paper are needed to write things downOverall: A great game for a great price. Make sure you have sound capability since it is needed to beat the game. Also keep a pen and paper. The art style and soundtrack are enough of a reason to buy this. The experience will leave you wanting more.			"

												Atmospheric and eerie, Year Walk will leave you wanting more of a very unique artstyle and intriguing story. A short game but with extremely well done audio effects and transitional 2-d to 3-d effects. The puzzles are not so confusing that you will leave the game but hard enough to exercise your mind. The few ""characters"" you encounter are developed well even without word and the game offers an encyclopedia for those who wish to look further into the games scandinavian background. The suspense is built in the most unexpected places making the suprises more suprising and possibly making you look twice when walking alone in the dark. Although straight-forward the game still gives you a sense of freedom with a small open world map. The replay value for me is high at least for one or two play throughs to see if the story can be altered or things can be done differently. This game is not an action game but does have a heavy atmospheric suspense-horror feel. Good for casual gamers who want maybe a small challenge with some puzzle. Very Artistic.			"

												Year Walk is a very intriguing game. If you like horror and puzzles, you just found what you're looking for!The puzzles aren't very hard, and the in-game hints window makes sure that you never have to be stuck at one point for an extended amount of time. The music and audio greatly enchance the game's eerie atmosphere, including a few excellent jumpscares. Even after playing and re-playing the game multiple times, those jumpscares do not get dull.It's a rather short game, but there's more to it than it seems at first, like the journal that you can only access after solving the puzzle that you get after the credits of the first playthrough.All in all a great fun little horror puzzle game. 8/10 because in my opinion it could have been a little longer.

												When Year Walk made it's first debut on the app store, I was both fustrated and engrossed in the world that developer Simogo had created. It has atmosphere and style that set it apart making it one of the best horror/puzzle games on the market. In many ways, Year Walk is like an adventure game with some truly unique puzzle designs put in to help lengthen the adventure. On more than one occassion did I get jumps at the horrors Year Walk threw at me, making me feel tense and disturbed while never wanting to stop. The only downside is that the puzzles can be so frustrating at times that it could lead to others quitting early on, but if you do know the puzzles, Year Walk suddenly becomes a 20 minute game rather than 2 hour game. But that shouldn't discourage all people from playing it, just have a walkthrough ready when you get stuck and don't be surprised when it ends quickly.			"

I doubt that you'll be able to put this down without beating it once you start it. It is one of the most complete and satisfying games I've played especially considering how brief it is.There are no negatives I can really think of. The game is great. If you think you might like this game you will. It will be better than you thought.A warning: This game is pretty dark.

But the fact is, I had watched all over the internet how to pass some quests. It quite tricky for us ( which doesn't like puzzle games ). Whom like to play puzzle game, honestly, this game would be an ' extraordinary ' and whom doesn't like or hate puzzle game, this game is not the type for the person. Overall, six out of ten. Oh, by the way, for those who had pass the Papa Horse quest, can you guys share with me, I can't open the storage in the cottage which a blood gas or something came out from the rooftop, it really helps me out a lot. Thank you.			"

												This is a game you should play for the creepy athmosphere, the audio and storyline. This actually quite overwhelmed me since I expected just a pretty click & play. It's a puzzle game so some like it, some don't since you can get a bit frustrated when you can't solve it quickly. I loved the double ending and reading the journal. I play this game everytime my friends come over just to show them the awesomeness. It is not for everyone tho and once you finished the two ending... well there is just no replay value unless you wanna show it to friends.  The solutions to the puzzles aren't randomly generated so once you've played it you can pretty much write the answers down and finish it quickly the second time. Which has its pros and cons. Big con for me; No collectable cards, hence no badge to craft :'( (I'm addicted to collecting cards)			"

												Year Walk is a horror puzzle game.  Yes it's an adventure too.  Some of the tasks you'll have to do is find keys, look for something hidden in the world, click things in a certain order...you know, typical puzzle stuff.  The game is in first-person but isn't like your typical first-person game.  It's best to watch videos about this game to know what I mean.  The controls are very simple and you just click items to interact with them.  The horror part of this game is mostly environmental.  It has an eerie feel to it and there's occasional jump scares.  I admit it's easy to get confused about the task at hand but you can always use the hints and map to get you in the right direction.  The artwork to this game is unique and adds to the feel of the game.  To me, between the music and artwork it feels like you're in a dream/nightmare.  If you like horror games you should give it a try.  This game isn't super scary but worth playing.			"

												It's been a long time since I've played a point-and-click game as enchanting as Year Walk.It starts you out with very little direction, and you only start piecing together your objectives as you wander around the eerie winter setting. There's an encyclopedia in-game that you can reference as well (And adds a bit of structure to your journey), and the lore it contains is a bizarre guide to the mythology of ""year walking.""Now, the trap that most point-and-click games fall into is breaking their own logic for the sake of difficult puzzles. This results in bizarre, non-intuitive puzzles that takes, at best, some serious imagination to find solutions to, and at worst, brute-forcing. Year Walk does not do this. It stays very grounded in the world it builds, and everything can be deduced through environmental exploration and logical deduction, giving the player satisfaction with each puzzle solved.Now, it is a short game, but it's far more memorable than most games I've played. Check it out.			"

												This would be the first negative review I've given a game. Year walk is more story than game, with intentionally difficult to navigate environments and cryptic illogical puzzles. The music, art style and the jump scares are delightful, but the actual playing of the game is just an excercise in tedium.  Once I found out that this was a phone game, the poor interface made a bit more sense. For a person with hundreds of games in his library, I regret purchasing this one.			"

Hard puzzles that doesn't make sense, tips that doesn't help you within the game and finally the story is not that great... Mix old folk pagan tales with an emotional background and you have the story of the game, yes it seems great but IN the game it DOESN'T. There is no explanation what so ever for some mysteries and to finally add that it is waaay to short.			"

The  art is amazing, but once you've tread the same ground a bunch of times the charm wears off.  I found two of the puzzles to be satisfying to solve, that but was about it.  As for the plot and the mythology, I'll just say that the game is not cohesive and leave it at that.  I enjoyed the first hour or so of the game.  After I got to the end, I was pretty soured on the whole thing.			"

It should be logical.In this game, only the developers' mind know what to do next.The mere fact that there is an integrated hint system is proof that they are aware that their game has no meaning by itself.

I know this games gets tons of praise, and I will be flamed for 'not getting it'. I finished the game - no I did not restart, which is apparently where most people say the 'real game begins'. I just don't have the motivation to continue after all the weird puzzles and really abstract messages. For those unaware - this is essentially a  point-and-click adventure with dark, abstract overtones. You meddle around the woods and solve riddles/puzzles. If you are thinking about purchasing this, I would consider getting it on your mobile device instead because it would be easier to play laying in bed or really wherever you want since there is no advantage of having it on your computer.Pros:+Wonderful artwork and ambience+It certainly gets points for being uniqueCons:-Puzzles are way too abstract in how you solve them - I think I even looked some of them up in the later game. But, ya know its funny, because I picked up Device 6 on my iPhone which I believe is made by the same team, and the puzzles were equally silly in their solutions (I quit playing it), so maybe their games are appreciated by a select audience that I am not apart of-I kept waiting for some enlightning moment of having some concrete understanding of the storyline, even right up until the credits, but nope - I still pretty much have no idea of what was going on-Overall, I found this game to be more frustrating than it was worth, it was a struggle to just finish itI wouldn't even recommend this on a sale.

There seem to be a lot of games in this genre, which I can only really describe as artistic adventure, that don't have enough narrative in them to really grab you and make you want to take the ride.As for me, I either want a game that launches me into a story with a reason to care about the fate of the PC, thus giving me a reason to do more stuff, or an immersive enough experience that I can become the PC and am motivated to go off and explore. For me, this game had neither - I didn't feel as if I had any agency, and didn't care if the story was advanced at all.Maybe it'll be your thing, but I was lost in the woods.			"

												The look and tone of Year Walk are simply outstanding. The story is also well-written and fascinating. The only major gripe I have is the translation of the controls from touch screens to mouse and keyboard. Some actions are not very intuitive using the mouse and keyboard setup. Dragging, spinning, pulling objects feels strange and doesn't work like you would expect them to. It would be very intuitive on a touch screen though and that's where the game was orginally released. If you can get over the control hurdles, Year Walk is a very strange and dark adventure.			"

												""The woods are lovely, dark, and deep..."" A fitting description for Year Walk - a delightfully dark folk tale adventure game based on Norse mythology, which looks and feels like a disturbing bedtime story for children. The art style is endearingly creepy and original, and creates a very engrossing atmosphere for the story that is deceptively simple but has a lot of depth for those who pay attention. Those who do not, will almost certainly not like this game. Year Walk does no hand holding and requires pen and paper to keep track of clues and puzzle pieces. It is a practice that is all but lost in modern gaming, and will undoubtedly turn off some gamers. For those who pay attention, however, the puzzles should not cause any trouble to solve; they ""make sense"" and are universally straightforward throughout. Like most children's books, Year Walk is very short and can easily be completed in under 2-3 hours for a first comprehensive walkthrough, with each consecutive run taking no more than 20 minutes (take a look at the achievements if you do not believe me). I wholeheartedly recommend you pick up this gem - it is a folk tale worth playing.			"

You'll better appreciate it.One might be tempted to use the Hint system or a walkthrough; don't. I know, it could be a chore to keep wandering aimlessly until you figure something out.  Don't use the Hint system or a walkthrough.   Any time you see anything noteworthy... make a note of it. You know. With pen and pad.   You might do well to even make your own map (do not use the in-game map, as that renders the game strictly linear, as opposed to leaving yourself totally ignorant, therefore immersed)  or a log of directions and locations (...so ""map"").  Do not use the Hint system or a walkthrough. The Hint system and walkthroughs; do not even consider their existence. While you're at it, don't play this game...EXPERIENCE THIS INTERACTIVE ART.			"

												Year Walk's art style is great, and is the main reason to play it. If all you're looking for is a short game with some creepy visuals, then by all means, play Year Walk. However, don't expect any more than exactly that.The story is extremely predictable, what little of it there is, and retreads ground that's been stomped to death by other dime a dozen indie horror games. Apart from a few exceptions, the puzzles are patronizingly simplistic and uninspired at best, and needlessly tedious at worst. That tediousness mostly stems from the way the world is constructed, making it difficult to remember where to find anything that isn't a major landmark. I understand that the authors wanted to evoke a ""lost in the woods"" feeling, but moving between screens very quickly became dull rather than creepy.I don't recommend this game unless you don't mind a surface level, derivative experience.

												It was pretty trash. It looked nice, and the programmer knew what he was doing, but most of the puzzles were easy and mainly required you look arround the map for most of the time trying to see if there have been any changes, and recording all the symbols you see on paper. After you do that you practically solved all the puzzles and you win. TLDR; its a game about exploring, and you need to record symbols on paper.			"

												Year Walk isn't really all that much a game but more of an interactive story. A story that you cannot alter no matter what you do. You only move around on the map, do a few puzzles, and the story progresses. The sad thing about the puzzles are that it is impossible to solve them without looking at the hints and still it's extremely difficult. Chances are you'll be utilizing an online walkthrough to guide you through a story that you have no control over. It also has ZERO replayability as it's only appeal is the unfolding of the story. Like a book, once you've read it, you're done with it.The only pluses that Year Walk has are that it's relatively cheap and that the story is interesting. If you like a good mystery story with psychologically creepy imagery then this is for you. If you're looking for a puzzle game solely because you want to solve puzzles then you'll be disappointed.I'm recommending this title but barely. Had it been a few dollars more I would have said no.

												Awful from start to finish, but thankfully can be finished in about 45 minutes with liberal use of the ""hints"" system. Can Steam please add warnings on games that were designed to run on your Blackberry Palm Pilot?My previously worst rated puzzle game was Lume, but by contrast Lume was a charming and visually interesting extravaganza compared to this dretch. Puzzles with no reason, matching up arbitrary symbols with other abitrary symbols which you encounter scrawled on walls or trees in the forest (Perhaps you remembered to write down). That is the extent it -- it's the equivalent of ""Hidden object"" puzzle gameplay. The last quarter of the game is touch based swiping puzzles. Whee, I rotated a floating crystal so fast that it, um, splintered apart and turned into a goat head. Why did I do this? Why did this happen? Because it was the only way to proceed. No other reason is given, and the story isn't interesting enough to analyze it further. Not fun or original on a mobile device, and even less fun on a desktop. Stop making crap like this.			"

I turned the game off to come back to it later (after being reassured that the game would save my progress), only to restart the game back in winter time.

												I bought this game because I like solving mysteries, point-and-click games, and eerie/odd things. I like fairy tales, folklore, fables and ghost stories. I thought I would really like this game based on the video and description. In truth, I love the art style and music of this game. The map is cool and not hard to figure out. For starters, it's kind of annoying not knowing what to do without using the clues. I play a lot of puzzle games, but I very rarely use hints or clues. I had to use them every time with this game. I would have liked this game despite this aspect though.I feel like this game was misrepresented in the description and video/screenshots. The first 5 minutes were okay. I just wandered around, figured out the map, viewed the encyclopedia. Most people have said that there are just a few times that things jump out at you or are horrifying. So far almost everything after that first 5 minutes happening in the game is VERY scary/horror to me... not just eerie/creepy. It isn't just a few times. All I've seen/heard are  screaming, scary images, bloody scenery, and dead babies.  There should be more emphasis on the horror aspect in the video and description.Unfortunatly, I just can't finish this game. It's too scary, graphic, and bloody. As a warning, don't play this game if you are  pregnant or planning to have kids any time soon.  "

												This game is... odd. On the most basic level it's a puzzle game, but not a very challenging one, nor a very long one.So why am I recommending this game? Well, first off it is beautiful, especially in terms of music and sound design. It's also incredibly haunting, far more so than you'd expect a game originally made for smart phones/tablets; the ending (the true ending that is) sent shivers down my spine, and reminded me a little of ""House of Leaves"" by Mark Z. Danielewski.Makers of games such as this deserve your support.			"

												Year Walk is puzzle-horror game that leaves you with your imagination charged by its brilliant puzzles, surreal artwork and music, and supernatural story. If you're a fan of folklore/history, engrossing atmospheres, or bite-sized games well worth their money, buy Year Walk now!The game has you adventuring through a solemn forest on New Year's Eve to attempt an archaic Swedish ritual known as year walking, which allows a person to see into the future of the next year. Year Walk astounded me by how much care it gave to the Swedish folklore. An in-game Encyclopedia allows you to read the details about each creature you'll encounter in the forest. The games developer, Simogo, does a brilliant job of translating these stories into memorable gameplay and artwork. The soundtrack is equally chilling yet captivating, and provides the perfect backdrop to many of the game's distinct moments.I only have two, measly warnings about Year Walk. First, of all, it’s very short. My first playthrough on iOS took less than 3 hours; this is the longest it should take anyone. I still found the experience incredibly satisfying, enough so that I bought the version here on Steam as well. Secondly, I enjoyed how the Encyclopedia and Journal were in a separate app on the iOS version (I won't say why for spoilers), so I wish the Steam version forced players to view them in a similar form as well.Overall, Year Walk is worthy game for any horror or puzzle fan, and one of my favorite games from 2013. I recommend playing it without using the map, hints, or walkthroughs - besides you'll get a couple achievements that way :)			"

												An incredible and beautiful experience. Rather short, but I got it on sale so I don't mind. The artstyle is gorgeous and the story is compelling. Traversing the forest is creepy without being terrifying and there's only one jump scare that I can remember. Very good, interesting game. Wish there were more like it!			"

												I've been wanting to play this game ever since it came out on iPad, but since I didn't have an iPad I had to wait painfully for over a year. Finally it arrives on Mac, and I was not dissapointed. This is an absolutely one-of-a-kind game. I can't even think of a game that is close to it (although of course there many games I've never heard of so take that with a grain of salt). You are a 19th century Swedish Man who has just been told by the woman he loves that she is going to marry someone else. Desiring a glimpse into the future, you set out on the ancient but dying tradition of a Year Walk: at the stroke of midnight you set out from your house to reach the church, but along the way you encounter numerous mystical creatures and artifacts.The gameplay consists of puzzle and exploration elements. It is 2D, but you can move forwards or backwards at preset places on your path. The world is not very large but it's still quite easy to get lost, so thankfully the game includes a map. Every puzzle in this game is unique and enjoyable, so the game stays fresh for its three hour or so length. There was only one puzzle I disliked and couldn't beat, because it used sound and I'm completely tone deaf, but thankfully there's a built-in hint system that will guide you through any puzzles you can't solve.The art style is quite stark - flat and angular and washed out. Yet it is beautiful all the same. The creatures are grotesque or beautiful or both. The snow-covered Swedish woods are haunting and lonely, evoking a sense of foreboding and wonder at the same time. This juxtaposition is not easy to achive and I applaud the developers.The story is surprisingly deep and moving, which I did not expect. The game deals with the theme of overreaching and trying to change things that are not within our power. Once the game is over, there is in fact a larger story to discover and a true ending to the game that will stick with you for quite some time.The best part of the game is discovering and interacting with all the spirits you meet along teh way. The encyclopedia that accompanies the game gives background lore on these fantastical spirits that most have never heard of. They are all wonderfully bizzare and fascinating, although I may be a little biased as I am quite into lore and the mystical.If you want a game that completely sucks you into its unique world, then this is it. I will not forget Year Walk for quite some time.			"

												I was not expecting the types of feelings that this game has pulled from me. I walked in blankets of snow, only accompanied by my own footsteps. The artwork drew me in, and the game itself made me stay. This game makes you want to walk into the dark, to watch the sky and reflect. Later in the game the subtle music helps bring atmosphere in an otherwise lonely world. With the music and barely hearable breaths of someone that wasn't me, I couldn't help feel like I was being watched. The folklore is deeply intertwined in this story, and brings this game to life.

												ultimate creepfest. i loved it. a very simple game really, puzzles weren't obscure, controls weren't hard and a story that just surprises you. probably if I had something bad to say about this game was the unreplayability of it, once you find all the secrets, not play the game for a while then come back, it's not as fun as playing it the first time. Though, still great, with very good ambience and art, this game will definitely be a keeper			"

												This is truly a unique experience. It captures the folly of man and the horrible thing he does to try and give himself comfort. It captures the evil lurking within us all, and the secrets of life, and lays them down in woven layers to be slowly unravelled, but along with it, your life. This captures the dark nature of pagan rituals and the dire consequences of trifling with spirits.The game provides several hours of play, and is deeply captivating for it's subliminal use of imagery to remind the Year Walker what is really happening. All this imagery is deeply rooted in folklore, philosophy, and ancient religions. The soundscape is eerie, and grows more haunting as the Year Walk progresses. The world itself takes on a sinister appearance, and all the while you get the feeling of hostility. A feeling that these spirits do not approve, and they do not want to to be there.My words can not do the game justice, however. This game is truly unique, and definately worth the money if you like deep storylines that need no narrative.			"

												          At first when I saw this game I didn't know what to expect of it, I only bought it because I had some money left after purchasing Bastion and now after playing this game and getting in love with it's mythos I can say from the bottom of my heart that it's worth all of your money, if you're into puzzles, simple yet complex story, mystery and secrets. If you're into those this game is for you.           The artistic direction for this game is very well put together. The music is perfectly synched with the events in the game, not once did I ever feel that it was out of place, add to taht the imagery which simplistic and less is in fact more and complex. It adds a layer of mystique and intrigue to our wonderful cake.            Some people maight complain to the fact it is short and in a speed run, which is an achievement, you can finish it in 20 minutes or less, but of course if you've already played the game or read cheats, if not you might end up spending quite some time in it, especially if you're like me and play without the map or hints.             This game is worth it's money, it might seem short, but it does not feel short and seeing the price for it I say this is not a major inconvenience. All in all this game deserves more attention and praise for that you can see the work the people making it had put and the lasting impretion it will give you is indeed one worth playing for.                                                          P.S. Play again after finishid and read the journal <Pqtvj qh vjg oknn, uqwvj qh vjg dtqqm> "

												Just finished it and I loved this game. It may be short but you will have goose bumps the entire time. Creepy, sad, but ultimately beautiful storytelling, this is a game you should play with no distractions (lights off if you can handle it!). The art, the music, and that sound of thick snow crunching under your feet suck you into the forest so that when a scare comes you really feel it. And there is some really creepy stuff in that forest! As for gameplay the puzzles are not too hard but a pen and paper is necessary later on. Completing one opens up another somewhere else a when you first stumble across the beginings of one the eerie sense of the unknown is one of the essential feelings that you take from the game. Feeling your way through the forest negotiating mystic apparitions without really knowing your final destination (you know it's the church but you get what I mean) all lends to the games unique experience. First time discovery of the forest is where most of the games charm lies so of course replay value is reduced but this is a game that you will remember! (In actual fact I was mid way through my second playtrough when I made the biggest discovery!)This is one of those really cool games that lives up to its style. You'll have images from this game in your head forever and the story wont fade fast from your mind either. Short but well worth the price for the experience in my opinion.			"

												I thought the game was good. The map navigation was unusual, but after a few minutes it proved easy to navigate. I was a little miffed at a puzzle that took liberties with the fourth wall, but I don't think that was a truely bad thing. It genuinely scared me once or twice, and the implied story was well implied.As I said, I thought the game was good, then I found the bonus material. Wow. Good work those people.			"

Well this game got me going for another 4 hours,trying to figure out all the puzzles,the journal...and the mystery box. I usually hate reading in videogames because I find a waste of time when you can be just PLAYING,but this game had such a great story that reading became enjoyable,the more you knew the more you wanted to find out about these small stories with the brook horse and the rest of them ;3 I give it a 100/100 ,it is worth the money I payed for and I will be playing it another time too, I love this game.

												Year Walk is definitedly one of the best, most thrilling, atmospheric short indie games I ever played since quite a long time. The graphics and soundtrack are really amazing and fascinating through a stunning kind of minimalism which holds a very gloomy charm on itself. Some of the riddles are quite tricky but you'll always find some useful hints in the menue to help you through. The story builds up slowly as you play,  explore and walk through a silent, odd winter landscape, leading you  to a most unexpected creepy discovery in the very end.  It ain't look great on first sight but you might change your mind when reaching and finding out the ""true"" story end of this Year Walk.I've always been fascinated by Northern cultures and their dark and strange fairytales so I was very happy to finally get a chance to dive into this hunting, confusing part of an old Swedish folklore custom. Well done!			"

												Wow. I dont usually review games, but this one was phenomenal. The lore, the dark storyline.... and a game that is actually worth playing a second time? (alternate ending, people!) Not difficult to get the hang of, simple controls and navi, no real inventory to deal with. Simple, clean and beautiful. Relatively quick, easy to pick up and go when you have a little time to kill. Stunningly appropriate graphics- its like being in a dark fairytale. Nothing too detailed, not going to bog down your graphics card at all- but still so gorgeously perfect for the story. A couple minor jumpscares (which I hate) but were fitting and not cheaply placed for the sheer purpose of making you crap yourself. I only actually jumped 2x... but Im extremely high strung and should really never play scary games because im a huge baby. PLAY ITTTT!!			"

												A very short game, very tightly packed with eery. Not exactly a horror, it leaves you rather sad than terrified. A walk through a forest, a journey through the brutal world of pagan mythology — not the one with epic gods' battles, but grassroots mythology with those things lurking in forests, wisps over marshes dead babies left in the woods. Some puzzles are easy, but some would require you to think outside the box. Overall, a creepy experience to remember.			"

												When I first watched a trailer for Year Walk, I instantly fell in love with the music and art style. Then I found that old folklore was thrown into the mix, and was instantly sold. I didn't know whether or not the game would come through in the end, but I hoped that it would.And it did.You're a simple man who wants to know that which many of us wish we could foretell: ""Will they always love me?""If given the chance to see into the future over this matter, myself, I would have done the same thing.The path is riddled with creatures that desire to impede you, and sating their desires requires some thinking and wandering.There was never a moment that the art direction and soundtrack did not bring everything together perfectly, and as such I was completely taken into immersion.This is definitely a horror game, and while I usually can't handle playing this genre being the scaredy cat I am, I managed to finish this. If that shows any indication as to whether or not you should pick it up if you're easily frightened, the answer is yes.It's a bit on the short side of things, but that works just fine as you need multiple playthroughs in order to reach the true ending.The story is much deeper than it originally presents itself to be, and I was left speechless at several points.Year Walk took my expectations and delivered higher than I even anticipated. I'm in a difficult time in my life right now, and can put myself inside of the protagonist's shoes perfectly. Just reverse the sexes and there you go. This game gives you a lot to contemplate about your own life and what exactly you are willing to give up for a glimpse of what is to come.I no longer yearn to see the future, as enticing as the notion seems to be. At what point do we play into fate's hands or carve our own path? That decision is yours, just like the decision to play this game.I can't help you figure out the prior, but the latter is definitely pointing towards trying it out for yourself.			"

												I am pretty big when it comes to anything Scandinavian and folklore related. This game captures both. It also has it's jump scare moments and is a fantastic puzzle game. For the price, you can't pass up this gem of a game. After you play the game in it's entirety, which includes playing it a second time, you will see the big picture. 10/10, fantastic purchase.			"

												Creepy as heck. Turn the lights off, volume up, and play this alone in a dark room on a large screen. I honestly spent more time researching Scandanavian folklore than the time I spent completing this game, which to me is a very, very good thing. This is coming from a guy who spent a good portion of his childhood sifting through every Time-Life Enchanted World Series books. For what it is, it's absolutely engaging and they managed to pull this off very nicely. I actually had no idea that this was initially a iOS game. Directly from the developers website:""At Simogo we don’t make games in a specific genre. In fact, we’re not overly concerned about whether or not they are even games!

The story, and slowly unravelling of the mystery and main character's psyche.... amazing. If you have any love for horror stories, mythology, or mystery, play this strange little adventure.I will warn anyone sensitive to such things that there are a couple of jump scares, but they are not too bad.

												This game was really surprising to me in a good way. Easy to get through in a short amount of time, but the time spent playing it is really magical.The story is pretty simple and gets a bit more detailed and complex the closer you are to completing it. It's creepy in its own way, has clever little puzzles, a unique aesthetic and fitting music. I sat down with a cup of cocoa and enjoyed playing through this game for 1-2 hours. Really relaxing and fun. If you like folklore, horror/creepy stuff, storytelling and puzzles, I'd suggest this one!			"

												i bought this game in April.Saw one of the achievements : Year Walk on New Year's Eve.flash forward 8 monthsPlayed it again, unlocked several puzzles and got the Year Walk achievement as well.I am so glad that I didn't write a review as soon as the first Year Walk, because I believe that the real game is actually in the second time you Year Walk. So please, Year Walk a second time and you'll appreciate this game a lot more.The plot is fairly straightforward when you play it the first time, then when you re-play it (if you want) it will get rather confusing especially  when you opt to open the journal and get the knife with the initials of D.S  . The graphic is minimalistic yet beautiful. Kind of eerie/melancholic, simple but consistent.The sounds are great and well placed. When you hear nothing but the sound of your footsteps on snow, even when  the Hudra jump-scare scene where it just screech-snapped at you after singing so beautifully .Despite the short gameplay (there's even an achievement to glorify it), I personally think it's more than satisfying. This is actually the first game where I didn't wish it to be longer.The mystery is well thought to the point where an explanation will actually ruin the whole experience, specifically  after you open the journal and open the wooden box .This is a beautiful game, the atmosphere, the music, everything is in place for a great gaming experience.Now I'm off to Year Walk some more for the achievements.

												I just finished it and I'm too flabbergasted (positively) to write a proper review. And besides, I don't want to risk spoiling it. It's an enchanting, worthwhile, paranormal experience that goes in unexpected directions. A bit spooky, but never scary. I wouldn't call it an ""adventure game"" proper (point & click) since it's so short; it's more like those artsy walking simulators but I don't mean that in a bad way. Again, it's great though not everyone will appreciate it. Learning about the ghastlier aspects of Swedish folklore was fun, too. Make sure you get the second ending as well, even if you have to use a guide (I did).			"

												First off.. AMAZING GAME!! This is now one my favorite horror point&click puzzle games.  SO, basically you are doing a Year Walk which is a spiritual journey to discover the future, either bad or good.  It shows both 3d and 2d graphics and blends them together perfectly IMO. If you are like me and get into the storyline and the mood the creators try to portray, well you are in for a treat.  I was at the edge of my seat the entire time I played.  Its horror is really cool but not the typical horror of todays hollywood movies, but that just straight up creepy horror that sends chills down your spine.  If you are looking for a game that is fun and tests you, well here it is. You can use hints that they let you click but really, only use if you are extremely stuck and have no idea what to do next.  At the end of the game it never says ""THE END"" but there is an end. So pay attention, cause unlike most games that you just get up an walk away during the credits...THIS YOU WANT TO STAY! it gives you vital info that you will need for your next playthrough and to access parts of the game that can not be accesses without that info. SO ENJOY YOUR YEAR WALK...it just might be your last..MWUAHAHAH XD			"

												Year Walk is a fantastic game, for what it is. The artwork is lovely, it's like walking through a creepy pop up book and it really sets the unsettling atmosphere along with the nice soundtrack. The puzzles are challenging without seeming too tedious and I found it interesting to learn a bit about Swedish folklore as the myths and monsters in this game aren't those you find it most horror games. It's a bit short, but I find the length appropriate for the game. Overall I'd recommend it if you enjoy creepy, atmospheric puzzle games.			"

												This is a very beautiful and engaging game. It is very short, let's get that said right from the start, and the interface is not perfect. The puzzles are simple yet momentarely challenging, and work beautifully with the story and the overall atmosphere. And oh, the atmosphere! There is something unique in this game. The art style and the strange atmosphere draws you in and keeps you curious all the way to the end. It also has an interesting way to bring you information of mythology, which is one of my favorite topics in the world. If you want the true entire experience, read everything! And I mean, everything! The best part of this game is definitely the story. Thanks to that story this game, no matter how short it is, will stay with me for a long time to come. I doubt I'll ever forget the feeling I had when I finished this. Highly recommended!			"

												[Game originally played on iOS]If you're looking for a review to determine if this is a game worthy of your time, I'll cut you the search: yes, it absolutely is. I'll get more into my thoughts on the game itself below.However.I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you own an iPhone or iPad, get that version instead.There are a lot of puzzles that make a lot more sense and that are a lot more clever with touch controls. There's no reason not to at least pick that version up first. The visuals are identical, it's a few bucks cheaper, and the controls are arguably better when actually using your fingers to swipe across the environment.As for the game itself, it's a stellar game. For such a short runtime, Year Walk shows an interesting world and builds a genuinely fascinating and creepy atmosphere. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and really compliment that atmosphere. The story is also really clever and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Much like the original Portal, it's short, sweet, and gets it's point across with no distractions. All killer, no filler.Absolutely pick this game up if it looks up your alley. Again, I'd urge you to try the iOS version first if you have that option available to you. If not, the PC release is absolutely fine, with only sometimes fiddly controls and a few surprises neutered in the process. I highly recommend Year Walk.			"

												Year Walk is a beautiful, unique experience, and despite its length, it is well worth the price. While this is considered a horror game, its primary draw is its clever puzzles and deceptively quaint and calming atmosphere that seem to take some inspiration from Tim Burton films. The sound design is excellent; both the music and sound effects are extremely crisp and know exactly when to go all out and when to draw back. There are even some music-based puzzles that will rely on your sense of pitch to be able to solve. However, most of the game is very quiet, with little to no music in many sections (though what music is there is quite well done), and only the eerily realistic sound of footsteps crruching in the thick snow will accompany you.One of the key selling points of the game is its focus on Swedish folklore, which is told through a companion app (included in the Steam version) and, while it is not necessary to read, I highly recommend going through it so you will know about the different creatures you will encounter on your journey. I found myself fascinated with the folklore itself, and some of the legends are truly frightening. However, the horror elements are mostly intermittent and not exceptionally scary (most of the ""scary"" parts I would classify more as unnerving than outright terrifying), I think this game is perfect for anyone who is new to horror games and will do a good job easing you into the genre.However, despite my glowing recommendation, I would not recommend playing it on PC if you can get it for another device. This game was originally developed to be played on mobile devices, and while the cursor is perfectly functional, it feels a bit clunky and does not have the same seamless feel of dragging across the screen as using your finger. I would say the ideal version of the game would be the Wii U version, as it has the touch controls of the mobile version, the convenince of having the companion act on the GamePad, and is presented on a large TV to let you truly soak in the visuals. However, if you don't want to play on mobile and/or don't have a Wii U, you experience will not be significantly hampered if you choose to play it on PC. Highly recommend,			"

												This was a pleasant discovery! It's a short puzzle game made very atmospheric! The puzzles aren't that many or very difficult, but that's not the point with this game either. They have based the game on the Swedish folklore ""årsgång"", and the story and how they implemented in to the game was both interesting and fun. I liked that is was abstract and artsy. The music is also good and suits the game well. If you, like me enjoyed the game Knock Knock, and even though it's very different from this game (gameplay wise), you might like this one too!			"

												Based off of Swedish mythology, this game is creepy and awesome. Made my ex boyfriend buy it for me by just the cover art, and he was forced to sit in the room with me while I played because there were constant jumpy scares. Totally worth playing though, if you like puzzles and wandering around terrifingly lonely woods.			"

												Beaten - 2 hoursAn interesting and very artisticly cool take on Scandinavian (I think) mythos. A story that is told by discovery. You pan the camera left and right and and move in and out of scenes. There are some stumpers for puzzles, but for the most part, if you take some notes (no really) you should be able to make it through without too much help. The game also offers help if you are totally stumped.Good short experience.			"

The story, and slowly unravelling of the mystery and main character's psyche.... amazing. If you have any love for horror stories, mythology, or mystery, play this strange little adventure.I will warn anyone sensitive to such things that there are a couple of jump scares, but they are not too bad.

												6/10 in my opinion. Got it as part of a Humble Bundle - wouldn't pay full price but if you're looking to kill an hour, it's not a bad time.Pros:-Art is unique-Cool atmosphere, spooky without being overly so-Folklore is interesting-Puzzles are somewhat intuitive if you half pay attentionCons:-Needless jump-scares (I dislike them anyway)-Won't spoil the ending but it was pretty disatisfying to me-Puzzles really are too easy most of the time.-Short. Even taking my time it took me less than an hour and there's an achievement to finish in less than 20 minutes which having played it once I imagine would be quite easy.			"

A seemingly simple, 30-45 minute puzzle game turned into almost 4 hours of intense reading, brain racking and mystery solving to finally get the true ending of the game. An utterly phenomenal piece of storytelling, both in the lore and the style of telling it. A must play for those who enjoy a good puzzle game.			"

												          At first when I saw this game I didn't know what to expect of it, I only bought it because I had some money left after purchasing Bastion and now after playing this game and getting in love with it's mythos I can say from the bottom of my heart that it's worth all of your money, if you're into puzzles, simple yet complex story, mystery and secrets. If you're into those this game is for you.           The artistic direction for this game is very well put together. The music is perfectly synched with the events in the game, not once did I ever feel that it was out of place, add to taht the imagery which simplistic and less is in fact more and complex. It adds a layer of mystique and intrigue to our wonderful cake.            Some people maight complain to the fact it is short and in a speed run, which is an achievement, you can finish it in 20 minutes or less, but of course if you've already played the game or read cheats, if not you might end up spending quite some time in it, especially if you're like me and play without the map or hints.             This game is worth it's money, it might seem short, but it does not feel short and seeing the price for it I say this is not a major inconvenience. All in all this game deserves more attention and praise for that you can see the work the people making it had put and the lasting impretion it will give you is indeed one worth playing for.                                                          P.S. Play again after finishid and read the journal <Pqtvj qh vjg oknn, uqwvj qh vjg dtqqm> "

When you reach the credits the first time, you feel devastated and there is a hint that you can change the outcome, so you'll play it again. And it still gets to you. This little gem of an Indie game is beautiful. The puzzles are clever but not too hard. The atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful and so is the artwork. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to get through a good story and is a Indie game lover. This game will stay with you for a good amount of time. Go play it already!			"

												Year Walk is definitedly one of the best, most thrilling, atmospheric short indie games I ever played since quite a long time. The graphics and soundtrack are really amazing and fascinating through a stunning kind of minimalism which holds a very gloomy charm on itself. Some of the riddles are quite tricky but you'll always find some useful hints in the menue to help you through. The story builds up slowly as you play,  explore and walk through a silent, odd winter landscape, leading you  to a most unexpected creepy discovery in the very end.  It ain't look great on first sight but you might change your mind when reaching and finding out the ""true"" story end of this Year Walk.I've always been fascinated by Northern cultures and their dark and strange fairytales so I was very happy to finally get a chance to dive into this hunting, confusing part of an old Swedish folklore custom. Well done!			"

												Year Walk, weird. This has been, is, and will be a very interesting experience. There really isn't anything like this on the market. The game is vague, abtract, plain, and confusing all at the same time - and I quite like that. The story is told with excellent fashion that I admire greatly. The gameplay is pretty much non-existent besides doing puzzles and (surprise surprise) walking. It was only a 2-3 hour long game but I feel that anymore time would have ruined part of the experience. Anyone with a knack for querk, wit, and casual should check this out.			"

												A puzzle / riddle game with some element of exploration. A VERY interesting story and deep sense of the supernatural wrapped in a mysterious aura.I will not spoil anything by telling you what it is about, but it is definately worth playing.Definately a marvelous experience, although it is a bit short and easy.

												Year walk is a relatively short game (It takes an hour at most I'll say, and theres even an achievement for beating it in under 20 minutes) but it's perfect for what it is.It focuses on Sweedish folklore (as you can guess from the description) and is a treat for anyone who enjoys urban legends of any kind. Not to mention it's absolutely breathtaking to look at.Would I describe it as a horror game? Short answer: Yes. Long answer? Well, it isn't exactly a traditional 'horror' game. The atmosphere is perfect but not exactly what I would call....scary? Its a little unnerving at times, and it does have about 2 jumpscares (but like most jumpscares if you play the game more than once you won't find them spooky again) The games story is (relatively) easy to follow, but the puzzles are brilliantly challenging. More often than not you should expect to find yourself checking the hints. Between the beautiful graphics, simple and nice story, and secret true ending I'm sure it's worth the money to get even at it's full price of 6 dollars. I whole heartedly reccommend this game to anyone. (And if you like an added challenge try and get all the achievements- some of them are even more cryptic than the puzzles in the game)			"

												Yearwalk is a fantastic historically-based, first-person adventure game. The minimalistic graphics are beautiful, and can be beheld on a potato. Coupled with the kick-butt soundtrack, the immersion in this game is top notch. The story is rather short (If you know what you are doing, it only takes about a quarter of an hour), but it holds some replay value (as there is another ending option). Yearwalk is based on the Swedish tradition of Yearwalking, a long forgotten ritual of old. Not only did this game stay with me on an intellectual level for quite some time, but it also piqued my interest in Swedish folklore.This game can definitely be seen as an interactive movie, and as such it may not be for everyone. Overall, I would say it's only lacking in length. 8.5/10			"

												Year Walk has a compelling story behind it, stretching beyond the main gameplay. Its very beautiful, as well as mysterious. The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is certainly something to behold.One feature I REALLY like about this game is the autosave feature. As soon as you close, it saves and the next time you open it, it loads in the exact place you left off. No having to redo parts, very handy if you're like me and can only snatch a half hour of game time during the day!			"

												Great atmosphere, very dark and strange and makes you feel out of place. The strange format works pretty well, the games movements are a bit resrictive though, but this allows the game makers to put in some really great ideas. The story is easy to follow and though there is an air of mystery, like many great horror titles should have, most things are explained in the end but not all of them. This leaves you with even more questions than you began with. Overall this is a wonderful game, highly recommended. And if you would like to play it but cant afford it, or if you like some commentary with the game, check out my playthrough of it.

												Creepy as heck. Turn the lights off, volume up, and play this alone in a dark room on a large screen. I honestly spent more time researching Scandanavian folklore than the time I spent completing this game, which to me is a very, very good thing. This is coming from a guy who spent a good portion of his childhood sifting through every Time-Life Enchanted World Series books. For what it is, it's absolutely engaging and they managed to pull this off very nicely. I actually had no idea that this was initially a iOS game. Directly from the developers website:""At Simogo we don’t make games in a specific genre. In fact, we’re not overly concerned about whether or not they are even games!

												When I first watched a trailer for Year Walk, I instantly fell in love with the music and art style. Then I found that old folklore was thrown into the mix, and was instantly sold. I didn't know whether or not the game would come through in the end, but I hoped that it would.And it did.You're a simple man who wants to know that which many of us wish we could foretell: ""Will they always love me?""If given the chance to see into the future over this matter, myself, I would have done the same thing.The path is riddled with creatures that desire to impede you, and sating their desires requires some thinking and wandering.There was never a moment that the art direction and soundtrack did not bring everything together perfectly, and as such I was completely taken into immersion.This is definitely a horror game, and while I usually can't handle playing this genre being the scaredy cat I am, I managed to finish this. If that shows any indication as to whether or not you should pick it up if you're easily frightened, the answer is yes.It's a bit on the short side of things, but that works just fine as you need multiple playthroughs in order to reach the true ending.The story is much deeper than it originally presents itself to be, and I was left speechless at several points.Year Walk took my expectations and delivered higher than I even anticipated. I'm in a difficult time in my life right now, and can put myself inside of the protagonist's shoes perfectly. Just reverse the sexes and there you go. This game gives you a lot to contemplate about your own life and what exactly you are willing to give up for a glimpse of what is to come.I no longer yearn to see the future, as enticing as the notion seems to be. At what point do we play into fate's hands or carve our own path? That decision is yours, just like the decision to play this game.I can't help you figure out the prior, but the latter is definitely pointing towards trying it out for yourself.			"

A walk through a forest, a journey through the brutal world of pagan mythology — not the one with epic gods' battles, but grassroots mythology with those things lurking in forests, wisps over marshes dead babies left in the woods. Some puzzles are easy, but some would require you to think outside the box. Overall, a creepy experience to remember.			"

												Such an amazing game, with sinister atmosphere, bordering on terrifying. I bought it on a hunch and I have no regrets. The world of Swedish folklore sucks you right in and lets you out richer in new, slightly unsettling knowledge... Very interesting indeed. I recommend using headphones for this game, not only because of the better scare some sound effects will give you, but also because some puzzles are based on sound, following voices, etc. Overall, I think Year Walk combines certain elements which make it so alluring, maybe not to everyone, but definitely to me - it has puzzles, mystery, mythology, a little bit of horror, great soundtrack, amazing, haunting graphics - I could just go on and on. What's not to love?			"

												First off.. AMAZING GAME!! This is now one my favorite horror point&click puzzle games.  SO, basically you are doing a Year Walk which is a spiritual journey to discover the future, either bad or good.  It shows both 3d and 2d graphics and blends them together perfectly IMO. If you are like me and get into the storyline and the mood the creators try to portray, well you are in for a treat.  I was at the edge of my seat the entire time I played.  Its horror is really cool but not the typical horror of todays hollywood movies, but that just straight up creepy horror that sends chills down your spine.  If you are looking for a game that is fun and tests you, well here it is. You can use hints that they let you click but really, only use if you are extremely stuck and have no idea what to do next.  At the end of the game it never says ""THE END"" but there is an end. So pay attention, cause unlike most games that you just get up an walk away during the credits...THIS YOU WANT TO STAY! it gives you vital info that you will need for your next playthrough and to access parts of the game that can not be accesses without that info. SO ENJOY YOUR YEAR WALK...it just might be your last..MWUAHAHAH XD			"

												Just finished this game (including the extra part), and I couldn't recommend it more. A little short, but everything else about it is wonderful. Puzzles are fun, aethetic is top notch, music is simple and haunting (to be really cliched about it). And it's cheap! Just buy it. Right now.			"

												Year Walk.  This game is something.  It will not be for everyone.  The game is not huge, but I know there are a couple different endings.  The gameplay itself focuses on exploring the forest and solving puzzles from a first person perspective, but you do not walk around like a normal first person game.  You kind of slide from side to side and move forward and backward to different areas.  This is a little confusing at first but you can get used to it in ten or fifteen minutes easily.  This game is mostly focused on solving puzzles, as mentioned above.  Actually this is one of the only games to really give me the same vibe that Myst gave me all those years ago… I am not sure what it is about it.  Some of the puzzles are pretty abstract, but a lot of them have hints in the game world if you look.  But this game has a great serene atmosphere that becomes more creepy and unsettling over time.  A very melancholy but thought provoking experience, if not a short one (I beat it in two hours, but there is a speed run achievement for something like 20 minutes).			"

												This game is a perfect combination of drama and thrill. It's puzzles are nice and cryptic and the art is amazing. Soundtrack makes you feel like that you are indeed walking the year walk. You realise the effort people have put in this game more as you proceed. If you like Scandinavian folk tales and moody puzzle games with a beaut artwork, I suggest you to buy this game without a doubt.			"

												This game is visually enticing and the story easy to follow. The puzzles aren't terribly difficult but the tale that unfolds makes the quests well worth the effort. I bought this game during the Steam Sale and am very happy with the purchase. If I had bought it at full price I might be a little frustrated with how short the game is and the lack of replay ability it contains. Still an excellent game and would recommend to friends, or merely have them play on my computer whenever they visit for a nice little Swedish folktale.			"

Not really the biggest adventure game I've ever played, but very interesting how it utilisies various Nordic/Swedish myths and traditions in the game.  Also great to see that they've included an encyclopedia and Swedish names for the various areas.  Both intriguing game and great bit of education about the Swedish traditions and language.			"

												This game does something that very few pieces of media do well. This game manages to be simple in treatment and complex in subject matter. And do both very well at the same time. I really enjoyed my time with this short game. It has an achievement to get through the game in 20 minutes, and after a play through or two that's very very doable. The lore in the encyclopedia and the introduction of the journal in the second play through are wonderful. The puzzles are pretty nice too. I recommend not going into this one with a guide at first. The puzzles aren't anything that will make some one throw a keyboard or anything, but they are enough to make ya' scratch your head the first time you see them. This game is just so clever in how it chooses to do things. The closest thing I can think of to this game is Pan's Labyrinth. They're different as far as plot and what not, but their approach to the subject matter has the same kind of tone.If you're looking for a short game that has some meat to it this is a great one to pick up. If you're looking for something outright terrifying you might want to look elsewhere.			"

												Wasn't really sure what to expect from this game due to no prior experience with the previous versions but I was i the mood for something weird and different so I tried it anyway. All in all very happy with the game, as mentioned by others the game isn't difficult, the puzzles aren't hard, because you're here to experience the ambience of this unique little game. Although, the replayability isn't too high I went through the game a couple times with a fine tooth comb and really started to appreciate the music, art, mythology, and story when one takes the time to see it through to the end in one sitting without any outside influences drawing attention away. It was interesting enough to incline me to come back on New Year's Eve for another playthrough just to get the achievement and experience it again. My one and only complaint is that it wasn't long enough but then again it's not like you have to sell a kidney to buy it so that's to be expected.Get this game.			"

												First off.. AMAZING GAME!! This is now one my favorite horror point&click puzzle games.  SO, basically you are doing a Year Walk which is a spiritual journey to discover the future, either bad or good.  It shows both 3d and 2d graphics and blends them together perfectly IMO. If you are like me and get into the storyline and the mood the creators try to portray, well you are in for a treat.  I was at the edge of my seat the entire time I played.  Its horror is really cool but not the typical horror of todays hollywood movies, but that just straight up creepy horror that sends chills down your spine.  If you are looking for a game that is fun and tests you, well here it is. You can use hints that they let you click but really, only use if you are extremely stuck and have no idea what to do next.  At the end of the game it never says ""THE END"" but there is an end. So pay attention, cause unlike most games that you just get up an walk away during the credits...THIS YOU WANT TO STAY! it gives you vital info that you will need for your next playthrough and to access parts of the game that can not be accesses without that info. SO ENJOY YOUR YEAR WALK...it just might be your last..MWUAHAHAH XD			"

The real reason to play it in my mind, though, is for the experience.

												A short but very atmospheric walking sim (yes, similar to the point&clicks - but a first person walk with arrow or wasd keys).  For sure, it has a great creep factor but not terrifyingly so, otherwise I might not have been able to play.  What I really loved most (other than the sound of the snow crunching under foot and great music) was the context of 19th century Swedish folklore.  And I think if you have an interest in folklore, you would value this experience.  I loved reading the encyclopedia which has spurred my own library search to read Swedish fairytales and folklore.  I also loved the journal you acquire after the first playthrough.  Which deepens the story leaving me at the end feeling as though I'd finished a good creepy read.  Great stuff.  Hard game?  No.  Enjoyable?  Yes.			"

												Year Walk is a short, creepy adventure that is 2 parts adventure game and 1 part interactive fiction. Inspired by the Swedish folk tradition of Arsgang, Year Walk sets you in the shoes of someone who dares to undertake this strange journey.The art and simple controls, as well as the sensation that you are watching an old film complete with tears and dust on the print, put you into a realm where anything could happen. It is not without some quality jump scares and unsettling imagery. There is a bit of Lovecraftian horror dwelling within Year Walk.The puzzles fit into the world well, although while manipulating them you can tell the game was conceived for tablets. It should not diminish any enjoyment, however. They are clever enough to make the player feel smart upon completing them. And the less you know going into it, all the better. Year Walk is worth it for fans of interactive fiction games and creepy short stories.			"

												i'm a very big fan of folklore, especially scandinavian. other games i've played that try to touch on folklore either don't give enough background and end up confusing, or give way too much information and feel like a history lesson. this game balances the historical information with the gameplay very well. you get to interact with every character you learn about in the game and some levels aren't possible to beat without knowing the history.the gameplay is a bit confusing since there aren't many games that are 2D and first person, but you do get used to it pretty easily. i wouldn't call this a puzzle game, but you do have to use critical thinking if you want to move on in the story, unless you use a walkthrough like i did. for me puzzle games have to do with finding patterns in the physical properties of objects. in this game, you are given hints as to how to get past the chapter in the story in the form of riddles, and you have to decipher the riddles. i guess this would really be a riddle game instead of a puzzle game.the story is not linear and you only get clued into the plot at the very beginning and the end. the game starts with the main character visiting his girlfriend, where we learn a bit about the characters and get some background on what ""year walks"" are. you don't eat or drink for a day, then you walk into the woods at midnight in search of clues for what will happen in the future. this is loosely based on a swedish tradition. the next day you begin the year walk, and the plot is not mentioned for a while. the majority of the game is solving a series of challenges presented by and involving different scandinavian folk figures. the game provides an encyclopedia where you can read about every creature in the game. this gives clues to their nature and behavior, and sometimes helps to solve puzzles. when you finally get to the end, you get a glimpse into the main character's future, which i won't say since it will ruin the game.however, this is not the end. the game ends in a tragedy, but it gives you a chance to right your wrongs by switching perspective to a modern-day historian who is researching the year walks. he gives you a riddle that lets you view a journal he has been keeping about the events of the game. some people say the journal is a long read, but it only took a few minutes of my time. this part of the game is almost a different genre; it seems more like a detective short story than a surreal video game. the historian is haunted by the creatures you interact with from the game as they show him how to help the main character. his research into the year walk tradition explains a lot about the plot. i will say that this whole aspect of the game seems a bit out of place: like the developers just threw it in because they felt like people would be confused by the twist ending or wonder how the game ties into the real world. ultimately it created a bit more confusion than was already present, but since you get a chance to save a very likeable character it makes a good addition to the game. the alternate ending created by the journal does involve the very overused (especially in games) cliche of heroic sacrifice.none of this would really matter if the game didn't have nice aesthetics though. it doesn't try to make up for anything with them, but the simplistic gameplay and virtual lack of dialogue would make for a very boring game if it weren't for the way this game looks. the graphics go along very well with the gameplay and other stylistic choices for the game, like the use of runes, the setting, the light horror aspect, and the depiction of the folk figures. allegedly the developer of the game researched horror movies to get the timing right on the spooky scenes, and it really shows. right when the music gets peaceful and the graphics become fluid and lure you into a false sense of security, some spooky pagan ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will come flying at you out of the blue. people are very averse to the jump scare, and most fans of horror and critics will say that it's a cheap or uncreative tactic, but just like everything it has its place, and there are some times where it's appropriate to use it. unlike most of the horror genre, where the jump scare is used so much it becomes a joke amongst the audience, this game knows when to trigger a fight or flight response.besides minor flaws i talked about, this is one of my favorite games right now. i know most folklore fans don't give a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about games, and most gamers don't give a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about folklore, but this game has something to offer to both groups.

Was absolutely terrifying but then everything went back to normal in what seemed like 30 minutes. Overall, great game 10/10 IGN would hallucinate again.			"

												There isn't much else to be said about Year Walk that hasn't been said already. I'm not the point 'n' click type and I'm not sure what pulled me toward this game but it scared me in all the good ways and more importantly its story fascinated me. After my first playthrough I was genuinely interested in learning about the lore of Year Walking or ""Årsgång"" and I think a lot of horror games are missing that element of everlasting wonder, y'know? Those haunting moments that never really let go and have you jumping at your shadow. The game itself isn't very long, with a typical playthrough lasting 45mins-1hour, but you'll find yourself mesmerized by the ending and the ***SPOILER***   journal you unlock which sheds light on the present day researcher looking into the mystery of year walking My only gripe with this game is that its short!+atmosphere+story-length			"

												Won't take you long to finish, but worth the journey. Haunting at points - perhaps a bit too typical of the genre (jump scares, blood, darkness) as others have noted - but the story is strong and combination of mechanics draw you in.			"

												I can't help but be reminded of the HBO T.V series True Detective while playing this game. Elements from the game such as the rune stick symbols, dead babies, strange pagan rituals and folklores post strong similiarities to the theme of the said T.V series. Combined with the creepy and trippy vibe in the game, you will either ruminate or obliterate the existence of the game from the mind, writing it off as a bad trip. For me, it was an experience, which in the process allowed me to discover the bleak, grim nature of Scandinavian folklore.			"

												Loved this game.  Great story, gorgeous environment, and while not exactly scary, hits this wonderful note of just creepy enough to want to keep the lights on.  It'll likely take you an hour or two to play (it's not terribly difficult) but you'll probably need to play it through 3+ to actually complete everything. Oh and watch the credits.			"

												My first playthrough of Year Walk took two nights, simply because I was so overwrought after the first half that I needed a break. I was initially a little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ albeit unsurprised at the ending, but I couldn't get it out of my head. I play a lot of horror games but this one really got to me.LET IT BE NOTED : Yeah, it's a horror game but don't expect tons of gore or anything. A few jumpscares, a little blood, and that's it. Mostly it's the symbolic weight of all those things that got to me personally, ESPECIALLY after reading the encyclopedia and journal in-depth. It's very heavy. When I finally got the true ending (admittedly on my third attempt with a smigen of cheating) it became even heavier, but more satisfying and beautiful. This game is for those who have the ability to immerse themselves in a mythical tale of adventure, observation, sacrifice, and love. Everyone says this game is ""meant to be played twice,"" which is entirely true but I know there's even more. I fully intend to uncover all that I can.			"

												Awesome atmosphere - very unsettling. Navigating seems couterintuitive at first, but with the help of the map, this is easily overcome. If you are into darker stories in your games, and you enjoy the experience without having to really be challanged, definitely try this game. Not to say the puzzles are easy, but this ain't not Myst, people. I beat it in about an hour. Sidenote: this totally reminds me of the music video of Steven Wilson's The Raven that Refused to Sing.

If you enjoy story driven experiences, PLEASE give this game a try. Although you can't ""die,"" I felt a real sense of foreboding throughout. The art style is simple but genius, ranging from beautiful to downright terrifying. The game mostly consists of clue collecting and puzzle solving, which reveals the story of our hero's ""Year Walk"" and the folklore behind it.  "

												Wonderful game.  Others have covered it pretty well.  It's very short, but the puzzles strike a nice difficulty balance: not too obscure, not too obvious.  The story is fantastic, and it's definitely worth a second playthrough.There's some dissagreement about whether this is a horror game or not.  It is not a traditional horror game.  I would say it has some horror elements (well implemented at that).  I like horror and adventure games, so this was a perfect fit for my tastes. It does have a very dark story as well.  I do not know whether to call it a horror game or not. I don't have that kind of authority.Would feed dead babies to a river horse again  9/10			"

												This is one of the most imaginative games I have ever played. As others will tell you, it's short, but you literally have to play it twice if you want the whole story. I'm no good at puzzle games, but very rarely was I frusterated with this one; instead, I just wanted to keep playing and figure it out. The story is very poignant and emotionally striking. As for the horror aspect, I've been constantly looking over my shoulder to make sure the Huldra isn't there. My only complaint: NEED MOAR! A sequel would be great...			"

												To keep the story short - ""Year Walk"" is an atmospheric mystery horror adventure with an unique presentation and splendidly unsettling atmosphere. It does everything a truly unsettling psychological horror should. The strongest point is the telling of the narrative, which is brilliant, and takes (at least) 2 play-throughs to unfold.The game has no dialogue, and offers no backstory. During your 1st play-through you'll get bits and pieces of the puzzle, but it's up to you to connect the dots, and guess and assume much, thus creating the skeleton of a story. Then during your 2nd play-through, if you choose to do a side-quest (of sorts) the true nature of things is revealed, and the story suddenly gets a crazy spin and expands majestically in scope as everything falls into place.""Year Walk"" is not so much of a game, as it is an amazing example of story-telling. Recommended, and then some!			"

												A short-but-sweet adventure game with some minor horror elements (atmosphere, a few jump scares, but that's it). The puzzles are never really directly stated (aside from the beginning and ending there's no text anywhere in the game) but are logically solvable and the game world is somewhat mazelike but a map helps to prevent you from getting lost. There are a lot of strange creatures to interact with and the puzzle design is pretty great, but the game is over very quickly and can be played start-to-finish in some 10-15 minutes if you know what to do.And there's also a second ending you can get after beating the game the first time, which is what really makes this worth playing, in my opinion, but... I won't say anything else.Maybe not quite worth the full price, but I'd say it's a unique and enjoyable experience.			"

The use and explanation of real folk-lore gave the game a more realisitic feeling  and just added to the atmosphere explaining what each 'watcher' was and how they operated.You have to have the capabilities to get wrapped up in the world of Year Walk to fully enjoy it. If you're looking for just a basic game that doesn't have a deep story-line i recommend you look elsewhere.You don't really play Year Walk. You experience it.10/10			"

There were a couple jumpscares, which were not used cheaply (first one scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.) The ""end"" of the game left an unsatisfied feeling, and thank goodness it wasn't quite over.You must find the login to the journal to get to the real ending, don't stop until you do what you need to do and get to ""The End.""10/10 would recommend			"

												Immersive, engaging, beautiful. This is not a very long game, but what it lacks in length, it makes up for in story and atmosphere. If you enjoy story driven experiences, PLEASE give this game a try. Although you can't ""die,"" I felt a real sense of foreboding throughout. The art style is simple but genius, ranging from beautiful to downright terrifying. The game mostly consists of clue collecting and puzzle solving, which reveals the story of our hero's ""Year Walk"" and the folklore behind it.  "

												Interesting but short game with gorgeous graphics. Tells a very haunting story that horror fans will love, though it can be a bit cryptic. The music is also beautiful!In the end falls short because of cheap jumpscares, boring memory puzzles, quite some senseless wandering and too much reading of GUI's, which leads to the player losing his immersion way too often. And while the weird perspective used in the game is very unique, at times it feels maybe a bit too out-of-body. Would still recommend it if you're looking for a cool artsy game to play that does some fun experimenting in how stories can be told.I'm feeling a light 7			"

												Since I haven't finished this game and apparently have no plan on it,either,I just say this straight:an outstanding story,really,but a HORROR game,too!!It scared me,twice!!At first I thought it was another fairy-tale-style game,just like Child of light.But after 40 minutes' playing,I realized that it is exactly a fairy tale,but not for children or me,at least!No,I'm not a timid guy,but I didn't expect something horrible suddenly jump out in front of me in a fairy tale!It's not a complex game.little dialogue,no mission oders or other instractions,even no voice actings.And these exactly make it obscure.Need to try hard to search,to discover,to understand.When you are confused about it and can't figure out anything,it means nothing to you.But when you finally make it,you'll know an impressive story.8.5/10.A good story,obviously.But no,I'm not gonna play it again.

												Wonderful game.  Others have covered it pretty well.  It's very short, but the puzzles strike a nice difficulty balance: not too obscure, not too obvious.  The story is fantastic, and it's definitely worth a second playthrough.There's some dissagreement about whether this is a horror game or not.  It is not a traditional horror game.  I would say it has some horror elements (well implemented at that).  I like horror and adventure games, so this was a perfect fit for my tastes. It does have a very dark story as well.  I do not know whether to call it a horror game or not. I don't have that kind of authority.Would feed dead babies to a river horse again  9/10			"

There are 2 endings. You'll get a hint on how to do the second ending after the first. It involves the journal, that's all I'm going to say. It also involves looking at the map but you won't understand why until you finish the game first. It will tell you where to look. Trust me I had to look hard in the forum to figure it out so I'm making it easier here. Definately worth a play through.			"

I really appreciate this game’s attention to detail. The story, though a little confusing if you choose to dive into it, is fascinating. I love how everything is tied together. This game gave me goosebumps on multiple occasions. Even with the map, navigation is a little confusing. And I don’t like the Steam achievements, but that has nothing to do with the actual game. Overall, this game is very unique, creepy, eerie, weird, dark, and somewhat terrifying, but in some ways… it’s beautiful. It’s a hard game to describe.

												I was looking forward to Year Walk coming to Steam, and now that it's here I can say it was well worth the wait.  The atmosphere is like so many of the classic horror games, slightly odd at the beginning before becoming unnerving and by the end there is a feel of sheer terror at what might be next, with some well-orchestrated scares in the game.  The atmosphere is aided by some great art and sound design as well as some superb music (which is top of the list for my next download splurge) and the story itself is intriguing, as you wonder where it will go next - and, on a second playthrough, you find out even more.Most of all, Year Walk is a game that stays with you once you play it, burrowing into your mind and finding a comfortable nest for itself, reminding you of your encounters with the Huldra and the Mylings when you least expect it.

												Honestly this is probably one of the better puzzle games ive ever played, I highly recommend anybody who likes beautiful art and a deep enthralling story lines to play this. Even after playing it I found myself wanting more, and constantly bugging my friends to play so I can watch them gasp at the twist ending. I've played this game over and over, and it's a really quick one if you know what you're doing (If not, all you do is click the hints!) Also, A word to the wise who finishes the game and automatically stops: If you remember what is told to you at the ending, please, yearwalk again. The game isn't COMPLETELY over. There's an entire, indepth part of the story that you're going to miss, if not. And if you're confused with the hint, I will give you another to help you. (Scroll your mouse to where it told you to go over your map!) Play this game!			"

												Okay I want to start off by saying that as much as I wholeheartedly reccomend this game, it IS a horror game. I just finished a puzzle that ended in a really freaky jumpscare, and overall the atmosphere is really creepy and intense. If that's going to really freak you out or if you really can't stand games like that, this isn't the game for you.Overall my reaction has been wholly positive so far, even if I did just get the pants scared off me. The art is gorgeous, the music is eerie but nice, and the controls are very simple, making for easy-to-learn gameplay. I don't think I'm close to finished quite yet, but between the art and the overall atmosphere of the game, I'm really enjoying playing.And it's not just a horror game; it's a puzzle game. Puzzles that are original and unique from what I've seen in other games for the most part, and they aren't just random little things; everything seems to be fitting together, puzzles take you through many different areas of the game (thankfully there's a map), and there's an easy-to-use hint system that keeps me from getting frustrated by an 'unsolvable' puzzle. There does seem to be quite a bit of backtracking involved, as where you can move is limited (only side to side, and forwards/backwards only when there is a path), but I feel that that's a minor flaw in an otherwise entirely enjoyable game. I'll definitely be posting my full reaction to the game once I've finished, which will make for a more comprehensive review :)			"

All in all very happy with the game, as mentioned by others the game isn't difficult, the puzzles aren't hard, because you're here to experience the ambience of this unique little game. Although, the replayability isn't too high I went through the game a couple times with a fine tooth comb and really started to appreciate the music, art, mythology, and story when one takes the time to see it through to the end in one sitting without any outside influences drawing attention away. It was interesting enough to incline me to come back on New Year's Eve for another playthrough just to get the achievement and experience it again. My one and only complaint is that it wasn't long enough but then again it's not like you have to sell a kidney to buy it so that's to be expected.Get this game.			"

												Year Walk introduces you to a whole new world of horrifying supernatural phenomena. Drawing upon the events of the Swedish tradition of the same name, the protagonist (you) seek to learn the future -- and what better way to do so than to lock yourself in your cottage without food, fire or speaking to anyone for the day to later venture out into the woods at midnight to hallucinate from a combination of starvation and hypothermia? If somewhat simplistic, the game is steeped in Swedish culture and macabre in design and plot. There are new creatures to add to your nightmares and several absolutely terrfying moments, rendering the horror tag well deserved. This horror component adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, the main purpose focus being a series of puzzles that you must unlock with your keen senses.The early stages of the game are frustratingly vague however, the first few moments are spent wandering around uselessly until you realise there is both a map and a hint section. Once you get the hang of it however, Year Walk sucks you in, driving you deeper and deeper into delirium.While a little short, there is an option to play again and unlock the secrets that bested you the first (or second) time around.For me it crashed out a few times in the early stages, refusing to load the first time so I was allowed to stare at an empty screen for five minutes, but I won't hold that against it. Year Walk saves automatically which is a definite plus when playing on temperamental computers.Definitely worth the price. 10/10 would walk again.			"

												One of the more unique games you'll play. It draws upon Swedish folklore, something that lends an interesting flavor as you explore mythology that may be unfamiliar. The art and music are both gorgeous. Be warned: this game makes you work. I was thrilled to find myself making notes and drawing little sketches to help myself solve puzzles. Don't be deterred, though; hints are available should you want them. The game has horror elements, but, aside from a couple of jump scares, is fairly subtle in its delivery. To get the full story you must play the game twice, though I suspect some may find the secondary story to be disappointing and a little too sci-fi in comparison to the first story. The game is short, maybe an hour for the first playthrough, but it uses its time effectively to show off interesting ideas and beautiful art.			"

												An intriguing art style, proposed foundation in Swedish folklore, and under $5? Why not. While it has its issues, I found Year Walk worth its price tag and an interesting game. MovementWalking side to side and moving forward and backwards through panes, the movement system is interesting at first and compliments the art style well, but eventually it becomes slightly tedious. PuzzlesOverall, the puzzles were enjoyable, the majority being based off memory, fetching, and reference. While the puzzles themselves are fairly easy, the most difficult part is realizing what gives you the answer. An example of this being one puzzle where you need to look at the pattern that one object moves in to know which order to click two other objects, meanwhile these objects appear totally unrelated and are halfway across the map from one another. Some may appreciate the adventuring it takes to find this out, others may just become frusrated.StoryI found the story to be of little importance besides setting up a beginning and end for the game. During the meat of the gameplay I gave the story very little thought. With that being said, I did enjoy the little amount of story that did occur, I only wish there was more of it. Dat SpookinessWhile mostly just eerie, there are one or two jump scare moments that catch you off-guard. I enjoyed the music, it is definitely used well in the game and adds to the tension, even if that tension never really comes to a boil but simply simmers on the back burner. InterfaceConstant checking of the map, while not excruciating, does become a slight burden. The inclusion of a journal, which I did not use, could make for more a immersive experience if someone were to. A Hints section is well done, offering at first very general advice as to how to go forward, however if you continue with the hints they do become fairly direct as to what to do. ConclusionI found Year Walk to be a unique experience. While not without its flaws, the great art, folklore aspects, and acceptable puzzles make it a game I can recommend to most. "

												If Twin Peaks had been set in late-19th-century Sweden, it might have resembled Year Walk.  Add in a distinctive art style, some clever (but not too challenging) puzzles, and a few jump scares -- we end up playing, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coff... adventure game.Find a way to open the box.

												*orgazms explosively after beating the game*I loved everything about this game. The artstyle was unique and helped get accross the creepy and unsettling mood creating a fantastic atmosphere. The story was a masterpiece. I have never found a game other than year walk i could replay multiple times and still get chills when i reach the end. The use and explanation of real folk-lore gave the game a more realisitic feeling  and just added to the atmosphere explaining what each 'watcher' was and how they operated.You have to have the capabilities to get wrapped up in the world of Year Walk to fully enjoy it. If you're looking for just a basic game that doesn't have a deep story-line i recommend you look elsewhere.You don't really play Year Walk. You experience it.10/10			"

												First things first: I counted three horror elements in the game, and they were all jump scares. So, if you're avoiding this because you're concerned about the horror tag, please don't let it deter you. I find myself paralyzed in most horror games, but I never felt that way with Year Walk. I love point-and-click adventures, but I particularly enjoyed this game because the mythology behind the plot and mechanics wasn't just dressing. If you want to solve puzzles, you read the encyclopedia. And not in the Witcher-sense of the idea: you don't read it to automatically unlock something else. You have to find things, and the encyclopedia entries help with that.I also loved the art. As I said, I'm not big on horror games, but I love it nearly every where else. The surreal style mixes with muted colors to create an eerie atmosphere for the game. (Man, I adored that damn horse.) The puzzles serve the atmosphere, as well. They're each their own representation of the creature you're working with (or challenging, depending on your interpretation, I guess). They don't require intense brain power, firing off all of your neurons or anything, but I found them sufficiently challenging and appropriate for what the game is. My biggest issue was with the movement. You can't turn around or look to the side, but you move as if you should be able to do those things. But the map is so small it didn't end up as frustrating as I thought it would be.I'm not sure Year Walk is for everyone, but I'd say it's a must if you enjoy atmospheric and/or point-and-click adventure games.

												I really did enjoy this game. Initially, the game is somewhat reluctant to give any information as to what's happening. Mostly, it's just trying to understand the sheer complexity of this really great game.It had suspense, elements of horror, intriguing design and all round well made.9/10 good game, Swedish Folklore = trippy as balls.P.S. Try to get a glance at the ""locked"" journal, (it's a very interesting addition).			"

												This game was really surprising to me in a good way. Easy to get through in a short amount of time, but the time spent playing it is really magical.The story is pretty simple and gets a bit more detailed and complex the closer you are to completing it. It's creepy in its own way, has clever little puzzles, a unique aesthetic and fitting music. I sat down with a cup of cocoa and enjoyed playing through this game for 1-2 hours. Really relaxing and fun. If you like folklore, horror/creepy stuff, storytelling and puzzles, I'd suggest this one!			"

												Year Walk is a beautiful, unique experience, and despite its length, it is well worth the price. While this is considered a horror game, its primary draw is its clever puzzles and deceptively quaint and calming atmosphere that seem to take some inspiration from Tim Burton films. The sound design is excellent; both the music and sound effects are extremely crisp and know exactly when to go all out and when to draw back. There are even some music-based puzzles that will rely on your sense of pitch to be able to solve. However, most of the game is very quiet, with little to no music in many sections (though what music is there is quite well done), and only the eerily realistic sound of footsteps crruching in the thick snow will accompany you.One of the key selling points of the game is its focus on Swedish folklore, which is told through a companion app (included in the Steam version) and, while it is not necessary to read, I highly recommend going through it so you will know about the different creatures you will encounter on your journey. I found myself fascinated with the folklore itself, and some of the legends are truly frightening. However, the horror elements are mostly intermittent and not exceptionally scary (most of the ""scary"" parts I would classify more as unnerving than outright terrifying), I think this game is perfect for anyone who is new to horror games and will do a good job easing you into the genre.However, despite my glowing recommendation, I would not recommend playing it on PC if you can get it for another device. This game was originally developed to be played on mobile devices, and while the cursor is perfectly functional, it feels a bit clunky and does not have the same seamless feel of dragging across the screen as using your finger. I would say the ideal version of the game would be the Wii U version, as it has the touch controls of the mobile version, the convenince of having the companion act on the GamePad, and is presented on a large TV to let you truly soak in the visuals. However, if you don't want to play on mobile and/or don't have a Wii U, you experience will not be significantly hampered if you choose to play it on PC. Highly recommend,			"

												I wasn't so sure about this game at first.  The navigation takes some getting used to because you're travelling horizontally a lot.  It's challenging, for sure, and I had some pretty frustrated moments.  I also had moments where it scared the crap out of me and I shrieked.  The music is haunting, nothing is predictable, and the setting is mesmerizing.This game is like nothing I've played before, and I definitely recommend spending an evening with it.  It only takes about 1-3 hours, but it's worth the $5.  Without spoiling anything: read through EVERYTHING.  Do everything.  Write things down.  Don't skip anything.

												What a beautiful game! I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I managed to get through it all in about two hours (extra end bit included). I personally really love myth and lore, and being unfamiliar with Scandanavian narratives, I found it extremely enticing. I happily read all the encyclopedia chapters and journal entries. My mind is so enthralled, I'll probably do more research on my own when I have the time. Pros:- Aesthetically pleasing (love the addition of the crunching snow sound)- Beautiful, but holds its eerie quality- Puzzles are challenging but not impossibleCons:- Unfortunately short- Story is left ambiguous (although this also adds to the mystery of the game)10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes lore, history, and horror.

												This is a very beautiful and engaging game. It is very short, let's get that said right from the start, and the interface is not perfect. The puzzles are simple yet momentarely challenging, and work beautifully with the story and the overall atmosphere. And oh, the atmosphere! There is something unique in this game. The art style and the strange atmosphere draws you in and keeps you curious all the way to the end. It also has an interesting way to bring you information of mythology, which is one of my favorite topics in the world. If you want the true entire experience, read everything! And I mean, everything! The best part of this game is definitely the story. Thanks to that story this game, no matter how short it is, will stay with me for a long time to come. I doubt I'll ever forget the feeling I had when I finished this. Highly recommended!			"

												There's a kind of game that doesn't repeat itself.It's not bloated with grinding, nor trying to incentivize the player with microachievements and level-ups. It doesn't stroke your space-marine ego, and it doesn't boast lifelike graphics and physics. No, this game just wants to tell you a story and make you feel something.This is why I love Year Walk. It's atmospheric, clever, stylized, and steeped in folklore.You are a man attempting a Year Walk--a nighttime stroll through a supernatural forest to win a prophetic vision. It plays like a point-and-click minus the tedioum. There is no inventory, no dialogue trees, no rapid-fire click spaming to find objects of interest. Just exploration and a wealth of bite-sized puzzles, On three occasions, I've sat friends down to play the entire game while I watched over their shoulders. They were all spellbound. I say with certainty that Year Walk is worth your time.			"

												First off, I wanna say that this game is very interesting and beautifully made. I'm glad I bought it, and I'd suggest it to anyone interested in old world mythology. However, the plot was fairly uninvolved and I ended up finishing the entire game in an hour and a half by accident. I'm still impressed with the game, but I wish it was longer by half and the plot was either more or less in depth. As it is, you get some vague weirdness about what I guess is a secret affair at the beginning, which tries to explain your character's motives for going on a year walk and ends up just kinda falling flat. Honestly, I'd still recommend it though, if only for how truly unique it is.			"

												Part folktale, part mystery, part augmented reality, and entirely entriguing. Year Walk takes an ancient, nearly forgotten Swedish ritual and turns it into a really interesting way to share culture.			"

												A brilliant and beautiful little game. The puzzles are challenging but not alienating. the story (while relatively short) is easy enough to follow allowing the chance to immerse yourself in some truly fascinating lore and mythology. The art style is also absolutely stunning, I would recommend this game to anyone. :D			"

												9/10. A short but extremely satisfying game with excellent visuals and mood.Firstly, I loved the visual style of this game - the 2D illustrations are incredibly beautiful. I also loved the way 2D blended into 3D in terms of gameplay from a first-person perspective. While disorienting at first, I think that is intentional and it works well with the fact that the game itself blurs the lines of time and space.The Swedish folklore this game is based upon is rather enthralling too, and I greatly appreciated the little encyclopedia that works in-game. That you have to understand basic folklore to play the game is a wonderful approach.The puzzles are strange and challenging, but not so difficult as to discourage casual players. Also, the sound design is excellent and provides for a truly immersive experience. As is the secret mini-game after the first 'ending', which leads to the true ending.Despite being able to complete the whole game in only three hours, this was well worth the full price for me. And the game has really stuck with me as being a moving experience and work of art.			"

												[Game originally played on iOS]If you're looking for a review to determine if this is a game worthy of your time, I'll cut you the search: yes, it absolutely is. I'll get more into my thoughts on the game itself below.However.I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you own an iPhone or iPad, get that version instead.There are a lot of puzzles that make a lot more sense and that are a lot more clever with touch controls. There's no reason not to at least pick that version up first. The visuals are identical, it's a few bucks cheaper, and the controls are arguably better when actually using your fingers to swipe across the environment.As for the game itself, it's a stellar game. For such a short runtime, Year Walk shows an interesting world and builds a genuinely fascinating and creepy atmosphere. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and really compliment that atmosphere. The story is also really clever and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Much like the original Portal, it's short, sweet, and gets it's point across with no distractions. All killer, no filler.Absolutely pick this game up if it looks up your alley. Again, I'd urge you to try the iOS version first if you have that option available to you. If not, the PC release is absolutely fine, with only sometimes fiddly controls and a few surprises neutered in the process. I highly recommend Year Walk.			"

												Awesome game, it was a trip and a half to get through it all! Gameplay reminds me a lot of Myst, always pushing me to think outside of the box. Gorgeous art style, spooky atmosphere, and a really interesting hidden plotline - it really is a great game.The Huldra's section was really difficult for me since I'm partially tone deaf, so it'd be nice if there was a way to do that puzzle visually without having to use the hints, for players who have hearing problems. But with that in mind, I'd give it a 9/10, really great game!			"

												The price is right for Year Walk, which if by nothing else is justified in its unnerving lore, quality sound effects, and unconventional gameplay experience. I'm not usually one to recommend a casual game that requires pen & paper to complete, and some of the puzzles, while inventive, distracted from my enjoyment. Some of the game's achievements also border on gratuitous, again possibly taking away from your experience depending on why you're playing a game like this.On the positive side, Year Walk was surprisingly memorable for such a quick game (there's an achievement to complete it in under 20 minutes which is barely difficult) and has a minimalist world that the player will want to explore. There are so many things that tie in to subsequent playthroughs, assuming you are dedicated enough to find Year Walk's many secrets.7/10.			"

												Fantastic little game! I've recently been trying to experience as many horror/supernatural or even just eerie games that I can find and this one hit the spot. Left me craving more and even after you believe you've finished the core game theres some surprises left for us that make the experience that much more real and leaves you with a chill. Had to jot down some notes here and there which I haven't had to do for a game in a while (but I might just be getting old). You gotta' love Simogo for the amount of research they put into these games. It started out so serene too, I loved everything about that first encounter...			"

												Very engaging, albeit short experience. Year Walk is not really a horror game, despite the tags, although the ambience is creepy and there are a few scares, it's not too vicious. It's more of a puzzle game, with a very interesting story, which is only mostly revealed at the end of the game. Even then, it leaves room for interpretation.The puzzles are fun, they never left me thinking ""that was stupidly illogical"", nor ""that was stupidly easy"", like many puzzle games do, on occasion. And they manage to do this while being to some degree abstract, with few hints, which is admirable.The graphics are fantastic, in my opinion: beautiful art style, clean, and clear.Sound design is good, one puzzle relies entirely on sound, and is challenging but fair, so no complaints in this department.Story, like I said, I enjoyed it very much, open to interpretation, yet I wasn't left feeling cheated out of a satisfying end.The game also includes nordic folklore, which I found very interesting.The game is quite short, so you may want to pick it up on sale if you are averse to games with few hours in them.All in all, Year Walk is, in my opinion, a great game, deserving of the (currently) 87 metacritic score, as well as the 90%+ positive reviews.

The amount of detail put into it was thrilling and everything-- the music, the visuals, the details-- brought it together really well. I would definitely recommend this to lovers of creepy point-and-click games. Just remember to write stuff down!!			"

												This was a very quick little game I came across a bit over a year ago and beat it in one or two nights. I really enjoyed it for how short it was. The game was visually pleasing with a very interesting play style cleverly implemented to accommodate the artwork. It also built this incredible tension I was not expecting. Creepy audio, some disturbing imagery, and an uncertainty of what you would run into next. All this tied together with a simple but classic styled story made it memorable. The last song to play during the end-credits was awesome too; I still have in saved to my Spotify!			"

												Beaten - 2 hoursAn interesting and very artisticly cool take on Scandinavian (I think) mythos. A story that is told by discovery. You pan the camera left and right and and move in and out of scenes. There are some stumpers for puzzles, but for the most part, if you take some notes (no really) you should be able to make it through without too much help. The game also offers help if you are totally stumped.Good short experience.			"

												i bought this game in April.Saw one of the achievements : Year Walk on New Year's Eve.flash forward 8 monthsPlayed it again, unlocked several puzzles and got the Year Walk achievement as well.I am so glad that I didn't write a review as soon as the first Year Walk, because I believe that the real game is actually in the second time you Year Walk. So please, Year Walk a second time and you'll appreciate this game a lot more.The plot is fairly straightforward when you play it the first time, then when you re-play it (if you want) it will get rather confusing especially  when you opt to open the journal and get the knife with the initials of D.S  . The graphic is minimalistic yet beautiful. Kind of eerie/melancholic, simple but consistent.The sounds are great and well placed. When you hear nothing but the sound of your footsteps on snow, even when  the Hudra jump-scare scene where it just screech-snapped at you after singing so beautifully .Despite the short gameplay (there's even an achievement to glorify it), I personally think it's more than satisfying. This is actually the first game where I didn't wish it to be longer.The mystery is well thought to the point where an explanation will actually ruin the whole experience, specifically  after you open the journal and open the wooden box .This is a beautiful game, the atmosphere, the music, everything is in place for a great gaming experience.Now I'm off to Year Walk some more for the achievements.

The story is fantastic, and it's definitely worth a second playthrough.There's some dissagreement about whether this is a horror game or not.  It is not a traditional horror game.  I would say it has some horror elements (well implemented at that).  I like horror and adventure games, so this was a perfect fit for my tastes. It does have a very dark story as well.  I do not know whether to call it a horror game or not. I don't have that kind of authority.Would feed dead babies to a river horse again  9/10			"

There are 2 endings. You'll get a hint on how to do the second ending after the first. It involves the journal, that's all I'm going to say. It also involves looking at the map but you won't understand why until you finish the game first. It will tell you where to look. Trust me I had to look hard in the forum to figure it out so I'm making it easier here. Definately worth a play through.			"

												having now played trough the full game. I have to say this is a nice game with nice creepy visual and a fantasic complentery soundtrack and some turly great puzzles that I have not seen in a while this game is fun, but is a little less creepy when the scares are just loud nosies that pop out at you. So overall it is a good game with a few disapointing exacutions on the scares side.			"

												Not much replay value once you know the full ending, but a fun and interesting game nonetheless.The concept and art style are the biggest +s to this game, and the puzzles can be fun and challenging when they're not bizarrely obtuse, and hey, I learned something new from this game, so that's always a plus.I think it can fall short if you're buying it expecting more than what it is (a short puzzle game), but I came in entirely blind and I enjoyed it fairly well.

												[Game originally played on iOS]If you're looking for a review to determine if this is a game worthy of your time, I'll cut you the search: yes, it absolutely is. I'll get more into my thoughts on the game itself below.However.I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you own an iPhone or iPad, get that version instead.There are a lot of puzzles that make a lot more sense and that are a lot more clever with touch controls. There's no reason not to at least pick that version up first. The visuals are identical, it's a few bucks cheaper, and the controls are arguably better when actually using your fingers to swipe across the environment.As for the game itself, it's a stellar game. For such a short runtime, Year Walk shows an interesting world and builds a genuinely fascinating and creepy atmosphere. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous and really compliment that atmosphere. The story is also really clever and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Much like the original Portal, it's short, sweet, and gets it's point across with no distractions. All killer, no filler.Absolutely pick this game up if it looks up your alley. Again, I'd urge you to try the iOS version first if you have that option available to you. If not, the PC release is absolutely fine, with only sometimes fiddly controls and a few surprises neutered in the process. I highly recommend Year Walk.			"

												A brilliant and beautiful little game. The puzzles are challenging but not alienating. the story (while relatively short) is easy enough to follow allowing the chance to immerse yourself in some truly fascinating lore and mythology. The art style is also absolutely stunning, I would recommend this game to anyone. :D			"

												A cool and creepy game based on weird foreign legends and monsters.  It's pretty basic looking, just a flash based indie game.  But the puzzles are pretty good, the creepy parts of pretty creepy, the concept is pretty awesome, and the ending has a surprising depth that really made it one of the best game endings ever.  I got annoyingly stuck at a few parts, but that's puzzle/adventure games for you.  It's pretty short, so no more than $12 or so for this one.  But it's a solid game.			"

Year Walk - in 100 words:It begins just like a fable, but a dark one, with snow, surnatural beings and blood. In the middle of a Sweden forest, a man tries to catch a glimpse of his own future by year walking. What is it? The methods are unorthodox; the consequences are grim. In the end, nobody will survive this hubris. Fables are no more, they say. Video games killed them. Year Walk disagrees. It's an embodiment of things past that shall never be forgotten. The moral lesson will survive: some things are better left unknown. Year Walk is a reminder not to play God.Year Walk is......a game with a strong atmosphere and a gloomy mood. Jumpscares may occur, so be warned....forcing you to play at least twice to begin understanding the whole thing....relatively easy on the puzzle, and does not require a PhD in Braid-o-phily.Year Walk is not......a fast-paced game with guns and explosions. Everything is slow, even the walking....long enough. In fact, it is very short. Know what you are getting into before buying it....for those who hate reading and connecting the dots by themselves.

												Year Walk is, by all means, an incerdibly endearing game. The ambiance, graphics and music are absolutely immersive, and the folklore into which we are thrown is extremely interesting and really gets your curiosity going (well, if you enjoy lost and obscure folktales ands legends, which I do very much). The only shortcoming is the VERY short length of the game which turned out to be utterly disappointing, although a short game means you can do a lot of speedruns if you want to go for all the achievements.Overall a fantastic game, but more demo-like lengthwise (which cuts the fun short but does not spoil it at all) which is probably why the price is so low.

												Experience the strange, terrifying and alluring folkloric tradition of Year Walking through this short, stylized game. Follow a young mans journey through the Swedish wilderness to see his future, and maybe even change it. Solve puzzles, learn about the dark past of this land, and discover the fables which still wander these woods. Year Walk is a very short experience with little to no replayability but a beautiful soundtrack, compelling art direction and a very very unique story. Originally for the phone/tablet, this game is clearly meant to be played with a touch screen, but is still enjoyable on home computer. Pros: Without a doubt this games art is stunning and is what drew this reviewer in at first glance. As well, the music is quite enjoyable, and both music and art in tandem serve to make this game all the more creepy and mysterious. The puzzles in this game are fairly simple, but tough enough to give most pause. Nothing too difficult to be found here, probably a good game for those interested in puzzle based games but new to the style. As well, Year Walk has a very dark theme and deep story for those willing to dig a little bit. To get the full experience from this game you will need to be a gamer who enjoys the story just as much, if not more than, the gameplay. Year Walk is a point and click game, and that should tell you how much real action is to be found in this title. Luckily, Year Walk provides more than enough lore in its story to make it worth a run through or two. The addition of a lore book on the many creatures you’ll meet in this game is a wonderful addition. Gamers with a passion for folk lore will find this game a fantastic lesson in Swedish lore and a wonderful experience.Cons: As others have stated, this phone game is very short. For many this may cause pause and you may want to wait for a sale before picking this particular title up. It took this reviewer around four hours to completely 100% this title, including all achievements. As well, because Year Walk was originally a phone game it does play a little strangely with a mouse and keyboard. Finally, as a point and click puzzle game there is very little “action”. For those looking for a long lasting, difficult, action fueled experience you are going to be deeply disappointed. Overall, Year Walk falls flat in action, and length. However, it does pack a lot into the short hour long experience. The music and art unsettle as this very adult themed tale unravels before you. The lore and backstory are deeply interesting to those who like this sort of tale. The puzzles are soft but deep enough to cause pause and provide a satisfaction once completed. This game is definitely a niche title and will not be enjoyed by most. If you are someone looking for a short experience, enjoy puzzles, and like learning about lore and fantastical creatures, then Year Walk is the game for you. For what it is, I have to recommend it, but please keep in mind the short length and lack of real gameplay in this title. This is more of an experience than a game in most ways. "

												Year Walk makes an old tradition into a great puzzle solving ""horror"" game. The story is actually much deeper than it first seems and there is loads of symbolism. After your first playthrough, you will get more puzzles which will then open more story for you. The story was so interesting that I actually started to wonder if it was true (but sadly it seems it isn´t). I absolutely love the music in this game and the art style.

The game is not broken, it's not a horrible game, but it's not a game for me. Waste of money even on sale.***I wrote this review while feeling very critical and judgemental, for some reason this game was in my radar and it took a bashing. It's much better than I first interpreted it to be, clever twists and secrets hidden around an interesting story. I'm switching this review from negative to positive.			"
