												Finding Teddy is one of those games in which I walked in not expecting anything at all, and came out completely awed by what the developers were able to accomplish with this little adventure title. There's a saying that simplicity is the key to brilliance, and that completely applies here.  Everything from the story and gameplay to graphics and music is very minimal, but all come together to create something more magical than flashier games are able to achieve.  Our story is fairly basic, a little girl sleeps soundly in her room when a monstrous spider sneaks in through the wardrobe and steals her teddy bear.  Venturing into the wardrobe to a dream-like world full of dangerous creatures and beautiful landscapes, she must find the spider and rescue teddy.  That's all we are given to lead us through the game, and despite the very simple premise, it works.The mechanics is your basic adventure puzzle fair of finding items and using them on objects and creatures to further your progression through the game world. There is no written dialogue or item descriptions, so a bit of trial and error willl be needed for some puzzles.  Despite not having anything spelled out for you, there is a logic at play in specifically the music puzzles; as you slowly figure out the method, everything begins to make sense and the dream world in which you're lost doesn't seem quite as enigmatic as before. This unveiling is accomplished so deftly, it's difficult to explain without destroying the sense of discovery in figuring it out yourself, so I will just leave the point here.Musically, the soundscape is atmospherically ambient with subdued melodies that resonate an ethereal, dream-like quality. This complements the strange and mysterious game world and creates a base for the melodies in the music puzzles.Hand-made pixel graphics make up the world you explore.  Knowing that the artists designed every image pixel by pixel is awe inspiring.  The colorful palette and gorgeous visual style incorporates impressionistic geometrical elements that give off an otherworldly feel. Everything from the landscapes to character and creature designs are imaginatively conceived, with the final world featuring some of the most creative imagery I've seen from pixel graphics. And to think this game was developed in only 4 months time... I have very little to complain about as I feel the design is perfect for what it accomplishes.  Some may find the lack of instruction or direction to be frustrating, but I believe this was a design choice meant to enhance gameplay and impress upon the player a sense of being lost in a strange world. I came across a few bugs in which the game froze or crashed, but didn't seem to be able to recreate those situations after coming back to it later.  Outside of those few bugs, there's not much I consider at fault with the game. All said, I feel every element of Finding Teddy comes together so perfectly that it elevates the game to a digital work of art. $6.99 for 3+ hours of immense enjoyment seems very fair to me, although it has been featured in numerous bundles for a fraction of that cost and sees frequent sales.  Either way, if you are looking for a beautiful game with a simple yet unique take on the adventure genre, I highly recommend picking this one up.			"

I hesitate to recommend this, however the entire game is such a labour of love that I could not bring myself to press that Thumbs Down.This is a game that is almost worth your patience, and if you somehow make it through you'll find that it has a great ending to accompany its neat art style and solid sound direction.However, the game falls apart in the gameplay department.There is absolutely zero handholding in this game, which some might think to be a good thing. I do not think that myself.You click to move the unnamed protagonist to various points of interest on the screen and to navigate between screens, the core loop is simple. Find a place you can't get through yet, find the correct thing to open that passage and then go through that passage. The required items aren't even that much of a stretch, you get past the web of a giant spider by releasing ants into it to distract it, for example.However, there are two exceptions, one is small, the other gigantic.The smaller one is that you gain several companions over the course of your journey and they can help you with certain puzzles. The first time this happens you actually get a helpful arrow that explains this, but later times you're just left guessing whether you're missing the item or need to select your companions to help. There are about four times where this is needed over the course of the game though, so it's not that critical.What really slows down the progress in the game though, is the music note system.Now, I love the concept behind this, picking up clues from characters you meet to slowly learn a musical alphabet that you then use to convey messages to others. A great example of a moment where this works well is that you encounter a mole about halfway through the game, minding its own business but singing the notes D, I and G (spelling 'dig') as it's digging. Then, a few screens further, you find a sleeping mole. Reciting the DIG notes wakes up the mole, and causes it to dig a new passage for you to explore.Unfortunately many of the messages you encounter are audio-only, leaving you to match and then memorize the correct notes without necessarily knowing yet which letters they correspond to or what you might need the message for. At the start of the game when the music system is introduced it isn't even clear that they correspond to letters yet...I can imagine that some players love piecing this system together, but to me it felt clunky and detracting from the fun.If you feel like piecing together a challenge, sometimes not a very logical one, then this little adventure game might be a good fit for you. Don't say I didn't warn you though.			"

												Have you ever met a really pretty girl that you wanted to get to know better, but once you actually started talking to her you realised she was in fact bloody awful and all you wanted to do was get as far away from her as possible and never talk to her again? That's almost exactly what playing this game is like. I had really high hopes for it as I loved the art style and the trailers made it look fun and interesting, but playing it turned into a massive disappointment.You play as a little girl whose teddy has been kidnapped by a scary monster in the closest. You follow it through and find yourself transported to a strange world with odd creatures that will either help you or kill you depending on your interaction with them. Half of this interaction is done merely by giving them an item you've found at some point, while the other half comes in musical form as you sing notes to them. There are 26 notes in all, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet which, when played in the right order, will spell out a word or phrase pertinent to the situation and allow you pass. The trouble is, getting to grips with the musical aspects of the game is such an infuriating chore that it grinds any fun to a complete halt and kills any enthusiasm you may have otherwise had.There's no instructions given at any point, and aside from the spelling puzzles, no dialogue shared between characters. So the fact that the sounds are tied to letters is never expressly explained and leaves you with a massive amount of head scratching as you try to figure out what to do and where to do it. There is some attempt to teach the player this mechanic shortly after it starts, but it just felt too vague to make the connection the game wants you to make. Once you actually realise how it works it isn't entirely so bad for the rest of the game, but for me it was a huge misfire that rubbed me up the wrong way from the off then never won me back around. But even had this been handled better it still wouldn't have saved the game from the rest of its issues.It's absolutely riddled with bugs. My own personal list of problems includes losing my save data when I exited the game, losing an essential item from my inventory that meant I couldn't pass through a door, restarting the game, reaching the same door again, walking through it, then being sent back to the start before then being unable to click on an exit to go any further, I also had puzzles glitch and become impassable as well as some characters or items not responding when I clicked on them, and that's all on top of the terrible UI and hugely restrictive traversal (you can't move around freely, but rather can only click on exits or interactive objects within each screen). It's like the last 30 or 40 years of game design never happened, it's just all so shoddy and ill-conceived. I had to restart my game several times as a result of all these bugs and began to increasingly resent the game with each instance of me having to retrace my steps over and over due to its own faults. Some of the game's defenders will say it's so short (probably takes about an hour to complete the first time around) that it doesn't matter and you can easily get back to the same spot again pretty quickly, but that's a pretty p*ss poor argument and there's no excuse for having to restart any game from scratch due to its own technical failings. Once or twice is bad enough, but multiple times is just unforgivable incompetence.I really can't see how this has received so many positive reviews, as checking out the game's discussion board it mostly seems to be filled with people reporting bugs and looking for solutions. And looking up the achievement stats, as of time of writing, only 22% of players have actually finished the game, and fewer than 43% of players would appear to have even completed the first chapter... two years after its release! When not even half the people who play your incredibly short game can pass the first area then I think that can only be an indication not of bad players but of poor design.There's a good idea at the heart of this game, but it's so badly managed that I think most players are driven away by it. I would have loved it if these notes you sing were the entire language of the game, and as you learned new notes it would give you a greater range of vocabulary to solve problems. Maybe it could have played more along the lines of something like Scribblenauts where multiple solutions to a puzzle could be possible depending on how many notes/letters of the alphabet you had learned and how imaginative they could be with the problem. To me that seems like a greater refinement of the idea that still would have easily allowed the developers to maintain the artistic integrity of the core concept whilst also opening it up for greater possibilities. But, instead, it's just something that looks great but is actually pretty bad, a girl whose messages I'll be deleting and number I'll be blocking.			"

												As a young child losing something as seemingly trivial as a stuffed animal can be devastating. So imagine the shock of waking up in the middle of the night to see a monster climbing out of your wardrobe and making off with your teddy bear. Finding Teddy is the journey of a little girl off to reclaim what is most valuable to her, plunging headfirst into an uncanny dreamscape full of bizarre creatures and even stranger sounds in a lightweight point and click adventure.Navigating the world by simple presses to the edge of the screen, you travel though nonlinear levels collecting items and solving basic puzzles. Many of these revolve around forming odd musical messages, in a bit of a call back to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, by which you communicate with the inhabitants of the strange world you find yourself in. As a musician I personally found these fun to solve and more original than the simple ""bring object A to point B"" that otherwise make up the bulk of the puzzles, but it should be noted that those with less of an ear for music or are even tone deaf will likely find them infuriating, perhaps even impossible. This is not to say only musicians and the like will be able to enjoy the game, but I feel it is wroth mentioning for those that find it difficult to pick out distinct notes, as this is likely not something for you.Despite its initially dark appearance it is actually very sweet, with a charming cast and a fantastic ending that left me feeling warm and smiling through the credits. The pixel artstyle is quite lovely to look at despite a few jerky animations, and the soundtrack while generally just ambient noise is quite good when it decides to take more of a center role. The one thing that might turn people off is that it is very short, as I finished it in just under two and a half hours despite getting stuck at several areas. Veteran adventure game players will almost surely burn through it in even less, and aside from a few secret achievements there isn't any reason to return.If you are not turned away by the somewhat frustrating musical puzzles and brief playtime, I would definitely recommend Finding Teddy to any fan of classic adventure games. It wasn't the least what I expected, but turned into something I grew quite fond of over my brief tour and expect many will find a relaxing and welcome change of pace to most modern gaming fare			"

												A beautiful. if short, point and click adventure game that will win you over with its charm, and stump you with its puzzles. The game is ripe with gorgeous artwork and phenomenal music. Don't let the simple plot lure you away; Finding Teddy is every bit as wonderful as it is beautiful.			"

												Finding Teddy is a great cute little game, unfortunately a slew of glitches and poor design decisions makes me caution purchasing this game (ah, for want of a better scoring grade!)The good: The art in this game is beautiful and atmospheric, both when it comes to backgrounds and to characters. There is little in the way of dialogue, but well-directed cutscenes do a great job of telling the (admittedly rather simple) story line. The protagonist is a girl looking for her kidnapped teddy in a strange dreamscape of monsters and spiders (arachnophobes beware). She comes across as very competent, and the game never overly sexualizes her or belittles her for being a girl, which is a huge plus for me. If I had kids I could definitely see myself playing this game with them.The bad: The game is short, many of the high points are already given away in the trailer. Interface is somewhat lacking and difficult to navigate. New game+ switches to old art in animations. More damning, there being no option to save means it is easy to get stuck at some places in the game by advancing before solving puzzles vital to finishing the game. The inability to travel back to previous levels again means you can get stuck and be forced to replay the game from the start. This game requires a very good ear for pitch as most puzzles contains a step (or several) in which you must echo a sequence of high-pitched notes. This is a great gameplay element, but if you have less of an ear for music this game becomes a lot less enjoyable (this was the case for me) -- something that could easily be mitigated by giving players the option to show the letter-notes in every puzzle, and in any case ought to be better advertised before purchase. For the most part the music is great, but the high-pitched tunes can sometimes become a bit hard on your ear, which is a problem since the sound is too important to the solving of puzzles for turning the sound off for a bit to rest your ears to be an option.In sum, this is a beautiful but short game with some innovative gameplay thet should have seen more work on the bugs and bottlenecks I mentioned above. I look forward to more games from this studio when they've found their proper sea legs.			"

Background/StoryYou awaken in the middle of the night, only to find that your precious teddybear has been stolen by some monster in cupboard, so you set on a journey with haste to find your teddy and bring it home, on the way you discover marvelous things, uncover secrets, find hidden paths and make new unexpected friends.Finding teddy is a small, simple but cute adventure, point and click, puzzle game. It’s cleverly thought through, and while you at no point were stuck on a level without a clue how to get past it, the puzzles weren’t far too easy either, I think the devs did a good job balancing itSoundtrackFinding Teddy has a nice little soundtrack, even though it is limited to only a few tracks, I feel like those tracks managed to create an inspiring mood and a lust for adventure, just a shame they didn’t take the time to create a larger library of music since they did so good with everything elseAchievements and whatnots Aside from the main game content, and it’s limited world, this game had a lot of things to be done, and a lot of achievements to be gotten, compared to other games I think this game is fairly easy to be 100%’ed for anyone out there who might care, however to 100% this game may take several playthroughs (most people can do it in 2) as you randomly get in-game artwork while playing through the main story Controls and mechanicsAs stated previously this game is a point and click game, meaning you will be using your mouse for basically anything in this game, one of the mechanics in this game (if you can call it that) that I found really cool, is the fact that it uses various small melodies to unlocks paths and whatnots, you basically get a sheet of paper with 26 nodes, all representing a letter, and throughout the game you get small hints on messages that you have to carry back and forth in order to solve puzzles. So if you are having trouble hearing nodes, you might have a hard time finishing this gameAll in all I quite enjoyed this game, it took me about 3 hours to 100%, and then an extra hour for a last playthrough, it ran very smooth and lived up to my expectations, I give this an 8/10			"

The good side:The art, environment and story are cute.You can walk faster by clicking twice on your destination.The music related puzzles were somewhat original.Death sequences are great (and with almost no consequences).The last puzzle was ok.The bad side:It's short with almost no replay value (and mostly just for achievements).Many screens (about 40%, I counted) serve no purpose besides esthetic/ambience (or hidden fireflies, that unlock artworks). And those that do contain something never have more than one purpose.There's a bit too much backtracking (which is made worse by the previous point).One ""item"" is quite pointless and the related puzzle relies on an unexplained mechanic that you will use only once in the full game. (The cat, although a cute companion, will stay available all the time even though it's used only once, it was forcefully crammed in the puzzle you use it for and combining the pets is used only there.)Another puzzle uses unexplained and specific mechanics. (When you have to combine objects to get rid of the crocodile.)When trying to figure out the notes you hear, the background sounds will make them hard to discern (turning off sfx/music might help, I haven't tried). The notes will also be played in a loop with a quite short pause in between, which leaves only short intervals for you to try and reproduce them.The girl will sometimes stand in a place that will make it difficult to click on what you actually want. It's also difficult to click on your companions (it will open the inventory most of the time).Parts of the HUD should be displayed all the time without having to wait or click blindly, at least the button to access the music sheet. Also, switching from windowed to fullscreen is only available in the main menu.Some notes are too similar and hard to tell apart. (H and I, M and N, in particular.)Most of the puzzles were not fun or satisfying to solve.All in all, this game is quite disapointing. I was expecting much more from it.It lacks a lot of polish to make it at least enjoyable, even if short.The dev team congratulates itself in the credits about finishing the project in 4 months. I have to say that, sadly, it shows...			"

												I didn't find anything to engage me in this game until the very end, where it unveiled its first clever puzzle and a cute ending.  Prior to that you walk through empty passages until you reach a roadblock or an item.  If it's an item you pick it up, if it's a roadblock you use an item you picked up in order to gain passage.  Apart from the simplistic item using puzzles there's also a music system where you are either told the notes you'll need to play, or have to figure them out by ear.  One of those is very frustrating but I don't want to give too many spoilers and say which!I found that the choice to have no dialogue or flavour text of any kind (apart from musical notes spelling short messages) hurt the atmosphere.  I've entered this magical world and there's nothing to look at as there would be in other adventure games, so it's just there, empty and hollow and dull.			"

												I recommend this game on the following notion you are searching for a charming little game of a sweet simple and short story with puzzles that may impeed you, will never really quite challenge you. Seek elsewhere if you want a strong story, challenging puzzles, and something to play over a fair amount of period, this is like that of a children's book (of a slightly dark nature) made into a point and click adventure after all.As an adult however, it was a nice diversion that lasted roughly an hour.I do not recommend this to be played with a young small child on your first play through as there are segments that may trouble them, but a second play through where you know exactly what to do and where to go without ever failing/making a mistake could provide a nice experience for him or her.Fair warning, if you have trouble hearing musical tones, this game will prove troublesome. It's main puzzle is based on hearing them clearly, and though you can get past with just visuals, it's far more difficult. If you are the type that just wishes to experience a story, a visual guide does exist out there for you to use.The lovely artwork, from in game pixels to unlockable sketch art that is worth seeing even if you don't play it however. So if you can track that down on your own, do so.			"

												Finding Teddy caught my eye as it showed a strange world a young girl finds herself in after her teddy is taken by a strange creature. Point and click adventuring seemed like it would be a more relaxed pace of gaming after the more action intensive games I'd recently played. For the most part, this game seems a bit split on how things go. There are elements I really liked and others that made pressing on feel more of a chore than something I'm doing for enjoyment, but ultimately I feel the balance is a bit too much into the negative to really recommend the title.The pixel style graphics are charming in their own right and the colour usage seems pretty solid. The animations are mostly subtle but effective so I was very interested in what new sights I would discover. The audio is a bit mixed, as the various simple melodies that form part of the puzzles are interesting to hear sometimes but the actual background music felt too repetitive. The story is presented in a very minimal style - it's really just a tale of a girl seeking to reclaim her comfort in the form of her teddy and having to explore a strange unfamiliar world. There are some other story elements that creep into spoiler territory that are likewise effective without going into full cutscene mode for it all.The puzzles are a bit mixed. Some are pretty clever and did make me realise how much sense a solution made after I'd done it. The puzzle involving the crocodile is the perfect example, which made me think of the items I needed and how. Then you get others that don't flow nearly as well. The game also tries a unique approach with music based puzzles. Some of these work very well too but those are mostly the ones with actual visual clues for those that can't quite get the pitch right, but others rely on sound alone and this can result in some major trial and error as you try to figure out the correct pattern (and hoping you're in the right area that needs it too).The game isn't very big, where I clocked in at 1.6 hours for a playthrough. This doesn't take into account the new game plus the game apparently has or looking for any secrets. Unfortunately, what this does take into account is the lots and lots of running back and forth through familiar areas because sequential elements of certain puzzles are at opposite ends of winding paths you've already been through several times. Given that I was already backtracking a bit for things like picking up items I had previously missed and had to accept that as my own fault, the last thing I would want is to be forced by the game to do even more of that.

												Ultimately a bit of an unsatisfying game.  I gave up and started using a guide the moment the game expected me to match musical notes by ear against a note-to-alphabet cipher, and I did 8+ years of band in school + university.  I'm someone who is familiar with music, but tone matching is not something I'm good at doing without some effort and people without music experience are typically much worse.  Its a pain in the butt at first and becomes more obvious and easy as the game goes on but I just didn't want to deal with the hassle.  You have to use the music-to-note cipher to say simple phrases to creatures in the game, and then complex ones at the end very.  Its kind of weird because the game doesn't give you the whole alphabet cipher by the end and you ARE expected to use letters you dont know (you can sing them by clicking on their empty space on your cipher sheet).  I can see where from the developer side of things this makes sense, but from the player side its not so straightforward.  Its just not good game design and player confusion like this is something where point-and-click adventure games can suffer the most.Lets assume I didnt find the music-alphabet cipher to be a problem, and look at the rest of the game.  Unfortunately, its just not that great.  There's more or less no dialogue until the very end of the game.  The creatures you encounter serve no purpose except to kill you King's Quest style unless you use the correct item on them.  They aren't really characters at all, they're just roadblocks.  The puzzles aren't that meaningful either, being both limited in number and scope, and they dont really feel like they contribute to a complete package.The aesthetic is passable.  Graphics serve their purpose but dont amaze, and the music is a bit too light to be thematic or enjoyably ambient.  There's also a serious sound balance problem where the 'open inventory' sound is someting like 2 to 3 times as loud as the background music, causing some unfortunate earblasting.  Characters again, aren't characters.  Only the last encounter in the game has much depth or charm.  You also can't position yourself onscreen, only move to transitions, so a feature of the game where some onscreen invisible blobs have to be revealed by sonar mouseclicks gets more bothersome than needs be due to clicking on a transition and being unable to cancel moving to it.With the Steam guide leading me after my initial foray, I finished the game in 75 minutes.  Given that there is no dialogue or cutscenes to skip this would only be padded by exploring / headbanging against some of the puzzles, some of which I am certain would have been unintuitive without the external assistance.  Normal for the genre in some ways, but as many recent amazing games by Wadjet Eye and Daedalic have shown point-and-clicks dont have to be that way.  Anyway, my additional listed hours in the game was merely to collect the trading cards before uninstalling.  The game has very minor replay value, in the form of an NG+ with a memetic alternate ending themed after nyancat.  I wouldn't recommend this game, even on sale.  There's just not enough content present to justify a purchase even at a low price, and whats present is neither particularly inspiring, charming, or entertaining.  The credits say that the game was completed in just 4 months, but perhaps some additional time spent on the game would have made it more worthwhile. The game does contain failstates.  Most monsters in the game will kill the player while they are unsatisfied (colored grey), resulting in a reset to the moment immediately prior to the death and an unlocked achievement for dying in that way.  Deaths are not particularly gruesome aside from the one by the very first grey creature you encounter, but they don't really add much to the game as well and I would just as much prefer they not be there.

You have to solve small puzzles and also collect music notes to see the end of this game. The game has 3 Chapters. Also keep watching out for fireflies in the level you hear a tone ringing when you click with the mouse and if you click near it the tone will make more noise until you finally click on it. The game will take few hours at most to play through and part 2 is already planned. I think the game is cute in its own way and is really charming if you like Point and click like i do i see no problem if you want to buy this game.			"

												I write this having gotten through the majority of the game. I already started  over once when I learned there's fireflies you're supposed to catch, but there's no way of reloading old saves to go back for them. The final straw was meeting the final boss, but not having all the keys mapped out with, again, NO WAY of going back to get them. I don't know how someone could get through this without a walkthrough. I spent most of the time guessing which keys to press solely by experimentation and running back and forth. Clearer instructions and a manual save device would improve the game immensely.			"

Excellent! | Отлично!A cute little adventure game. As some other people saying it's a bit hard to understand what the F to do at the beginning, but when you finally get it - you will be unable to stop playing untill the game's finished. I've beaten it four times now and the ending is still makes me so ""H A P P Y"" ^_^ Strongly recommend, especially if you like adventure games.Милая маленькая приключенческая игрулина. Как многие говорят - по началу может быть не понятно что вообще делать, но потом, когда наконец ""дойдет"", от игры уже не оторвешься до самого конца. Я прошел игру четыре раза и концовка каждый раз делает меня таким ""С Ч А С Т Л И В Ы М"" ^_^ Настоятельно рекомендую, особенно тем, кто любит приключенческие игры.			"

												Well, Finding Teddy was a cute little game that was included in a bundle I bought a while back and finally got around to trying out. The story itself is cute/quaint, and the sort of tale you could expect to come from the mind of somebody's little daughter (or having been written for somebody's little daughter). That said, the strength of this game was definitely the puzzles, which incorporate music into riddle form fairly brilliantly. Once you realize what is happening, you wont have any real issues solving them, but learning them initially will take most people a bit of time, and you will need to pay attention in order for the final puzzle to become obvious. Outside of that, there are also objects you find that you will need to progress, much like every point and click game, which this is (albeit, done in a refreshingly different fashion).All told, this game probably took me about an hour and a half to finish, and there is replay value for the completonist. In fact, I get the sense that other things are unlocked in NG+ (unconfirmed by me personally).Anyway, I found this game to be a pleasant surprise and can easily recommend it.			"

												Finding Teddy is a delight and a surprise. It's a game that could easily languish as a hidden gem of the platform, but it's just as sure to be evangelized by those that play it. It's an easy game to love, particularly if you're a fan of point-and-click adventure. The story of a girl and her teddy bear may not seem like the must-play hit of the moment, but it has so much love to give. A little of your time isn't much to ask in return.Finding Teddy is a strange and wonderful trip inside a musical, poetic yet cruel, fable. As an adventure, it lacks some length and logic in its puzzles but as an overall experience, it's really worth it to spend a few hour between its strange locations and creatures.It’s a shame then that Finding Teddy is all too short, clocking in at less than a couple of hours. The story doesn’t outstay its welcome but it does leave the player wanting more. Like precious already out there, Finding Teddy is a delightfully original change of pace.For those who love pixel art, point'n click adventures and puzzle games, Finding Teddy is like a trip to Wonderland.

												A very cute game. I played this last year on my Android and loved it then, and this version is just as good, and includes bonus content and remastered backgrounds, which are unlocked after completing the game once. People with an ear for music will have an easier time with this game, but even those with no musical talent will be able to figure out the notes. The game is short, but that just makes it easier to play through the second time to see the new content and snag all of the achievements.			"

												Finding Teddy is a mercifully short, deeply mediocre game with no idea what it is doing, backed by a very strong aesthetic that makes its numerous faults more or less tolerable for the scant one and a half hour it takes to play through it as long as you don't kid yourself and get a walkthrough immediately.The game begins with the titular Teddy being taken away by some manner of monster in the unnamed girl's closet. Thus begins the quest to retrieve the stuffed toy and immediately problems with both the narrative and gameplay present themselves.From the moment controls are handed over to the player, nothing whatsoever is explained. Some random clicking around the screen will likely reveal the basic controls, and soon thereafter the deeply uninspired, vapid point-and-click gameplay becomes apparent. The rest of the game consists of finding the single thing in a screen which matters to the rest of the game and using the correct item collected from a previous screen to interact with it. Intermittently, sound puzzles present themselves and do as such things usually do, cause progress to grind to an absolute halt.Now in and of itself, the point-and-click gameplay isn't horrid, however it has several major flaws that pushes it from mildly obnoxious to outright annoying. It has no comprehension of ""quality of life"" improvements to gameplay, such as minimizing backtracking, the puzzles are more or less all either blindingly obvious or painfully obtuse, and the controls are minimal and surprisingly annoying.Even this could have been but a stumbling block, older games have certainly had all these problems and worse besides. However to compound all this, the story - such as it is - is frankly not even remotely as clever as it seemingly likes to think it is.It consists of essentially five segments, of which only three are actually relevant to the ""story"", and of those, one is the introduction, and the other is the very final scene. Of the meat of the game, two of three ""chapters"" are essentially completely pointless. They add nothing, not even contributing in any real sense to an ""Alice in Wonderland"" atmosphere, because the insipid puzzles and the half-random, incoherent design ruin any such attempts. The attempt at purely environmental storytelling is in a sense admirable, but that still requires there to be an actual story! You cannot simply string together elements and pretend it makes sense!Additionally, the finale completely breaks with its own thematics and mood. The aesthetics and the progression through the environments had a steady darkening of tone, and the brutal deaths the unnamed protagonist might suffer during the game imply that the otherworld she travels through is a fundamentally hostile and dangerous place inhabited by enigmatic and unnatural creatures that make no attempts to communicate. Yet the final puzzle has more in common with a quaint children's picturebook than what the game was seemingly trying to be.The only verdict I can give is that the developers had no idea what they were actually trying to do, with their complete failure to understand how narrative structure and adventure game mechanics should actually work.Still. While incredibly flawed, it is not a bad purchase if the price is hanging around a single euro. If nothing else, the art itself is rather well done.			"

												Meh!It took a very small team a very short time to make this very small game, and it shows. It might hide behind being retro styled, but it still feels a bit sloppy. I don't mind the retro graphics at all, I have been gaming since 1984, so the retro hits my nostalgic heart. What doesn't though, is the sloppy animations, controls and lack of creativity. Some of you might find this ""musical"" aspect new and refreshing, but it has been done before, and IMO it has been done a lot better. ""Loom"" is a game that comes to mind when playing this, and even though it is a very long time since I've played that I remember how much more fun I had in that game than here.The game itself is a point & click like style adventure game where nobody holds your hand at all (not that it is needed). There is very little explanation of what is going on and how to play the game. It is mostly hidden in some vague clues here and there. For the game itself that doesn't matter much. Most will find out how it works quite easily, and the puzzles you need to solve is also quite easy. Well, at least if you have played a fair share of similar games or point & click adventures in general. It shouldn't take much more than an hour or two on the first playthrough, but if you collect achievements you need to play through it at least twice. I encourage you to use an achievement guide though as some of them are very hard to figure out without any guidance.There is very little going on in this game, and even less to do. This whole game has less content than most first chapters in any other adventure game I've played. That being said, this game has a ""to be continued"" in the end, so I guess this is a first chapter too. I just wish that they just made the whole game in one, then maybe it would have a little more meat.Even though the game in itself is not THAT bad and is built on a good idea (just not done well) I don't feel it is worth its asking price of $6.99 (at the moment of this review). Many might enjoy it and find it original (especially if you haven't played ""Loom"" or similar games) and many won't mind it being short, so don't base your decision on this review alone. I got it dirt cheap in a bundle and would recommend to look for a deal for this one if you are deciding on getting it.My thumbs down is based on what you get for full price, for half the price I'd thumb it up.5/10HAPPY GAMING!

												Whoa - such an artistic indie game as you've never seen before. The graphics are quite amazing.The trees have twisted branches and weird roots in the ground, the backgrounds are multicolored, everything well designed and high detailed. An unique look and feel. I was just taking screenshots all the time.Finding Teddy is a simple sidescroller and a point-and -click adventure. The story is easy told: You are a young girl. Oneday a big spider rob your teddy and you try to regain it. Memorize all tunes you hear around and then you can talk with some of the creatures. The puzzles mainly concentrate on learning musique notes like the ABC. You can use a tonescale to play literally words to NPCs. Great idea! Unfortunately the game is quite easy and also very short. Sometimes you get lost in the labrinth of tunnels and crossings but a playthrough will take about just a hour. And to be honestly these achievements are really silly. You must die of a spider, crocodile, snake, queen bee, etc. Then it's called ""spidered"", ""crocodiled"", ""snaked"" or ""beed"" ... hahaha. I wonder why I can't get ""vultured"", ""flamingod"", or ""frogged""?			"

												Finding Teddy is a pixel art point and click adventure puzzle game of musical proportions, It's like reading a good book before bedtime.The Good:+ Concept behind the puzzles is original+ Soundtrack+ ChallengingThe Bad:- Cannot adjust in game music, it's either on or off- It's not readily apparent how some of the puzzles work- In the 'About the Game' summary it says there are no dialogs in this game. That's not entirely true as the final puzzles have you in a dialog with the antagonist of the game. Just a pet peeve.This is a game taken back to it's roots, there are no boxes and boxes of dialog to click through to tell the story as the story itself is pretty self explanatory. Immerse yourself in a world knowing nothing about what your objective is or how things work, you will need to click and observe, a lot. Some puzzles are hidden but most rely on an alphabetical musical scale, therein lies my problem, you pretty much have to mute the game's score to hear the puzzle music which sort of kills the immersion. All in all (after I was clued in to how the puzzles worked) I found Finding Teddy to be quite a relaxing take-your-time puzzler. 7/10			"

												A cute, little point and click adventure, with somewhat simple but fitting and nice-looking pixelated graphics, and nice, calm minimalistic background music. The game has some minor faults that unfortunately detract from what could have been a better experience.A lot of the riddles are tied to solving words and sentences by pushing the right notes/letters. My using a ""/"" is because the letters are shaped like notes, i.e. the font resembles musical notes. Although the letters are pretty enough (for the graphical style) and creatively done, they also have the drawback of confusing the player as to what letter the note is supposed to resemble.Example: You're in progress of solving a riddle and it's nigh impossible to distiguish what is letter ""e"" from letter ""t"" because the ""notey"" font doesn't quite resemble a clear ""e"" or ""t"", causing you many times to press the wrong letter and having to try over and over until you get it right. Also, if you press the buttons to quick, the game will not register it, you have to take your time and wait for the game to ""catch on"" sometimes, registering the correct letters/notes. This makes some of the riddles frustrating for all the wrong reasons; it's not because you don't understand what the riddle is, and how you might solve it, it's because you are not able to distinguish the letters from each other.I certainly don't want to slaughter the game, because I find the execution okay, but it needs some patching/cleaning up. If I have to recommend or not recommend it, I would say you could get more value for your money by buying another point and click adventure game, but give it a try if you're curious.Kudos to the developer for trying something new.

												I personally do not like point and clicks and this didn't change my mind. The game is super slow paced and it has a lot of tedious backtracking in order to complete really simple and obvious grab-the-new-item-you-got-and-give-it-to-the-enemy-you-just-saw"" ""puzzles"". The game has a musical note representation of the alphabet that you use to talk to the characters you find. But the problem is that when characters talk you can only hear the notes played, and you cannot see the actual notes. And so you have to use your music note book and try to match the notes they are playing by using trial and error. You can spend about 5 minutes trying to figure out which of the 26 notes he is playing. And that is just to figure out what letter he is saying. Often times he is saying a 4-6 letter word. And so you can spend up to 20 minutes trying to figure out just what the hell the character is trying to say. And then, after all that work you find out the ""puzzle"" is that he is saying ""Happy"". HMMM maybe I'll go play that ""happy"" song to the guy I found crying. So then you spend a good minute or so slowly walking ALL the way back to the guy you previous found, and you play him the notes that spell ""Happy"". Wow, what a top notch puzzle that was. Definitely worth that 15-20min I spend trying to figure that out.Point is, these puzzles are barely puzzles and they are so obvious it does not feel satisfying to figure out. Majority of the game is padded out with sequences like that in which you have to figure out what the noises that characters make mean, and with the tedious backtracking. Overall there was barely a story, the puzzles were so straightforward they felt pointless, and the tedious backtracking will surely make you want to uninstall the game.To its credit the game does have really nice ambient music and a really great pixel art style, but the gameplay just didn't do it for me. I was ready to quit when I noticed that it said I was 70% done, after about 1 hour of gameplay...and so I proceeded to finish this really tedious yet short game.FINAL THOUGHTS:PROS:- Art and Style.- Ambient musicCONS:-Pointless puzzles-Tedious backtracking-Forgettable characters and story-Very obnoxious music note alphabet puzzle mechanic.OVERALL: 5/10			"

All the puzzles are pretty straightforward, although the music puzzles are slighty more challenging. There is no spoken dialog, and essentially no text either.  The audio is pretty good, with decently interesting and sometimes creepy background music, and minimalist sound effects.  I only got stuck twice, once because of an interface problem.  My four-year-old son was actually able to complete a decent chunk of this game without me, to give you an idea of how simple it is.  Still, not terrible by any means, just don't expect a lot.			"

Confuses its target audience and is fit for neither younger nor older players.This minimalist point-and-click adventure lies outright. Finding Teddy is certainly not textless. The game begins with an incredibly simple item interface, boiling everything down to single iOS clicks. Because of how paired-down the interface is, solving puzzles is painfully easy since one never happens upon enough items and roadblocks to have to even consider the question posed. Its cute graphics and simple puzzles could make the game work for a younger player, but the game shortly introduces a system of musical notes. A player must be able to identify different notes (inconsistently) by ear or symbol.   A brief analysis of the notes shows that they represent the English alphabet and are used to spell words.  This would make the game decidedly unfit to a player unable to read.   The hardest part of the game is locating unnecessary hidden objects throughout, that are never once referenced within the game and are only used to unlock concept art. Even then if a player knows how to look for them it is more a matter of trial and error than an invigorating exercise.While cute, it is hard to recommend the game. It is too easy for anyone who could manage its music system and too hard for anyone who is too young to be able to.			"

												The game is a very cute, pixel style game with a female child as the protagonist. It's a basic point and click game, but there are options which you can click which *gulp* actually kill you! There is a puzzle aspect to this game, where you have to sing to some of the creatures as the items you have collected don't help you interact with them. I found it very difficult as I wasn't sure what the singing was about, but they are actually the 26 letters of the alphabet. Some of the ""songs"" are words spelt out using the musical notes, which can get a bit frustrating if you aren't sure which is which. With a bit of patience you can work them out, and then press them in the right order. It sounds tedious, but I actually like this aspect of the game, it brought a bit more thinking into it rather than just giving people items you've found to solve the puzzles. Let's face it, just picking up stuff and giving them to people can get a bit boring after a while. At least this gave it a bit more bite. Overall, really loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a pixel-y point and click but with a bit more brainwork involved. Would not recommend if you have Arachnophobia. "

												Very strange and mysterious point and click with a very charming pixel art and somewhat smooth animations. Even though it's fairly short and very linear it still provides you with a decent story of a girl who had her teddy bear stolen by a giant spider which came from her closet, through some kind of dimension or world other than our own, most of us knows how it feels like when loosing a toy we really liked when we were young. That is the goal of the game, to find Teddy. The game doesn't really present you with any actual puzzles, instead you have to just find the necessary object in order to use on a certain place in order to proceed. Other than that, Finding Teddy relies on on some sort of music riddles, in which the notes are represented and represent a letter of the alphabet and by playing those notes you communicate with the creatures from this weird dimension of sorts. At first Finding Teddy might look and feel like a weird and dark game where a child is lost, specially if you end up getting yourself killed often, but by the end you realize it's all about about friendship and helping others out.

												Very strange and mysterious point and click with a very charming pixel art and somewhat smooth animations. Even though it's fairly short and very linear it still provides you with a decent story of a girl who had her teddy bear stolen by a giant spider which came from her closet, through some kind of dimension or world other than our own, most of us knows how it feels like when loosing a toy we really liked when we were young. That is the goal of the game, to find Teddy. The game doesn't really present you with any actual puzzles, instead you have to just find the necessary object in order to use on a certain place in order to proceed. Other than that, Finding Teddy relies on on some sort of music riddles, in which the notes are represented and represent a letter of the alphabet and by playing those notes you communicate with the creatures from this weird dimension of sorts. At first Finding Teddy might look and feel like a weird and dark game where a child is lost, specially if you end up getting yourself killed often, but by the end you realize it's all about about friendship and helping others out. It's certainly not something I can safely recommend for everyone but considering it's fairly short, I'd say to give it a try if you have some time to burn and want to know if this is anything up your alley.

												A heartwarming tale of a little girl's journey to find her Teddy Bear.  Finding Teddy is a  simple point and click game involving some puzzle solving.  To be honest, I had to play this game using the walkthrough for the first half, as nothing is really explained  gameplay wise throughout the game. (I guess it's to add to the challenge, idk). Once you get the hang of the notes and type of puzzles, it becomes easier. It's a great little game to play casually and doesn't require too much of your time (or effort, depending if you use the walkthrough or not). So if you like point and click puzzle games, this is a great game to add to your collection.			"

												The story is OK ( despite not really having any dialogues at all ), the graphics are fine and the music is good. There's alot of CON's though in my opinion.-When you click a note sometimes it clicks through the window and do an action instead.-Sometimes you select 2 notes at once.-Sometimes it's really hard to click on a door or an item because your character is standing just next to it.-The Newgame+ mode has a very apparent graphical glitch, I can't explain it here because it would be a spoiler.It's all those little things that made the game annoying to play through. It's probably because it's an iphone port but oh well. That game can be completed in under 2 hours. I cannot recommend this game due to those glitches being frustrating.			"

												Part of me would just like to let this game go unreviewed, but, apparently, that part has been stifled and gagged by the other part writing this review. And I guess that's a proper diagram for how this game makes me feel: Split down the middle. Having just recently (re)played Loom, I could draw the obvious parallel there. But Loom A) didn't have an inventory system and B) only used 8 notes in a way that forced you to learn the spells along with Bobbin. Yes, it may be nitpicky for me to slam the inventory system and (mostly unused) music notes in this game, but a majority of it was unnecessary. Finding Teddy gives the player an alphabet with which to ""communicate"" with the world and get real feedback from it sometimes. You've already given the player a voice and immersed them into the experience. Why cluttler it up with items and allies? If the inventory was simplified or even removed (and absolutely scrap the cat and the fly. They're cute, but only perform two or three tasks the whole game), leaving only the alphabet, the game would have been so much more intuitive. Instead of hopelessly using every item in your inventory on every seemingly interactive thing in the game (in ADDITION to typing musical messages at them, or maybe using the cat or maybe using the fly), the player would have nothing but their words. It's a welcome limitation.Actually, let's expand on that: The whole experience feels like a game that could be strictly text interactions, but has inventory items and allies shoe horned in. Instead of giving the text-based genre new life, it just causes a loss in momentum when you have to open your inventory on every screen. It causes the game to fall flat by having too many options. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game. But I feel like text based games and point and click adventures are most rewarding when you hit on those ""Ah Ha!"" moments, of which this game has very few *because* of its varied mechanics. I do ultimately recommend it, however simply because of the graphics and ambient music. It's too bad that it's an insult to your visual and music talents when the core mechanics are convoluted and sometimes frustrating. No spoilers, but I wanted the whole game to be just like the ending. Hell, the ending itself could have gone on a lot longer. Adventure games are all about using your key mechanics to keep the player forgetting that they're actually playing a game. And it felt like the ending put me in that immersive stranglehold only to let me go after a short time.Final word: Never leave your player wanting to be strangled more. Let's hope the sequel brings out more of the positive aspects of this game and reduces the detritus.			"

The story is actually pretty good and is explained entirely by your actions and context. I found the gameplay frustrating and a little annoying most of the time, with some parts of it just not feeling intuitive at all.

												A rather neat and pretty decently-designed point-and-click adventure.  The solutions to puzzles are fairly straightforward, as are the achievements (which can be completed rather reasonably).A relatively short game but this means that you should have time left over to explore the game's new-game-plus features -- including an easier way to find the collectibles and an alternative ending clued in by one of the NPCs.The story is very atmospheric, with some horror elements, but challenges the usual association of antipathy with the grotesque -- just because something's ugly and scary-looking may not mean that it hates you and means you harm.  But you must figure out how to communicate with it, and what to say to it.The game also has a distinctive way of ""communicating"" -- a ""musicom"" that lets you type out a message letter by letter using musical tones.  It's fun to use.Apparently the musicom also features in this game's sequel, Finding Teddy 2.  And this game does have a scene at the end that ties into FT2.  FT2 is a metroidvania, though, and I'm even more excited about that game.(Disclosure: I bought this game on the Humble Store, while it was discounted.)			"

												Finding Teddy was an absolutely wonderful surprise. I had kept it on backlog for quite some time, expecting it to be a plain ol’ indie retro 2D platformer. In reality, it is a point & click adventure with a light emphasis on music. The art style is extremely pleasing to look at and the sound is cute but can get a bit annoying at points. One of my favorite parts however, is that Finding Teddy does not suffer from the usual Point & Click trope of being infuriatingly difficult to navigate.The game is short and sweet, perfect for a nice afternoon adventure. It’s really refreshing to find a great story that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome.			"

												Finding Teddy reminded me of Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP. It's a point-and-click adventure, it's about the same length (just a couple of hours) and it has an amazing artstyle (even though Sword & Sworcery is just a tad more detailed). It's nicely animated, has a cute story and an unique way of solving puzzles, which rely mostly on sound. So you need a good ear to figure out how to imitate some of the tunes in it. After a while you'll figure out that the musical puzzles use a certain system. Once you figured that out the game will become a whole lot easier, believe me. I was impressed by the fact that the game was created in just a few months time. I have deep respect for that, because it's a polished game as far as I can tell.Supposedly, there's also a New Game+, which should (could ?) give you a different ending and allows you to use a colored girl (instead of black and white) or use a mask that allows you find the fireflies hidden around the levels. I didn't feel like playing it a second time, but at least it's extra content.Finding Teddy is a fine game, a game more people should play.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Finding Teddy is a rather average 2-D pixel adventure game.  The most notable gameplay feature of it is it's primary puzzle-solving gimmick, which may take you a while to catch onto, and discussing it much is a spoiler since this is a short game at around 2-3 hours long.The most interesting part of Finding Teddy for me are the character deaths.  There are various points where a failed puzzle solving attempt will result in an NPC killing the main character and they are effectively unsettling.  It's a good use of the disparity between the game's visuals and your expectations of what a failed puzzle will bring.  I recommend anyone playing through the game to try to trigger them, especially since dying has little negative impact on progression.As for the rest of the game, it just didn't pull me in.  The puzzles, locations, characters, and so on kind of washed over me and weren't particularly memorable or brought me much enjoyment.  Not a bad game, but I only finished it because I though the deaths scenes were interesting and  I wanted to see how the game wrapped up.  I don't think I would've completed it if were much longer since it had a tenuous grip on my attention.  A thumbs-down, but not a wholly negative review and if you're interested in puzzle games and can grab this in a bundle or on the cheap, it's probably worth an install.			"

												Finding Teddy is a cute pixelated point and click game. The objective is quite simple: Find your missing Teddybear. Just like its premise, the game is very innocent and charming, though you'd be surprised by how eerie it is. The music and art helps to set the tone of the game. It's very atmospheric and calming but also, at times, a little haunting. The core of the gameplay is the puzzles which mostly revolve around music. No fear, if you do not have a  musical ear, you will after trial and error, and with accute observation, figure out the mecanics of the game and how to solve the puzzles and riddles.It took me around 4 hours to complete and 100% the game. It might take less or more for some. I'd recommend picking up this game. It has enough charm and character for players who enjoy point and click adventures. It's a simple game to play that really makes you happy at the end of it ^w^bMy only complaint is that it was too short and left me wanting to explore more the strange land in which this little girl finds herself. And the puzzles might be a little too easy for some or irritating for others. If you are looking for a challenging game with long gameplay and replayability, this isn't for you then :PIt's more of a wind downed version of a game like Limbo with less traumatic deaths or creepy ambiance. It's simple, charming and adorable:Enjoy the game ~			"

There isn't much I don't love about this game.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=lovedGame design: 4/5  It's not a complex game, it works great, it just uses the mouse and what more do you need?  However, the game doesn't feel 100% finished yet.  There are some animation glitches, full screen still doesn't work, and pixel hunting for fairies sucks, but these are some picky complaints. Tone: 5/5 Simple and classic.  Gorgeous artwork, involving audio atmosphere, cute story, and an enjoyable learning curve. I've been sucked in. Personal skew: 5/5  Clearly I'm a little biased, but that's because I've enjoyed playing the game.  There are many similar games to this in Steamland, and I enjoy most of them.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Finding Teddy. It’s Too Obtuse To Be Fun.Genre: 2D Point & Click Puzzle Game.Developed & Published by: Storybird & LookAtMyGame, Plug In Digital.Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsFinding Teddy is a simple point-and-click game from a new developer. Featuring a 2D plane with rich pixelart and a musically inclined theme similar to a previous game that I’ve reviewed. Your teddy bear has been stolen so you’re going through another world, trying to get him back. That’s pretty much it, there really isn’t much to the story and the other “characters” don’t do or say anything of significance. I know they intentionally wanted to craft a game without dialogue, but there’s a lack of narrative that I can’t ignore.The main mechanic is a lot of simple inventory puzzles. Find an item, give it a creature/thing for another item and keep going until you reach the end of the level. All the while, you’re being sung to by creatures and walls. Which you’re supposed to figure out that the notes are actually letters from the english alphabet. But the game doesn’t really clue you in and the notes look so alien that I didn’t figure it out until a guide clued me in. Even if I was willing to let go of this complaint, it’s not that fun a mechanic. It’s more annoying as you try to match the notes in the right order to progress through the game but there’s a lack of feedback as to whether you’re doing it correctly. Far too many of the puzzles are too obtuse to figure out, with clues too far and few between. There’s no real hint to what each item does and I had to use a guide to get through at least 50% of the game. I’m not the greatest puzzler on the earth but even for me that’s pretty bad. While I can’t fault a game for my incompetency, the obtuseness of the game with the rather meager puzzles and story can be faulted.  PC Settings (Or lack thereof)There is exactly one thing you can change in Finding Teddy: fullscreen on or off. Nothing else can be changed. There aren’t any .ini files that I could find either. It did run well during my playthrough but for such a short game, I do kinda expect that to be the case. Soundtrack is simply ok, not all that interesting or engaging to listen to. There’s also the other issue that the sound effects are too quiet over the louder soundtrack. Which would be easily solved if audio sliders had been put in but well, that didn’t happen. Even more odd is that there’s a lack of audio feedback. When you click on objects or move around, there’s nothing to really back up that you did that. It bothered me the entire while during my playthrough. Final ThoughtsFor a scant couple of hours, Finding Teddy is merely ok, not all that special. The lack of audio-feedback, the obtuse UI and puzzle design can be far more aggravating than I think it’s worth. I’m sure for the devs it was a great starting point and it’s got lovely pixelart to look at. But I just didn’t really enjoy myself with it, not helped by the constant need to refer to a guide in order to finish the game. All that combined with a minimal story and I'm finding it difficult to recommend Finding Teddy. Read this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Finding Teddy is a short game about a little girl trying to find her teddy bear in Narnia. The music is nice but overpowers the tones you need to listen to so you might mute it. Options in game are very limited, but this doesn't take away too much from the game.Pros:-Pleasant story-Interesting idea to have musical notes be letters-The art style works well for the game-Good ambient musicCons:-Had to mute music for the first playthrough so I could listen to more important things-Clicking is wonky (Want to click the bug following you? Nope, you're going back to the last room you were in.)-All artwork achievement gets bugged sometimes (If you have all 23 artworks and dont have the achievement, create and new game, go to Narnia, then go a screen to the left or right, it should say you got the achievement)Not worth it at full price, but pick it up if it goes on sale for 75% or more.

												Finding Teddy is a simple point & click videogame that feature a very beautiful pixel art and a short story. The game is a strait forward, and can be finished in less than 2 hours. The art style make it seems like early platform games that was released in the late 80s and early 90s.The art and nostalgic feeling you can get from the game is enough for the price. There is little repayable value. It has hidden treasures and steam achievements that were put by the developers for those who want to have a 2nd try in the game.If you want to spend an easy relaxing artistic hour of videogame and pixel art, look no further. I recommend this game. "

												Short and sweet. The art is very beautiful. The story is ambiguous, so each person may get a different interpretation upon completion. The music and sound is used in a way that is integral to the story was something of interest to me.Although I have never played many point and click games, I ended up really liking Finding Teddy. I got really hooked by the second half of the game, getting more and more excited as I got closer to the ending. If you like a game that is thoughtful in its design and has clever story telling, then this is the game for you. However, there is a bit a patience needed, for the game doesn't hold your hand at all and you are left to explore and figure out the world on your own. If you aren't willing to take the time to figure out all the puzzles, then steer clear of this title.Overall, a great game that I am glad is in my library!			"

												""Finding Teddy"" is a simple-looking adventure game that builds on atmosphere, a retro-look and solving some puzzles.In it you play a little girl who is stolen her beloved teddy bear. In order to get it back she enters a strange world through her closet.First of all: It is quite a short game. Don't expect to be occupied or entertained for hours.Also the amount of information you get is very limited (if any), you gotta figure out a lot by yourself (there's no text speech or something).The variety of actions you can make is also limited: You can run from one end or object to another, collect a few relevant objects and solve puzzles mostly by singing ""songs"" of this strange world (I don't spoil but let's just say that the music notes look quite familiar). Personally I think the music idea is very original and sweet.The story is as simple as it gets (I already told it). And as you progress the story won't really develope. So it's more about exploring places and enjoying the atmospheric environment.The pixel graphic is very nice to look at, often very colourful and pretty.The soundtrack does not contain sound effects, it only builds on music which gives the game a special touch.Overall: I recommend the game because it was a nice short experience but I won't scream ""Play it!"" in your face. If you enjoy adventures where you get much more to do and don't like it otherwise, then ""Finding Teddy"" might not be something for you. Right now, the normal price is 6,99 € but I recommend to wait for an opportunity to save money (like through a discount offer or something).And when the announced sequel will be published, personally I'd like to check that out, too.

												Amusing diversion that doesn't overstay its welcome. You a play a girl whose teddy bear has been stolen by a giant spider that lives in some alternate dimension within the closet. The game employs simple point and click gameplay with a usage of an audio cue gimmick for several of the puzzles (see for yourself). The game has a very appealing pixelated art that appeals to me, reminiscent of Cave Story. Short game (~2 hrs for both first run and new game+ for wrapping up extras).			"

												A short but beautiful and warm-hearted puzzle adventure game about a little girl seeking her Teddy bear in a magical land. The game has very simple mouse-based controls which mostly focus on some simple item puzzles and a slightly more complex music mechanic which is fun to use, very faintly reminiscent of Loom. A great way to pass an evening, though you need to listen carefully so play when there isn't a lot of background noise.			"

												This game is adorable. Although its just involves clicking, the puzzles are great. This game is a little vague about the main way to solve puzzles but when you figure it out you'll be smiling the entire time. The scenery (different art aspects) and music is really what makes this game wonderful. Plus, the story is cute as can be. I loved this game.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Finding Teddy. It’s Too Obtuse To Be Fun.Genre: 2D Point & Click Puzzle Game.Developed & Published by: Storybird & LookAtMyGame, Plug In Digital.Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Business Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsFinding Teddy is a simple point-and-click game from a new developer. Featuring a 2D plane with rich pixelart and a musically inclined theme similar to a previous game that I’ve reviewed. Your teddy bear has been stolen so you’re going through another world, trying to get him back. That’s pretty much it, there really isn’t much to the story and the other “characters” don’t do or say anything of significance. I know they intentionally wanted to craft a game without dialogue, but there’s a lack of narrative that I can’t ignore.The main mechanic is a lot of simple inventory puzzles. Find an item, give it a creature/thing for another item and keep going until you reach the end of the level. All the while, you’re being sung to by creatures and walls. Which you’re supposed to figure out that the notes are actually letters from the english alphabet. But the game doesn’t really clue you in and the notes look so alien that I didn’t figure it out until a guide clued me in. Even if I was willing to let go of this complaint, it’s not that fun a mechanic. It’s more annoying as you try to match the notes in the right order to progress through the game but there’s a lack of feedback as to whether you’re doing it correctly. Far too many of the puzzles are too obtuse to figure out, with clues too far and few between. There’s no real hint to what each item does and I had to use a guide to get through at least 50% of the game. I’m not the greatest puzzler on the earth but even for me that’s pretty bad. While I can’t fault a game for my incompetency, the obtuseness of the game with the rather meager puzzles and story can be faulted.  PC Settings (Or lack thereof)There is exactly one thing you can change in Finding Teddy: fullscreen on or off. Nothing else can be changed. There aren’t any .ini files that I could find either. It did run well during my playthrough but for such a short game, I do kinda expect that to be the case. Soundtrack is simply ok, not all that interesting or engaging to listen to. There’s also the other issue that the sound effects are too quiet over the louder soundtrack. Which would be easily solved if audio sliders had been put in but well, that didn’t happen. Even more odd is that there’s a lack of audio feedback. When you click on objects or move around, there’s nothing to really back up that you did that. It bothered me the entire while during my playthrough. Final ThoughtsFor a scant couple of hours, Finding Teddy is merely ok, not all that special. The lack of audio-feedback, the obtuse UI and puzzle design can be far more aggravating than I think it’s worth. I’m sure for the devs it was a great starting point and it’s got lovely pixelart to look at. But I just didn’t really enjoy myself with it, not helped by the constant need to refer to a guide in order to finish the game. All that combined with a minimal story and I'm finding it difficult to recommend Finding Teddy. Read this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												This game is hard to categorize/rate. On one hand it is very pretty, sounds good, does its job fine, has a nice little message, it is short and sweet and it kind of clever for such a small development time. On the other hand it is kind of unforgiving for anyone without any musical knowledge. But even if it kept the visual aid the whole time, it still kind of falls on the trope of trying everything with everything else that most point and click games have; and it becomes kind of impossible without a guide.Well, if it is your cup of tea go for it.

												I'm always interested in new games I can play with my children. They love whimsical adventure / puzzle games, the best thus far being Lily Looking Through. I accidentally scared them half to death a few years ago playing Limbo with them. I find this to be a good, entertaining puzzle game somewhere in between those two - whimsical but still serious, though the death is generally less grizzly than Limbo. The puzzles are easy enough for us to play through casually while still giving me a decent challenge. Recommended for anyone playing with their kids in early elementary years!			"

												Before you buy this game, you need to know that it relies heavily on audio puzzles. Many of the puzzles require an English alphabet to music code. It can be extremely frustrating if you don't know that the sounds relate to the alphabet or if you can't tell many similarly sounding notes apart. I do not recommend this game to anyone with audial difficulties.That said, this game is a cute, magical adventure full of death. It has the usual pitfalls of point and click adventure games - repetition, back-tracking, ""why do I have this object?"", use everything with everything, etc. - but it also has frustrating sound puzzles. Honestly, I almost gave up on this game because of the musical code puzzles. It does have this odd charm about it. Once I got past the frustrating bits, I ended up enjoying it. This is a game that takes a lot of time and thought. Unless you use one of the community guides.			"

Short version: 72%Finding Teddy is a textless point ‘n’ click adventure game with astonishing pixel art, simplistic plot, somewhat clunky controls, and an unnecessary musical puzzle aspect.Long version:Finding Teddy is a cute and beautiful little point ‘n’ click that was made with love, but it set its goals too high by trying to be an art-only adventure game.Sure, the plot is so simple it hardly needs any dialogue: you play as a little girl whose teddy bear gets stolen, so she enters a magical land where she encounters some unfriendly beasts she needs to tame with certain items or code phrases.The problem comes from acquiring these. The items are not too problematic– if you are patient enough, brute force will eventually let you pass. But the code phrases…They use a musical alphabet where you only receive the letters after you solved the puzzle tied to them. So in order to beat the game you either need to be an experienced musician or have an exceptional hearing. Also, if you play with laptop speakers, don’t even bother.Still, if you don’t mind relying on a walkthrough, the game is adorable enough to spend a few hours with it.			"

												In this little point and click game you play as a little girl. Where one night some mysterious creature comes and takes her teddy. The little girl enters the wardrobe and thus starts your adventure in a strange world. The puzzles in this game can be a bit confusing at first. Probably because nothing is explained. It took me a little bit to figure it out, and then it was pretty easy. The games about 2 hours long probably for your first play through. And to 100% achievements you've gotta play through a second time which is fairly fast if you remember how to advance through the story.			"

There were times that took me a bit longer than it should have because some of the puzzles aren't that intuitive and there is no hint system (that I could see). That being said you don't have to solve every puzzle to complete the game but that just gives me a little more incentive to replay it and get the remaining achievements I'm missing. This is a sweet game with a bit of a musical theme and a beautiful atmosphere. If you're a fan of point and click adventures this game won't disappoint.			"

It has lovely visuals and the music and sound suits the game perfectly.Overall pretty easy achievements if you have given them a look ahead of time. Only one really tricky achievement and the game also has an achievement that involves beating the game twice but thats not a big deal due to the length of it.Time to 100%: 2½ hours			"

												A short point and click adventure and a monotonous and disappointing experience. You get this little girl who is trying to get back her Teddy bear from a mysterious world, pleasantly designed, though lacking imagination. I enjoyed a lot the artwork, the soundtrack, but not the game itself. The gameplay is just tedious and the puzzles are simple and minimalist, the mojority of them tending to be ridiculous. Even the achievements are tending to be negative. You get the echivements for being killed by the creatures you're supposed to please, so if you're not supid enough to get killed by them all during your journey - you'll have to start it over, and this time ""remember"" to die if you want the achievements. Another waste of time and money. Just doesn't worth it.			"

												Finding Teddy is a colorfully pixelated point and click game that places the player in control of a girl whose teddy bear has been stolen by a monster from out of her wardrobe—because, for the little girl in Finding Teddy, her teddy bear means everything! When she follows after the teddy bear, she is transported to a fantastical world filled with musically-inspired puzzles and several animal companions that can be used to solve riddles and unlock secrets.The majority of Finding Teddy's puzzles can either be solved by gathering and using the correct objects from within the level or by playing a specific melody on an alphabetical musical scale that the player slowly fills out throughout the game. The puzzles are thought-provoking without being aggravating. Often your goal is to find a particular item that will cause a creature that is blocking your path to move out of your way. As you progress further into the game, the little girl will be joined by two helpful sidekicks that will allow the player to reach otherwise inaccessible objects and areas.One of Finding Teddy's most charming features is its naivety; the game never presents you with a problem that must be solved via an act of mean-spirited trickery, but instead offers you sad creatures whose problems you must solve in order to continue. In Finding Teddy, you'll find missing baby spiders, sing ""Hello!"" to a group of frogs, and retrieve food for globular monsters with gigantic tongues. Finding Teddy is very much a game that embraces the perspective of the little girl that you play.Finding Teddy's high points can be found in its disarmingly childish storyline, its lush and detailed pixelized backgrounds and characters, and its attractively dialogue-free, music-centered gameplay. Perhaps the only downside to this casual point and click game is its short gameplay time and low replay value—most players will finish their first playthrough in under two hours and completionists with quick minds will find themselves completing all of Finding Teddy's achievements in that same time frame.Despite its short gameplay time, Finding Teddy is a brilliant example of quirky point and click games. This game presents you with sympathetic characters, unique puzzles, and a wonderfully vibrant atmosphere, giving it more than enough reason to earn a recommendation as a casual, light-hearted point and click game to play between some of your more intense adventures as a gamer.

												I don't see what the fuss was about, this game is bland and boring. Graphics are from 1982. You just click around, and even that doesn't work sometimes as some paths for going down or up don't trigger even if you click all over it 10 times but then works once you leave the area and come back. There is no dialogue and basically no story at all besides you getting your teddy. The game does this ""music"" thing that just gets annoying and loses its lustor after the first time they use it. A lot of game points out the problem with many point and click, the random logic and pixel hunting. As if I was supposed to know I have to take 3 rights and a left, in the confusing areas with multiple paths, click on this thumbtack in the background, then go 5 ups and 3 rights and down and use it on a hole in the wall to build up the pressure of water behind it, which makes it burst and shoots out a key you need to give to this penguin 10 minutes back, etc. One time there was a web I had a fang that I could have used to cut it, but the game wanted me to sing to something to cut it for me, even though I used the fang later to cut a web. It is this obtuse reasoning where they just want you to follow their prescribed logic instead of use any of your own. The confusing layout ads to the problem of there being no cohesion to doing things, just random scattered objects you take to different paths, but in no particular order or sense. Final boss was just kind of annoying. Not really many redeeming features. Pretty short game too. 4.5/10.			"

The concept of using music as the main source of dialogue was interesting, but in the beginning you can be left wondering what you're supposed to do - looking at you bird feather statue. On a positive note, the hand drawn graphics do look great. 5/10			"

												Ok after this and Shelter... I don't think I will be buying any more Greenlight games................ I feed robbed and I believe I only paid the equivalent of 3 kinder eggs......... (Although they would have been much more fun)The narrative could EASILY have been produced by a 4 year old (It may have been)The graphics give you a proper headache, (imagine looking at all the colours in the rainbow flashing 100 times a second whilst hanging upsidedown naked)The puzzles were lame as ""Use flying bug thing"" on ""feather stuck in a tree"" because I cannot reach it...And in the end I didn't give a poo Where my flippin TEddy was, I just wanted to feed the protagonist to the singing bloody frog and wake up from this flippin nightmare!

												Story: Youre a little girl. Some mean spider took Teddy. Now you gotta find Teddy! Can you say kawaii?Did you think the game would be boring because its a point and click that can be completed in under 90 minutes? WRONG, its awesome. And you got ♥♥♥♥ing achievements to complete to show how hardcore you are at video games. 19 of em. Thats almost 20, dear god...			"

												Finding Teddy is a quirky short point-and-click. It's Sound is it's best point, as the entire game is based around it. The Art mis also very beautiful. However, the game is very fun and very enjoyable. Pick it up at full price if you're a fan of beautiful art and music, and/or point and clicks.  Get it on a sale, as it is a little pricy for it's length if you're not either of the two but are looking for a short fun game. Plus, it has STEAM TRADING CARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS!			"

I really don't have much to say other than it's very well crafted and if you have a chance to pick this up on special, you definitely won't regret it. The sequel to this game is already out as well and takes on a whole new approach turning it into an adventure/rpg.			"

												Finding Teddy is a charming game with unique atmosphere and beautiful graphics. The puzzle-solving system is fun to use, and it all ties together in the end. It may take a bit of wandering to solve the puzzles, but the world is a place you aren't going to mind wandering through. Relaxing, cute, and gorgeous. I don't think it's ""this is my favorite game of all time!"" material, but it will join a fond place in your memories.			"

												(7/10)Cute little point and click adventure game.  Art is very pixely old-school and the music is darkly chippy and enjoyable.  There are a couple of pretty strong/interesting ideas here when it comes to solving the puzzles and learning as a player how to interact with the various creatures in the world.  Not the longest game around but it doesn't need to be, file it under short and sweet.			"

												Only planned to start it up and see what it was and I ended up playing untill I finished the game.  Finding Teddy is a fun little point and click game, telling a cute story about a girl trying to find her teddybear. Puzzles aren't that hard, but you can get stuck at times. It's easily fixed by backtracking a bit. The biggest annoyance for me was unlocking letters and them not showing on the music chart which resulted me making mistakes that could have been avoided.

												Finding Teddy is what I would describe best for myself as a hidden gem. I honestly did not know what I was getting myself into. All I knew was that it was a point and click adventure game. The setup is very simple and the implementation is beautiful to say the least. The aesthetics are what drew me in and I loved every second of solving the puzzles. The artwork and the drawings and the animation are all fun and cute and you can easily tell this had a lot of effort put into it. I blindly recommend this great work of art. One of the few indie games out there that turn a simple concept into an unforgettable experience. Who can't say no to cat companions and flies with top hats?

												Finding Teddy is a very charming indie point and click adventure game developed by Storybirds (a French start-up developer) and published by Lookatmygame.Graphics:- Wonderful, imaginative, colourful and vibrant colour palette- Art style is uniqueSound:- Very unique in its implementation as it's a major component when it comes to the puzzlesStory:- Fairy tale in its imaginations. You play an anonymous young girl whose teddy is stolen in the middle of the night, by a monster that comes out of her wardrobe. It's her mission to locate the source of these troubles and to get her teddy back!Gameplay:- Unique both in terms of art design and in the fact it features no dialogue- Combines traditional point and click elements - Has musically-inspired puzzles using actual notations- Not too difficult- Companions may join you adventure- There's an interesting side-quest for players to unravel once they overwrite their previous save game- Has some nice achievements and artwork to collect- Very short (though from my point of view this is not detrimental)Conclusion:	- Use of music as the basis of its puzzles is interesting	- Very short	- Charming art directionIndie rating 8.5/10My video review:

												Finding Teddy is an Indie adventure through a magical world filled with creatures and curiosity. The little girl (the main character) travels through this world in search of her stolen Teddy bear, solving puzzles, riddles, and quests inspired by music elements. An amazing Point & Click tied together by a nostalgic pixel ride with a childhood vibe.+ Nostalgic pixel story+ Unique puzzles and riddles+ Interesting way of incorporating music elements+ Touchscreen compatible+ Easy Achievements+ Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)- Lack of a friendly UI and tutorial- Music elements lack any kind of explanationPersonal Ranking: 6.5/10 "

												The game was fun until the puzzles suddenly got extremely cryptic. I knew there was something I haad to do, but the game didn't give a very clear answer to what that was. When I finally had to turn to a guide for help (which I hate doing for puzzle games), every puzzle I got stuck on, I thought ""How in the world was I supposed to figure that out?""In my opinion, very small things could have been done to fix this and wouldn't have ruined the flow of the game or the puzzles throughout. Again, I really enjoyed the puzzles that made sense, but not the ones that didn't.			"

												Annoying art-game is annoying.I've really only ""done"" 2 significant things in the game: Got past the blob and got past the frogs. OK, 2.5: I picked up the jar, too.At this point, though, even despite trying to utilize the hint system, it seems I'm stuck. I've explored every available area at least 3x, including viewing the hints to no avail. (Other than a few fail-achievements. Thanks for that!)I even tried to see it in the spirit of ""back in the day"" when games were way more abstract and not knowing what to do was seriously part of the fun!  (And I honestly miss that!  It's an element that's 100% missing from today's games. In all fairness it's not 100% the games' fault ... i mean, u get older, and stuff that used to amaze and befuddle u just doesn't any more. It's a good thing, they say... :P) But even that approach is only going to fend off boredom and frustration for so long...The fact is: the kind of gaming where u just run back and forth the same 15-20 rooms back and forth with no positive feedback whatsoever*? I got no time in my life for that any more. (Could I google my way thru this game? Gee, I wonder. Am I going to do that? Gee, I am not.)(*until you eventually break down and ask your friends at school the next day ""hey how do u get past that one part?"" and somebody has an older brother who's beat the game so of course they know what's up and then u can't wait to get home from school and do that one part and then u get stuck 5 minutes later and repeat the whole process the next day until you eventually either ""beat"" the game, or, far more likely: just move on to something else.)I do sincerely appreciate what this game is trying to do art-wise, including the audio. (And don't get me wrong: I do want to find that @#($*ing bear! :P) But I just can't justify putting more time into this when I'm literally getting nowhere (and taking far too long to do so).And with that -- and, conveniently, as my final trading card drop has just dinged into place -- I think it's time to put teddy to bed. :`-|Still i ""recommend"", cuz, it's more like ... i don't not recommend. The old ""YMMV"" rule, and all.			"

												A truly beautiful game.While most other point and click adventures have the same mechanics, this game is a real challenge. It has sound-based communication, which is only hard in the beginning, as you don't know, how to begin.The artstyle looks absolutely great, while the only thing I can complain about is, that it was made for 4:3 screens. But that's a fact, you can really look over, because of the beauty of the surroundings.I only started this game because I could get some Steam trading cards, but then I realized, how great this beautiful masterpiece is. The only sad thing about it is, you can play it only about 2-3 times. After that, there's nothing new left.Gameplay 10/10 (innovative)Graphics 10/10 (beautiful)Soundtrack 10/10 (nice and calming)Replayability 4,5/10 (Everything unlocked after 2-3 plays without guides)Overall 8,625/10It's worth the money if you love riddles and indiegames!I am looking forward to the sequel!

The puzzles were a delightful mix of challenge without being skull bashingly stumping.The Bad: This game virtually has no replay value once you have beaten the game, unless you wish to unlock all of the artwork in the game. The Verdict: Finding Teddy isn't a very powerful game, but it exceeds in it's ability to charm and challenge. More of a playable storybook than a game by conventional standards. Even as a playable storybook of sorts, I really enjoyed the charm of the game in general.			"

												A mildly fun game which takes obvious inspiration from Loom, as far as the ""using music to make things happen"" gameplay goes.Unfortunately the game itself is very bland and uninteresting. It's also very annoying that it isn't obvious what can be clicked on and what can't. The old ""sweeping the cursor looking for hot-spots"" trick doesn't work here as there is no wordline.You can finish the game in about half-an-hour, so unless you want to play it again for the achievements, there isn't much to make you go back.Oh, and was anybody else expecting the theme from ""Tonari No Totoro"" over the ending? :D			"

												This is one of those games that is very basic but also very good! It's very short, taking an hour to beat the game and only 2 hours to get all the achievements. I actually really enjoyed the storyline and the child-story gore. The game has hidden secrets to explore and an alternate ending if you get everything which is pretty cool. The puzzles are fairly challenging but not too much so and it was enjoyable the entire game thru. I would have to give this game a 4/5, I hope the second one is just as enjoyable!			"

												This game is fantastic IF you follow a walkthrough. I would have never figured out that the notes are actually letters and you need to know that right at the start of the game. A little clarification on that aspect of the gameplay would have gone a long way. Also, being that there is ONE part in the game where you need to combine items could have done with some explaining since it happens once and then never again. Why bother putting that in??? I still recommend it if you follow a walkthrough or get help from the forums. The story is neat and the art style is pleasing to look at.			"

												This game is fantastic IF you follow a walkthrough. I would have never figured out that the notes are actually letters and you need to know that right at the start of the game. A little clarification on that aspect of the gameplay would have gone a long way. Also, being that there is ONE part in the game where you need to combine items could have done with some explaining since it happens once and then never again. Why bother putting that in??? I still recommend it if you follow a walkthrough or get help from the forums. The story is neat and the art style is pleasing to look at.			"

												It seems when you set out to make a point and click game, there are several characteristics your game must have. It must have visual and audio effects that reflect a relaxing atmosphere. It must have a simple interface that makes you feel like a complete dullard when you inevitably fail to understand what you're supposed to do. Each solution must incorporate a logic that is completely unique to the creator and makes everyone else say, ""Umm okay... I guess that makes sense..."" when/if they find the correct solution. And finally, it must have gameplay that encourages the player to rub every item in their inventory against every interactive surface in the game, in hopes they'll get lucky and stumble onto the creator's train of logic.So with that in mind, let's go down Fondling Teddy's checklist.-Calming visuals? Check.-Soothing ambient music and sound effects? Check.-Ridiculously simple interface? Check.-Puzzles who's train of logic just pulled in from the twilight zone? Double check.-Gameplay and level design that makes the player wander aimlessly back and forth throughout the game, mashing random objects together like a confused, alcoholic alzheimer's patient that just pulled themself from a car crash? Ultra check.In fact, backtracking is such a huge part of Finding Tiddy that it should be one of it's big selling points. ""Now with 75% more backtracking!"", the store page would say. ""Do you enjoy seeing the same 8 screens over and over? Too bad!"", the store page would exclaim.But all the backtracking pales in comparison to the absurd ""solutions"". The breaking point for me occurred when I eventually got sick of the usual, ""mash item X against surface Y in a vain attempt to understand what I'm supposed to do"" technique and committed the ultimate and most dishonorable sin of all: looking up a walkthrough. As it turns out, I was supposed to play a series of notes from my newly acquired sheet music notepad thing to make a rock happy. Which would make sense, but here's the catch, over half of the music notes were missing from the sheet music notepad thing and I had no donkey punching idea how I was supposed to get the rest of music notes. Or what order I was supposed to play them in. Or even if I was supposed to play music at all. None of this is explained. Even after I copy-pasted the solution from the walkthrough, nothing is explained. There wasn't any sort of message saying something like ""hey you figured out the right music notes by giving a sensual massage to the tree of pounding"" or ""it's a good thing you booty bumped the stone of throbbing cause he had right idea"" or anything at all to show what planet the developer was on when they made that puzzle. All I can assume is that I was supposed to look up a walkthrough. As far as I can tell, that was the developer's intended solution.In short, Fondling Tiddy is your typical, mundane, nothing special, point and click game. Much like a stripper, it's fun to look at but once you get down to business, you'll see why looks aren't everything.If you want a good point and click game, then check out Machinarium and Return to Mysterious Island. Those games do point and click right.Machinarium:Return to Mysterious Island: "

												Initially the game looked good on so many trailers, but it was like walking into a cinema and getting ready with the popcorn and then 10mins into it you realise that you may of made a mistake. Beside the fact it feel and looks good, you know there something wrong. You, you realised that this is not your thing and the fact that you are wasting valuable time on this when you could be watching something else or be somewhere else is apparrent, you stick it out a little later and even go as far as 1 hour, and you know deep down... time is wasting....I cant give an accurate reason why, but this game is not for me. I like RPGs, I like some point and clicks, i even like pixelated games when the stories are good. But this... Was just annoying, like staying in the same hotel room as a work collegue who snores very loudly...Sorry for those who like it - just not my thing.			"

												Finding Teddy is a point n' click puzzle in which you play a little girls whose teddy-bear has been taken by a weird arm from the closet during your night. What else would you do? Just go through the closet to get it back! Then, you find yourself in a wonderland.There, there are ""monters"" which you need to help, and they help you in return. Otherwise they'll just eat you. That's life.Point n' click games aren't really my kind of game, and this one doesn't change that. It has the aspects of those games that I don't like, such as very slow and little actual gameplay, and puzzles are sometimes too cryptic and turn into a click-fest.But I certainly liked this game quite a bit, and it has certain aspects that make it unique.First off, the artstyle. Despite very minimal, it's really well done. Every scenery looks very good, and the world seems alive because of it. You can see it from the screenshots, it almost gives me a Sword and Sworcery feel, but still stands on its own. Nothing to complain in this regard, and it's one of the aspects I liked the most.Music didn't really standout to me, it was more ambience oriented, and that's ok, but I didn't find it particularly good. I wasn't bad either, but I barely payed notice to it. I'm talking about general music, and sound effects. Then, there is a really cool mechanic with it, about which I'll talk further.Gameplay is mostly standard point n' click. You click on the edges of the screen you want to go, or the item you want to pick up. Then, you click on yourself if you want to use items. So, pretty standard, I'd say.But, you eventually get a flute. With this flute, you can play different notes and pitches, and each note represents a letter of the alphabet.With this, you can interact with some characters, and even try to translate what they're saying by finding which letter matches with a sound. This is something I've never seen before, and it works well, for the most part. Other times, you have to respond back, choosing the letter, and so creating a melody. This gives a whole new aspect to both the mechanics and the world, and it's what makes it truly unique!A big complaint I have with it, though, it that the background music sometimes overlaps with it, making it a bit too hard to figure out which sound you want. That's was really annoying at one point, but nothing you can't solve.You go through 3 different stages, with different characters, and then you have a final ""boss"", which is all about communication, with a little easter egg in there. In each stage, you have some optional monsters that may or may not be necessary to progress the story, and you should pay attention to them, because the Boss is mostly about things you've experienced before in the game.Unfortunately, you can probably finish the game in a single hour, or so. Then comes NewGame+. I think this one was pretty bad, to be honest. The wonder and surprise from the first walkthrough is mostly gone, and you're left to ""collect"" Fireflies that appear on some areas. These aren't really hidden or anything, it's just about playing the game once again. Plus, it's a really cheap way to increase the game's longevity... why not give you the option the first time?Aside from the fireflies, you can have a different look to your character, which could be cool... but whenever there is a scripted sequence, your character changes back during it. I don't know why this happens, but it feels very awkward. Would be nice to see it solved for future players. Nothing too bad, but an annoyance nonetheless.Along with this, the achievements were mostly really bad, in my opinion. Half of them are to reward you for dying in each encounter. Instead of rewarding to figuring out things before hand, it rewards for failing. ... Why? It makes people purposefully failing if they want the achievement and have played well on their first time... It makes no sense to me, and it is the exact opposite purpose that achievements should have. My final complaint is not being able to Alt Tab the game, or even changing options during gameplay. There are no sliders for the music and SFX, Alt-Tabbing doesn't work, there are a lot of annoying things about it in a technical level. These could be very easily solved, but the developers seemed to have taken the easier way out and just made something quick that worked... somewhat.I've done everything there was to do in the game, it took my 2 and 1/2 hours, in 2 playthroughs, which is really short.If you can withstand all the technical issues and annoyances, you'll actually find a really pretty game with some unique features to it. I think it's worth playing once only, in my opinion. I'm interested what else can be done with this concept, and I'll be paying attention to you, ""LookAtMyGames"". Go ahead and try it, it has its strenghts! "

It's about a girl who gets her Teddy Bear taken from her by a giant spider and she must go into her wardrobe to get it back. This game is not long but long enough to wear out it's welcome.Even if you don't like point and click adventures I suggest trying it, the puzzles aren't hard but also not easy and the controls are super simple and can be played with just a mouse.

Finding Teddy is the absolute definition of “short but sweet” when it comes to point-and-click adventure games. Although the game is easily beatable in one sitting it is certainly an enjoyable experience. While not really bringing anything new to the point-and-click genre, its beautiful aesthetic and well thought out world really set it apart.The puzzles are fairly easy for the most-part, which may leave point-and-click veterans wanting more; although, there is a huge variety in the puzzles, so you won’t feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over...While its 4:3 resolution really shows its mobile roots, don’t let it fool you, it’s certainly far from a shabby mobile port. The game is a highly charming and memorable experience, not to mention the hysterical deaths I fell victim to along the way. For fans of point-and-click puzzle games, we give it a high recommendation, but don’t expect much in the way of narrative.The verdict:+ Beautiful and well realised world.+ Wide variety of puzzles.- Lack of complexity in puzzles may leave point-and-click veterans disappointed.Overall Rating: 6/10			"

												This one is a complete abortion - it's an iOS game ported to PC and then flogged on Steam by some very entitled feeling hipsters who feel they deserve some money from PC gamers for performing ablutions on the gaming industry. Gameplay - ported from iOS, it has a terrible UI, barely playable on PC, designer for hipsters, not humans.  At best, it's reminiscient of games that did very badly on the C64, but with worse gameplay.Graphics - Developer didn't bother, why should I?  Oh yes, because writing this review is more involved than the effort those guys put in.  Retro pixel rubbish, except they couldn't even maintain the fake accent properly, so from time to time they forget to use pixel graphics.   Lazy, halfarsed mess.Technical aspecs - graphics and sound are terrible because it's an iOS game.  Doesn't run properly in any resolution over 1080p - even iPads do that - how bad are these developers?My advice? Only buy this game if you can be sure you get the only copy, then shoot it, burn it, collect the ashes, shoot them, stir up the ashes with some petrol so you can burn them, then find the McDonalds the developer is working at and make him eat them.   It's the only way to be sure.I'm kidding of course - McDonalds would never hire anyone this incompetent.			"

												Game itself seems really cool, but implementation is very poor on Linux. Fullscreen mode changes to a weird resolution and you can scroll the game out of view by moving the mouse down or to the right. Setting windowed mode has no effect. After trying many different keys I managed to bring up the in game menu and could quit to the main menu screen. However, there was no way to quit the game itself.Update: Windowed mode is enabled after a restart. Bringing up the in game menu is still a little fiddly but can be done by moving the cursor to the lower left hand of the screen.			"

												A charming and sweet point-and-click adventure game that tells a beautifully sad story about a girl who enters a bizarre, Wonderland-esque world to track down her stolen teddy bear. The pleasant pixel-art visuals are a blend of Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery meets Fez, with a vibrant color pallette more closely resembling that of the latter. Sound design is another strong point of the game; not only is there solid ambient music to help set a moody atmosphere, but sound also plays a prominent role when it comes to creating some of the more interesting and unique puzzles that Finding Teddy has to offer. I also really enjoyed the simplistic and traditional nature of the game. The interface is very minimalistic and there are practically no hints of any kind. The player is allowed to explore these dream-like environments on their own without any assistance and the game is better off because of this. The story is a short one (~90 minutes) but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's the kind of adventure you can finish up in a single night and still be completely satisfied by the experience.In all, I had quite a good time playing Finding Teddy. Nice art design, a minimalistic style, and an endearing story of friendship and loneliness. Recommended for those who are fans of the genre.			"

												Grade: 88/100Difficulty: EasyPros: The artwork is amazing for being pixelated, and for a game done in only 4 months. The puzzles are interesting and just challenging enough to not feel too easy or obvious. It's rather cute, and the music-based puzzles can be an interesting challenge until you figure out how easy it really is (you're probably overthinking it).Cons: The trailer music is about as good as the game's music gets. In most areas it can start to grate on your nerves. It's too bass-heavy to listen to for a prolonged period of time before you feel the need to move on to something else. Two playthroughs will get you all of the Steam achievements -- one if you use a walkthrough guide or are excruciatingly meticulous about seeking out the hidden things.Replayable: Not really. I finished all achievements in two playthroughs. I probably won't play again unless I'm showing it to somebody. Even so, this fact doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.			"

												I have never been a fan of the click adventure genre, but this I really enjoyed. The delightful pixel art graphics at the brilliant music and sound effects give the game a really relaxing and enjoyable feel. The game consists of three chapters each filled filled with riddles and puzzle solving, none of which are particularly difficult but still enjoyable and rewarding. The game is short around 2 hours (how long it toook me to complete) but I think it was also have good replay value find all of the collectable items and getting the remaining achievments. If your looking a click adventure or chilled, atmospheric exploration game then I highly recomend this. I look forward to playing the next game from this developer!			"

Despite that I pretty much played the game non-stop until I was done. So clearly I really enjoyed the damn thing. Despite being a little annoying, it was really spooky to come acros some of the glitches. Mainly I am reffering to when you enter a room and get to watch yourself be killed. Usually this was only resolvable by leaving the game and entering it again but sometimes it could be solved by just leaving the area and entering it again. The end of the game left me with a huge smile and a deep feeling of reminicing. In the end I would say the word beautiful best describes this game.			"

												Very nice point-and-click, the trailer really sums up the experience you will get from this game. It is very colourful, I would say it is quite easy, however, this makes it enjoyable compared to other point-and-clicks that are frustrating. The main arc takes about 2 hours to complete, and the whole game another 2.			"

												This is a game that has a interesting story and good visuals, then suffers terribly because of the gameplay. ~ Good ~Story:This bizarre, yet sometimes adorable story is told mostly without any dialogue. It reminds a lot about ”Alice in Wonderland” with a dark twist. A strange world where you meet both kind and aggressive creatures. As everything is so weird, you don't know what to expect around the corner. I love stories that can be told without words, which is rare to find nowadays. ~ Bad ~Gameplay: This is one of the most tedious games I have ever played. Most of it consists of walking around and backtracking to get one object you need for another area. Usually these objects are ridiculously easy to get (click once, get item. Done.) and often it takes more time to walk back. It unfortunately reminds me of ”Secret Files 3” where the main character is deliberately dumped back to the start, so that the game will become ”longer” as you waste time walking through non-interactive areas. This also leads to dissapointments in the story, because most of the strange creatures interaction are redused to ”Fetch item. Give item.” It takes away the sense of fear and mystery about them. As everything about them is solved the same way, it leaves them all quite samey despite their different appearences.Another tedious design of the game, which could have been brilliant and unique, is that some puzzles requires the character to sing notes that another character sings. All notes represent the alphabet (which is not brought up by the game for some reason) and you basically repeat a message. The problem is that you have so many notes and when you first play the game, none of them are displayed on your notebar. So unless you have a good ear for tones (I do.. a bit), great memory (definately not my thing) or great attention to things (nope), then these puzzles becomes frustrating. The high pitched notes are not only irritating to listen to, but they are also hard to distinguish. Even with the background music off (which was overpowering the notes), it's still hard for me to make out the sound. The notes are also not written in clear letters, instead they are in a font which makes them hard to destuingish. And there are some creatures which doesn't even show the notes you have to click, forcing you to have perfect sense of tone, memory, visuals and hearing.This could easily have been the best part of the game, with a better choice of sounds (less earbleeding) and clearer visuals for the notes. And allowing them all to be displayed from the start. It would make the puzzles fun rather than frustrating.Game bugs:- Obviously the game is designed for something wider than a mouse cursor, as some doors won't activate unless you click very far off screen.- The music in the start screen constantly glitches and skips.- Sometimes when you try to interac with objects nearby a door or ladder, then the character will just walk out of the room, despite not clicking anywhere close to the exit.- After I completed the game and tried to turn it off, the game crashed.- Not every ""room"" in the game allows you to practice on the notes, despite that you can always bring out the noteboard to ""sing"". This leads to two problems. 1: There are only some rooms where you aren't ""supposed"" to sing. When you try to click certain notes, it will just click on the monsters in the background that will proceed to kill the character. How am I supposed to know she isn't supposed to sing in this room? Why can I click some notes while others clicks on the background?2: When you want to practice next to the characters that only makes sounds and no notes, the game will make a loud ""DING"" sound, because you are technically clicking an area you aren't supposed to, which blocks out the notes sounds. Even when you have the notes screen up, the game makes that loud dinging noise as if you are missclicking.			"

												Finding Teddy is a short, enjoyable game about a young girl who is awoken in the middle of the night by something stealing her Teddy. She goes on a quest to find him in a strange, foreign land. Don't expect it to hold your hand. There is no tutorial or guidance.It is a point and click adventure that consists of three chapters, and I think that you could probably get through all three in about 2-3 hours, at most. During your adventure, you have to find items to help you get past obstacles, and there are a few hidden treats for achievements, but overall, I enjoyed my time with Finding Teddy and would recommend it. I want to make a special note that it has a unique puzzle mechanic that involves 'speaking' to the animals in the game to solve puzzles by using musical notes that relate to letters. I've not seen this in a game before and it was a neat mechanic. It's always refreshing to see something new that keeps the genre interesting.Also worth mentioning, it has a new game + feature, if you missed anything (Like I didn't know about fireflies until I was into act 2... whoops!) and there is no punishment for death. You just start over on the same screen. In fact, it is often rewarded in the form of achievements :)			"

												""Finding Teddy"" is a game in the same way as ""To The Moon"" is, in that it doesn't deserve to be played because it's a game, but because it's great in all other ways. It just happens that the mechanics are very game-like. It is very short, but very beautiful and atmospheric, mixing a very creepy and a very cutesy environment.If this story was put into a short film or a book, I wouldn't have bothered with it. It needs to be an interactive exploring experience.If you have any respect for story, charm, art and creativity, you do want to play this game and the developer deserves all the praise they can get for making this. I certainly hope that they will make more stuff like this in the future.			"

												The little I played is enough to realize that this game is not worth my time or patience.In its blind quest to be ""the revival of Point'n-Click,"" it takes only the worst and most frustrating aspects of that genre.You'll spend most of the game not actually thinking about puzzles, but slowly backtracking through the same places, waiting for the damn walking animation from one endpoint of a screen to another to complete, over and over again.It's neither fun, interesting, nor charming.And when you get to a place, good luck with the obnoxious, no-feedback pixel hunting and poorly implemented item use controls.If you're a fan of point and click, do yourself a favor and ignore this game.Instead, grab something by Wadjet Eye Games, or a title from the Broken Sword series, or one of the various other, much more thoughtfully designed titles such as Machinarium, The Inner World and Broken Age, off the top of my head.If you want a similarly pretentiously ""arty"" game, but without such egregious design flaws, check out Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP.

												This game is an absolute gem. Charming, challenging, and visually lovely at every turn, it deserves to be given a chance by anyone who might feel interested even in the slightest. I had to look at a guide for three small parts, but overall it is very intuitive. The note system will throw you for a loop at first, because everything in this game is explained only to the slightest degree, which I understand can be frustrating, but understanding that you have to match words/notes to figure out words, remember the words so that you can use them when the time is right, and knowing that your items menu is pulled up just by clicking on her is really all there is that may be confusing to understand at first.Honestly, best game I have played in a while. 10/10, absolutely enchanting.

												The game is very basic, the little girl loses its teddy and starts a quest on finding it.Pros:-the game is basic, it doesn't take too much time-I like the 2 d-has a cool story and the interactions with the monsters are cute-very cheapCons:-the game is basic(this can be a pro or a con, for me it was a con since I was expecting it to be more adventurous)-the puzzles are kind of boring-the game is played only by clicking. This can be good for some, it was a con for me.trying not to give any spoiler, I would recommend this game to a kid (it has a few brutal scenes), but to an adult, the game needs to have more adventures, maybe some enemies on the road to achieving the bosses. The game has a different feel to it though, and the music was good. If I recommended the game it would be just for the sake of the cute story and the music. It is not a fun game to play though, and this is the reason I don't recommend the game.			"

												I would not recommend this game to anyone.  It handles its puzzles, player conveyance/teaching, and its controls very poorly.  The mouse clicking is actually touch screen ""emulation"" and is very, very inaccurate and causes problems.  I click on the fly and due to the touch screen ""ripple"" it also selects the cat or the inventory or makes me leave the area.  I click on notes and it clicks through the notes onto actions to walk to things which kill you instead or it will click two notes at once which is never what you want and is completely useless. I completed the game only having to look up the answer two things at the very end.  One of which was due what I think is a miistake or oversight in the game.  The big spider is the GREAT TARANT.  His mailbox says TARANT, he is referred to as TARANT in at least two or three places.  But, for some reason the yellow glowing lantern puzzle makes you type his name as TARRANT -- extra R.  This made me stuck.  I get that if you concatenate all the wall scribbles you get GRE  EAT  TAR  RANT, but IMO it's still an awful oversight by the devs.  Unless I am missing something...The other thing I looked up was the response to ""I AM SAD"" beause the resonse to that was something the player would have learned at the very very beginning of the game before the player knows how anything even works.  In the beginning, there is pretty much no tutorial and I was mindlessly matching scribbles that I didnt even know were letters at the beginning so I did not properly learn that response to that question.  There is pretty much no tutorial and expecting the player to remember a nugget of infromation from before they understood the game's mechanics is just wrong.  Overall, a nicely styled good idea, but poorly designed mess of a game that should have stayed as a distraction on Andriod/iOS and not a Steam game.			"

												( this is probably one of my favorite games in my library so i might be biased, anyway: ) this is a really charming point & click adventure. visually, it's another indie title with pixel graphics, but the composition and color pallette help it to stand out from the rest. this combined with the sounds and music, only add to the atmosphere. the soundtrack is soothing and calming, which is a nice backdrop for all the puzzle solving.the main mechanic involves a music note system. you'll be relying pretty heavily on your ears, at least at first, especially if you want to unlock all the achievements. difficulty-wise, it's pretty easy. most of the time. the only thing that might cause you real trouble is the very end. there are guides in case you get stuck though.  it's not that long, but there's a new game+ option for completionists ( or if you can't get enough of it ). - TIPS - * double-click to run* don't be afraid to die* this is part one of two* buy this game			"

												Warm, not warmest recommendations. The musical aspect paired with the writing attracted me, also as a learning tool for my 6-year old, which carried the game along nicely. Music is okay, graphics are nice, controls are acceptable but a little annoying, as you can't press where you want to go, as in most games of this sort. You can only walk to places where something's going to happen. So you're standing around a lot.Your character will die, sometimes rather violently. No eyes popping out of their sockets, but being impaled by a bee might scare a 3-year old.When the girl runs, she swings her right arm and right leg forward at the same time, left ones backwards, unlike how humans run. I found it amusing and wondered if the creators were being clever or sitting down way to much to know.			"

												Grade: 88/100Difficulty: EasyPros: The artwork is amazing for being pixelated, and for a game done in only 4 months. The puzzles are interesting and just challenging enough to not feel too easy or obvious. It's rather cute, and the music-based puzzles can be an interesting challenge until you figure out how easy it really is (you're probably overthinking it).Cons: The trailer music is about as good as the game's music gets. In most areas it can start to grate on your nerves. It's too bass-heavy to listen to for a prolonged period of time before you feel the need to move on to something else. Two playthroughs will get you all of the Steam achievements -- one if you use a walkthrough guide or are excruciatingly meticulous about seeking out the hidden things.Replayable: Not really. I finished all achievements in two playthroughs. I probably won't play again unless I'm showing it to somebody. Even so, this fact doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.			"

												Short, cute and endearing, Finding Teddy isn't going to go down in the annals of point-and-click adventure game history, but it's a decent way to spend a couple of hours (or a couple of minutes if you're brilliant enough to work out all the answers instantly). It suffers a bit from fractured adventure game logic, particularly with regard to grasping the nuances of the core musical communication system which can be a bit befuddling until you realise the notes correlate to the alphabet and some of the puzzles are a bit random. But the graphics are bright and colourful, the protagonist is adorably sweet even when she's getting brutally killed (fortunately death is just a novelty in this game), the world is bursting with creativity and life and the ending theme of the story is surprisingly heartwarming- everybody needs a friend. A pleasant experience.			"

I suppose that's what the magic in this game is, a small adventure without having any clue what's going on.Worth atleast one play through, maybe even more for all achievements.Key words: Beautiful, heart warming, adventurous, adorable, music & puzzles.Tip: Don't turn off the game after the credits.

												Short and sweet. It helps if you have an ear for music, and don't mind figuring out stuff on your own. If you like to have your hand held or need training wheels for a point and click, then this one isn't for you. It's no Monkey Island, but it's great for what it is, and that's all we should expect of it. I thought it was fun!			"

												I got through about an hour of this game before deciding it wasn't worth my time.As far as puzzles go, these were about as bad as they come.  Absolutely no logic behind them at all.  Use items randomly on other items.  Here's an example.  I get a saw.  Turns out I'm supposed to saw down a little green sprout?  Then I'm supposed to stick the sprout in a weird hole with symbols around it (as far as I can tell, nooo hints for this anywhere).  And then I get... a fly with a top hat.Not only that, but in order to solve this I have to walk back and forth across at least 10 empty screens; much more if you include wandering, which you're going to do a lot of.  The game is ridiculously spread out, with 0 to 1 interactable things on each screen.  Lots of screens with nothing.The main unique feature of this game is the musical alphabet.  The idea is cool.  But something about it's execution just wasn't working out.  The alphabet at first appears to be random, hard-to-remember symbols, but after you look at it for a while, you realize it is actually just the English alphabet in a misleading font (seriously, another one?  Why do people keep thinking this is a good idea?).  Once you realize this, a lot of things become much easier.  It feels a lot like cheating.  I'm still not sure if you're supposed to realize it or not.  If you don't realize it, the game is laborious and tedious.  If you do, it feels like you're skipping any gameplay that was there.Other problems I had:- The ""companions"" were basically items, but selected in a different way, and it was veeeery unclear when a companion was selected or not.- Once you open your inventory and select an item, you have to actually deselect it before you can select something else.  If you don't do this, UI may stutter and flash.- When you open your little keyboard to play on it (a crucial part of the game) clicking on the keyboard also clicks through to whatever is behind the keyboard, which means you can't play certain notes while on certain screens.- Once you click on a door and your character starts walking over there, you can't make her stop or go somewhere else. And worse, you can still click on a bunch of UI things during this, but they are all broken and will stutter open and closed.- Unlocking UI features was badly timed.  Over and over you catch a glimpse of a feature that you're pretty sure is there (like some new menu pops open and then closes before you can look at it); you can't figure out how to access it and fight with it for a few minutes; you give up and wander around; eventually you stumble onto an arbitrary screen and it finally gives you access to the UI.

												( this is probably one of my favorite games in my library so i might be biased, anyway: ) this is a really charming point & click adventure. visually, it's another indie title with pixel graphics, but the composition and color pallette help it to stand out from the rest. this combined with the sounds and music, only add to the atmosphere. the soundtrack is soothing and calming, which is a nice backdrop for all the puzzle solving.the main mechanic involves a music note system. you'll be relying pretty heavily on your ears, at least at first, especially if you want to unlock all the achievements. difficulty-wise, it's pretty easy. most of the time. the only thing that might cause you real trouble is the very end. there are guides in case you get stuck though.  it's not that long, but there's a new game+ option for completionists ( or if you can't get enough of it ). - TIPS - * double-click to run* don't be afraid to die* this is part one of two* buy this game			"

												Finding Teddy is an adorable story about a girl who's teddy bear is stolen one night by a giant spider from a magical closet, which leads her on a wonderland like exploration of the world hidden within to find her bear. It is a an old school style point and click adventure with nice puzzles and an interesting musical element to the game. It also boasts whimsical artwork style throughout the game, culminating with a cute story. My only complaint is that the game felt a little short, leaving some to be desired, but considering the game was made within 4 months, I think its an inspiring ammount. If you get the chance I recommend giving this indie gem a playthough.			"

Finding Teddy is a Point&Click-Adventure in your usual retrographics, which people have come again to appreciate during recent years. You help a little girl, whose beloved stuffed animal was stolen out of her bed while you try to supress all those whimsical ""Awwww""s that might escape your mouth watching all that cuteness that's going on On-Screen. Beware though, that this game has some very nightmarish moments, even deathscenes (And yes, each one of those unlocks a Steam-Achievment ;))Besides an item-inventory the player can use some kind of musical language trying to communicate with various animals and insects, that she meets during her travel. The hardest part of this game is probably realizing how this communication works, as the tutorial for this is almost non-existant. The artwork and animation is well done, the music score is pleasant. All in all there a well done first Steam-Entry for the developers at LookAtMyGame[www.lookatmygame.com]. Apparently they are already working on a sequel (Not too happy about that, I would like to see them do other stuff as well).I recommend this game to those who enjoy a very shortwhiled adventure experience. Finishing the game doesn't take more than an hour.			"

												I'm only about 10% complete with this game, but I am already hooked on it. I really like the memorization aspect about this game, as there is quite a bit of backtracking. The amount of backtracking reminds me of the amount you have to do in Chapter 7 of Paper Mario: TTYD, but the detail and beauty of this 8-bit looking game gets you past that aspect of the game. Colors are vibrant and the soundtracks are very calming and peaceful. The only thing I would say that I personally don't care much for is the controls. You can only use your mouse to click which direction the protangonist wants to go, so there's no freedom of using the typical ""WASD"" key combination for moving around the world. It's definitely something to get used to if you haven't played a game like this. It looks as though this mechanic is changed in the sequel, as the protagonist can run, jump, and fight, bearing a sword and sheild right from the beginning. Overall I would highly suggest picking up this game. The price is an amazing deal, in my opinion, for the amount of work that was put into this game.			"

												This isn't a point and click adventure nor is it a puzzle game. This is just some weird handicapped version of both genres.The controls are just bad - you never know where you can click and where you can't because almost everytime just nothing happens. Sometimes it's because you're clicking slighty off an invisible boundaries of a screen exits and other times you're just clicking on a background non-playable object. And also you don't move like you would expect from a point and click adventure. No, in this game your character just stays on one place until you click on one from maximum three clickable objects or exits (there really are max three clickable objects per screen including exits). Most of the time the controls are just confusing and not responsive (for example your inventory just pops out when you are trying to select one of your companions). So that's enough for the point and click part.The puzzle part is even worse. There are just two types of puzzles - one is a primitive combination of one item from your inventory with some environment object (most of the times in a pretty random manner). Second type is this ""original"" playing with horrible sounds (which represents alphabet) when you have to speak with beeps to the others and make them do something. This is not only boring but also very tedious and the climax is a final boss which is just a totally random use of this game element.Throughout really short gameplay (about 2 hours max) you are accompanied by a horrible music which consists of short loop of polyphonic beeps. This in combination with an ear-tearing beeps from objects interaction in the game (even the inventory pop up sound is annoying) makes you want to turn the speakers off.PROS:-Nice graphics and unclockable gallery picturesCONS:-Bad looping background tune and beeping sounds all over the game-Bad controls-Lacks logic-Lots of boring backtracking-Really short			"

Don't expect too much of it though, once you figured it out it hasn't got that much of a replay value - but if you want every achievement you have to play through it twice (beating the game once will unlock new game+ if you load the game you beaten) thus a short story is actually preferable as you unlock one of the achievements in the very end of the game the second time you play it. I like it, but I don't see myself playing through it more than I already have - it's a neat way to waste some time if you have an hour or two to spare :).			"

												I got this Point & Click Puzzle Game for 25% of the original price just because I liked the game art and wanted to give it a try. After playing the game I'm really happy I did. You are thrown into a strange world where more or less everything wants to kill you to find your beloved Teddy. The game gives you good puzzles to think about and even rewards you with pieces of artwork at the end. There are multiple endings to explore depending on your choices throughout the game. Although the game itself does not require a lot of playtime, you will need some time to think about the puzzles. I strongly recommend buying this game and also getting the Soundtrack DLC.			"

												As much as I recommend this game for being a quality product that works for what it does, Finding Teddy just isn't without its issues.It's a point and click adventure game, but the movement is heavily restricted. You don't just click to walk somewhere, you only move when transitioning screens or picking up items, and you can't cancel these actions. So if you accidentally click on a transitional hitbox while clicking around for one of the game's many hidden collectibles, you're stuck moving.The game also tells you nothing. I don't know what's with these types of games telling you nothing about their story and their mechanics but it works as well for this game as it did for Hyper Light Drifter (read: not very). Like that game, there's also a made-up language you have to learn. Mercifully it doesn't require a language course to master and is mostly based in regular alphebeticals, but it relies heavily on sound cues. So if you aren't good with sounds, you're not gonna have a fun time.The game is also far too short. Not in the good way either, the only reason I barely scraped the two hour mark was because the game was so hard to figure out and I played it a second time in New Game+. I'd recommend the far longer (and far superior) sequel in comparison to this, but for what it's worth it's a great game if you really want it.			"

												Short but sweet point-and-click adventure game. Lots of neat, colorful sights to take in as you explore as well as some soothing ambient tracks. One of the main puzzle mechanics can be a bit hard to fiddle with at times, and the death animations are honestly a bit too gruesome for an otherwise cute game, but overall, this is worth your time, especially if it's cheap.

												Finding Teddy has a lot going for it stylistically, but almost every other area of the game is a mess. Despite the obvious care that went into the audio/visuals, it faceplants as both a puzzle game and as a point-and-click. Right off the bat and throughout the game, the controls are clunky and unresponsive.  Hitboxes of things that you need to click on range from bullseye exact to so wide that you'll activate them by clicking on them from out of state. Even those things pale in comparison to the awful music-note GUI. Arguably the key feature of the game is the ability to sing notes...that aren't visible to you from your note selection screen until you've solved some puzzle that they're involved in. The result is you're trying to solve puzzles with a palette comprised of some notes you can see and some you can't - until the very end of the game where you're essentially rewarded with a GUI that would have made the entire game more playable.Keyword there is ""more.""It's really not clear to me who this game is for. The cutesy but foreboding world seems to be reaching for a kind of LIMBO or more likely Dreaming Sarah vibe (both much better games worth exploring, FYI), but erring on the cutesy side. And yet this game is not for kids. Not because it will give them nightmares, but because they'll waste their precious young lives trying to figure out poorly-conceived puzzles. The puzzles in this game jump from embarrassingly straightforward to face-scrunchingly obtuse, often with no transition between the two depending on what you have to do next. You'll lose even more time eliminating solutions you thought you'd tried only to find later the absurdly demanding hitboxes actually never picked up your earlier attempt. The lack of widescreen support adds insult to injury since it hampers enjoyment of the one area the game excels in. On the other hand, it's probably a moot point: even huge pixel art fans should just leave Teddy for dead.			"

												I got through about an hour of this game before deciding it wasn't worth my time.As far as puzzles go, these were about as bad as they come.  Absolutely no logic behind them at all.  Use items randomly on other items.  Here's an example.  I get a saw.  Turns out I'm supposed to saw down a little green sprout?  Then I'm supposed to stick the sprout in a weird hole with symbols around it (as far as I can tell, nooo hints for this anywhere).  And then I get... a fly with a top hat.Not only that, but in order to solve this I have to walk back and forth across at least 10 empty screens; much more if you include wandering, which you're going to do a lot of.  The game is ridiculously spread out, with 0 to 1 interactable things on each screen.  Lots of screens with nothing.The main unique feature of this game is the musical alphabet.  The idea is cool.  But something about it's execution just wasn't working out.  The alphabet at first appears to be random, hard-to-remember symbols, but after you look at it for a while, you realize it is actually just the English alphabet in a misleading font (seriously, another one?  Why do people keep thinking this is a good idea?).  Once you realize this, a lot of things become much easier.  It feels a lot like cheating.  I'm still not sure if you're supposed to realize it or not.  If you don't realize it, the game is laborious and tedious.  If you do, it feels like you're skipping any gameplay that was there.Other problems I had:- The ""companions"" were basically items, but selected in a different way, and it was veeeery unclear when a companion was selected or not.- Once you open your inventory and select an item, you have to actually deselect it before you can select something else.  If you don't do this, UI may stutter and flash.- When you open your little keyboard to play on it (a crucial part of the game) clicking on the keyboard also clicks through to whatever is behind the keyboard, which means you can't play certain notes while on certain screens.- Once you click on a door and your character starts walking over there, you can't make her stop or go somewhere else. And worse, you can still click on a bunch of UI things during this, but they are all broken and will stutter open and closed.- Unlocking UI features was badly timed.  Over and over you catch a glimpse of a feature that you're pretty sure is there (like some new menu pops open and then closes before you can look at it); you can't figure out how to access it and fight with it for a few minutes; you give up and wander around; eventually you stumble onto an arbitrary screen and it finally gives you access to the UI.

Overall, for those who like pixelated puzzle games, I'd recommend this, and I'm looking forward to Finding Teddy 2.			"

 Plot Summary Finding Teddy is a charming point-and-click adventure about a little girl searching for her stuffed bear in a mysterious and magical world.So what can I say about this game... Positives + The pixel art graphics are beautiful. A lot of joy can come from stopping in a few of the areas and just enjoying the atmosphere.+ Atmosphere is peaceful, and yet suprisingly erie and unsettling at times.+ The game uses an interesting music/alphabet system. If you play it, you'll see what I mean.+ First playthrough lasts 3 hours or so (if you figure out the puzzles quickly), which is a good length for a game like this imo+ Second playthrough (New Game+) can last only 30 minutes or so, which is good for achievment hunters (2 runs are required for 100%)+ General feel-good game. Highly enjoyable. Meh things +/- Music is ehhh. There are some tracks that are really great, and some that are repetitive and a little obnoxious Negatives - There are hidden (literally invisible) collectibles in the game, which aren't explained at all. I found my first one on the last level  by accident  . Final Summation Liked it a lot, definitely worth a play.			"

												There's not a whole lot to this game that makes it very unique - but there are two things that have made it special and one is exclusive to me.1) The musical communication system - at first it felt incredibly complicated.  I didn't understand it at all.  I even was creating the symbols on a notepad, wondering if I'd need to use sequences I'd seen on walls later.  As it turns out there was something I clearly missed about this system that was quite obvious when I realized and it made the game all the more interesting having not been aware of its true meaning at first.2)  The art direction - what made the game great for me personally was that my girlfriend could get into it.  She's not a gamer so it's a pretty big deal when she likes something I own.  This particular game just struck her.  She seemed to identifiy with it on a personal level as if it were her own childhood dream.			"

												A charming and sweet point-and-click adventure game that tells a beautifully sad story about a girl who enters a bizarre, Wonderland-esque world to track down her stolen teddy bear. The pleasant pixel-art visuals are a blend of Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery meets Fez, with a vibrant color pallette more closely resembling that of the latter. Sound design is another strong point of the game; not only is there solid ambient music to help set a moody atmosphere, but sound also plays a prominent role when it comes to creating some of the more interesting and unique puzzles that Finding Teddy has to offer. I also really enjoyed the simplistic and traditional nature of the game. The interface is very minimalistic and there are practically no hints of any kind. The player is allowed to explore these dream-like environments on their own without any assistance and the game is better off because of this. The story is a short one (~90 minutes) but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's the kind of adventure you can finish up in a single night and still be completely satisfied by the experience.In all, I had quite a good time playing Finding Teddy. Nice art design, a minimalistic style, and an endearing story of friendship and loneliness. Recommended for those who are fans of the genre.			"

												A short and simplistic point-and-click adventure in a child's dream-world. Some of the puzzles are contrived, and the rest require code entry via a singing / alphabet system. It's okay once you get used to it, but at first it's a little awkward.The art is retro pixels, but gorgeous and the audio is 8-bit but very well done. These, together with a heart-warming ending, added depth to what might otherwise be a bland experience.It's a nice afternoon distraction for those who like this kind of thing, but don't spend much on it.[5.2]			"

												Grade: 88/100Difficulty: EasyPros: The artwork is amazing for being pixelated, and for a game done in only 4 months. The puzzles are interesting and just challenging enough to not feel too easy or obvious. It's rather cute, and the music-based puzzles can be an interesting challenge until you figure out how easy it really is (you're probably overthinking it).Cons: The trailer music is about as good as the game's music gets. In most areas it can start to grate on your nerves. It's too bass-heavy to listen to for a prolonged period of time before you feel the need to move on to something else. Two playthroughs will get you all of the Steam achievements -- one if you use a walkthrough guide or are excruciatingly meticulous about seeking out the hidden things.Replayable: Not really. I finished all achievements in two playthroughs. I probably won't play again unless I'm showing it to somebody. Even so, this fact doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.			"

												A word of warning if anyone is buying this game for their children:  This game has death scenes.  Some of these scenes are greusome and possibly traumatizing.  If anything, this is not a game for children but for teens and grownups.The detail and atmosphere of the game is beautiful.  Exploring from place to place in order to find out what needs to be done and to tends to blend in with the need to explore.

												An awful confusing experience with an endearing pixel art style.PROS:-Decent animation given retro themeCONS:-Apparently this game has ""music puzzles""; in the brief time I ran around, I saw notes but aside from opening my inventory did not figure out how to do anything else or how to play these notes. The games decision to avoid -any- type of text leads to several problematic user experiences (such as controls or a total lack of options)-Only action seems to be left click (not sure since nothing is ever explained in the slightest bit)-Can't tell what you can and can't interact with-Can't tell if using an item on a monster will actually work or not, but if it doesn't it will replay the overly long death scene...and you can't skip it.-Not really any options of any kind (only ""full screen/windowed"" via an icon on the main menu)The pixel art style is somewhat endearing, but pretty much everything else about this game is awful. The ""gameplay"" is nonsensical, consisting of randomly clicking on everything and often ending up seeing the same animation over and over. It took me a good minute just to get the game started from the bedroom scene until I found out you have to click on the closet. I was wasting my time trying every key on the keyboard.			"

												I'm only about 10% complete with this game, but I am already hooked on it. I really like the memorization aspect about this game, as there is quite a bit of backtracking. The amount of backtracking reminds me of the amount you have to do in Chapter 7 of Paper Mario: TTYD, but the detail and beauty of this 8-bit looking game gets you past that aspect of the game. Colors are vibrant and the soundtracks are very calming and peaceful. The only thing I would say that I personally don't care much for is the controls. You can only use your mouse to click which direction the protangonist wants to go, so there's no freedom of using the typical ""WASD"" key combination for moving around the world. It's definitely something to get used to if you haven't played a game like this. It looks as though this mechanic is changed in the sequel, as the protagonist can run, jump, and fight, bearing a sword and sheild right from the beginning. Overall I would highly suggest picking up this game. The price is an amazing deal, in my opinion, for the amount of work that was put into this game.			"

												Short, cute and endearing, Finding Teddy isn't going to go down in the annals of point-and-click adventure game history, but it's a decent way to spend a couple of hours (or a couple of minutes if you're brilliant enough to work out all the answers instantly). It suffers a bit from fractured adventure game logic, particularly with regard to grasping the nuances of the core musical communication system which can be a bit befuddling until you realise the notes correlate to the alphabet and some of the puzzles are a bit random. But the graphics are bright and colourful, the protagonist is adorably sweet even when she's getting brutally killed (fortunately death is just a novelty in this game), the world is bursting with creativity and life and the ending theme of the story is surprisingly heartwarming- everybody needs a friend. A pleasant experience.			"

She seemed to identifiy with it on a personal level as if it were her own childhood dream.			"

												Short and sweet. It helps if you have an ear for music, and don't mind figuring out stuff on your own. If you like to have your hand held or need training wheels for a point and click, then this one isn't for you. It's no Monkey Island, but it's great for what it is, and that's all we should expect of it. I thought it was fun!			"

												Very cute game!I love how this was animated and how you communicate in it! The giant spider was really cool, the cat that follows you is adorable, it was totally worth the purchase(I got a deal on it though). The only complaint I have is that I wish it were longer, but there is a chance that a sequel is coming. The ending made me feel  happy inside and it was also very cute too. And if you playthrough the game again(by loading the file you have and starting a New Game+), you can see Nyan Cat(which I have yet to see)!			"

												""Finding Teddy"" is a game in the same way as ""To The Moon"" is, in that it doesn't deserve to be played because it's a game, but because it's great in all other ways. It just happens that the mechanics are very game-like. It is very short, but very beautiful and atmospheric, mixing a very creepy and a very cutesy environment.If this story was put into a short film or a book, I wouldn't have bothered with it. It needs to be an interactive exploring experience.If you have any respect for story, charm, art and creativity, you do want to play this game and the developer deserves all the praise they can get for making this. I certainly hope that they will make more stuff like this in the future.			"

												Very nice point-and-click, the trailer really sums up the experience you will get from this game. It is very colourful, I would say it is quite easy, however, this makes it enjoyable compared to other point-and-clicks that are frustrating. The main arc takes about 2 hours to complete, and the whole game another 2.			"

												This is a game that has a interesting story and good visuals, then suffers terribly because of the gameplay. ~ Good ~Story:This bizarre, yet sometimes adorable story is told mostly without any dialogue. It reminds a lot about ”Alice in Wonderland” with a dark twist. A strange world where you meet both kind and aggressive creatures. As everything is so weird, you don't know what to expect around the corner. I love stories that can be told without words, which is rare to find nowadays. ~ Bad ~Gameplay: This is one of the most tedious games I have ever played. Most of it consists of walking around and backtracking to get one object you need for another area. Usually these objects are ridiculously easy to get (click once, get item. Done.) and often it takes more time to walk back. It unfortunately reminds me of ”Secret Files 3” where the main character is deliberately dumped back to the start, so that the game will become ”longer” as you waste time walking through non-interactive areas. This also leads to dissapointments in the story, because most of the strange creatures interaction are redused to ”Fetch item. Give item.” It takes away the sense of fear and mystery about them. As everything about them is solved the same way, it leaves them all quite samey despite their different appearences.Another tedious design of the game, which could have been brilliant and unique, is that some puzzles requires the character to sing notes that another character sings. All notes represent the alphabet (which is not brought up by the game for some reason) and you basically repeat a message. The problem is that you have so many notes and when you first play the game, none of them are displayed on your notebar. So unless you have a good ear for tones (I do.. a bit), great memory (definately not my thing) or great attention to things (nope), then these puzzles becomes frustrating. The high pitched notes are not only irritating to listen to, but they are also hard to distinguish. Even with the background music off (which was overpowering the notes), it's still hard for me to make out the sound. The notes are also not written in clear letters, instead they are in a font which makes them hard to destuingish. And there are some creatures which doesn't even show the notes you have to click, forcing you to have perfect sense of tone, memory, visuals and hearing.This could easily have been the best part of the game, with a better choice of sounds (less earbleeding) and clearer visuals for the notes. And allowing them all to be displayed from the start. It would make the puzzles fun rather than frustrating.Game bugs:- Obviously the game is designed for something wider than a mouse cursor, as some doors won't activate unless you click very far off screen.- The music in the start screen constantly glitches and skips.- Sometimes when you try to interac with objects nearby a door or ladder, then the character will just walk out of the room, despite not clicking anywhere close to the exit.- After I completed the game and tried to turn it off, the game crashed.- Not every ""room"" in the game allows you to practice on the notes, despite that you can always bring out the noteboard to ""sing"". This leads to two problems. 1: There are only some rooms where you aren't ""supposed"" to sing. When you try to click certain notes, it will just click on the monsters in the background that will proceed to kill the character. How am I supposed to know she isn't supposed to sing in this room? Why can I click some notes while others clicks on the background?2: When you want to practice next to the characters that only makes sounds and no notes, the game will make a loud ""DING"" sound, because you are technically clicking an area you aren't supposed to, which blocks out the notes sounds. Even when you have the notes screen up, the game makes that loud dinging noise as if you are missclicking.			"

												A short and simplistic point-and-click adventure in a child's dream-world. Some of the puzzles are contrived, and the rest require code entry via a singing / alphabet system. It's okay once you get used to it, but at first it's a little awkward.The art is retro pixels, but gorgeous and the audio is 8-bit but very well done. These, together with a heart-warming ending, added depth to what might otherwise be a bland experience.It's a nice afternoon distraction for those who like this kind of thing, but don't spend much on it.[5.2]			"

												Finding Teddy is not fun. The puzzles are very simple, but they also have an annoying habit of being obtuse. The visuals are nice, but the pixel look doesn't benefit them in any way - it's really the colors and design of the characters. Audio is neat, too. Still, nice presentation does not make a game. Maybe check this out if you have a serious hankering for some point-and-click gaming. Just know you have better options elsewhere.			"

 Plot Summary Finding Teddy is a charming point-and-click adventure about a little girl searching for her stuffed bear in a mysterious and magical world.So what can I say about this game... Positives + The pixel art graphics are beautiful. A lot of joy can come from stopping in a few of the areas and just enjoying the atmosphere.+ Atmosphere is peaceful, and yet suprisingly erie and unsettling at times.+ The game uses an interesting music/alphabet system. If you play it, you'll see what I mean.+ First playthrough lasts 3 hours or so (if you figure out the puzzles quickly), which is a good length for a game like this imo+ Second playthrough (New Game+) can last only 30 minutes or so, which is good for achievment hunters (2 runs are required for 100%)+ General feel-good game. Highly enjoyable. Meh things +/- Music is ehhh. There are some tracks that are really great, and some that are repetitive and a little obnoxious Negatives - There are hidden (literally invisible) collectibles in the game, which aren't explained at all. I found my first one on the last level  by accident  . Final Summation Liked it a lot, definitely worth a play.			"

												For £1.49 I got much more than I expected in this charming little point and click adventure.Summary for those too lazy to read the full review:Positives Cheaper than chips Great Music and Art Tough but Rewarding Puzzles Minimal backtracking Some replayability in the form of Achievments and UnlockablesNegatives Final Puzzle was ""impossible"" (see full review below for details on that) Even though it is minimal, some will find the backtracking annoying Past Achievments and Unlockables you won't be replaying this a lotFirst of all I absolutely adore both the music and the art style. I think it is a very pretty game and considering you get the soundtrack free with the game I would say £1.49 is worth that alone.When it comes to the game itself you play as a little girl who is adventuring through this magical land in search of her teddy. Do not be fooled though, this is not a game about sunshine and rainbows, in fact the game I would liken this to the most would be LIMBO, and for those of you that have played that you know what kind of deaths await you.Throughout the game you travel through different areas in order to help the creatures in your way. You do this in most cases by singing to them. It's a very interesting mechanic and I like it a lot.While the game is rather short the odds are that you will not see 100% of it on your first play through. I personally only saw 60% of the game on my first playthrough and because of that I will be playing it again to get 100%. Past that however there isn't much replayability here other than achievements and hidden artwork you can unlock and look at in the game, however for such a low price I wasn't really expecting something I would be playing for weeks to come.As much as I love this game I did however have one problem with the final puzzle in the game. Without spoiling anything I'd like to say that I found this specific puzzle to be pretty poor. This is because in order to complete it you need to have completed it pretty much 100% on your first try, otherwise you will have to google the answer. While this wouldn't be a bad thing if you could back track and look for clues, you are instead stuck on the final screen until you solve the final puzzle. Personally I did not get 100% on my first run through and instead had to google the answer after a while and I'm sad to say that even if I had really thought about it for a long time I would never have gotten past this screen because I missed a couple of parts. This could reasily have been solved by only making the mandatory sections part of this puzzle. However they didn't and therefore it ended on less of a ""Yay I beat  the game!"" and more of a ""How was I supposed to ever get that?"".Overall I would still very much recomend this game to anyone, especially for the price it is currently at. Plus it has steam trading cards which is nice too.			"

												Finding teddy is a compelling, short, and surreal point and click adventure game. It has weird puzzles that are quite strange but still in the realm of sanity. You can reasonably be expected to solve them by yourself. HOWEVER and that can be a real issue, there are quite a few musical puzzles in there. And if you're hopeslessly and utterly tone deaf like me it can be infuriating and unsolvable. I feel the store page should mention this in some way.			"

												It's a side view point & click adventure game. The 8bit graphic reminds FEZ but the game style is actually more like The Cat Lady. If the way of control isn't point & click, then it would be much look like FEZ. Anyway the puzzles of the game are based on alphabet. Player has to put codes which are in fact alphabets together to solve the puzzles. I realize that middle of gaming so until then I solve them only with the tone of sound effect which makes noise when I click the codes. And that was pretty difficult even for me who studies composing.To put it simply about the game, it's not that bad but it's also not that fun. The idea might be fine but it doesn't make much fun. There is no message which the story gives and even the gamplay doesn't give much fun, though the game is cheap. ;P			"

												Finding Teddy has a lot going for it stylistically, but almost every other area of the game is a mess. Despite the obvious care that went into the audio/visuals, it faceplants as both a puzzle game and as a point-and-click. Right off the bat and throughout the game, the controls are clunky and unresponsive.  Hitboxes of things that you need to click on range from bullseye exact to so wide that you'll activate them by clicking on them from out of state. Even those things pale in comparison to the awful music-note GUI. Arguably the key feature of the game is the ability to sing notes...that aren't visible to you from your note selection screen until you've solved some puzzle that they're involved in. The result is you're trying to solve puzzles with a palette comprised of some notes you can see and some you can't - until the very end of the game where you're essentially rewarded with a GUI that would have made the entire game more playable.Keyword there is ""more.""It's really not clear to me who this game is for. The cutesy but foreboding world seems to be reaching for a kind of LIMBO or more likely Dreaming Sarah vibe (both much better games worth exploring, FYI), but erring on the cutesy side. And yet this game is not for kids. Not because it will give them nightmares, but because they'll waste their precious young lives trying to figure out poorly-conceived puzzles. The puzzles in this game jump from embarrassingly straightforward to face-scrunchingly obtuse, often with no transition between the two depending on what you have to do next. You'll lose even more time eliminating solutions you thought you'd tried only to find later the absurdly demanding hitboxes actually never picked up your earlier attempt. The lack of widescreen support adds insult to injury since it hampers enjoyment of the one area the game excels in. On the other hand, it's probably a moot point: even huge pixel art fans should just leave Teddy for dead.			"

												As much as I recommend this game for being a quality product that works for what it does, Finding Teddy just isn't without its issues.It's a point and click adventure game, but the movement is heavily restricted. You don't just click to walk somewhere, you only move when transitioning screens or picking up items, and you can't cancel these actions. So if you accidentally click on a transitional hitbox while clicking around for one of the game's many hidden collectibles, you're stuck moving.The game also tells you nothing. I don't know what's with these types of games telling you nothing about their story and their mechanics but it works as well for this game as it did for Hyper Light Drifter (read: not very). Like that game, there's also a made-up language you have to learn. Mercifully it doesn't require a language course to master and is mostly based in regular alphebeticals, but it relies heavily on sound cues. So if you aren't good with sounds, you're not gonna have a fun time.The game is also far too short. Not in the good way either, the only reason I barely scraped the two hour mark was because the game was so hard to figure out and I played it a second time in New Game+. I'd recommend the far longer (and far superior) sequel in comparison to this, but for what it's worth it's a great game if you really want it.			"

The game gives you good puzzles to think about and even rewards you with pieces of artwork at the end. There are multiple endings to explore depending on your choices throughout the game. Although the game itself does not require a lot of playtime, you will need some time to think about the puzzles. I strongly recommend buying this game and also getting the Soundtrack DLC.			"

												Un premier opus Point'n Click introductif à un futur univers coloré et ambitieux. Malgré ses lacunes en soud design (absences et bruitages manquants), l'environnement visuel suffit pour l'immersion.Le second est en disponible, inratable !			"

												( this is probably one of my favorite games in my library so i might be biased, anyway: ) this is a really charming point & click adventure. visually, it's another indie title with pixel graphics, but the composition and color pallette help it to stand out from the rest. this combined with the sounds and music, only add to the atmosphere. the soundtrack is soothing and calming, which is a nice backdrop for all the puzzle solving.the main mechanic involves a music note system. you'll be relying pretty heavily on your ears, at least at first, especially if you want to unlock all the achievements. difficulty-wise, it's pretty easy. most of the time. the only thing that might cause you real trouble is the very end. there are guides in case you get stuck though.  it's not that long, but there's a new game+ option for completionists ( or if you can't get enough of it ). - TIPS - * double-click to run* don't be afraid to die* this is part one of two* buy this game			"

												a short and simple point and click story about a little girl, who goes on an adventure, trying to save her teddy bear. everything feels quite simple in it's form, from the art to the music, but there's some charm about it that keeps you playing.the puzzles arent that tough, although it might take you a bit of time to figure out how it actually works; and when you do, it becomes quite easy to solve most of them.overall a pleasant journey, with a sweet tale, worth investing a couple of hours into (it's that short).

TL;DRA nice point-n'-click adventure. Not really a puzzle p-n'-c, but more of an atmospheric one. Gameplay takes around an hour, which isn't bad for the normal price of $7.Web of FriendshipStoryline is pretty generic, little girl gets teddy bear stolen and gets transported to Narnia a forest and proceeds to be helpful. That said, the art is very well done, and you can tell the developers packed a lot of love into the game. The animations are very smooth, and the little attentions to detail really take the cake.My one complaint is that I feel like they must've ran out of time to complete the game. You unlock a musical alphabet throughout the game, and finishing the game really only requires half of the letters. I feel like it must've been planned for the player to unlock all the letters during the gameplay, but those sections of the game were either trimmed or never completed. Also supporting this train of thought is the fact you have 6 item slots, but will never have 6 items at once. The extra letters you're missing when you finish the game just get added to your codex when you spin up a New Game+ (which also feels a little out of place as nothing changes between the original and NG+ versions of the story.)Overall, the experience was enjoyable for the price I paid ($1.79 on sale). You definitely don't have to play NG+ to get the whole game, that's only if you're an achievement hunter and want that juicy 100%.BreakdownPros No Suffocation: good atmospheric game DJ Speed It Up: pretty fast game, doesn't overstay its welcomeCons Unmeaningful NG+: why have new game+ if it's just for some achievements?Score: 8/10			"
