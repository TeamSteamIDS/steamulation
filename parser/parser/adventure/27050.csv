												This is not a game.  It doesn't play like a game.  Do not buy this expecting a ""progression"", or puzzles, or a clear and obvious story.  If you're wanting a vide-game, I don't recommend that you buy this at all.This more like a small art exhibit.  Like the description states, it is intended as a ""living tableau"".  If you're willing to pay $7.00 to see an interactive art exhibit inspired by the story of John the Baptist, Salome and the Dance of the Seven Veils, then buy this and enjoy.  If you're looking for a video game to play and win, I don't recommend purchasing this.			"

												While turning Wilde's ""Salome"" into a short art video game might seem like a strange undertaking, I think the play's thematic content could provide enough material to merit worthwhile exploration via the language of game mechanics. However, FATALE's message is ultimately muddled. Rather than grabbing onto the play's theme most suited to exploration in video game form (e.g. its obsession with the danger of ""looking"" and its positioning of the aesthetic gaze as, paradoxically, both creative/reverent and destructive/dehumanizing), FATALE instead spends most of its 20 minute running time on plot and a conceptually murky sequence where the player extinguishes candles on a static 3D tableau. Thus, ultimately the game plays like a hollow bit of 3D diorama--with the candles just being an excuse to get the player to look at different parts of the scene. An interesting and often pretty experiment, but ultimately vague and underwhelming, both as a game and as a commentary on Wilde's play.			"

												(I played in off-line mode, so the play time should be 3hrs)To the haters: Does it make you feel better if you don't consider it as a video game?Fatale is still my favorite, because I think it's the best example of interpretation and it shows new possibilities of art pieces in multimedia, I'd like to see more this kind but not labeled as games. I said it’s a powerful poem when I first played it years ago, Fatale is belongs to those “serious, deep and sad things” I always like. It’s perfect in its own, but yes it’s horrible.And they updated it this year make it has another feeling, more emphasis on the text by Oscar Wilde, more understanding the story. I appreciate they updated those old artworks, it made me think they still keep their early ideas of making digital artworks, though I know they’re going to change under the big pressure of contemporary game circles, obviously people have strong opinion about what is a game and what is not, then refuse to accept new possibilities, it's just a wrong place for non-games. Even I feel the pressure writing this review, too many people rate down and give negative comments.I love all of ToT's artworks. Steam is a place for mainstream gamers not a place for serious conversations, but I have to say a few words in the end, people who describe them as ""pretentious"" please read more information before judging. They're never pretentious because they know what they are doing, their works are true and explicable, no one ""trying to seem more intellectuall"" than they really are.			"

												Tale of Tales, developer of masterpieces such as The Graveyard, Bientôt l’été, and The Path, has once again invented a simply ingenious, unique, and spiritualistic piece of art with FATALE. Their endless ambition and imagination can easily be seen with the amount of care they put into their projects. They are simply a once in a lifetime experience, and for all the effort that Tale of Tales puts into their work, the payoff is almost infinite.For instance, as of this writing, Tale of Tales has priced The Graveyard at a fair $4.99, and it takes less than 20 minutes to complete the game in its entirety. I actually managed to beat Bientôt l’été in a whopping 80 minutes, and it's priced at only $9.99. With FATALE, at only $6.99, it took me a very fulfilling half hour to reach the end. What amazing value!Meanwhile there are developers who think they can hock games such as The Binding of Isaac for an exorbitant $4.99, of which I've only managed to squeeze over 50 hours of gameplay and I haven't even completed the game yet. What a joke.Don't forget that Tale of Tales introduces highly intuitive controls with each iteration of magnificent gaming art. Thank god I can now only move my head while holding the left-mouse button, which also causes me to walk forward at the same time. I could never understand wanting to keep still while being able to freely look by solely moving the mouse around. Primitive WASD scheme is completely thrown out the door, and good riddance. Half-Life 2 has nothing on FATALE when it comes to traditional game mechanics.If you haven't done so already, you simply owe it to yourself to play every single one of Tale of Tales' amazing artworks. It's like trying to suck your own ♥♥♥♥ and failing, but that small glimmer of hope is the only thing that motivates you to continue trying. Just once more inch.Until you break your neck.Then you definitely know it was all worth it./s			"

												I'm recommedning the game, but don't even consider buying it unless you understand what it is.  Putting that  into words is a bit of a challenge though.  As concisely as possible, I might describe it as: ""A single, one-hour, self-guided exhibit in the local museum of contemporary art.""  As you might expect from that summary, I'm not trying to claim that it's for everyone.  But an unusual way to relax in a single-sitting.			"

Games as an art form!I'm going to say this again, in case anyone hasn't read my reviews before - I friggin' love art games. This one may be the arty-est. Well, actually, I'm not going to say that. The difference between the arty-est and farty-est of games and this is that this has some elements that can actually cause you to see it as a game. Tale of Tales isn't known for being the most accessible of game developers, at least where this sort of thing is concerned. What's good about it?The graphics are gorgeous in a primitive way, and I would compare them to The Path (another ToT title) in terms of actual quality. As always, the soundtrack is superb in getting across what it wants to, but I can't help but be upset that this isn't a DLC - because I would probably pay a dollar for it. The soundtrack is the best part of it, and it bears mentioning because it carries a strange post-Swans Jarboe/Tom Waits in an ashram feel to it oddly plopped into some nameless middle-Eastern country and peppered with some modern instruments to make your liver quiver. I half expected a duet between the indie art goddess and the god of Bruce Springsteen's career to come leaping out of my speakers at the same time, causing a bizarre existential crisis that would coexist with my current one, and ultimately lead to me going crazy. Things I didn't like...The fact that I do not need Tom Waits and Jarboe to sing a duet and drive me to the point of an existential crisis, because if I had to light one more friggin' candle, I was going to light my own hair on fire and scream for someone to hold the nameless unexplaind darkness over it to put it out. Then, I would dance traditionally without a shirt on so I could lead the non-Oscar Wilde reading bible crowd to describe it as, ""erotic,"" and attempt to censor it. Final Verdict:Look, this game is worth your time and your buy, especially if you want to be in awe for an hour or so of your life, but if you're not into art games and weird clanky noises laid underneath of some of the oddest non-standard chord progressions, you're not going to like it. For me this is a solid 7.5/10, and as an art piece I'll probably revisit it later, but it's not something I'm going to sit in front of my computer and think, ""Oh, I have an extra few hours to kill, maybe I'll just open Fatale and put out some stupid candles.""

												I got this exploration game because of ""The Path"" being an awesome game and the screenshots look gorgeous in ""Fatale"". Apparently, my high expectations for this was shut down with wonky controls and nothing much to explore within the landscape. Yes, the scenery was beautiful, yet that's just about it. This could have had more potential...but apparently this potential wasn't what this was going for. If you miss picking up this game on Steam, then don't worry about it. It's one of those games that would go in the garbage bin and no one would care for it.			"

												Not a game. This isn't a game. This is some kind of pretentious interactive experience with obtuse narrative and no goal at all. It's just about 30 minutes of roaming around two places, reading a few texts and completing one minigame. It tries to tell a story, yes, but it's terrible at it. Technically is also quite terrible, but that doesn''t even matter. It could have Crysis 3 graphics, and still would be terribly annoying. If you wanna try it, bear in mind that this is not a game, and wait until it's on sale. Then it will still be a pretentious waste, but a cheap pretentious waste.			"

												First off, for those who have never played a Tale of Tales game before, do not expect a standard game. There will be no plot, no challenging gameplay, no achievements to hunt for. This is not a game. This is an experience.That being said, it is not neccesarily a good experience. The game is about setting up an atmosphere, trying to be an interactive piece of art. However, the only real emotion I felt during the game was confusion, because I had no idea what I was supposed to do. And while some people might huff and reply that clearly I don't GET the game, that I shouldn't judge Fatale by the same standards I judge the common man's shoot 'em up, I am going to stand my ground and say that if the goal of a game is not clear, then it will be difficult for players to get anything out of the experience, because they will just be confused. Unlike The Path, which rewarded players for blindly wandering around, this game provides no direction. It is trying really hard to be artsy, I get that, but it is FAILING.

Also, I don't know why the company is called Tale of Tales, they don't actually tell any tales. There's no story. There's no narrative. I can't beleive I played this game for almost two hours.

												There's one glaring problem with Fatale. If it's suppose to be a game, then it's a terrible game, with no playability and embarrassingly bad controls. If it's an interactive art exhibit, then it's a beautiful installation, based on a play by Oscar Wild. It deals with life after death, and toys with the idea of there being an awkward transition between this world and the next.So, if you want a ""survival horror"" game, you're going to be disappointed.But, if you want to have a brief, artsy experience, go play The Path.Seriously, this game is only a tiny bit longer than The Graveyard.

												I am a fan of Tale of Tales games, and also a fan of strange games in general, especially admirable looking ones. I liked the game very much, especially the second chapter, but, really, it's a very special genre, and it can't just be taken by everyone. Salome, by herself, was a horrible person, irrational one, partially mad and erratic. This line feels really good in this game. You watch the story of her madcap deed, while Salome stays romantic and proudful, and that is amazing and shivering. I recommend this game as an interactive painting of the story, with which you should be familiar. Than you will find it perfect.			"

												A very calming game that doesn't really have alot to it, its more of an account of history then a game. The simple puzzles are simple. The artwork in the game is interesting. The music is very nice to listen to and very Arabic. There are 3 levels to this game and each level has its own thing it does. The Exploring Salome is about the Daughter of Herodias who was queen of Chalcis and Armenia Minor. The name Salome means ""peace"" in Hebrew. Salome is a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. B. In the Bible, Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. Most of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event, when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts. The overall game is wonderful and very tastefully creative.			"

												This was a very weird experience despite it being short. It's an interactive exploratory hub if I would describe it accurately. I can't call it a game since it is like a piece of art to be examined from different angles and you'd see something that would mean something to you... Or doesn't mean anything at all. I'm glad I got it on sale though. I would not recommend it on full price.			"

												Please read all the way through this review before jumping on me for the ""yes"". You'll thank me for it.Um... I bought this game at the time because it was one of the cheapest games I could find on steam. I don't quite think I got my money's worth. The description said that it continued the plot of a certain play... but it didn't really continue it from what I could tell, so much as just tack on one final scene. It's got some pretty scenery though, but it feels like the authors fell (very) short of their goal. It feels like they wanted  do something bigger and grander.However, I'd still suggest buying it for the game connoisseur, as it does serve as a fair lower benchmark for judging a gaming experience. Kind of like comparing the sizes of states or countries to Rhode Island. Rhode Island isn't big, but it's a good benchmark for size. FATALE fell short of its vision, but its dirt-cheap, and that makes a good tool to judge other games by. Short version: On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate this game a 1, but It's a cheap way to get to truely know what a 1-rated game is like, and in turn, it will help you appreciate all your other games that much more. This game is to videogames what ""The Room"" or ""Star Wars Christmas Special"" is to cinema. It's not the ""so bad it's good"" but it passes right out the other side to where it's really REALLY bad. But, like I said, it gives you a chance to really appreciate what a bad game is, so you aren't tempted to call a ""good but not as good as you wanted"" game a bad game.			"

												This is not a game. It is not a graphic novel. What is it? Somewhat less boring than The Graveyard, but at $7, it is a rip off!			"

												Tales of tales best game yet.They have been trying(and In my opinon failing) to make intuitive artistic experinces for a while but this one, is actually worth your time. Short yet very cool, this is no old lady dying in a graveyard and its even more fun than playing as a girl who gets ♥♥♥♥♥ in the woods.  "

												uhhh, WTF was this. A voyeurs view of the Salome story from the Bible. Took approximatly 15 minutes to ""beat"". You basically are supposed to move around and click on things. THAT'S IT. All you do. Click on this barrel, click on this candle, watch the dancer..... it's pretty to look at and weirdartsy , don't spend $7 on it, it's not worth it.At least buy it with The Path or something interesting.

When i think of the developers of this ""game"", a couple words come to mind: thieves, pickpockets, bums. If you are going to flush your money away, you will get more value wiping your ♥♥♥ with the money than buying this pile of crap. I suppose the game can be an example of what not to do in a game. Don't give us a character to play. Don't give us a challenge. And please don't give us a lot to do. In this busy world, anything more than 2 hours of game play is a waste. Right? Forget those games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim that give you hundreds of hours of things to do. No need to play challenging games like Darksouls. This game has only one challenge: finding the point. Fatale is nihilism encapsuled in a game: nothing to achieve, nothing to do, nothing to be.   "

												If you love RPGs with deep and complex stories, with many heavy and thoughtful moral choices, then Fatale by the masters from Tale of Tales is the game for you. With hours of engrossing combat and dialogue, as well as numerous sidequests that feel just as weighty and important as the main quest itself.My only complaint is that the companions you pick up during your travels can feel lifeless and forgotten; I would suggest perhaps adding the companion wheel from Fallout: New Vegas, as well as more dialogue options once you've recruited them. But that's just a minor complaint that in no way detracts from the main game itself. You will find yourself losing hours and hours to this game.			"

												Don't EVER buy this... I don't mind the lack of interactivity as usually the story or environments make up for it. Sadly in this case there was neither there to make it a worthwhile purchase. This has to be one of the worst experiences that I've ever had to the displeasure of interacting with. The visuals are neither pretty or interesting. The story is pretty much non-existant. There's some poorly rendered words that appear on screen as an attempt to give some context but instead is confusing. The only interactivity in the game was a strange candle section where you had to light them all. I don't know what the significance was but it was awkward to navigate and not at all enjoyable.Please don't waste your money on this. Even if it goes on sale. Stay away. It's really not worth it.

												This game is like a vision, a dream. It is quite short, and confusing, and technically limited, but is intriguing, and beautiful.Point & click exploration, with a pinch of Oscar Wilde. The controls are odd (even frustrating), but this somehow lends to the style. And if I understand the story correctly, you have died, so it works that you can't control your new form very well.Not a must-see, but I found it a tasty little treat. "

												Is it wrong that I want to call this game 'Candle Extinguisher Simulator'?I really want to like Fatale. After being so impressed with The Path and considering how fascinating the concept of Fatale is (I like the idea of exploring someone like Salome through an interactive medium) this seemed like it would at least be an interesting experience. And there are things to enjoy! The art-style is nice, the soundtrack is great to listen to and that dance epilogue... oh wow! That is quite possibly the most beautiful piece of 3d animation I have ever seen.But I cannot take this game seriously, at all. I took my time, I explored each section and I even did three playthroughs in case I missed something, yet still this game doesn't do anything for me. The control is strange because it's open yet still limited (I really wanted to go down those stairs into the ocean), there isn't that much to really examine and the whispers/bits of poetry are pretty... but they don't seem to mean anything. I know this is an interactive art experience that won't appeal to everyone, yet it feels like what the description promised didn't come to fruition in the gameplay. Instead of falling in love with Salome, I was saying 'WHAT?!' over and over while staring at the screen incredulously. Anyone who did enjoy the game please tell me what your experience was like, because if there's something that's completely going over my head I'm more than happy to give it another chance. But as it stands... I cannot recommend this game.			"

												6.99 my ♥♥♥!So I stand around locked in a room for a few minutes intill some dude cuts me down then I'm a ghost for 5 minutes floating around and then game over. Wish I had bought this after Valve came up with the refund policy but sadly no.			"
