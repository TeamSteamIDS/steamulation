												Take Persona 3/4, remove the heavy story and dungeon crawling gameplay, keep the daily calendar grind/choices and the social links, but add lots of puns to 'em and bam, you've got Cherry Tree High Comedy Club! It's alright, but it feels like there's something missing, like all you get to see is a small part of a much bigger story.			"

												This was a charming little experience! It could be described as Persona 3/4 without the drama and battling, or as a platonic dating sim, if you're into that sort of thing. Expect some routine anime shenanigans, with characters deep enough to be interesting. It's a very lighthearted, easy-going game, but all the characters feel ""real"" enough to give it sufficient depth.My first playthrough took about four hours, and my second around two and a half. It's not a long game, but it's full of characters and personality, like a town from Paper Mario: tTYD, you can keep coming back to people for new looks at them. The game emphasizes making friends and being a well-rounded individual, which I think is as good a moral as you could get. I do wish there had been some forewarning about some aspects of the relationship-building dialogues. For example, you can only discuss a topic once with a ""target,"" for the entire playthrough. Of course, this isn't a huge obstacle, and it only makes the game have stronger replay value.Don't count on much action, or even multiple dialogue options. All of the gameplay focuses on skill-building, time management, and selecting good topics of conversation. This is simply a great game for those looking for solid characters and friendships in a quirky, somewhat-cliche anime setting. If there's a sequel coming out any time soon, as the end of the game implies, I'm very excited for it!			"

												I am Miley; the overly enthusiastic type of anime protagonist.My goal is to stalk 6 people who don't really want to join and nag them to join my Comedy Club while they deal with some actual issues. I have a friend called Harriet who I have decided to sign up to my club despite her lack of interesting and her having a part time job because I am more important.First was Sara; she is the quiet one who I follow about while she deals with her psychological issues; I got her to open up by knowing a lot about mystery novels which I had spent all night reading.Next was May; she is the cute little one who wants to develop a chest and is dealing with some serious choices about her families future; she decided to resolve them and join my club after I played some video games and stopped being such a NOOB.Next was my friend Cindy who was following her dream; through a combination of guilt playing and following her she finally gives in and joins me.My next target was Vivian, the hockey star who gets ill from people bothering her; I continue to bother her until she joins me through Stockholm Syndrome, ironic as she is Swedish.Tyler was stalking my friend; I give a potentially dangerous stranger my friends number without her permission and use Harriet to effectively trick him into joining. That's okay though, because I am too selfish to care.Then there is Male Student. He has a name, but you are supposed to talk to his father, hunt down his name through school and then ignore him not wanting to talk to me by threatening his social life until he joins my club.By doing all of this, I got the good ending.

EDIT: In the last few weeks since I played this game a dewesternised version has come out, which I have yet to play. I will update this review once I've played the new version, but I think most of my points are still valid.+ Free demo!+ No bugs whatsoever!+ You can transfer your Repertoire plus Targets' likes and dislikes to the next save file.+ ...So if you didn't make it the first time, you'll definitely get a good ending with the next playthrough.+ There is a sequel, which is out now!+/- 2 hours per playthrough.+/- Sugary sweet story, very innocent.+/- Perfect for kids.+/- In the westernised version, the translation is aimed at Americans who don't (necessarily) know anything about Japanese culture, even though there are shrines and cherry blossoms - but it works nonetheless.+/- In the westernised version, there are lots of references to (American) pop culture.+/- Simple art style, quite nice but not eye poppingly awesome.- Repetitive gameplay.- Not very original in its genre, both with gameplay and characters.- 2.5 playthroughs needed for full completion and no way to skip the last week or two (which is annoying if you've finished both your Repertoire and your Target list halfway through April).Conclusion: not very original, but still enjoyable. Get it on sale.(I played it while offline, so Steam didn't register my gaming time. :< )			"

												First off; I am going to say it is like a dating sim, in that you build relationships and meet people.The game is simple and doesn't try to be anything else, it doesn't shoe-horn in mini games to pass time, it tells a story and introduces you to interesting and funny characters; the more you learn of, the more you discover how deep they all are.The game can be tough, you play a highschool student and have to maintain homework, limit fatigue and all while also trying to maintain knowledge of various topics to discuss with potential friends and peers.If you want a visual novel type story with plenty of interaction and decent length of gameplay, pick this game up			"

												The goal of CTHCC is to befriend the game's characters well enough to join the school club. If you've played Persona 4, the gameplay of CTHCC tries very hard to be the town segments of that game. You train certain skills to relate to people better, then talk to them as much as possible in order to become friends with them, see their stories, and finally convice them to join. Oddly, you never actually perform any comedy in the game, because it ends on the club registration deadline.CTHCC is definitely not anywhere near Persona 4, but most games aren't. Unfortunately, this game has the weaknesses of P4's town gameplay as well. It's very repetitive. The music would be decent for this game if it wasn't repeated over and over ad nauseum. But, this game's strength is the character-driven story. While the characters are not near the level of P4, they were better than I expected them to be, though I wish they had more chit-chat dialogue.This game has some display issues. Alt+Enter is the only way to make it fullscreen, and even then it doesn't work well. The art is decent otherwise, for being 2D still images. CTHCC controls well enough.CTHCC is an okay way to kill an hour or two, but I was getting bored by the end of my three hour playthrough. I wouldn't pay much for it, though. Wait for a 75% off sale if this sounds interesting to you. If not, you're not missing too much by choosing to skip this game.			"

												Warning: Lengthy review incoming!Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is an interactive visual novel with the gameplay of a dating simulator.Before I get into the review, I want you to know, that I played the westernized localization of the game. I’m going to talk about this in a little bit more detail at a later point of this review.You play as Miley Verisse, a young comedy fanatic, who’s planning on forming her very own Comedy Club at her school. Miley’s roommate has already been compelled to join the club, but the problem is that school clubs have a minimum number of required members, which means that Miley has to find three more people to join her club until the end of the club trial period. That means you’ve got two months to manipulate and befriend as many people as possible. This is where the dating simulator gameplay comes in. There are six different characters that can be recruited and you befriend them by talking to them about different topics. You raise your skill levels by reading magazines or visiting places and occasionally you can also find random stuff on the ground that raises your skills as well. The higher your skill for “fashion” for example is, the more the friendship level of a character will be raised when talking to them about this topic.This type of gameplay can get a bit repetitive, since you do the same thing every day. You get up, talk to a character, talk to another character, watch some TV and the day is over. Repeat until some special event happens or until the friendship level of a character rises.To get a character to join your club you have to get them to friendship level 5, which is pretty much impossible to do for all 6 characters in the first playthrough. Fortunately there is a new game+, which allows you to keep all your skills and only resets your friendship levels.The whole game has a lot of jokes, because, you know… Miley’s a comedy enthusiast and stuff.There were some jokes that are right up my alley that I found really amusing and then there were some others that just fell flat for me.The characters are rather diverse and even though some of them seem pretty spineless in the beginning, you find out that they have a really interesting background story after befriending them. On the other hand, there are also some characters that still seem rather spineless after you convince them to join your club and their background story is by far not as interesting as you’d expect.A big problem I had with the game is, that it only supports a resolution of 640x480 and if you want to play it in fullscreen mode, the game window gets stretched to fit the height of your screen and you get two beautiful black bars next to the game to fill your screen. The settings of the game are also pretty limited, but hey, it’s a visual novel and not some fancy AAA game title, so I guess that’s expectable.At the time I bought this game, no original version was available in English, only the westernized version, with different names and locations.With the release of the sequel of Cherry Tree High Comedy Club on Steam we finally get to play the game in English with the original names and the same places as in the Japanese version of the game.For example, Miley turns into Mairu and Cindy suddenly is called Haru. Also, chilli dogs turn into rice omelets, because, you know, western people only know chilly dogs and can’t comprehend rice omelets or something.All those extremely western sounding names feel a bit out of place, because everything feels so Japanese and all those cherry trees in the background for example definitely don’t make me feel like I’m in the US either.I’m going to be completely honest with you: Cherry Tree High Comedy Club was the first visual novel I ever played, so I might judge this game a lot differently than some of you visual novel veterans out there but for someone new to this type of medium, this game was a really good entry point and even if you’re usually not a big fan of those type of games, you might still enjoy all those cute characters and the nice setting.The multiple endings and the new game+ give the rather short game some replayability, since you will not be satisfied with only knowing the background story of for example 3 of the characters but you will want to know the background story of all of them, even though they might not be as interesting as you’d expect.All in all, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a pretty decent visual novel for veterans and casuals in this medium. It might have its flaws but it is still a really enjoyable game to waste some time with.If you’re a diehard action fan who needs explosions, headshots and a lot of gore to enjoy a video game, or someone who detests reading and dislikes games that heavily rely on text in general, you might want to sit this one out.Everybody else:Should you play Cherry Tree High Comedy Club?Yes. Yes you should. "

												The way most people will relate to this game is ""Persona 3/4 without RPG battles,"" and they wouldn't really be wrong, aside from the fact that the Persona games did NOT invent this type of game. Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a fairly harmless and middling dating sim'esque adventure that, despite its colorful cast of characters, has almost no personality at all. It's locked into fairly standard anime tropes and character archetypes, and for a game about a girl that wants to start a comedy club, lacks even one moment of genuine humor. The localization is fairly offensive too in how it tries to portray the game as taking place in America, even though all of the world's locations (the high school, the shrine) are clearly Japanese. This is 4-kids level, straight out of the 1990s localization that isn't even so bad it's good. Again, it's harmless, but completely mediocre. The cheap price point may be good for those curious about these kinds of games, but I'm really not sure why, of all the doujin titles Nyu Media could have grabbed, this is the one they wanted.			"

												I've never really played a ""visual novel"" style game like this before, but for my first time I really enjoyed the offerings. Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a feel-good story about Mairu Hibisu, your typical 'I Wanna Be Hokage' type protagonist who dreams of becoming the next big international comedy senstation. Re-opening her school's defunct comedy club is the first stepping stone to her dreams; however, in order to form a club at CTH you need to have at least three members who want to sign up. And this is where the fun comes in!CTHCC is essentially Persona Social Links The Game, but it puts its own cute little twist on things. You run around town discovering new students to harass and blackmail into joining your club hopefully recruit, and as you get to know each of the students you meet, you'll begin to level up your social standing with them. Get to know them well enough, and they'll eventually give in to your constant hounding join up.One feature I really liked was how by talking to each character on a daily basis, you start picking up clues as to which converational topics they may or may not like. Some are made obvious, and some not so much. You also do better talking to students by increasing what you know about each of the conversation subjects. There are loads of ways to do this, from heading to the cinema or reading magazines in the library, to spending time at the arcade or listening to that weekend's guest speaker at the art gallery. There's genuinely loads to do all over town and many day/time specific events, which I personally enjoyed as it encourages you to get to know and care about the places & people you're interacting with.I also really loved the variety in each character's story, which starts to unfold as you level up your social standing with them. No story was similar and many were quite serious at times, but the sprites and character art remained adorable throughout, making it pretty hard not to find yourself endeared to everyone by the end. There's also a little re-playability value with the New Game+ mode (where you can start a new game with the stats you built up from the last one), but as CTHCC is just a quick bit of cutesy fun, you probably won't be picking it back up once you're done with it unless you want to see the perfect ending. Would highly recommend this as a great introductory game to the visual novel genre.Quick sidenote: if you're looking for pantsu, this really isn't it. There are absolutely zero romantic interactions with any character, which I was more than happy with but I understand would be a turn-off for some.			"

												You know, if you make a game about a comedy club, you really should make it funny. This is basically a resource management sim with some social interaction which never really hits home. Presentation is pretty nice, but the rest of the game kind of meanders along and doesn't go anywhere.If you really like the art style and have an urgent need to burn some time, you could do worse, I guess.

												Basically a dating sim where instead of dating, you're trying to recruit people to join your club.  People compare it to Persona 3 because it has that ""social link"" aspect that Persona 3 has, but it's really different in tone.  It's very light-hearted-- not a bad thing, but when the game does try to take a slightly more serious tone, it's just awkward.  That didn't bother me too much, though.  My favorite thing about the game actually was how light-hearted it was, it's very cute.  The main problem is that it's just way too short and simplistic.  The point is to level up your relationship with different characters by talking to them.  You do this by selecting from a pool of conversation topics (like ""art"", ""pets"", ""music"", etc.)-- if the character likes the topic, your relationship improves.  After your relationship improves by a certain amount, it levels up and you get to see a cutscene.However, there's not much to indicate what topics you should talk about and what you shouldn't.  You can probably figure out maybe one or two of the topics that are good for each person by paying attention to the story, but the rest just seem like random guessing.  It'd be much more enjoyable if there was a logical clue for each topic + character, but I guess they couldn't do that since there were so many topics.  They should've really just had less of them.The other big issue is that it's just really lame when you try to talk to somebody about a topic, and all the dialogue says is ""You talked about X topic with Y.  Y loves to talk about X!""  It would've been more interesting to read if there was actually conversation between the characters about each topic.  The dialogue that's in the game is actually not bad (I played the westernized version), there just needs to be more of it.  As of now, it's too robotic and boring.If you're a big fan of dating sims and got the game in a bundle, maybe it's worth playing through once just because it's cute.  I wouldn't recommend buying it outside of a bundle, though.			"

												I only bought this game because it's a japanese simulation game, and I'm a real fan of the genre.The idea is cute, pretty much like in Magical Diary - you make friends in order to recruit members for your club. The problem is, this game seems dull and boring. After playing more complex games, such as Long Live The Queen, Recettear and even Magical Diary, this game simply pales in comparison - *big time*!I'm not completely sure, I've only been playing for an hour or so, so I'm probably going to give it some more time, hoping it'll surprise me. I promise to update this review if I ever change my mind about this game, but so far, I don't like it at all. If you like games like that, better go for a better one, such as the examples I mentioned above.			"

												Recommended for anyone who wants to read + play a relaxing and comical adventure. I loved to visit the various characters in the town or at school every day to discover what funny or cute things they are going to tell this time (they also provide plenty of background information by the way!). This is a no-drama, slice-of-life interactive VN, with charming characters to meet; building up your various communication skills/stats to befriend them; there are different background music themes to set the mood in this colourful world. Did I mention the whacky shrine maiden? There are 2 modes to play this game in. I played the Japanese localisation version which I wholeheartedly recommend if you know and appreciate at least a few things about Japanese terms and culture. If you're not really well known with it, then perhaps the Westernized localisation is more suited to you.If you're not sure wether you'd enjoy this game, why not try out the demo ;)			"

												In Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, you play as Mairu, a high school student and aspiring comedian. In order to help bring comedy to the world, she sets out to restore her school's comedy club. But the student council president has a catch. Mairu must recruit at least five members in order to establish a new club. There is already herself and her best friend Hoemi, but she will need three more people to agree to join. Now Mairu must meet new people, make friends, and try to convince them to join her comedy club.As a note for this review, I played the so-called ""un-westernized"" version which retains the original Japanese names and some other cultural references, as opposed to the Americanized version.The main mechanic of this game is that you walk around town, meet people, and try to talk to them and make friends. This is mostly done by honing your conversation skills by learning about subjects to talk about through activities like reading magazines or watching television. You must also pay attention to your own concerns by completing homework on time, minimizing your fatigue level, and managing your money.To start off with some of the positive aspects of this game, I really enjoyed the artwork. The characters and backgrounds are very colorful and this aesthetic is pleasing to look at. The cartoony/anime style of the game really befits the more light-hearted nature of the story. I also liked the music used which is often up-beat.However, I was disappointed with some aspects of Cherry Tree High Comedy Club. The first would be the writing and characterization. While it is never really bad, it all just felt too generic most of the time. There are six potential recruits to chase after, but they mostly seem like clichés that I have seen before. As a result, none of the characters feel very memorable. Also, for a game about starting a comedy club, especially with a main character that loves jokes, I thought much of the humor fell flat. The gameplay also felt weak. I only played for a few hours as of this writing, but it was mostly just grinding in order to try to deepen Mairu's friendship with other characters. This quickly became boring. The general mechanics of the game were never really adequately explained which was frustrating for me. I went through on my play-through thinking I was doing what I was suppose to in order to make friends, but I ended up with a bad ending having failed to recruit a single member.This is not a terrible game and, believe me, I really tried to like it. The art style is very nice and the story is light-hearted, but I thought the gameplay was repetitive and boring with writing and characterization that felt inadequate. I paid the full price for this game and really expected more. Overall, this was just too average at best.			"

												Think of those old dating sims - you level up various abilities so you can talk to girls (or boys) better. Except instead of dating, you're trying to get them to join your comedy club. It sounds ridiculous, but it works!Miley's a hyperactive girl frantically trying to get three more members to join her club. The downside is people here actually read before they sign stuff, so she needs to get really friendly with them before they join up. The game is freakishly difficult for a dating sim the first time around: unless you have a walkthrough or know exactly what you're doing, you will probably fail. This is not a bad thing. But before you can get New Game+, be prepared to really slog it to just succeed.What kept me hooked was the writing and translation. The dialogue is hilarious; every character has charm and personality, and there are lots of great zingers during conversations. The translators have done a great job bringing this to a Western audience: think of the Samurai Pizza Cats, and you know the way they tackled this.Things I would change: skipping cutscene dialogue - there's a LOT of talking, which makes replaying the game tedious - and making it clear that if you use a conversation topic, it's only good once.

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is an interactive visual novel/adventure game where you play as Mairu, a girl during her last year as a student of Cherry Tree High, who is trying to reopen the Cherry Tree High Comedy Club. The game alternates between visual novel scenes and your own interactions with the world around you in side-scrolling fashion, as you level up your abilities and try to persuade at least 3 other people to join your club, in accordance with school rules. Buy magazines, go out for lunch, converse with others as level up your relationships, but hurry because you are running out of time for the submission deadline. Thumbs up to a fun interactive anime-type visual novel.			"

												Pros:- Cute and charming characters and art- Overall I found the writing cute and amusing- A visual novel that's about making friends instead of getting a date with hot anime grills - You have control over where you visit, who you talk to, and whenCons:- Native 480 resolution, I found it hard to get immersed this way- You cannot click to interact / select options, only arrow keys and space / enter- The timing is bad on dialogue progression and causes you to accidentally re-trigger the conversation sometimes- The mechancis of the game are complicated and not well-explained. I thought I was doing stuff right then didn't get any recruits at the end so apparently I am missing something. I would recommend looking up a guide before playing if you don't want to play the game over and over to figure out how to actually recruit people.The characters are pretty enjoyable and the pixel art is lovely, but the clunkiness of the game was too detracting for me. After I finished my playthrough and getting ""closer"" to a bunch of characters many times, I got 0/5 recruits I am very confused on how I was expected to play this game.I think if you're looking to try out a visual novel game there are better ones out there. However, if you really love visual novels and play them all the time you could very well still enjoy this one.			"

												There is nothing funny about this game. The jokes were either unfunny to begin with or they fall flat in translation. The game's mechanics depend on leveling up comedy stats over the course of a few months in order to befriend other barely cute anime girls. In practice, however, you spend a lot of time leveling up stats without ever using them for anything. Therefore, you are forced into a few hours of grinding before you find out if you're doing the right things or not. Even if you are, the payoff in this game is supposed to be the charecters and the humor. The humor has been adressed, and the charecters are all two demensional cookie cutters of anime girl sterotypes. I wanted to like this game, and I could have gotten past the unintuitive mechanics if the story or charecters brought anything to the table.			"

												*sigh*Well I beat the game. I didn't enjoy it but I completed it.I didn't think it was possible to mess up a visual novel but I guess it is.""Oh but x2Madda, this isn't a visual novel--"" Then what is it? Because I'll tell you what it isn't, fun!Cherry Tree is the tale of a girl trying to open a comedy club at school however she needs 5 members to be able to do so and her with her best friend are only 2 people. Recruit 3 more members out of a pool of 6 while finishing all your homework and balancing your fatigue or else you may collapse or fail class!That's what the advertising blurb said anyway. You get to move left and right on various screens and talk to NPCs but this isn't a platform game and the walking only serves to give the illusion of gameplay or to pick up various objects scattered around. The ""homework"" just serves to waste days and fatigue can be balanced very easily by just not wasting time working jobs. You see you have 40 days broken down into 3 time slots per day in order to make the potential recruits like you. However the only way to make them like you is to impress them with your various diplomatic actions which are influenced by your diplomatic skills which you increase by choosing a skill to level up, thus also eating into those precious time slots.This sounds like a game and it sounds like it could be good but the problem is that you can easily increase all your skills very high very quickly and recruit everyone with time to spare. You can also fail miserably if you try to actually engage with people instead of leveling up your skills so it reminds me of 'Long Live the Queen' but without the good writing. Or the fun.Speaking of writing, this is one of the most boring non-visual novels I have ever read. How do you even mess up a visual novel with a comedy setting? Well it has little jokes relying more on puns and memes and oh ho, before you accuse me of playing the westernized version, I am playing the Japanese translated version. I didn't enjoy playing the game. The music doesn't create any atmosphere, the story is sweet at its core but lacks any charm and the characters are believable but as soon as they joined I didn't feel any connection or want to engage with them further. Lastly the sound effects are from an open source sound bank so if you reconize some of them from other games (100% Oranage Juice) that would be the reason why.Really, the graphics are very good and I like the ideas that went into the game but it suffers poor executionHopefully the sequel which is a straight up visual novel, will remedy the issues I experienced here.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												A silly little game where you run around leveling skills and hoping that your efforts will be enough to succeed at recruiting 3 NPC's into a school comedy club. The gameplay can be a little frustrating in this regard because there is little to no room for error. But the characters are decent, their interactions are amusing, and the game isn't terribly long (2-3 hours) so if you screw up there isn't too much to replay. In short, it is a short silly little game that can amuse you for an evening or afternoon. Just don't go in expecting a great deal of depth and replayability, because you won't find that here. Still, it succeeds in what it sets out to do, and that's really all that is needed. :3			"

But to play it, you must manage what you will do wisely. Bcs the story of the game is you want to make a new club in your school and you have to recruit at least 3 people from 6 available in the deadline of 1 month + 1 week.It got good repetion if you want to get all 6 recruit as you can play New Game+ once you finish the game and it will continue your skill from the previous save game.I really recommended this game to all of you who like a light story or just want to pass time. Definitely you must try this game.			"

												You basically spam level your skills and then spam talk to people to raise your friendship level with them, just like your generic dating/social sim. There's nothing that really makes it stand out though, as there are different gameplay aspects sprinkled here and there like working and shopping, but they just don't effect the game enough to feel important enough to spend your 'time' on. The main appeal of the game, then, is to get to know the cast of random girls that you meet. While they could all be considered somewhat interesting in their own way, the game is pretty short so you don't spend all that long on each character. It just makes the relationships feel a little on the unnatural side when you're bombarded with deep-emotional-backstory type stuff about a character you barely know. If you like the dating sim model, but without the dating and without many interesting features, then I guess it's not terrible.			"

												I'm not usually one for time management games or dating sims, but CTHCC drew me in with its anime sensibility and comedic promise, before completely shattering my expectations.Befitting its comedy club premise, the dialogue is regularly chuckle-worthy, with moments of pure absurdist brilliance. (One example: ""I see now ... So that's why I like cannoli. That makes sense."" ""Wh... What are you talking about?"" ""It makes total sense."" ""Don't just end a conversation like that!"")That said, each of the major characters also has their own full story arc with actual emotional weight, ranging from coping with loss to coping with corporate encroachment. These topics are handled with surprising sensitivity, and display Mairu (Miley in the Westernized version) as more than a mere player avatar, with her own vulnerabilities occasionally surfacing... and then she'll make a lesbian joke, because deflecting is fun.The gameplay itself is broken down into distinct turns (seen here as morning/afternoon/evening), in which the player can explore the town freely before deciding on their ""move"" for that particular round. Thankfully, the developers provided enough content to avoid turning the skill-building process into a grind. Dozens of NPCs populate this world, some appearing only at specific times, and each spawning new dialogue on a daily or weekly basis, giving incentive to wander a bit before reading the next magazine or earning more yen.There are some minor bugs, such as character portraits being displayed with an incorrect outfit or NPCs referring to the previous week's guest lecturer as forthcoming. I played the deWesternized version, yet characters would sometimes lapse into their Westernized names, which is momentarily distracting but not nearly gamebreaking.You will most likely need at least a second playthrough in order to experience all six storylines, so the replayability is sufficient to justify the non-sale price, and I encountered new dialogue responses throughout my second run. I'm planning to try a third, attempting to generate the ""best"" ending without the benefit of the New Game+ option, before diving into the sequel... recruiting was just the beginning...			"

												Cute, but ultimately kind of lacking and unsatisfying, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club (or CTHCC) is simultaneously too short, yet too padded out. The stat raising system and the exploration of the city is actually quite charming in its own way, but ultimately only serves to needlessly lengthen the play time of a visual novel that, quite frankly, doesn't have much to read in it. The story builds up, but ends where it feels like it's only getting started.It never really managed to make me laugh; chuckle, at best, I'm afraid. Rather than think of it as a comedy, I'd more describe it as silly, light hearted slice of life... that said, in that regard, I've seen better media. Ultimately, though the writing and characters never especially  moved me or captured my heart (they're a little bit generic, as if hodge podged together from familiar tropes and little else) I think that I'm only left with that impression because the game isn't long enough to give anyone a character arc of satisfying length.Ultimately, it's kind of like playing a single month of Persona 3 or 4, minus the dungeon crawling JRPG side of things, but the fact that the stats never seem to matter for much and the scenes you unlock with characters never allows you to make any dialogue or action choices leaves the player feeling much more like an outsider to the experience. While that's fine for a visual novel, in this case it only contributed to the feeling that this VN was merely half done.All that said, I realize there's a sequel, and, since I did get it in a bundle with the original, I may change my opinion after playing that. Both are fairly cheap, so if I think of them as a bundle it may end up worth it. Nevertheless, CTHCC2 has a lot to make up for, and it's going to have to tremendously exceed the quality of experience the first game gave me if there's any chance I'm going to turn around my opinion on the series.

I literally don't even remember any of their names at this point just because I don;t really care about them.

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club (CTHCC) is a light VN with 2D side-scrolling exploration that applies traditional dating sim mechanics to non-romance subject matter. This approach to dating sims has only been notably applied in Persona 3 and 4, so naturally it draws a lot of comparisons.The dating-sim-esque format works a whole lot better here than it did in Persona. Mairu (or Miley, if you're a weirdo and chose the westernized version) is an actual character with her own personality, motives and ways of interacting with other characters (beyond being dead silent while other characters monologue to themselves for the entire game). Scenes where Mairu is strongarming people to bow to her own ulterior motives or genuinely relating to people with her own life experiences is infinitely more compelling than standing around while people sort out their own problems and attribute it to your intervention.Gameplay-wise, the 2D side-scrolling helps enforce the illusion of an explorable, breathing, homely town a hell of a lot more than the usual VN affair of disconnected backgrounds, and while the locales are noticeably limited the walking/running and interactions with optional NPCs is welcome. Generally, interacting with other recruitable NPCs involves finding them and opting to spend a block of the limited time you have with them, talking about one of 12 topics. The topics grey out after one use, and the NPCs reactions to each topic differ from person to person. Mairu can improve her knowledge on each topic by either spending a block of time performing an activity or by finding collectables around the time, that differ from day to day. Guessing which topics NPCs like involves a lot of gauging their character, and that's appreciated.There's six recruitable NPCs, and you only need three to finish the game. While there's ample time to get three, getting six is impossible on a first playthrough, and there's a slightly different ending for nabbing all six through the NG+ mode, which encourages multiple playthroughs.I wouldn't recommend this VN.Despite taking place in the formation of a Comedy Club, and revolving around Comedy, there's almost no comedy in CTHCC. What little there is, is safe, sterile, clean and tasteless. A few puns and light insults thrown into an otherwise unremarkable conversation, or nothing at all. It's some of the weakest comedy they could have possibly gone for, and unless you've never heard a joke before, or are incredibly amused by ""cute girls doing cute things"" it'll do nothing for you.Beyond that there's just no substance to it. Even after two playthroughs there's no memorable moments. Even if the light dating-sim mechanics ""work"" a whole lot better than it did in Persona, it's got no punch, no bite and no gall to back it up. This is an incredibly boring game that with all it's talk about making you laugh, won't even put in an effort to make you smile.			"

To do so, you have to talk to them (like building social links) but in order to make interesting conversation, you must build your rank in various and sundry topics one might converse about (just like leveling personal attributes in Personas 3 and 4).  As you can imagine, this all takes time and the clock is ticking down.  That being said, at it's core, CTHCC is really a time management sim, but you get to experience some nice character development and funny dialoge along the way.  One could make an argument that this game might even fall into the Visual Novel genre in a round about way.  A minor gripe with this game is that the translation tries to portray the story as if it were taking place in America even though there is a shrine at the edge of town complete with its resident shrine maiden as well as numerous other aspects of the game that simply smack of Japanese culture.  For those who aren't familiar with the U.S., we don't have shrines... like... AT ALL.   It doesn't have any kind of action/platforming what so ever and is so absurdly riddled with typo's, you begin not even to question if the translator speaks English natively so much but rather, if they are even fluent in it.  Regardless, the writing gets the job done and the characters are all unique and interesting.All things taken into consideration, the ""slice of life"" aura CTHCC brings to the table is a breath of fresh air in a market flooded with violence, zombies, and post apocolyptic environs.  Personally, for eight bux, I'm certainly getting my moneys worth out of this title.  For a nice distraction from the drudgery of the waking world or even other games, I whole heartedly reccomend this off beat title.			"

												Very nice game! A very nice pixely RPG style anime game, with a very rich plotline to compliment the genre. If you like any RPG anime games such as Corpse Party, I highly reccomend this game. If you play mainly anime fighting games like Street Fighter or Vanguard Princess, and are new to games like this, it might not be the best for you, but you never know! Aside from that it comes with a badge,  its own set of cards and a rock bottom price! The jokes in it are easy to get, and can be hilarious at times. I think this game got me laughing about 75% of the time I was playing it! Very Highly Reccomended			"

												10/10 best bottle collecting simulator on the market.But seriously, a very good little game. I managed 1 playthrough in three hours, but in order to get the good ending I need to go through one more time. No complaints though, the game is good enough to warrant another go-around and and the new-game plus takes out all the little things I had to do to boost my stats, so I should have little trouble getting all 6 people on my side.If you're not sure what the game is about, you're a girl trying to recruit a minimum of three people to your club in order for it to be accepted by the student government. To do this you must read magazines and watch telvision to boost your stats, then talk to people about those subjects in order to boost your friendship. Get to level 5, and they join your club. You meet 5/6 of the people over your spring break (and the last one when you get back to school), giving you about 5 weeks to befriend everyone. The days are all split up into 3 portions, two of which you have the chance to really communicate with the people, and then the nighttime where you can call people (Which does very little, to my knowledge), make some cash, or study up on your skills. Homework is also a small annoyance, but easy to overcome if you aren't streamlining friendships.The story itself is relativly engaging, making it entertaining to converse with everyone you can to get the few snippets out of them. There seems to only be a few that they cycle through, but that's okay. They're often funny, given the whole comedy club point of the game.There's also a lot of side characters you can converse with with are equally cool and play as much of a role as do the six subjects.My only quarrel with this game is the wonky controls and the size of the screen. For whatever reason I could not make this game full screen, or could I use my gamepad on it. It only requires the arrow keys and the enter key, but that particular setup is unlike my usual hand placements and felt uncomfortable. The tiny screen also felt unnessisary, but this could be an issue on my end alone so I don't blame it that much.All in all, a good little game to spend some time on if you haven't anything to do and are interested in basically a dating sim about humor. I'm excited to see what the next part has to offer based on what I did here.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club was a great experience for me. You play as a girl named Miley who's a bit of an oddball among her peers. She's a Senior in high school but still enjoys children's shows such as the ""Hero Rangers"". The objective of the game is to recruit at least three other people from your school to join your Comedy club by a certain date. I found each character to be pretty fun to get to know. With a game like this, who needs to go outside or socialize with real people? There are plenty of video game references and pop culture, and lots of funny moments (Your trying to set up a comedy club after all) This game left me with a really good feeling, and I enjoyed every minute of the experience. Oh, and the music is great! As well as the 2D art style. You have the ability to move your character around in certain areas too which was nice, not something you get to do in most of the visual novels I've played. I highly recommend this game to somebody who likes slice of life and school themed anime's and wants to play a game with a positive and happy vibe.			"

												When I first discovered CTHCC, I'll admit that I was a bit charmed. Like many others, I had enjoyed the social link system of the later Persona games and this is basically a game all about that. It also called back to other stat-raising games like the Princess Maker series. So for one, if you don't like stat-raising games, don't buy this game. Hopefully, that'd be obvious.It's very visual novel-esque and really a lot of the game is pretty nicely done. The graphics are good and it's actually made in RPG Maker, so I was a bit impressed by how originally the game controlled. The characters also had some potential, too.But the humor is where the game falls flat. For a game about comedy, this entire game only got a few chuckles out of me at most. And in a visual novel type of game, the writing is everything. If you're the kind to be wooed by excessive memes and pop culture references, then this game might be perfect for you. But for me, that's not the case. The writing was rarely clever and is reliant mostly upon making you say ""THEY SAID THE THING"". And sometimes, the memes are just out of place, too.. If you see some screenshots from the community hub, you can judge the humor for yourself. Perhaps the Japanese original was funny, but the English dialogue totally dropped the ball.At least the core of the gameplay is in tact, but if you don't like the writing, you have no wish to move forward. At least the characters managed to be moderately interesting, but some of their likes and dislikes were oddly difficult to judge.I suppose $7.99 is probably a good price, but if you're wary about this game, wait for a sale. Go see the community hub and watch a video of it. A small portion of the game is a good enough sample to know if you'd like it or not.			"

												If you are looking for a game with actual gameplay mechanics... you might want to look elsewhere.  This colorful anime style game is an ""adventure lite"" and has more in common with dating sims than even adventure games.  You are a high school girl with a little over a month for your last shot at forming a comedy club.  The goal of the game is to recruit at least 3 people for your club (up to 6) before May gets here, and clubs can no longer officially form at the school.  You accomplish this by talking to people and becoming friendly with them.  Starting a chit chat will give you a glimpse at the topics that they like the most so you can engage them in deeper conversations.  But no one wants to talk to someone who has no knowledge or interest of their beloved topics, so you have to level up your knowledge in the things they are most interested in.  You can do this in a variety of ways such as buying magazines to read before bedtime, catching a show at the cinema, watching tv, hanging out at the art museum, or visiting the school library.  Some of these things cost money to do, and usually the more cash it requires, the more skill you will get.  You get money by collecting bottles on the ground, or doing part time work at a few places around town.  Once you have leveled up your skills you can then work on trying to recruit your ""comedy targets"" so they will sign your paper, join your club and the ending is happy for everyone.  Leveling up with a friend opens up new cutscenes and gives you little insights to their life.  It's a lot of text, reading, guesswork and time management.  Engaging in conversation or working passes the time of the day, which brings you closer to the ending, whether you have recruited anyone or not.  That's where the time management comes in.  Do you try to become closer to a friend by talking to them?  Working at the shrine for money so you can catch that cinema show and level up your romance stat?  Occasionally there's homework to juggle too!  Cherry Tree High Comedy Club has interesting characters and a bite size play through time... I managed four recruits and completed the game around the three and a half hour mark.  Since it is so linear story driven, I can't see myself playing it again for some time, but others will likely want to dive right back in to try for the six recruits ""perfect"" ending.  If you enjoy dating sims or anime, this game has the tendrils to hook you.  The stories are well written and the translation is at times, quite amusing, being given a very robust translation.  There's controller and big picture support so you can potentially blow through this from the comfort of your couch.  I do wish there had been more variety in the game play, mini games would have broken up the tedium of chatting and time management, and having a wider cast of characters or more inventive ways to get to know them would have been fun.  Instead you are racing for the next conversational topic level... which is entertaining but there was a lot of potential here to be so much more. Definitely worth checking out, even if just for it's cute quirkiness, if any of the above sounds appealing to you!			"

												***First Impressions***Only started just now, even though I've had it for a couple of weeks. At this moment, I'm a bit mixed on the game. I've played a bit over an hour. The game is lighthearted and the story is very simple (which isn't always a bad thing). The gameplay is different, but might become repetitive, and it's not always as clear what you should be doing. The game has 10 trading cards, for those who're interested in those.The fact that you can only save at the end of the day is annoying. The game isn't fullscreen. Options are very limited (only options there're are sound (music and sound effects) and the text speed (instant or not). The controls aren' t clear, since it shows buttons like ""cancel"" or ""ok"", which aren't keys on your keyboard. I've also seen some spelling errors (like picnicker) and I've just started. We'll see what the rest of the game brings and I'll edit my review later. At this moment, I'm not convinced yet. Buy on sale if you're curious.***After completing the game once***I got the bad ending on my first run. I could only recruit one member, which wasn't enough. I won't be replaying the game though. I skipped most of the story, so I won't be commenting on that. Gameplaywise, this game is one giant repeat. Every day exists out of 3 parts (1. Morning/lunch time, 2. Afternoon/after school & 3. Evening). During each of these parts, you can chat with some characters, but only perform one action that actually affects the game and story. Although there're schooldays and free days, all days feel exactly the same. The game feels VERY repetitive.The graphics are exactly what you can expect by watching the screenshots. They're nice, nothing special. Overal, I would not advice others to purchase this game, unless on sale.			"

												Since this type of story is my thing I was really into the game at the start. The pace was a bit hectic and I had to worry about doing everything and planning ahead so I had enough skill to befriend people. Then I learned you cna only talk to each character with one topic on each playthrough. And that your skills stay the same when you start a new game. I lost all care for the story when I learned nothing I planned mattered, and i just rushed stuff. The worst offense is the true ending is no different bad from good ending, and it just sequelbates. It simply said the true ending is better because ""Well this is what it will be like in the sequel.."" and doesn't even give you anything extra for getting say...six recruits instead of 5. The only difference is a box telling you to try again.			"

												Run around and talk to people to recruit them for your school club that you are trying to create. Not really a whole lot to do, even when you're ""chit chatting"" with others it just happens with no content. Some of the dialogue didn't translate too well over from Japanese>English. There's some Japanese humor that they just didn't know how to bring over to English. Would have been nice to see the original Jpn text.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is the sequal to obscure Jay Ar Pee Gee Persona 4 The Golden. Due to the increasing popularity of social links over dungeons and horror the developers have decided to eschew the latter and focus soley on the former. This had led to a more focused development with higher production values and the move to true HD, one of the first in fact for console games. To tighten up the dialogue they've also brought on a new face to the dev team named ""Hideo Kojama"" to write the story. I'd say if you liked Persona 4 The Golden or its prequal Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne then you are not the target audience for this game. If you liked such great hits such as Halo 4 A Evil Awakens and CoDBlopsTwo then this game will be right up your alley. I give this game 9.3 IGNs out of 10On a different scale I give it 100/100 EGMs.DON'T FORGET TO PREORDER CHERRY TREE HIGH TWO:TWO WORLDS™ AT YOUR LOCAL GAMESTOP® AND RECEIVE EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE STANINATOR GOLDEN ASSAULTRIFLEBLADE!™			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a rare kind of resource management simulation game seldom seen outside of Japan. In games of this type you have to manage a limited number of turns (time) and resources like stamina and money while trying raise your character's stats up high enough to achieve some goal, usually finding a girlfriend. As such most games of this type in Japan are dating sims, although many Japanese dating sims use a different visual novel (choose-your-own-adventure) style of game play. In this case, while it has the standard dating sim high school setting, the goal of the game is different. You're trying to get enough students to sign up as members so you can start a stand-up comedy club at your school.While I can very much recommend it to anyone who might like this sort of game, or is looking for something different, it's hard to rank against other similar games since there are so few games like it available in the west. You have to go back all the way to the ancient text game Hamurabi to find something similar in the western canon of games. The only two Japanese games with similar mechanics I know of that have been officially translated are the unreleased English version of Princess Maker 2 and the PlayStation 2 and Wii game Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love. There was one attempt to make an entirely new game of this sort (I think) for the western market, Brooktown High, but I haven't played it. The RPG games Persona 3 and 4 have elements of these sort of games, and as a stretch you could say the Harvest Moon series of games are sort of similar.(The original Princess Maker, by the way, is the granddaddy of this variety of resource management games. In the Princes Maker series of games you're trying raise a young orphan girl to become a princess, though other good and bad careers are possible. So Cherry Tree High Comedy Club isn't really breaking the mold by not being a dating sim.)While it has a major publisher in the west, this was independently produced game in Japan and written basically by one guy. So it's not big game, it won't take too long to get through it. I took me 8 hours according to Steam, though some of that might be been while I was away doing other things. The original setting was a small but rapidly growing town in Japan, but this was moved to America for the English localization. That translatation isn't perfect, but changing the locale and cultural references for western audiences was pretty much a necessity. It does produce an odd mashup of American and Japanese culture (why does an American town a have a Shinto shrine complete with shrine maiden?), but a literal translation would've been incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't lived in Japan for sometime.

												Just like the comedy that Mairu (or Miley I believe her name is in the westernized version) loves and aspires to make a career of one day this game is humorous, lifts your spirits, and leaves you wanting more. The only possible complaint I could make was that it felt too short, but then again for a feel-good high school story like this that will happen regardless of how many hours you’d need to put in to finish it off. Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is one of those fun, wacky, lovable, and timeless high school stories like The Breakfast Club and Persona series. The game takes place over a month and a half; starting you off just before Spring Break with the mission of gathering members for your comedy club. Throughout your quest to recruit members you have 6 potential candidates who all have their own charm and appeal. Even the antagonist (Chitose) isn’t a particularly loathsome individual. She's a waspy preppy girl that you used to be friends with when you were younger and has it out for you now, but you never really feel any animosity toward her, just more of a rivalry. I think this is worth highlighting in my review because in my experience everyone I’d come across was likable in their own way. This casual atmosphere truly gives the game a pleasant and quite laid back feel. I had a successful run on my first playthrough despite my constant concerns that I wasn’t doing as well as I could have. I’m on my 2nd run now (there is a New Game+ feature by the way that I think should be pointed out so even if you do kinda meh on your first run you can come back to the story and do better the next time around) so I can’t wait to see how it turns out on an even better run.In conclusion/if you felt my review was tl;dr and couldn’t be bothered and skipped to the bottom, this is definitely a great game to get if you’re a fan of comedy, the whole relationship building gameplay from games such as the Persona series, high school tales more interesting than how high school really was/is, or if you’re a fan of visual novels with a bit of a free-roam element. So with that in mind I’m keeping my eye on the developer (773) and highly recommend this game.			"

												Wait for a sale.The only reason I cannot reccoment this game is simply because it is far too short. Lasted me three hours only to reach an ending.Of course to get to the good ending I should replay it and try to recruit every character, but honestly I can tell that will be an excercise in repetition, since you'd have to re-read the same dialogs again and again. And if you already got an ending, you have completed at least half the characters stories already.Other than that, it is a solid visual novel of sorts. I just don't find its length justified the full price Steam is asking for it.If it's 50% off and you like slice-of-life mangas, I'd reccomend it.			"

												I'm very torn on how to review this game, since quite frankly, I haven't played enough games similar to this to compare it to. So keep that in mind as I try to jumble through my mixed feelings on this game.For starters, let's start with what the story is about. You are a senior, named Miley. You love comedy. You want to start a comedy club. Jerk president of the student council or whatever says you need 5 members to establish a club. The conflict comes in here. You only have 2 members. Yourself and your best friend/roommate, who never is a big part of the game.So you, alone, have a month+ (something like 40 days total?) to convince 3 other people to join your club. You accomplish this by getting their ""friend level"" up to level 5. They all start out at level 1 when you meet them. There are 6 prospective members you can have join you. You can convince any of them (or none of them) to join your club, through various odds and ends.One example, and the one I expect most everyone will do on their first (and probably only) run, is the story of a little girl, and her grandfather's candy shop. These stories progress in 5 steps. Step one is the introduction to the character. Step two is the introduction to her story. Step three is the continuation of this story to the point where obvious conflict has arisen. Step four is another continuation of this branch, that usually results in you giving advice, or being helpful to the story's subject. And step five is the conclusion, where the prospective member thanks you for your help in the matter, and then hands you their club signup form, guaranteeing themselves a member of your cult of weirdos.You need to do this for at least three of the six potential members to ""win"". If you get all six, you get the ""good"" ending. Generally, this is a very easy task requiring absolutely no thought. You wake up in the morning and follow one of two schedules. You have a school schedule, and you have a day off schedule. On school days, your three blocks of time are as follows... you go to school (and conveniently have most of the characters you wish to recruit in one place, to learn about their likes and dislikes, though this can be uncommon at best), you have a block of time where you can walk around the town and do one special task (whether this is talking to the member you wish to recruit, building your ""skills"", or spending time eating and doing absolutely nothing), and then finally go home, and sleep/talk to girlfriends on the phone/make beads for money (which is pretty useless honestly.)On off days, you do roughly the same thing, except instead of going to school, you get an extra block of the free do whatever you want period.Now, the game sounded compelling in a way, and I'm a fan of anime-style graphics, so this game caught my eye. I went in with the understanding this game is very short (2 1/2 hours per playthrough at best?) and that the characters aren't to be taken seriously, but this feels like a pretty sloppy piece of work, considering how short the game is.There are various magazines you can purchase, or movies you can watch with the intent of upgrading your skills... but this is mostly pointless, as I barely touched my skills, and managed to beat the game with 4 of 6 characters recruited into my club. I'm sure the books may play a bigger part when you are trying to broaden your horizons and get all 6... but even then, it's pretty simple to get any character into your club, given the stereotypical nature of all the characters (the ones who look like they like sports like sports, and the ones who like smart stuff like smart stuff).By far the most interesting character in the game is the punk rock girl, Cindy, and her story is so short, that I feel unsatisfied. This is in contrast to Sara's story, which feels long and drawn out, and less interesting.I don't know, this is more of a synopsis on gameplay than a real review, so I may as well leave my final verdict here. The game is fun for about all of 20 minutes before the repetitive nature gets to you, and you lose interest in the story or what happens to the club. Should you manage to complete the game, (which isn't hard, the game is laughably easy) you can go into a NG+ mode I haven't touched yet (and don't plan to touch.)When a game offers me more content like that, and I say, ""no thank you"", it generally doesn't bode well for the overall replayabillity of the game. Unless the characters interests change, and the game gets harder (which I doubt on both accounts) I don't think I'll give this game another look.If you really must try it, get it during a Summer/Winter Sale when it is wicked cheap, and not at the current price. Paying full price will lead to massive disappointment for all.			"

												TL;dr: If you don't like adaptations from other languages, don't buy this VN, even if this has good potential. There's better out there.I didn't get to enjoy this game.The story is OK and it develops well throughout the story (I only got until the end of April).I believe that the main thing that threw me off was the lack of ""feel"" from a japanese VN that felt more like adapted than translated. If I want American or British feel, I'd go after an American or British VN, if I want a Japanese feel, I go after a Japanese VN. This one... (in the non-westernized version) Is around 3/4 translated & 1/4 adapted.Good:The gameplay quickly gets too repetitive and mechanical if you want to get to the good end, specially if you do the homework right off the bat.The story-tellers tried to make this non-repetitive and that's good and it worked well enough.Bad:I expected this to be heavy on comedy but... It wasn't. The comedy was OK sometimes, weak but, unfortunately, only allowed me to smile at best... when it didn't feel awkward due to wooseysm applied.Even when playing the non-westernized version, I saw what is to me too much wooseysm including jokes that I don't see how they can make sense in Japanese. Heck, one or other doesn't even make sense in its context.I don't know wether to recommend or not this game. As I didn't like due to the wooseysm + jokes that don't make me laugh (only smile or feel awkward in context) + expected to be amused with comedy, I will mention ""no"".Don't get the ""no"" fully get you, though! This is NOT a bad VN!			"

Some of the stats have fun titles, and there are a lot of well placed jokes throughout the game.Cons:1. No noticeable save system.  I ended up quitting out of the game and lost all my progress.2. Dialogue gets a little too drawn out.  I feel like the writing could be better, which is a major flaw considering the game's focus on the story above anything else.3. Controls are keyboard-based and the game does not support mouse clicks.  This isn't a big deal, I guess, but I would have liked to use my mouse to navigate the start screen and menus at least.

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club. Where do I begin. This is a story very reminiscent of visual novels, and gives you a variety of paths to take each day. This game involves a high school senior by the name of Miley Verisse. She loves comedy, and has for most of her life. She wants to resurrect the Comedy Club at Cherry Tree High School, but needs to find people for her club to start off with. She meets many people along the way, and you make decision, talk to a variety of characters and npcs, and you boost your friendship levels. Once they hit Level 5 in terms of friendship, the character returns a club registration form, getting you closer to resurrecting the comedy club that housed talented comedians in the past. This was a great little game to play, though I recommend it, I would only recommend those who really love the culture of visual novels, eroge, otaku culture and anime, as this might be boring to quite a lot of people, as the demographic is quite a niche. But if the price is right, try it out. I didn't regret it one bit. 6.8/10			"

												CTHCC is effectively a life sim game that tries to be funny. Okay, it IS funny at times…but it’s not THAT funny. Basically you’re trying to start a comedy club and in order to do so you chat it up with various people you think would be good for the club, develop deeper relationships, and hopefully get them to join. Problem is you don’t really know that many people…nor do you know much of anything as far as conversational topics.But never fear! You have the ability to read up on different subjects to gain a deeper understanding of them, then be able to chat about them more efficiently. Of course, not everyone likes to talk about everything, but you get the idea. That’s really the long and short of it. It’s not that complex, it is kinda funny at least, it really is something different from Capcom, and it’s cheap, so…yeah.Honestly, it comes off feeling somewhat boring.  I guess it could appeal to the right audience, but clearly I'm not it.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a really interesting game. Looking at the differences from the original Japanese text, there are some things I wish the english translation wouldn't have done, but overall it's a great story to experience. However, it's definitely a game you have to be into to enjoy. Don't come looking for action or intensity, come looking for nice, short story with all of it twists and turns.			"

												S'alright. I like visual novels, but this really isn't a visual novel. I like the school aspect of Persona 3 and 4, but this isn't that either. It's rushed, which is a problem that shows in how many things you DON'T do. There's places you don't visit in the game, tons of things you don't actually have to do, a ""side quest"" that doesn't actually get finished and whatnot... It's cute and in some places, really funny. But I don't really understand the game and I'm not 100% sure that Capcom really thought this through. The shortness sort of makes it worth the price, I suppose...?If you're looking for something to waste time, I guess you could pick this up, but at the same time, you could also play Sonic CD.			"

												The game's time limit forces you to rush and grind for a safe win on the first try. Because of this, you have to play it again in order to get a perfect run, because you just can't learn everything you can do in the game and still get it 100% right within the time limit. This may or may not be a bad thing for some.The game is also very short. It feels like having many good intentions scattered across but ultimately not well enough developed, because there's no way to fit such things in such a short timeframe. There is some relationship building and some background info on the characters that you discover this way, but it's all way too short and succinctly presented.Otherwise, the game is neat. It delivers the cuteness dose it's supposed to, it's interesting enough, and can keep you busy for a few hours or more. Yeah, I recommend it, but don't expect much.			"

												The easiest comparison I can make to this game is something out of Persona 3 and 4's social aspects. The difference here is that you're making purely platonic friends with the end goal being to recruit people to join your comedy club. Otherwise, it's the stuff you're probably already familiar with- the ultimate test in time management of socializing, keeping up with school, working part-time, and leveling up your stats.It's a great game and very relaxing (if simultaneously suspensful because you wonder if you can get everyone before the month is out) with cute character design, dialogue, and development. It's just a really well-rounded package and if you've got any interest in visual novels, enjoyed Persona's social aspect, or just want a cute little story then this shouldn't be missed.It should be noted there is a Westernized version and a localized version- the former changes the original Japanese names to American ones like 'Miley' or 'Sara'. I played with the latter option because it's kind of jarring to play a clearly Japanese product but have it stripped of that sort of authenticity- and I'm not necessarily stuck up on things like subs vs dubs. I can't comment on the quality of the westernized version, but it's great that it's an option for people who want it, but it should be noted that the sequel stays faithful to the original Japanese qualities... so if you're interested in both the localized version is probably your best pick.

												Here is my review of the first Visual Novel that i've ever played:Pros:The characters are likeable. There isn't a single character that I dislike :). It also helps that Miley Verisse's personality is very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's.The music is decent.The story is pretty good and lighthearted.The jokes are funny (Miley's Bad Dudes vs. Dragonninja reference, the scene where she also tells Curtis to bust out some salsa with Auntie Dina and where she calls herself ""The Bullet"" come to mind.).The game controls great with an Xbox 360 controller, wired or wireless, though you can only move Miley with the left analog stick.Both translations are good :).There is a lot of variety in the things you can do.The graphics remind me of a Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 or Gamecube game and I like the cute moe art style :3!Cons:You absolutely need a guide/faq to help you out, at least on your first playthrough.Even though the music is good, it gets monotonous after awhile. I recommend playing some music you have downloaded on your computer through a music-playing program while playing after turning the in-game music all the way down in the Options menu in subsequent playthroughs.Even though I think this game is a way past cool breath of fresh air, it doesn't have much in terms of traditional gameplay.Overall, this is an awesome game that stands out in a unique way. I totally recommend it to fans of anime and manga (And maybe a few Sonic fans, too ;)!)! IMHO, I give this game a 9/10.			"

												Cherry Tree High School Comedy club is definitely aimed at a distinct subset of people. If you have no interest in anime, ridiculous and exaggerated characters, and playing what more or less amounts to a friendship simulator, I can tell you right now there is nothing for you here. On the other hand if you enjoy quirky Japanese games, Cherry Tree is one of the few of its kind to be found on Steam and that novelty is what lead me to giving it a go. Unfortunately I came away quite disappointed, and am once again left searching for a suitable replacement.Although there were quite a few things I felt ended up as missed opportunities, the biggest detractor was the lackluster characters and writing. Though it's set in Japan the dialog is decidedly westernized, which led to it feeling less like one of my beloved anime comedies and more like what you might find in a Disney channel show. I never grew fond of any of the characters, and actually became rather annoyed whenever I had to spend an extended period of time interacting with them. This lack of interest also lead to repetition setting in rather quickly, and by the end I was simply going through the motions in order to recruit my required number of members. Given you can beat the game in a short 4-5 hours, how quickly it turned into a grind is very disappointing.I honestly really wanted to love Cherry Tree. It appeared to have all the ingredients for a game I'd love (anime and pixel graphics, a premise that sounded right up my alley, and gameplay that fell into the realm of the unusual), but it never clicked for me. Interaction felt shallow, the writing and jokes all fell flat, and it's strict time structure left little room for experimentation. There is certainly some semblance of charm to be found here, but for me at least, it didn't wind up amounting to something I enjoyed, or have any real desire to replay.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is an almost ""dating sim"" kind of game, as such its target audience, especially in the way this one is written seems to be women/girls. I however can't fault it for that, and what it does offer in my opinion is some quality gameplay for that genre combined with great dialogue and a decent size city to explore. My grievances are the limited and random statements made by characters, often causing them to repeat the same thing throughout intervals and the somewhat grindy nature of some conversations, provided no in game events are occuring (needed more in my opinion in this regard to detract from the basic gameplay). All in all it is a game of good value if you like the genre, that does even despite these listed flaws keep itself interesting through humor and the odd friendship/life lesson.			"

												I gave this 'game' 2 minutes of my time. One issue I take with it is; if you're going to make a ""game"" that consists of reading lines over the back drop of pictures, you can at least make it 1080p HD. It isn't even 720p. In this day and age that is shameful. I could move past this though if it were the only problem. The real problem this 'game' has is very simple and yet very major -- It lacks controls! I've 'played' other so called 'visual novels' before and no matter who made them they all used pretty much the same system of control, which makes sense since it works. That system isn't here. I couldn't use my mouse or game pad at the main menu. I had to use the arrow keys and enter. After that the only thing the 'game' allowed me to do was click the left mouse button to skip to the next line of text. I'm not kidding - That was literally it. I couldn't scroll back to previous text or anything. If it's a good story and funny I'll never really know, because I am not going to spend my time on something with such bad design or rather lack of design. Software 101: The user needs to be able to navigate. I suggest passing on this.			"

Most of these games main objective was to get girl naked, but well, this one sadly isn't about it...Anyway, in this kind of games you were able to do few things daily, had some money/points etc. to spent, and did it over and over and over. You know what? Cherry Tree High Comedy Club kinda remind me of ""sim"" games. Sadly, it's not for everyone. You will probably need to be fan of this genre, or be into japanese animation. If you are into one of these things, you will not regret getting this game.			"

												A special thank you to ""Infersha"", I will be making her a .gif signature in return for the X-mas present. On with the review:A rated ""E for Everyone"" Visual Novel Title about a silly girl who wants to make a club before the deadline. While you hear silly lines, there are no dating options. Once you explore and conquer all six kids while finding easter eggs, along with plainy New Game +, this is about it.The dialogue is bright and simplistic, rarely you'll come across a few translation errors. There are quite a few Video Game references and other proverbs twisted around and it'll give you a few chuckles if you're a cheesy, corny old fart.The gameplay aspect is your typical ""Raise your parameter"" while balancing out your schoolwork and fatigue level.It takes at least two playthroughs to beat the game because you need your first playthrough to figure out what all the characters likes/dislikes, then you can do fine the second playthrough. If you do not beat the game within your first playthrough, you'll have to start over again. The New Game + only comes in after you beat the game successfully once, and all your parameters / items will come in afterward.It's easily worth 5 bucks if you're into Visual Novels (or have a younger sister who likes cheesy things. It seems to be a perfect ""Get together with Onii-chan"" game). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else otherwise.			"

												This game, although it may appear otherwise, is actually rather difficult to beat. You have to learn how to manage the time your given to recruit a minimum of 5 students (you start with 2 to begin with so you really only need 3) to the Cherry Tree High Comedy Club! To be honest, this game is so cheesy I found myself hating the story altogether (my level of tolerance is pretty high considering I watch anime). The humor of the game is ridiculously corny. Also another annoying factor about this game is that is plays in such a small window. You can't even full screen it! The soundtrack BGM sounds good at first, but when you hear it EVERY DAY in game it kind of kills it. Other interesting stuff you may want to know: The main character who looks 11 is actually 17! YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN IN THE GAME IF YOU HOLD SPACEBAR, IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO REALIZE SO I HAD TO SPEND HOURS WALKING ACROSS TOWN! THIS GAME TAKES PLACE IN AMERICA, WHAT THE FLIP? However if you can manage to tolerate these details, the game can be a little fun (especially if you make your friends read allowed the awkward conversations of the game). I would rate this game a 4.5/10.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club = One of the worst games i have ever played  As far as dating mechanics and characters goes. Before you start throwing out the you just suck line check my profile i have only had one or two bad routes and those were like my first two routes ever played on any vn. I'm a quick learner but i also quickly learned that on this game picking the right dialogue option wasn't good enough. Oh no not for CTHCC. You have to have pick the right dialogue option and completing the minigames. I don't care if you're pick the best route. I finished all the minigames in a night and then go to bed then game over!! This is worse than katawa shoujo and go go nippon put together i kid you not. I have also learned that even when im clearly picking the wrong option i have a better shot at finishing th e route if don't say anything at all. I'm sorry but this game is utter trash. The only thing it has going for it is the fact its a vn. Take that away and this would be the worst game EVERRRR			"

												So this game has been sitting in my library for a while and today i decided to play however, WTF ARE THE CONTROLS!?! I mean i can understand games having confusing controls in all heck ive played some with horrible controls but the fact that it doesn't even attempt to try and give you what they are is horrible. My main issue what button is the back button??? Cancel doesnt exist on keyboards so what am i supposed to press to get out of menus? This little oversight literally makes the game unplayable, please someone help me. this is more of a cry for help than a review but still if i can't figure out what the controls are other people are probably having  the same issuses i am. So until i figure out what they are this is a no go for me, just a fair warning to potential buyers.			"

												A game for people that love the turnbased time managemant games where you have limited actions to reach a certain goal. In this your focus is to buld friendship with different NPCs to convince them to join your new club.This goal sound easy if it was not for the limited time you could talk to one NPC and so its absolut necesary to first build up your understanding in some topics before even start to talk to the NPCs as the higher you knowledge of a topic the more the relationship imporves if you talk about it. WIthout a guide or constant save and reload I think its next to imposible to see a good ending on the first playtrough.			"

												I played the demo first. The graphics and art are cute, some people may be allowed by low res but it's OK for me. The characters are pretty stereotypical, but I did liked them and wanted to learn more about them.Unfortunately, I messed up- I tried to balance out skilling, exploring and talking to people instead of grinding first and asking questions later and I failed miserably.The problem is, the game at some moments feels like a chore. The cute music was really short and looped and I exhausted myself through some parts of game hoping something interesting will happen (or I'll be able to save).There's no humor. Damn. I'm a weirdo that likes anime humor, from light-hearted slice-of-life, through slapstic, to the really surrealistic and abstract one. But here, I didn't smile even once. Maybe it was the translation. I get puns weren't translatable, but if the game was just puns (and, frankly, puns are NEVER translatable in a way allowing them to stay funny), maybe they should choose a different one to translate and put on Steam? Meme and games references felt like bad fan translations, when they tried to be cool.And now, I didn't finish the game right and it hurts my obsessive side, but just thinking about replaying it makes my skin crawl. Maybe if I'll be trapped in a fallout shelter and would want to remind myself of times where I thought playing this game was a bad thing.			"

However note that this game is very short and can be completed in just a few hours. There is some limited replay value to try and get all the characters as your friends but nothing much besides that. The time management aspect is also pretty simple. I personally would have liked more things to do and more impact from how you spent your time.

												This game is not primarily a comedy game: your main goal is to find and convince three of six possible characters to become members of your club in a limited number of ""time"". Funny things can be found in this game, and at least one character, the shrine maiden (not seen in the picture to the right), has a deadpan-serious about random things type of personality that really suits my taste of humor. The humor is a backdrop to the main focus, though - exploring and planning the tactical manipulation of 6 schoolchildren into your ""comedy club"" within a set number of turns, without NG+, can be pretty difficult. This game can be entertaining if you're like me and are interested in any game involving anime-styled characters. Spoilers: It's supposed to take place in America, apparently, but the town resembles modern day Japan a lot more, complete with a shinto styled shrine on a hill that was supposedly donated from a sister city in Japan. I'm not sure if this was a change the translation team decided to do, or what. Also, I'm sad that the MC doesn't tell any jokes, or at least any memorable ones. For a game about a comedy club, you would expect a series of stand up jokes from the MC, but alas, she only exhibits manipulative behavior and a bit of lesbianism. (Or was that part supposed to be humor?)			"

												So I finished this game 3 times. The first two being a normal new game and I managed to recruit 3 new members each time and got the good end. The third time was a new game+ where my stats carried over and I recruited all 6 characters. Each run took about roughly 3 hours to finish. I haven't seen what the bad end looks like, but I will later on. All the characters are likable and you learn a bit about each character as you grow closer to them. There's quite a bit of stat building and you have a limited number of moves each day, so you have to plan from the get go. It's helpful to use a character guide to tell you what each character likes or dislikes to speed things along because choosing the wrong topic to chat with them about will lower your closeness level with them and set you back. The story is pretty much linear with no choices as there are only 3 possible endings in the game. Overall, I found this pretty enjoyable.			"

												Fun time management gameplay that meshes well with the story.Likable characters, each with their own arcs.Multiple paths to take through the game gives the game decent replayability, and a new game+ feature to help make sure you can easily experience everything it has to offer.Though the non-westernized translation still has several instances of the westernized names being used out of place, it still makes the game more enjoyable.

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is what I would consider a time-management visual novel.  You manage a limited amount of time/actions to improve your skills and then use those skills to overcome challenges.  It is a good time for the short game/novel it is.  About 3-4 hours of unique content with a second playthrough pretty much needed to see the stories of the all characters.  After seeing the content however, the game loses all replay value.  Nothing random happens and the majority of the events have maybe 1-2 versions depending on your progress at that point in the game.  I would recommend to pick it up on sale if you have interest in these types visual novels.  However, it won't convince anyone to be a fan of the genre.  Keep in mind there is a new game+ that allows you to carry over your stats if you ""beat"" the game to allow easier recruitment on future plays.Note: I played the non-westernized version.Pros:+Decent characters - I liked them.  They were trope heavy, but they were well written and I enjoyed the banter.+Great Art - I really do enjoy the art-style of the game.  Between the pixel art characters and the  cartoony overworld, you will be enjoying the colorful town.Meh:~Short - Common for this genre, but depending on your reading speed it is easy to finish the first time in 2.5-3.5hrs.  I completed the game 3 times in my 5.5hrs and saw everything this game has to offer.~Music - Nothing wrong, nothing noteworthy.Cons:-No dialogue skip - Most visual novels have the ability to skip over text you have already read, if you plan on playing 2-3 times to either see the other characters or recruit all 6 this feature is sorely missing.-Poor graphics options - Full screen stretches and the default resolution is pitiful.  Would benefit from either bars on full screen or the ability to scale the game window.-Short - Common for this genre, but depending on your reading speed it is easy to finish the first time in 2.5-3.5hrs.  I completed the game 3 times in my 5.5hrs and saw everything this game has to offer.TL;DR - Short time-management visual novel, but worth picking up on sale.			"

												This game is fine if you're looking for a lighter, simpler stat-raising / relationship-building game.Nothing especially outstanding, but it's relaxing and the graphics are cute.  The idea is to improve relationships with the people you want to recruit to your comedy club.  As usual, you have to balance school, possible part-time jobs, and talking to key people (and finding out what they like etc.).If you're looking for something to play in the genre, and you're taking a break from more adult or intense games, this is worth picking up.

												FOR WHAT IT IS, I recommend this game.Not everybody will enjoy visual novel/dating sim games, let alone ones steeped in Japanese cultural tropes. For people who cannot enjoy such genres, this game will be horrendous.For those who do, it is a game with a youthful feel and a certain degree of sweet innocence. Elements of time management also factor into gameplay.As these games go, it is far from a difficult one, and fairly forgiving. The replayability will vary depending on how much of a completionist you are, and how your first run went.			"

Would definitely play it again to do all the stuff I couldn't do the first time I played it.The music is nice too, so overall, I'd say 10/10. Would recommend.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club takes Persona 4's Social link system and builds an entire game based around that concept.  The main plot of the game is that you require at least five members to be allowed to create the Comedy Club you have always wanted to create. To gain a member of your club, you need someone to give you there application, and for this to happen, you need to reach rank 5 (the max social link) for that person. Since you count as a member, and your best friend is for sure the second member, you only need to max social links with three different people of your choice throughout the game, by April 30th (application deadlines. ) Just like in Persona 4, anytime you rank up in social link with someone, you get to see a cool cutscene where they have conversations and do cool things. Unlike Persona, this social linking system is more deep. There are roughly 10 or so topics, and you can gain knowledge in them, by reading books, watching tv/movies, going to exhibits/ participating in other events. Something kind of similar to Persona is that you can purchase books or magazines and read them at night. This game also has a Morning / Afternoon / Night system, again similar to Persona, where certain things will change it to the next time of day. I beat the game in 3.6 hours, and I only recruited 3 of the possible 6 recruits. AGAIN, like Persona, there is a new game + which brings over stuff from your previous game, in this case your knowledge in all the 10 topics. (Persona does this too with Courage , etc. ) This makes it easier to talk/recruit some certain people, depending on what topics you boosted up the most. There are three endings to the game I believe, one of which is the bad ending (which does not allow new game plus) and that's if you don't get five members by the end of the game. (Again, you start with 2, so you only really need 3 more) The regular ending (the one I got) was quite nice, and is if you manage to succesfully make the club by the end of the game. The good ending is if you recruit all 6 possible recruits, (making it an 8 member club, counting you and your best friend. ) And I'm not sure what this ending is like. What was cool is that at the end of the game, The main character takes a picture with all the members of the club. It would be cool to see all the other art for all the other club combinations. All of the art in this game is very anime - esque, so if you are turned off by that, I guess don't go for this? But I still think you will be missing out. You can now play the game in a westernized version or a version where everyone has the original names and what not (which is the version I played in and reccomend). The music is this game, although not plentyful is great in my opinion. It's all very catchy and upbeat. (Aside from a few tracks used in sad scenes of course. ) Since this game is a lot about friendship and how great that is, it does remind me of Persona 4's mood. There are items in this game, that you can buy and use, which do numerous things. Take note again that the social linking system is very similar to persona wherein certain times you just have a nice chat instead of coming closer to ranking up, or ranking up. The characters in this game are kind of tropey, but have some deepness to them. Of course you should not expect something like this to be too deep, but I think it has some interesting characters, and there was not a single one I disliked.   Regardless, I think this game is worth the roughly 4 hours it took me to beat. As well as the potential 8 hours, if I do it over again but with new game plus. (If I do, I plan on going for the three I did not get this time around. (Maybe even after that I'll go for the good ending with all 8). Overall, I would reccomend this to anyone who's cool with Visual Novels, or Persona 4's social linking system, or both.			"

												Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a nice change tone compare to other games and offers something creative with colourful theme.The music was upbeat and rocking, the dialogue was funny like manga, and the characters were colorful and likable.the game also features multiple endings by how many people you convince in the end of the game to join the Comedy Club. The only issue I had with the game was the length in story that possible to finish in 3 - 4 hrs, however Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is fun to play.			"

I ended up replaying it 3 more times to get the best ending.This one has gameplay component while the 2nd in the series (""I! My! Girls!"") is only a visual novel, in case that is important to you.

												A cute little visual novel. With the word ""comedy"" right in the title, the game is under pressure to deliver, and some might find the humor a little too bright and quirky, but it generally delivers. The gameplay can get a tiny bit grindy towards the end, but it's not really long enough to suffer much for it. I managed to just recruit the minimum of 3 characters two game-days before the deadline in my first playthrough, which clocked in at about 5.5 hours. A second play-through (which allows you to carry over your skills and records of the potential recruits preferences) took just another 3 hours and was wrapped up with an in-game week to spare. Brevity aside, this game did successfully elicit both laughs and a few tears from me for the correct reasons. Actually, the short length could make this a good choice for someone who is hesitant to try something from the visual-novel genre/medium.Also, I think the only difference between the original and westernized localization translation are the character names.

												TL;DR - I liked this game but it does get repetative. It's short and might not be worth your money.I'll start off by saying I had a great time with this game. I completed it in just under 3 hours but the character's are pretty good and it does have a lot to offer.Having completed it only once, I enjoyed my time thouroughly. But felt that there wasn't ehough to warrant another play.Gameplay:The basis of the game is that you need 5 members to start your new comedy club at your highschool. You start with two, yourself and your roommate. You must pick 3 others from 6 possible people. The premise is you get to know these people more and more as you play and increase your friendship level with them. As you increase each level you start to learn more and more about each character. It's a nice way to include some character development and backstory but personally it felt like it was unnatural and forced. You got a special cutscene of sorts each time you leveled your friendship up and your friend would open up a little more to you. So overall I got the sense that I wasn't acting as a friend I was there purely because I required members.Advancing friendship in this game is repetitive and more of a chore. There isn't any development between levels you find them somewhere in town and then you talk to them about something for a third of the day. You either find out they liked or hated what you talked to them about but you don't get any other dialogue. I spoke to these characters day after day as more of necessity to win than me wanting to learn about the character because you only learned about them as you advance levels. This part of the game is the majority of what you do and It's a shame that it isn't interesting.Characters:To be honest most characters are copy paste generic. There are a couple that aren't terrible but it just seems to me like they don't really have a whole lot of depth. There's shy girl, rocker girl, foreign transfer student, and creepy stalker (as stated this is only one playthrough). There is however a few characters which were really likeable and fun. It's just unfortunate that these are not characters you could conscript. I'm sure that many people will disagree with me but I felt as though the characters I liked were ones I spent the least time with. And that is a real shame for a story driven game like this.Conclusion:Based on what you've read you might think that this game isn't worth getting. And you could be right. A 3 hour experience for $8. But if I play it going after the other three targets I could get 6 hours out of it. Which isn't terrible. Of course many people are going to say that it isn't enough for them and that's understandable. I did have fun and the game is worth a couple of laughs and some enjoyable characters. If you're buying this game you HAVE TO get the sequel. It adds much more depth to characters and creates a better experience out of both of them. I feel the games should not be seperate and would do better to be a single title but playing both of them isn't that big of a deal.If you're going to buy this game buy it on sale in the bundle,			"

												Its well done. Great art, fine translation (I play the non westernised versions only) and not too many things to manage. A bit on the hard difficulty for a beginner in these time-management games of the visual novel genre.It also feels a little short which is a pity. Being a beginner I don't know yet if this length is the norm yet.Definitely re-playable and makes me see all the endings, a fact that tells me its a successful one, cause if I don't want to see it ever again before me then a game is a flop.

It starts off as a cute game about the antics of Mairu Hibisu trying to revive the comedy club at her high school, and ends up with several surprisingly touching stories about the various people she meets along the way. Was able to 100% it in 2 playthroughs, so not a lot of replayability, but overall a must play for a bit of high school comedy and light drama.			"

												It is a charming dating-sim style game. The art is very pretty. The music is nice. The characters and setting are endearing and pleasant. The mechanics do the job. It's short. It's fun. I enjoyed it. Don't expect too much, though.The localization was bad. For a game/genre this text-heavy, this is almost unforgivable. The game is so Japanese it's painful, but the localization team incompetently felt that they should try to force it into a pigeonhole Americanization. That sort of xenophobic sensitivity is painful and decades out of date. Even ignoring the weak attempts to pretend it was all happening in the US and fit everything into stereotypes thereof, the localization team was in dire need of a fluent English-speaking editor because the English language was abused in many amateurish ways. There/their/they're, to/too, etc. are prevalent errors, and I encountered at least one sentence so broken that it is incomprehensible gibberish. It's a doujin so I let the poor English slide for the most part, but it's something that anyone competent in the language could have spotted in an evening read-through so it makes it feel like they rushed through it.Mechanically, there are some bugs and design choices I find questionable. At times, the wrong sprites and location lables would show during events and conversations, but it was nothing game-breaking. I found the randomized events and such to be frustrating because attempting to apply strategy in skill-building was ultimately undermined by my inability to predict or control which skills would be leveled by the random events. There are multiple endings and a new game+, and, as it seems unlikely to get the complete ending the first time through, there is a reason to play the ng+, but you'll likely be so over-skilled that you'll finish the recruitment about half-way through, which makes it inconvenient that there are neither text-progression contols nor more effective time-advancing mechanics.It was alright, but could've been better.

There's also some exploration to do, characters abilities to level up, friendship levels to build and more.Anime fans such as myself will be pleased and will probably go for that New Game+ and try to get all the different endings.

												Really easy, the characters are mostly likeable, and the gameplay is kind of relaxing. It's super short (2-4 hours depending on what all you do), but it's also one of those types of games that you have to play multiple times with New Game + to get the true ending. Just don't ever try to spend an entire playthrough maxing out all of your skills, because if you don't have 5 club members by the end of April, you get a bad ending and don't get to save for NG+. I just learned that the hard way, having wasted a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hour and a half doing exactly that.			"

												Fun time management gameplay that meshes well with the story.Likable characters, each with their own arcs.Multiple paths to take through the game gives the game decent replayability, and a new game+ feature to help make sure you can easily experience everything it has to offer.Though the non-westernized translation still has several instances of the westernized names being used out of place, it still makes the game more enjoyable.

												A fun little distraction that's part visual novel, part sim game, and all charm.  It's short but still really enjoyable, as I had no problem starting on my second playthrough to complete the game immediately after finishing my first one.  If you're a fan of visual novels and an anime/manga-type art style, give it a try.			"

												This game is fine if you're looking for a lighter, simpler stat-raising / relationship-building game.Nothing especially outstanding, but it's relaxing and the graphics are cute.  The idea is to improve relationships with the people you want to recruit to your comedy club.  As usual, you have to balance school, possible part-time jobs, and talking to key people (and finding out what they like etc.).If you're looking for something to play in the genre, and you're taking a break from more adult or intense games, this is worth picking up.

												I actually did not think I would play this game, but I had brought a japanese humble bundle. This is such a cute game and endearing. I enjoy that it was simple and it's about a girl who tries to assemble a whole group of people for her comedy club. The character is fun and unique in herself and I like to play girl characters who are strong in their own unique personality and she seems like one.I like the fact that this game made me smile in several ways and reminds me of playing gameboy games in my youth. I think this game out of my whole bundle purchase was worth it.The visuals are goods, and you have to try and improve your relationships with all characters. I like that it's not romantic in any way really and its a breather and refresher in me wanting a play a normal, old school game.8/10!			"

												This game is not what i had expected really. There are many things which are not positive about this game. The music is not good and has no feeling whatsoever, and is looped over and over again. The characters and text pop-up take up far to much space on the screen if you play in fullscreen, giving an almost nauseous experience. Also the pacing of the gameplay and story is far too slow for this type of game. Character walks very slow which is a real pain when you have to walk the same places over and over again. Some fitting references does not save this poor excuse of a game. Avoid this cash-grab.4/10:Edit: Found out you could run using space			"

												FOR WHAT IT IS, I recommend this game.Not everybody will enjoy visual novel/dating sim games, let alone ones steeped in Japanese cultural tropes. For people who cannot enjoy such genres, this game will be horrendous.For those who do, it is a game with a youthful feel and a certain degree of sweet innocence. Elements of time management also factor into gameplay.As these games go, it is far from a difficult one, and fairly forgiving. The replayability will vary depending on how much of a completionist you are, and how your first run went.			"

												A light, fluffy game. You play as Mairu, a slacker and joker who argues with children over cartoons. Mairu wants to start a comedy club at her school, but waited until the last minute to recruit the remaining 3 people necessary for her club to be official. Help her achieve her dreams. Think modern Persona games, with all the dungeon and fighting stuff cut out. You spend your days running around town, picking up empty bottles and trying to raise your stats so you can trick people into liking you enough to join your comedy club. The game is actually a bit harder than it looks, as later friendship levels can move at an almost glacial if you aren't using the right conversation topics. There really isn't much too it than that, and the game is fairly short (takes place over about a month and a half, which was over 3 hours for me). Perfect for living out all my Japanese high school life fantasies. Essentially, if you like visual novels and stat-raising sims, you might like this.Oh, and Yoriko is my waifu.			"

												It reminds me of Persona 4; I love it! I just wish the story and the gameplay lasted longer and we were able to keep going with the story. Let's say everything was achomplished, we would then be required to start attending and doing events for the club and interaction with real life events. Events, love life, school, then finally graduating and doing something similar and more time consuming with her going to collage. Would have been awesome! But I love it still;9/10			"

												The artwork is cute, characters are funny and likeable, and the plot is entertaining. Gameplay is simple; it's very much a time management game that looks like a visual novel. The controls are simple as well, once you go through the tutorials. I noticed some strange translation errors, mainly with the characters occasionally calling each other by the westernized names. It didn't ruin the game for me, but if you are someone who does not like this sort of thing, this is a heads up. Overall, it's a fun, cute game.			"

												The game itself is cute and occasionally funny.  You can read other reviews here which will tell you more.  My main beef is in the difficulty of the game.  I put in the 5 or so hours to get to the end, didn't make terrible choices, I don't think, but got the Bad Ending.  Now my only option is to start over and min-max my way into getting the Good Ending.  What fun!			"

It has hardly any cutscenes and is made in kind of a minimalist way (it's not Tokemeki Memorial), but it's perfect.			"

												This game made me legitimately laugh, that's how well the characters of this game are written.The gameplay is quite fun too, you're always running around the city to talk to potential members, to learn about various subjects and of course to make homework too. But once again because of the well written dialogue it's still fun to do and they're so many things to do it never gets repetive.The music is upbeat, it makes me want to play right away.And lastly the artstyle is really cute and colorfull a perfect fit for this style a game I'd say.I recommend this game, it's probably the only VN I have ever finished because once again it's written so well all the characters have a certain charm which makes them fun to talk to (even the NPCs!) I'm actually looking forward to talking to the NPC/characters whenever I see one because they just genuinly interesting.			"

												So, a little while ago, I finished doing a second playthrough of the entire game (first one was two-three years ago), and before doing so, I was slightly worried that the fond memories I had with this game wouldn't live up to what I expected it to be, nor would I laugh as much as before (viewing the jokes a second time didn't help it's chances). Well, not only was the game just a charming and rewarding as I remembered it to be, I... Honestly think I laughed harder and more frequently here then I did back in 2014.The game itself is about a 3rd year senior called 'Mairu' (Miley for the westernized English edition, who likes eating chilli dogs and going fast occasionally), who wants to start a comedy club to create the second successful female comedy duo to emerge from her school, Cherry Tree High, and the game is you picking up recruits by getting to know them and building up your conversations stats (so you appear more interesting and recruit people faster). Basically, a visual novel with movement and dating sim mechanics.Gameplay wise, it's not much, so to make up for it, the game puts all it's focus on it's presentation and narrative. The story, while inheriently simple, understands how to build around it's prescence to create a likeable world with likeable and well-rounded characters. The main cast ranges from reclusive to colourful, allowing for diverse personalities to work of of each other to create some pretty funny dialogue, Mairu in particular helping others through their problems with a mix of genuine sympathy and her motto of bringing smiles to everyone she knows. Their are moments where you question their methods of achieving their goals (especially one guy in particular), yet it doesn't take away your enjoyment of them, or their likeability.The game handles it's mood rather effectively, transitioning from despondent to full of joy and lighted rather seamlessly at times, and when it has to hold on an emotion for an entire scene, it'll do it simply yet potently. But honestly, that's probably mostly due to the ost that plays during these moments.Oh yeah, the soundtrack's pretty fricken great too. It's a short selection (only 8 songs), but the production work on them is so stellar that it makes up for that sad fact nicely, and the only leitmotif used has only one significance ingame whilist making up the intro and credit theme the other two times (distinctly mixed as well), which makes me happy beyond any reasonable measure. The ost can be anything it wants to be: Laidback and relaxing, cheerful and upbeat, depressingly emotion, you name it, and they're so well made that despite the numerous amount of times I hear them ingame, I never get sick of them. It's a shame I can't give more money to these people to purchase a copy of the soundtrack, but it's nice to know the developer included them for free in the game's steam folder, so props to him for that.Art style's got a liquidy, oil painting look to it in terms of background, which make for some very nice scenery, and the character designs got that nice little anime asthetic to them that seem to drives all the westerners wild (me included, to an extent), having sharper outlines that allow for a nice contrast with their surroundings. The designs themselves seem to match the personality traits of who they represent as well. It's a little hard to describe exactly how, but when you see a character, what you'd think they'd be like based on their look would most likely be right.Also, maybe it's just my particular sense of humour, but Mairu is probably the funniest video game character I've ever had the pleasure of watching spout one liners to everyone in her path. I suppose seeing how the game is called Cherry Tree High 'Comedy' Club, the humour really had to be on point, and about 85-90% of the time it is, it is, and that's including the whole cast! So it's good to know the game lives up to it's namesake.Clearly, this review has gone on long enough, and I'm running outta things to talk about, so I'll end on this:Admittedly, this game is the first visual novel-esque game I've ever played, and if I ever bothered to play another (excluding the sequel, which I did play), I'd consider it a great introduction to the genre. It has heart, comedy and a nice sense of everyday life atmosphere. I'm looking forward to booting it up again in another two years to get the same reaction I did the first two times, and I highly recommend at least playing the demo.Also, there's pop-culture references and memes that can be witnessed at times, so hopefully whoever's playing this in the future understands what's being referenced and won't consider (I'm pretty sure) one joke a dead meme. Actually, their was an original version of the meme joke in the Japanese version that wouldn't be understood by us 'uncultured' westerners, so they switched it to a different one. I'd guess you could consider it more a reference, but in my eyes, anything quotable and referencable is a meme in itself. If you're interested in learner either what scene in the game I'm referring to or what the original joke was, here's a link to the translation faq on the official website: http://cherrytreehigh.com/translation "
