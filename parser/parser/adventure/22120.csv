												I won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra series.Black Plague is the second of their three-part Penumbra series, but in this man's humble opinion it tops even their most successful of games.Yes, I said it. It's better than Amnesia. Now before you get to the hate let me just say that I adore Amnesia. It introduced me, as it did so many others, to Frictional Games' work. But once I finished it up I wanted more. I was lucky enough to see this package come up during one of Steam's classic Halloween sales and decided to snag it. For some reason or another, I started Black Plague first, and I couldn't have made a better choice.This game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notes. But this one does what I hope Soma (Frictional Games' next title) will do again - make a great story.I won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investment.I highly recommend this game.			"

												The sequel to Overture, Black Plague further tells the story of Philip which eventually comes to an end. In fact, it turns out, this is not the final episode (as Requiem includes further chapters) but for me it seemed like the final chapter of his adventure.The story now continues and tells us much, much more. Running and hiding is even more frequent and from this episode we can clearly see the couple of places that inspired Frictional Games to make Amnesia. The game is also somewhat longer.Since this is an essential part of a great survival horror trilogy, look for discount on the trilogy pack (if there's any) so that all episodes can be purchased at once. The story and gameplay are both well worth the ride!			"

												I can totally recommend this game to all horror fans(that arent searching for action horror) and everyone that liked the predecessor. Thick atmosphere, creepy experience. Good and clever puzzles without being too hard, but more challenging than in Amnesia. You can tell some good thought went into the puzzle design. The unkillable enemies arent as annoying as I expected, you can handle them with a bit effort or run from then in most cases. Story is also intriguing, finally you can make something out of it, more clear than  in the first part. Furthermore, really appreciate the way the story is told: Reading notes, checking logs etc. Very fitting for a game like that.Graphics arent too hot, especially for today standards, but you cant really say it aged bad. Enemy animations look a bit clunky, but overall the whole thing works for an atmospheric horror game like this. Afaik there is no way for steam to get German language for all the text, which might be an issue for some people.			"

												My recommendation: Buy it.Pros and Cons:+ Great, creepy atmosphere+ Interesting puzzles+ Good story- Small variety of enemies- Simple AITo avoid any spoilers, I'll just say that the game starts right where the Penumbra: Overture ended. You still play as Philip, in his search for his father and the truth behind the mysterious events in the Greenland mine.While the game preserves most of the features from the first episode - like exploration, puzzle solving and stealth - the combat system has been completely removed. Personally, I think that the lack of ability to fight back makes the game a lot more tense, especially because of the very creepy enemy design.However, enemy variety is still quite poor, but for one there is a lot less of them than in the first episode, and I've never felt that enemies were there just for the sake of it.The plot really develops in this episode, it's well written and interesting. There is a lot more interaction with characters, and some of them may even ""grow"" on you (pun intended), and the whole setting is much more twisted than it was in its predecessor.Voice acting and dialogues are also much better, while sound assets, musical score and graphical capabilities remain pretty much on par with Overture. There is also a lot more variety in level design and in the overall environments. While it's not that important, it's worth mentioning that the AI is still fairly simple, and that it's not particularly difficult to lose pursuing enemies.In general, it's a great sequel, especially in it's story. While it's scarier than Overture, it doesn't rely on jump scares, but on it's fantastic atmosphere. Definitely play it if you like horror games, but make sure to play Overture first for the complete experience.Click here to read my Penumbra: Overture reviewMore reviews on my Tumblr page.[megaskylight.tumblr.com] "

												This is the kind of game you'll have to play with a pair of headphones and no source of light because only then you'll experience its true power. The game's overall story is deep, unpredictable and intriguing, making it very interesting, which is a big plus for a horror game. (It even has a few emotional moments!) Even though at the beginning there is a short recap of the events that took place in Overture, I highly recommend playing the first game first in order to have a full understanding of the story. (You can only buy the package containing both games, so why not give it a try?)Both games are similar in terms of gameplay, but Black Plague improves a lot on about every aspect of the first game, making it more solid. There is no direct way of fighting with the enemies in this installment, so the combat system, which, in my opinion, wasn't that awful, should no longer be a problem for those who complained about it. Another important aspect of the game are puzzles: being the second episode, Black Plague is also filled with intelligent puzzles that require reading (in-game ""notes"") and thinking, but this time they are just a little easier than those found in Overture.The graphics may be a little outdated, but there's nothing to worry about because it doesn't break the immersion; they are decent and have successfully created a terrifying atmosphere that will constantly make you scared of the unknown. (For that to work at its full potential, I recommend lowering the gamma a bit, until you can't see anything in places without any source of light.) With its impressive sound design and voice acting (at least for a low-budget game), the developers managed to create their own world filled with few, but believable characters. For such a low price, I can recommend the Penumbra games without a doubt! This package is a must-have for every horror enthusiast, as it delivers a frightening experience!			"

												Amnesia's ♥♥♥♥ed up little brother. Same, interactive environment and just about the darkest storyline anyone could ask for. The soundtrack/lighting can give you a headache at times, but then again what sort of horror-genre game doesn't? Sound was a bit buggy in general; had to restart the application a few times. Puzzles are immensly challenging, roundabout corridors will keep you guessing, and the voice acting (which a lot take for granted) was superb. The entire game took me about five hours to complete (excluding idling at the main menu), and the ending was strangely satisfying. Overall: 9/10, would replay.			"

 ""Every time, it’s harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.” Penumbra: Black Plague is the second of three episodes in the Penumbra series. While continuing the compelling storyline from the first instalment it also improves the characterization of the protagonist. Furthermore, the excellent music background contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. The puzzles are challenging and enjoyable, without being illogical or forced. Without the awkward combat system of the prequel, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self-discovery.  Trivia: Penumbra: Requiem is the third and last episode in the Penumbra series. Originally intended to be a trilogy the series was reduced to two episodes due to unidentified problems with the previous publisher, Lexicon Entertainment. In the end, the third instalment came in form of an expansion pack in order to tie up loose ends and put the focus more on the puzzles. Amusing quotes:  “Is the emergency figurative or literal? A figurative emergency might, for example, involve an undersupply of coffee to the vending machines. A literal emergency, on the other hand, might involve flesh eating monsters rampaging about the facility.”  “So… you are running around with a human body part in your backpack, and I am supposed to be the bad guy?”  Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												     Well, as a second review, I want to make this as positive as can be. Penumbra points out the pefect imperfections of human nature. Dark areas with whispering, slithering, crawling and screaming in the background allows for a more ""intimidating"" experience. Enemies are fuel for nightmares, conjured up from the fears of fellow humans. The general atmosphere will make your heart pound and make you sweat. The good ol' fashioned jumpscares (how few they are) will last in your memories and well, deep into your dreams. Nightmares* excuse me.      Now, the ONE (1) bad thing I had was not game-ruining; a simple lighting error with the shader. A simple fix of course. Lower the shader resolution to medium. Bing, bang you're back in action! If you left in the first place. My computer is nothing close to a gaming rig, however, Penumbra runs at above 60fps with hardly (meaning none) any lag ingame, don't be deterred if you're using a less-than-perfect machine.      10/10 would rebuy, reinstall and replay it over and over.

												Black Plague was excellent. It gave the player a real sense of horror and inability to do anything and the way the whole plot goes from this game is excellent and shocked me.

												Penumbra: Black Plague is a sequel to Penumbra: Overture, an adventure horror game with more realistic physics for more immersive interaction. It was released in 2008, year after original, and yep, still made by Frictional Games, but this time under different publishers. They say that under pressure from old publisher Frictional Games turned what was intented to be trilogy into duology, Black Plague concluding the series. It's unknown how much from planned two last episodes was fit into Black Plague, it could be possible that something important got cut. Thus some people belive the ending to be a slight cliffhanger and want Penumbra 3 to happen, while others just view it as a proper bad ending of sorts. I am leaning toward the latter.You may notice that Steam store says ""Gold Edition"". It means that it includes Requiem, an expansion pack. Which you shouldn't think of as Penumbra 3, as it's just a set of puzzles that were cut from Black Plague without horror. Or big story. That, and maybe not cut, can't say for sure.So, as far scary, it's a step up from Overture. Or step down. Now, instead of fighting it out with dogs, developers decided to remove weapons fully. Instead you will have the infected roam the corridors, who look like creepy zombies. And you will not be able to fight them directly, instead your only options is to hide and avoid them. Which is supposed to make it scarier. If forget that they aren't terribly efficient killers as you can just outrun them easily and not even bother with hiding sometimes. Oh well, always hiding would have been too annoying for me.You aren't alone this time either, as the world feels more filled with other characters. Mostly human corpses that Overture lacked so much. But you will be accomplished by one sarcastic voice which isn't exactly enemy but not ally either. From one point it also brings in creepy hallucinations. Thankfully nothing that screams into your face. But then he and his sarcasm pop-up often enough that I can't help but to feel that at times game felt like a thriller with black humor rather than proper atmoshperic horror.The story of the game on other hand is enough to make you play it not because of atmoshpere but to know what is going on and what happens next. It's not just about being alone and reading tons of notes. Things are happening right in front of you and plot twists around, as it finally get revelead and tells you slowly what is actually happening, while Overture was barely hinting at things. It was exciting. For horror-adventure.Sounds and music were good at what they were supposed to do as well. Mostly tension. Sometimes paranoia. And sometimes relaxing in a locked little room, deep in a unknown.Puzzles felt more refined as well. Or at least they felt more fitting into main flow. Still got a bunch of standard puzzles and puzzles that make you use said physics. And throwing bricks to break stuff. And combining inventory items. Even if slightly less experimental than original.Black Plague is a much tighter dark narrative, much less about wandering in the dark alone, but still with nice atmoshpere and horror. A worthy conclusion to duology. Or main meat of it. Depends on preference.By the way, if you find all 10 statues in the game then you will be given a password. You can use it to play a simple Space Invader-like game on one of the in-game computers. Or you can open game's folder and use it on super_secret archive to unlock bonus materials.			"

												Frictional made some terrible decisions involving the story, how it's told, and how the player interacts with the antagonists.Edit: I didn't want to go into a lot of detail, but people are actually reading this review so I decided to elabroate a little.  There are also very few bad reviews, so hopefully this will give people a more rounded impression of the game before they buy it.  Also, I love Frictional and I can't wait for their next game.  The first Penumbra and Soma are excellent titles.One of the main characters is supposed to be this really omnious dude but they got someone who sounds like Bernie Sander's (US politican wish a hard Brooklyn accent) greasy brother to do the voice acting--it's completely immersion breaking.  That character is also incredibly obnoxious, it's more like dealing with an annoying child instead of.. well, what it's supposed to be.  That might have been the point, but I don't know how keeping a metaphorical fruit fly around the character's ear is supposed to contribute to suspense.The story went out of control toward the end, think sorta like M. Night Shyamalan.  Some people might like that; I think it's poor writing.  It's almost on the same level of bad as The Village.There's no combat in the game, which can be a positive, but all of the enemies are just really weak and slow, so it turns out to be more of an annoyance.  They also put them in your face so much you just aren't afraid of them by the end.  Of course as the game progresses more and more show up, so it's just.. more and more annoying dudes that you have to dodge and weave..The game has boss fights.  A story focused non combat game has boss fights.  They're as terrible as you can imagine.  There are also really gimmicky auto-kill areas in the game that don't entirely make sense.  It feels really jarring to go from being chased around by actual entities then in other parts just outright dying if you don't get the puzzle right or if you're mediocre at platforming.  That's not horror, especially with how dying is handled.  It just turns into a quickload cycle until you get things right.  While that might work in something like Silent HIll or Resident Evil, that's not good gameplay for a strictly story based horror game like Black Plague.A lot of people really really like this game, and more power to them.  The game has a really cool atmosphere and the environment is interesting and creative.  Opinions are opinions, take what I have to say along with what everyone else is saying and come up with your own decision.  A lot of the fluff/extra parts of the game are really good, but the core--the story and how it's told--is awful.  That's why I don't recommend this game.Edit: Added an actual review.			"

												Like it's predecessor, Penumbra Black Plague is environmentally interactive, even being able to break glass bottles, throw boxes off cliffs, and play jenga with bags, barrrels, and books. Unlike the last game, the sequel seems to have gone more the paranormal route but still have elements of survival horror. I was glued to this game to find out the mystery behind it all. Unfortuntely, I cannot say the same for the expansion Requiem. It seems it was just made for puzzle solving and adding a severe mind**** to everything you have just played/experienced. I basically just rushed through the puzzles in the hopes I would get something more from it. I don't know.NOTE:  This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												This game much like the first is really good. I did not like it as much as the first game, but not by too much. I thought the story was still very strong, but they definitely were going for a much more ""helpless"" feel and more focus on puzzles than lurking around in the dark avoiding enemies. Though actually, when considering the end of the game, this theme actually makes a lot of sense...There's definitely a lot of evidence of why they went with no combat in Amnesia after they made this. It made this game feel way more out of your control and more terrifying.			"

												This series astounded me! I never even heard of this game until I completed Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Both Overture and Black Plague are very good. I personally sided with Overture just a little more, simply because I liked the feel of the mines. Although I do have to hand it to Black Plague, the story was enhanced. This survival horror has so much to offer with the variety of thing's to find. Or if your a completionist (like my self) you can look every where in the vast mine and really delve deep in to the story. In my mind this game exceeds Amnesia because the deep thought and emotion Philip feels towards objects, scenery, and creatures is so realistic. It made me feel as if I were Philip, only more terrified. The puzzles were very well thought out, some very hard. Most games have their downfalls though. Such as Penumbra was more about the puzzles and story, rather than the horror. I admit, I jumped twice. Other than that it was not to scary. The ending was very suprising and I would reccomend it. I give it a 8 out of 10.			"

												If you took Portal and turned it into a survival horror narrative you would have the Penumbra series.Penumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd installment in the series and the best hands down.  The heavy focus on exploration, lack of weapons, brilliant level design, ambient sound and fantastic voice acting make it a well rounded experience that paved the way for games like Outlast and Amnesia: The Dark Descent (this studio actually made that game).If you love horror you owe it to yourself to play this.  People who assume horror can only be jumpscares will laud FNAF as a 'masterpiece' but that game looks like a sunny day at the park compared to the viscreal scares of Penumbra: Black Plague.			"

												The second installment of the Penumbra series that picks up immediately after the end of Penumbra Overture.  Right off the bat, the mere menu screen with it's dark, grimey visuals and it's deteriorated, darker music fills you with the dread of the horrors that await you, making you realize that everything is getting worse and more hopeless for our main protagonist.  Not much has changed gameplay-wise, keeping the scares high as ever, except now, that terrible combat system in Overture has been completely removed.  You will also find yourself meeting a new support character and an unexpected antagonist that evolves psychologically in the player's mind that not enough games have been able to pull off with their bad guys.  To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed this game more than Amnesia and I hope anyone who has played Amnesia will feel like this one will stack up nicely to it.			"

												Players having reveled in the oppressive atmosphere of Penumbra : Overture rejoice : The sequel remains invariably in the same spirit. Better yet, it even reflects a true rise, while the scenario is gaining depth and some of the mechanisms of the most questionable gameplay were happily balanced by the wayside. Black Plague, even horribly ugly, finally manages to create an atmosphere heavy and sticky, while carefully avoiding falling into the trap of overbidding. An unusual title worth the trip and makes us very happy to land at a relatively modest price. Under these conditions, why deprive yourself?			"

												WIth the ending still fresh in my mind I felt like writing a review as I did with the first game.  Frictional loves their psychological horror and it shows.  If the first game dealt with the unknown and trying to understand what this is all about.  Black Plague is about going about fixing what happened.  Only nothing is what it seems and everything is out to kill you even the voices in your head.  Without spoiling anything its a lot more puzzle based than I remember Amnesia being.  Onward to part 3!			"

												Even though I personally prefer Overture to Black Plague, I have no doubts about recommending this game. Many people consider Black Plague to be the best in the series and it is clear to see why.Overall Black Plague is a pretty satisfying continuation of the story. It has a longer runtime, more aggressive scare tactics, and better balance.I am thrilled they did away with all combat and weapons, and the number of enemies was scaled back appropriately. The gameplay flowed much more naturally and felt slightly more polished compared to Overture.A lot of game-time is spent searching/fetching/backtracking, but I never got lost and my progress was never really halted, so I wouldn't say the game is frustrating in that sense. Not always super fun to run back and forth through the same area repeatedly - there were times when it got old - but for the most part the story helps move everything along. If you can stay immersed, it is fine.The setting isn't as compelling as the mining tunnels of Overture. Not many memorable environments, a lot of repetition due to the nature of the building. Considering this, I thought they did a great job with exploration and keeping things fresh.I was missing the role of writings in this game. In Overture there was just enough cryptic information in the form of notes, newspapers, etc. It created a constant duality of discovery and horror. In Black Plague there were almost no interesting notes to find. Instead I felt like information was just being thrown at me from every direction and I was told too much too soon. There was almost no sense of mystery left. Have to say I wasn't a fan of the many new characters/people/personalities introduced. There was a lot going on and I never felt isolated. Unfortunately it hurt the tension for me and I ran through the game mostly without fear. Despite that, there is a good amount of horror to this game in the form of some very effective and memorable sequences. Outstanding use of audio and light/dark.I'm not one to get frightened, so I am stuck perpetually chasing the high of horror, looking for the fear and rarely finding it. I do love the thrill of this genre, having developed some kind of obsession with morbid material.Some of Black Plague's scares got a physical reaction out of me (quick heart rate, adrenaline) and I'd notice my hair standing up or my spine tingling and realize the game had spooked me, even if I didn't know I was scared. It was worth it just for that.A lot of decent scare tactics are used, along with some cheaper jump-scares, and it's a lot of fun. I enjoyed seeing what they came up with and when the game caught me off guard. It was kind of like a haunted house.Complaints and nitpicking aside, I had a blast with both games. Penumbra delivered a satisfying experience with plenty of mystery and entertainment. It let me smile, curse, and gape in horror. Well done.			"

												WARNING: SPOILERS!!How do I start? Penumbra Black Plague is an EXCELLENT game. Frictional Games have really defined themselves as experts in the horror genre. The first game, Overture, was good but it lacked the horror we experience in Black Plague. In Overature, you can fight your enemies with various tools you find throughout the environment. While this was a good idea in itself, the physics based movement/interaction coupled with combat made for an incredibly clunky control scheme. However, in Black Plague, you cannot fight your enemies. You can either run and hide, or die.Most people know Frictional Games for their work on Amnesia: The Dark Descent. People believe that this title set the standard for horror games. But to really see what horror is like, you need to go back to Amnesia's roots, which all started with The Penumbra Series. Black Plague does more than just scare you. It makes you question reality. It makes you wonder what really is possible, and what is just the making of a nightmare. You start as a Philip, a dangerously deranged man who has just been to hell and back during the first game in the series, Overture. You wake up in an a prison cell, your mind completly fragmented, with no recollection of how you got to where you are. You have to put the pieces back together through notes, puzzles, and exploration. As you make your way through the abandoned facility, you realize that your shattered memory is not the only thing you need to worry about. There is something much more terrifying thats lurkes the hallways. As you duck and dodge through a multidude of enemies, you must figure out the reason for the madness that is happening all around you. As you uncoover more secrets and start getting your memory back, you realize that you can no longer simply escape. You discover a sinister plague, something that has taken control of not only everyone around you, but yourself as well. You must find a way to stop it from spreading to the outside world. You must destroy it! Stricken with insanity, voices insulting and deterring you with every step, as well as the many grotesque creatures that patrol each corridor all add up to a horror game that is a cut above all the others. 9/10 - A near perfect horror experienceYou will thoroughly enjoy the horror that this title has to offer! (FOR BEST EXPERIENCE, PLAY ALONE, WITH YOUR LIGHTS OFF, AND WITH HEADPHONES.)			"

												This is an atmospheric first person survival horror game at its best. Combat is there, but almost completely obsolete against your enemies. You are much better off using stealth and tactics. *Thinking*. Using the environment to your advantage. This is a real horror simulator where you are the victim, the target. You are not a survivor, you are not a well-armed super-soldier blasting his way through zombies, parasitic creatures, mutants, and the hordes of hell. Before I go ranting about how to play this game and how it is so different from the common horror shooters that are actually *fun to play* and inevitably drive you away from a well-spent ten bucks on this game...You're locked inside a building where nobody is your friend and all your enemies have bigger d*cks than you. In fact, they're so proud of their d*cks they're willing to display them, with a facial expression that says ""look at my big ♥♥♥♥ while feeling so inferior, saddened in your depression that even the big f*cking worm prefers me to you. That if any girl were around, she would see that your ♥♥♥♥ was so inferior to mine.""Of course, you won't be looking at their face or facial expression, because you will be so distracted by the sheer, immesne size of their d*ck. Even when they try to kill you, you will not be able to help but look at the big, red, erect thing between their legs. You'll find yourself running away from them, maybe turning back to catch a few glances... and then finding yourself going back to get another good look. You also run into these strange objects that Philip (Yes, your protagonist's name is Philip...) feels the need to masturbate with. He even goes out to say “Every time, it’s harder to pull out. Every time, I feel more of myself inside.” at least *one* time in the game. I must say that it's quite an experience. I feel more of myself rushing out too... I don't want to pull out. I want to keep going. Now, back to talking about the game:This is not FEAR. Instead of being r*ped (because steam doesn't like the R word) by an 8 year old girl and killing ghosts in slow-motion, you will feel utterly helpless as large, gray skinned men beat you to a bloody pulp and get their bloody pulp inside you. You won't care, because you'll still be distracted by their d*ck.There's a story, somewhere, along with schizophrenia and some rather tense moments. However, it would be better without the schizophrenia and split personalities, which get really damned annoying at times and totally ♥♥♥♥ the entire sense of terror and fear. Imagine getting off really hard and having your uncle walk right in and say ""Oh yeah, I used to do that all the time."" Not only does it kill the moment, but you want to stop and never do it again. Think of your dead great grandmother watching you masturbate and laughing at how you're doing it so ""wrong"". It really kills you.Sorry, back to the game. Well, no, I've just about wrapped it up and concluded it. You'll have some ""half-life"" type puzzles involving physics (Placing blocks on a lever is the extent...) and some resident evil style puzzles involving pushing boxes around. That's about it. You might find the combat system to be fun if you're really bored. You can throw boxes at enemies to try and kill them (Boxing Match). This will allow you to inspect their large d*cks more closely.

My review is based on finishing Black Plague and not playing Requiem. My review may change afterwards. Penumbra: Black Plague is a pretty good wrap up to the original, Prenumbra Overture, which follows a man in the search of the whearabouts and the mystery of his father's dissapperance from a Mine/Bunker/research facility. The game plays near exactly the same and you can probably play this without playing the first Penumbra, but you will miss out on many references and the game is a direct continuation of the first game - so it is not recommended.It retains the same style of gameplay from the first game, minus any combat except for maybe one sequence near the end - you won't be using any tools to smash vents and knock enemies about here. You will will mostly lurk around enemies in the dark (though, the game seems less dark) and solve relatively simple puzzles involving combining items and reading notes. You still have the annoying ""mouse motion"" controls when is a huge pain when trying to turn valves or move objects quickly.Saying much of the story is a spoiler, but I will say that you engage with protaganist that reminds me of Mark Hammil's Joker from the Batman universe and learn of a fairly interesting reason for the events that occur. Both main titles are a good value at $10 total and the game should be seen as an inventory based adventure game with a first persion perspective and a horror theme. Outside of platforming and moving objects, stealth and action are relatively minamal.  "

												For a low-budget game, it's pretty good. Story is somewhat interesting but flawed in a few ways, such as certain characters' roles. Environments are atmospheric, and often isolate the player. They're generally devoid of any true living beings, but you'll find that a strange presence controls the ""dead."" Though there are zombies, don't let that discourage you. They're not your typical stupid walking corpse, but more terrifying. For the price that it is, I would recommend purchasing it. Just because it's low-budget doesn't mean that it's bad.			"

												Huh! Unlike the console horror stylings of Overture, Black Plague feels more akin to, say, System Shock. A combatless System Shock! Does that make sense? Maybe not.Anyway – the writing is surprisingly light-hearted and comedic than the first game or horror games in general. One particular character is basically writtten like a devilish, sarcastic Stephen King antagonist. That may or may not be to your liking. Humour tends to spook away the horror. All in all, I appreciate how they went a different way with Black Plague, and in its way this is an extremely worthwhile game in a world where sequels tend to tread same ground.REQUIEM, though... so, you know how sometimes there's like a ""10 new levels!"" or a ""time trials expansion"" pack to a story-driven, self-contained game?Yeah, Requiem is one of those and it's sort of a snore. Basically, it's Penumbra: Aperture Science – nine boring ""hit the lever"" puzzle stages with a fourth-wall breaking female computer voice cracking jokes on someone's behalf. Art assets seem to be recycled from the earlier Penumbra games and their scrapped content, and the ending doesn't really relate to the main game story. It's basically a crock.			"

												Penumbra is a horror/adventure series by Frictional Games, the developers of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While not nearly as good as that horror masterpiece, there is still a lot to enjoy in Penumbra. In fact, it's very easy to see how Amnesia eventually came to be what it is - its elements are on full display here, albeit in early forms. While the games do have some scary bits, overall the fright-factor is not quite where it could be. This is mainly due to the somewhat dated graphics and easily thwarted enemies (which, unlike in Amnesia, can usually be killed). The puzzles are generally pretty decent, with only a few solutions being particularly obtuse. So, while not perfect, the series is still worth a look for horror/adventure game fans, especially those who enjoyed Amnesia and are interested in seeing the roots of that game and supporting its developers.Penumbra: Black Plague is the 2nd game in the series. It improves upon many aspects of Overture, and is the best of the 3 games.			"

												Another brilliant game from Frictional.  Or TWO games, rather!     One word of warning about Requiem, though:  It's pure, 100% puzzle-solving.  Well, okay, a couple of treacherous bits of jumping and timing here and there...but apart from environmental hazards, there's no way of dying (i.e. no ""enemies"")...which makes it less of an action/horror game than the others, and yet oddly spooky and suspenseful in spite of all that.  I still spent a good deal of the game half-expecting something nasty to jump out at me, but alas...!  I would in any case heartily recommend this pack to anyone who enjoyed the first Penumbra and/or Amnesia, though would suggest that only those who enjoy the puzzle-solving antics in and of themselves proceed to Requiem.     (Oh, and don't attempt to play the latter if tired and grumpy, 'cause there's head-♥♥♥♥ing aplenty.  Personally I waited 'til I was in a particularly ""intelligent"" mood - which doesn't happen often, let me tell you - before committing myself to a session.  Though I will be the first to confess, I'm pretty dismal at these puzzle-solving games!!!  Stare me in the face all you like, chances are I STILL won't see you...)Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

												Like Amnesia, Penumbra Black Plague is the type of horror game where you experience pure fear in the presence of enemies, because unlike more traditional horror games like Doom or Slient Hill you don't have a shotgun or any means of defense other than running, hiding and hoping to god you're wearing clean underwear. Gameplay is heavily based on puzzle-solving and navigating dark corridors where you have no idea what's lurking around, no companions met face-to-face and real time inventory, meaning you can't just open your backpack and remain worry free from the attacking Tuurngait while trying to figure out if something you're carrying will kill it (fact: you can't kill them). My main gripe is with the subconcious alternate personality in your mind, Clarence, and how he ruins the atmosphere of the game with his grimy wise-guy voice. Running out of room: Penumbra is not nearly as scary as Amnesia, but it gets the job done well enough.			"

												Imagine Half Life without firearms or even your crowbar. Black Plague features a significantly different art design over it's predecessor Overture. Featuring less abandoned mines and spider infested caves with underground facilities with advanced technology and a mutant plague virus that threatens the world. Sound familiar?Black Plague however distinguishes itself in numerous ways to Overture. For one it's significantly more character driven. The original only had two major characters, the player and the enigmatic Red who wasnt even modeled ingame. Here you have a skitzophrenic voice in your head and zombies walking linoleum hallways.Really what can be said about Black Plague? It suffers from the same problems as Overture, and vis-à-vis it features all the improvements so dearly needed for the game. So really... it's just a sequel that feels like it needs to be packaged with Overture instead of seperated.			"

Each puzzle had 2-3 keys which we had to find to open a secret door. Still fun!			"

												Penumbra Black Plague is an improvement over its predecessor Penumbra Overture. Instead of fighting random animals, you will encounter mutated humans. Unlike the first game, there is no possibility of combat against them. You are defenseless against them, upping the ante on terror and suspense. The music is still excellent and the controls are solid once you get the hang of them.This particular package, Penumbra Black Plague Gold Edition also includes the final game of the trilogy, Penumbra Requiem. Unfortunately, it is the worst game in the series -- easily. In this game, I never felt any suspense but mostly frustration because it was loaded with convoluted puzzles (the worst part of the series) and completely lacking any monsters, therefore no sense of being followed (the best and scariest part of the series). I didn't feel a need for wrapping things up with the main character's storyline, which is what Requiem does essentially. Requiem's biggest sin is the fact it centers around the main character completely as opposed to continuing the plot from the previous game, leaving no room for any scary moments whatsoever.Overall, this game is worth the purchase. Personally I think the series ended well with Black Plague, as there was closure in its conclusion. But if you want to play the whole series for the sake of completion, go for it!			"

												10 dollars for the whole pack..... Really, why haven't you bought it yet? Seriously? So, Overture is a truly well-done game, as the 2nd game Frictional Games, the makers of the Amnesia series and the upcoming Soma, started out with a Penumbra 2006 Tech Demo. (available for free on Frictional Game's site so try it out if you aren't sure about getting it) Then, because of it's rising popularity, they created Penumbra Overture. I really don't want to spoil anything, but it has one of the best atmospheres in gaming. Your father died. You have found a letter left by him, talking about a security deposit. You go to it, and find a note that tells of a faraway place. You go there, and you get caught in a snowstorm. So, you find a buried hatch, open it, and fall into a mine. You have to find a way out. One thing leads to another, and you are stuck in a mental hospital. That, is how they chose to start Penumbra Black Plague. And, I am only halfway through Black Plague. So, 10 DOLLARS FOR 3 FULL GAMES.  and, why get Amnesia for 20 bucks when you can get the first 3 games for 10! Oh, and the games are really good.			"

												This game was amazing! It was a great horror game, and my personal favorite of the penumbra series. It had some jumpy moments and the first time you encounter an infected can be very heart racing, but not the scariest game ive ever played. Amnesia was a little more scary because you cant lose the ""monsters"" as easily. But, i actually recommend this game (or series) over Amnesia because the enviornment is better/scarier. This game had amazing physics and the puzzles were extremely fun. Amnesia has a story but the objective of the game is not to beat it, but to immerse yourself in the enviornment. But penumbra has a story that is meant to be beaten, not to roam around and light candles, and its about immersing yourself in the chilling enviornment. I highly recommend this game it will be worth every penny. WARNING: DO NOT LOOK UP A WALKTHROUGH UNLESS ITS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY! THIS WILL RUIN THE GAME BECAUSE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FIGURING IT OUT YOURSELF! enjoy  "

												After the first one I felt in love with this kind of game experience. Gathering notes, exploring the facility for the artifacts. Like I said about the first one, it has a great atmosphere of despair. You feel like you are alone in this god forsaken place.But like in the first game, after one or two enemies encounter you forgot about hiding tactics. You just dash your way through the hallways, and avoid enemies by jumping. The game has one or two encounters when you need to use your brain to defeat or avoid enemies. But beside this two exception there is nothing to fear from monsters.			"

												One of my favourite games ever,much better than the first and while not as polished or as scary as Amnesia I prefer it since the theme of a secret facility and abandoned mines are much more interesting to me than the usual haunted house/castle in Amnesia.     This Game continues from the first and the story is still a intriguing,mystifying and scary story,better puzzles and harder too since you are usually in danger while doing them so you are distracted and might do them in a shaky rushed way.The gameplay I feel is slightly more refined and the physics system is still innovative.   Since you can't fight back and the enemies are quite fast so the best method is to hide in the shadows terrified the infected with the flashlight will see you and bash you in with a crowbar.Still a staple for any horror fan,cheap too even bundled with overture.

												Quite good overall. The captivating nature and excellent production values of Penumbra: Overture are present in full in this sequel, and the story is brought to an interesting conclusion. I did find it less satisfying than Overture though, owing primarily to two flaws. First, the problem with the enemies has worsened, in that they are rather unchallenging and in fact I found it very difficult to take them seriously at all, certainly not as much as the plot tried to sell them. Second, there is a noticeable shift away from horror and more towards rather lacklustre sci-fi, and the darkness of the theme is broken by comedic elements owing to a certain, shall we say, character that accompanies the player throughout most of the game.

												Like the first part, Overture, Frictional Games again manages to capture the true essence of survival horror improving from last time by incorporating better sounds, atmosphere and a somewhat tighter story with memorable characters. The voice acting was superb throughout but while the humourous moments helped lighten the mood faster in order to regain that ""SHOCK"" moment more often, I felt that this rushed approach wasn't well executed nor received.The total removement of the combat system is what I think makes this game far superior than its predesseccor. You have to run and hide rather than club your enemies to death.The best thing about Black Plague was by far its script, it never fails to keep the player both captivated and horrified. The end message was well thought out and delievered although the overall shortness of the campaign may disappoint the die-hard fans who were looking for something a bit longer.Overall, this game is superb and fully deserves your time and money.

												The Penumbra series is one of the only horror series left in modern gaming - story driven, challenging, dark, and believe it or not, scary.  People call Doom, F.E.A.R., Dead Space, and Resident Evil 4-5 horror games even though they're no more than just shooters.  If you're looking for something more authentic and deep, then give Penumbra a try.  Remember to play them at night.This game shines brightly in both survival horror and existential horror.  Dialogue is one of its strongest aspects, and Penumbra is uniquely good at developing characters quickly, off screen even, and building up toward an inevitable encounter.  Overture does this numerous times as does Black Plague.Overture is a slow burning torch while Black Plague is a rollercoaster through hell.  Both are only about 4 hours long.  They are not mere jumpscare fests, having very few if any.  But the uneasiness and terror are constant.  Overture is the only game from Frictional Games to feature combat, so Black Plague has none.  They are also known for their practical, sometimes physics based ""puzzles"" but they are not really puzzles, just problems.  Requiem however, the unnecessary expansion for Black Plague, has puzzles.  Requiem is purely a puzzle game; cleverly designed puzzles that are challenging by the genre's standards.  But Requiem is an unnecessary story expansion designed to deliver a more clarified ending because small minded gamers find Black Plague's brilliant ambiguity too much.Penumbra is a must play.  It has aged exceptionally well, being wonderfully fluid save for turning valves/wheels.  It is better than Amnesia, mostly due to it being far better written.			"

												The Penumbra series is as good as Amnesia... well... both games are great because their made by the same developers (Frictional Games).  The storyline is extremely great and is probably one of the best horror games that can tell a story driven by the player itself, the first chapter (Overture) has a vague entrance to the story, but once you complete Penumbra Black Plague, you achieve a full understandment of the story and man... is it remarkable. Overall, this series should definitely be played by anyone who likes a good plot and/or horror games because it can be compared with other great games.  This recommendation goes for both Penumbra Overture (Chapter 1) and Penumbra Black Plague (Chapter 2), I'm planning to do a playthrough of Penumbra Reqiuem... not sure how that's going to turn out because the main protagonist dies *massive spoiler lol* but anyways, reqiuem should probably be as good as the main series, and it probably tells the story from a different perspective.

												I picked this up on sale recently as I've always wanted to play it but never got around to it. As a fan of Amnesia: The Dark Descent I was excited to get started. The game is fairly old so getting things up and running was a bit of a chore but was easily resolved with a quick google search where I learned that I had to disable a setting in the compatability menu in Windows for the executable. There fixed, now onto the game. The visuals look pretty good for a game this old. The creepiness and suspense is pretty great as well and will have you scared to come out of whatever hiding spot you may have found during certain parts. The puzzles weren't to challenging but rewarding enough I suppose. I like that there are a few ways to approach some of the physics puzzles so it doesn't seem like you're hand is being help the whole time. The story is interesting and easy enough to follow even if you never played the previous games which I had not.The game is pretty short like Amnesia but it keeps your attention right to the end. Overall I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for something like Amnesia and haven't already played this.			"

												A classic horror game that still scares me after watching lots of people play the whole way though. I totally didn't get stuck in the first room for an embarassing amount of time... Anyways it runs and looks great on old hardware. Story is top tier and filled with content, what more could you ask for!			"

												Apart from Amnesia, this is one of the few horror games I can actually recommend. The graphics are ok, but the sound is what makes the game extremely athmospheric. Controls are spot-on and easy, just like the inventory system. Also, the story is very good and overall, the game is a very enjoyable experience. The only thing which kinda annoyed me is the fact that the enemy AI is dumb. And I'm not talking about ""sometimes dumb"" but rather ""full Donald Trump dumb"". It makes the game way too easy if you've been spotted.Anyhow, the game is still recommendable due to its story and gameplay. So go ahead and buy it! You won't regret it.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Penumbra: Black Plague is the second game in the Penumbra trilogy and developed by the gods of horror; Frictional Games and published by Paradox InteractiveI won't go on and on with this one, but let me just say that before Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent became synonymous with fear, they were perfecting their craft with the Penumbra seriesThis game has it all. From the atmosphere that breathed down my neck, tingling my spine and darkening my thoughts to the gameplay immersing me into the world, this game hits all the right notesI won't spoil anything, but let me just say don't let the atypical setting of a mental asylum fool you. It's much more than that, and giving this game enough of your time to find out why is well worth the investmentI highly recommend this game and the Penumbra trilogy in general! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Not only have i finished this game more than 5 times, I just keep going back. The game has an amazing puzzle story. Some parts so hard that I raged on. :P If you have played this game, you must have heard of Amnesia. This game is really simular. The atmosphere of this game is stunning. I always let my friends play this game, but then somehow I end up kicking them off of my PC because I get jelly and want to play. Do I recomend this game? Definitly.

												Loved it, The beating heart of the Penumbra series.The pace of the game was quicker and darker. Some great twists and turns and the ability to fight back has been taken away since the first game.Better than Overture by far but the strong story makes both games playable. Only 2nd to Amnesia Dark Descent as a horror in my books.Requim is the series going all jar jar binks on itself and is more frustrating than scary but it game with black plague so whatever.			"

												This review comes from someone who played Amnesia before any Penumbra game, so make of that what you will. I'll try to keep this short.I'll start off by saying that, on the technical side, the game is pretty darn good. The engine itself (as evidenced by its use in more recent games by Frictional) holds up very well to this day. Black Plague was released in 2008, so it's not incredibly old, but, in an age where I have to check whether or not entirely new games will actually run on my specific combination of hardware, I haven't had any trouble in the slightest getting the game to run. No crashes, no graphics issues, no slowdowns, nothing like that at all. The only problem that I have with it in that regard is that you can't change the FOV, but that's set just high enough for it to not be a problem for me, at least.A lot of the game revolves around physics-based puzzles and they've definitely put enough effort in to make sure that the physics engine works as perfectly as it should do. Objects feel like they weigh as much as they should, moving objects around isn't a chore and the game knows when you want to put an item in a specific place and locks it there without any hastle or feeling like it's doing your work for you.On the subject of puzzles, for the most part, they work well enough. The solutions are invariably completely intuative (no, you're not going to tie a balloon to a banana and feed it to a monster to get that computer running, you're going to find working drives and format them), and, on the off chance that the answer is simplified a little so that it doesn't get in the way of the game mechanics, it still makes perfect sense and there's a way to find out how to do it. As someone who frequently gets frustrated with adventure/puzzle games and has to turn the Internet off so that I don't cave and look up the answers (i.e. an idiot), I figured everything out for myself pretty quickly, save for one puzzle near the beginning which made sense in retrospect. The only problem I have with the puzzles is that many require finding multiple specific items, and, without fail, every one of them will be hidden behind a couple of other physics objects that are stacked in an odd and very conspicuous way.Now, unfortunately, there are two very big issues that I had with the game that, while they weren't quite enough to stop me from playing, they are bad enough to me that I wouldn't personally recommend the game. The first is the story: the story of Penumbra: Overture, while not groundbreaking, was at least intriguing and subtle enough that it kept me very invested through the whole game. In Black Plague, that subtlety goes right out of the window from the beginning when it gives you a very clear and safe view of the new monster, then, sometime later, the player character develops an internal voice in his head whose main purpose seems to be to explain every plot point several times over in case you didn't pick up the hints. There were several times when I read something interesting in a note and got as far as thinking ""I wonder if that means-"", then he'd immediately chime in and say that that's exactly what it means, please don't try to work it out for yourself. It honestly feels like Frictional realised that they could afford voice actors for this one and just decided to throw in literally anything that they could think for them to say, no matter how dumb or obvious, on top of the quality of the voice acting giving Bethesda a run for its money. I also counted four times in the first hour or so where the player character had the exact same realisation about himself. Add in how, for some reason, they decided to throw in an almost constant barrage of downright embarrassing attempts at humour (seriously, one computer asked if I was sure that I wanted to do something, then if I was really sure, then if I was really really sure...) and I got to the point where I just couldn't consider this a horror game anymore.On that note, my other problem with it is that it really doesn't feel like a horror game in almost any respect. It's very dark (lighting-wise), yes, but... that's really it. It doesn't take long to realise that you're in almost no danger whatsoever. I think that I came across four things in the entire game that were able to hurt me, disregarding an obvious tripwire ""puzzle"", and the very few enemies that you do encounter can be outrun, avoided, sneaked around and generally outsmarted with no effort at all. I appreciate the rudimentary stealth mechanics as a massive fan of the Thief series, but the enemies in Black Plague are exactly as intelligent as the dogs in Penumbra: Overture, which is to say not too bright.In conclusion, I suppose that, if you just want puzzles and can appreciate something of an adventure/puzzle game in first person (some mechanics actually brought back memories of classic point-and-click games, but much better-polished), and can also tune out the excuse plot for those to exist, then I can definitely recommend the game because I enjoyed those parts a decent amount. If you're looking for a compelling horror experience, then, as far as I'm concerned, you're probably not going to find it here, although I've met people with a completely different opinion to mine. I'll also note that it's pretty short; it took me slightly over six hours to finish, but you get the entire Penumbra series for £7 at full price, so that's absolutely more than fair for that length.

												What can I say, this game is terrifying and had my blood pounding through my viens every step of the way.This game uses an awesome item control system that makes opening doors and draws easy and fast. Items can be moved in the way of doors to give you time to hide and the leaning was actually useful in a game for once. I also really liked the whole sanity system where you lose your mind looking at the ... things? The graphics are not the best but considering time of release thats expected and also I found the quality gave the game a scary feel and atmosphere.The story was deffinatly good but confusing at times and I found it did not fully explain the concept of the ... things?, where thay came from, what they are, why they are here and why they attack you. However this could just be me being an idiot.All in all I think this is one of the best horror games there is and even if you don't like a scare get it anyway and scare your friends when they come over.

												Predecessor of Amnesia, I actually liked this game more. It has more puzzles and actually forces you to interact with the enviornment, something Amnesia rarely did. While Amnesia certainly created a more atmospheric game, Penumbra is less slightly less atmospheric with more emphasis on puzzles. Also, Penumbra has a much better story line than Amnesia.

												This game is plenty entertaining, if a bit frustrating at times and tonally inconsistent thanks to the presence of an annoying ""sidekick"" character for a good chunk of the game. The atmosphere, while normally good, is at its best when there are no enemies to worry about, since the persistent monster patrols quickly become tiresome. The puzzles are the real star here, and while there are a few stinkers that refer back to the ""logic"" of early-90s point-and-clickers, they're normally quite tactile and satisfying to complete thanks to liberal use of the physics engine. Black Plague, then, is nowhere near as impressive as either Amnesia game when taken as a whole. Still, its flawed story is perhaps the most ambitious that developer Frictional Games has created yet, and its (mostly) enjoyable while it lasts.			"

												Black Plague was a good survival horror game that you might not want to play at 1 am while alone in the dark.  The plot really advances the story of Penumbra Overture and is also emotionally captivating.  I really enjoyed this one, if being scared for 11 hours can really count as an enjoyable experience.I do not, however, recommend Requiem.  The best I can liken it to is if George Romero made the zombie horror movies Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, but then made Day of the Dead a musical romance about vampires.  Let me be perfectly clear, Requiem is not a survival horror, it is a puzzle game, and not even genuinely creepy.  Half the time it isn't even clear what you're supposed to be doing with the puzzles, you just kind of see there is something you can do and then do it, and everything seems to work out.  Without giving anything away, it felt like an afterthought and I don't think it added anything to the story.  If anything, it was an anti-climactic buzzkill with a convoluted story that did nothing to advance the series.Unless you like platform jumping and puzzles for the sake of puzzles that have (mostly) no discernable purpose, stop at the end of Black Plague and use your imagination and decide what you want to happen from there.  Since Black Plague is 2/3 of this package I still recommend it, even if my review was very critical of Requiem.			"

												It's rather short, but rather sweet. It was an earlier ""Amneisa: The Dark Descent"", and while it's not as good as Amnesia, it's still very scary. On the unfortunate side, some of the puzzles are unclear or difficult, so be prepared to look up a walkthrough.			"

												A good game, made by the same people who made Penumbra Overture and Amnesia. If your into puzzle horror games then this is what your looking for, Its puzzles can be simple or just damn too confusing. However the horror makes up for the puzzles giving Penumbra a dark atmosphere, Its story line isn't something to follow as most of the time you will be interested then flat out bored of it because its mostly go here do this and then go there and do that. Overall Its a good game and would recommend it.			"

												---Review for Penumbra:Requiem DLC--A bit of a disapointing end to the trilogy.This installment forgoes monsters and focuses entirely on puzzle solving, which wouldn't be a problem except for the Portal-esque manner in which it does so.  Unfortunately, the rationale for why the test levels feel so artificial just isn't any where as good as Portal (nor are the puzzles as good as seen in Portal).The setting is the same, although less dynamic and panic-inducing than previous installments, but there's little to no plot progression.  We get a small glimpse of the fate of the character we've been playing right at the end and that's all this installment adds.   I was rather hoping for more.			"

												Solid, pioneering bit of horror FPS. The first game I'm aware of to use the FPS ""grab and interact"" style of gameplay which later made Amnesia such a firm favourite (this being the predecessor). I just complated it today, and it really does sell atmosphere incredibly well. The graphics are really dated at this point, but it didn't stop the scares coming thick and fast.

												This game is scary, both with jumpscares and being chased. It is a little bit of a puzzle game, too. If you can't get past a certain part, and you are sure the thing you need is in the room, TRUST ME, you're right. Most of the times I was playing this, and I was stuck on a part, it turned out the thing I needed was in the very room I was in. Except when I was looking for something later in the game called ""substance 65"" and a hacksaw, and a gas mask. Anyway, the only monsters that chase you are these weird alien-infected things that used to be humans, and the things that jumpscare you are some hallucinations. One last thing, there is a game before this one called Penumbra: Overture. GET IT. I don't know if I got a collector's pack because I got a deal or because they are just selling it like that now, but either way, PLAY OVERTURE FIRST. Otherwise you'll have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA JUST WTF IS GOING ON. Overture is kinda boring, and much harder both playing and with riddles, AND requires MUCH more patience, but is worth it if you wanna play THIS game the right way.so 6.5/10 wud make a crazy guy cut off his hand agin			"

https://youtu.be/6uvhQ5H4Scg?list=PLzVDMpjrANuXZJP9kS-UMIyv0yQ5WWVOw One of the best old school horror games out there but have to say since it is old I feel like they could have not made such a weird ending to this series. Overall the game had it's atmosphere and that is importent. I enjoyed the game up until the end, I had no idea what was even happening. Still I would say start Penumbra Overture first then Penumbra Black Plague. Puzzles were not as hard but still challenging. I felt most of the Overture puzzles were more hard to be honest. As when it comes to threats the character Phillip only encountered the tuurngait. You had way more in Penumbra Overture but still overall game was great and had a wonderful time! That is my entire playlist for Penumbra Overture and black plague.			"

												If Overture didn't freak you out enough, Black Plague will leave you with a sizable yellow stain in your pants and an urge to seek the nearest motherly figure and embrace her until the utter terror introduced by this game subsides. Unlike its predecessor, Black Plague gives you no weapons to defend yourself with and pits you against intelligent enemies and tricky puzzles. If you're looking for a spooky physics adventure rife with adrenaline rushes and bouts with fear itself, look no further.			"

Ihr Leuchtet da schon mit Taschenlampen herum die Batterien benötigen, sie kann also immer ausgehen, aber zur sicherheit habt ihr auch ein Leuchtstab, dass vorallem den Horroreffekt einleuchtet ! Mit dem Leuchtstab seht ihr nicht viel im dunklem, nur etwa 1m weit, dass heisst wen ihr läuft kann jeden Moment etwas vor euch auftauchen !!! Mit der Taschenlampe sieht man weiter, aber nur weiter nicht breiter ! Man sieht den strahl entlang und da kann immer etweas durch hausen und wieder im Dunklem verschwinden, was echt zum aus der Haut fahren ist ! Ich musste stopen das Spiel spielen, ich war noch jünger und schwächer mit den Nerven ! Ich bin nicht wirklich weit gekommen, aber ich werde wieder loslegen :D ! Das ist klar !

												These game where recommened to me by Tork/Eric, I really enjoyed them, I prefer a little more killing, I didn't find them all that scary, but I like where this series is going, I hope they expand on these, I got the whole series for cheap so it was worth it, I think I got like 15 hours out of all 3 games that are a part of this series. I like the old-school feel it had to it, kind of reminded me of a game called ""the dig"" maybe some have played it, or maybe a king quest where you have to find the right tool, although far more linear than a king quest.  If you like horror and suspend you'll like this, not a game for little kids though, like I said I don't really find things all that scary, but it will get your heart racing in a few spots where you are trying to avoid enemies.

Penumbra: Black Plague - the beginning of the end. After leaving the abandoned mines, Philip's journey continues as he finds himself imprisoned in the so-called ""The Shelter"", being even more determined to find out his father's fate; the circumstances in which he finds himself also play an important role in his decision of pursuing the mysteries behind this desolate location and its downfall. The pinnacle of this short horror survival series is found in this game where our character not only meets a couple of ""his friends"" from the previous game but he also makes some new sentient bipedal ""friends"" as he explores the depths of ""The Shelter"" in search for answers.Relevant psychological themes and horror survival combined with interesting and captivating puzzles make this game an exceptional journey with a meaningful and well-made storyline. An unique experience you have to try.			"

												While writing this review, I found it hard to write it without just saying ""It's Penumbra: Overture, but without the hit-or-miss combat system and with more reasons to be frightened of the world."" Because that's precisely what Penumbra: Black Plague is. It's the example of what a successor should be. It sticks to what worked in the original and removes what players didn't like. For example, Penumbra: Black Plague maintains the terrifying atmosphere and adventure game elements of Penumbra: Overture, but removes the (overly reviled) combat system. There was also some new additions, with one specific addition being a character that constantly messes with Philip's mind (and by connection, the player's mind).Anyway, continuing without connecting it to Penumbra: Overture, Penumbra: Black Plague is just a excellent horror game, and the clear step toward Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The game starts off immediately, with only a brief cutscene explaining the prior events. From that point, Penumbra: Black Plague is practically a nonstop horror show of twists, turns, evil science, hallucinations, and an ancient evil. As cliched as I'm making it sound, the whole of the story is highly creative, with an increased atmosphere as well. It's just as terrifying as Penumbra: Overture, if not slightly more. The removal of combat helps, along with enemies that won't give up the chase and hallucinations that constantly make you question reality. As for the gameplay, the removal of combat makes Penumbra: Black Plague feel identical to the classic adventure games of the 1990s, such as Tex Murphy and Myst. It's a change that is highly welcome, as it becomes amplified with decent exploration, hidden collectibles, and great puzzles. It's a very tense and terrifying game with a great story and more than decent visuals.Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition also gives you Penumbra: Requiem, a small expansion pack to Penumbra: Black Plague. The expansion is decent for the most part, trading the old-school adventure approach with gameplay more akin to Portal. The puzzles do mesh well with the gameplay, creating some intricate, multi-part puzzles.  However, the atmosphere is pretty much gone here and, while still occasionally eerie, it's not nearly as terrifying as the original two games. The story does try to tie up all of the loose ends, which it does reasonably well, thanks to two endings that are up for interpretation. It's a short stint, but worth looking into if you want to see Philip's story to the end (or ends).			"

												Penumbra: Black Plague is quite simply, a continuation of Penumbra: Overture. It might as well be considered one single game. The engine seems to be the same used in the first game, and most mechanics are identical. The atmosphere continues to be dark and creepy, with the addition of some new surprises that surface throughout. Everything is basically the same, with only the plot and storyline developing further. The one major improvement in comparison to Overture is the amount of thrills found in this iteration. There seems to be more action and more atmosphere overall, which makes the game more enjoyable, more creepy and a bit more scary. The story progression isn't as interesting or original as in the first game, but at least it has much more detail and much more depth. The voice acting also continues its high quality performances. Loading times are atrocious and much longer than in the first game, which tests patience. Some of the puzzles included in this game aren't as logical as in the first. The unintuitive puzzles are more complicated and mostly involve trial and error during a particular segment of the adventure. There are also more absurdly hidden items and mechanisms, which makes this game much more difficult in terms of its playability as an adventure game. There is also more interaction between the player and other characters in the story, which quickly dissolves the feeling of being a solitary person in a creepy and scary locale. The developers decided to get rid of the melee combat instances completely (found in the first game), which I agree is for the best and makes the game more tense and more fluid. There are way too many interruptions for plot development voice acting. Without ruining the experience with spoilers, I will say that these voice acting pauses occur almost at any given time, without a focus on storyline turning points. They can get a bit distracting at times. Not having the ability to engage your enemies in melee combat makes the game so much more tense and exciting. The ending is very good and adds to the story rather well. Penumbra: Black Plague is better than Penumbra: Overture in every way, as it corrected some of the developers' mistakes and made the gaming experience more enjoyable as a whole. This is clearly the best adventure game I have ever played; totally exceeding Penumbra: Overture. Once again, the game runs a little bit short, but I suppose it is of adequate length after all, since it is an adventure game with lots of theme and mood. I am now looking forward to the third part in the series.Penumbra: Black Plague is good.			"

												I think I mentioned this in my Overture review but this game blows Amnesia: The Dark Descent away in terms of its plot and actually being a proper horror game. That being said it relies a pretty good amount on you playing the game properly and not just sprinting through it as fast as possible.Anyone that played Overture (you should play Overture first) will be glad to know that there's less chase sequences in Black Plague. Some of them I couldn't tell if I was actually being chased or not, I wasn't gonna risk it so I hurried anyways. No hordes of spiders chasing you through small tunnels at any rate.This game is kind of similar to A Machine For Pigs oddly enough in how it handles the plot, I suspect Chinese Room took a lot of inspiration from Black Plague in how they designed AMFP. Though don't get me wrong there's a plethora of ways to die in Black Plague, unlike AMFP which you basically had to try to get something to attack you.If you enjoyed either of the Amnesia games you'll enjoy Penumbra as well, you just have to keep in mind that it's an older title running on an older engine.

												Felt a little short, but I think this one is an expansion. Pretty good game, scary, great for playing in a room with friends. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Amnesia. Note: The Penumbra series came BEFORE Amnesia, so don't expect 100% the same experience. They made progress with Amnesia over these games, but they're still enjoyable.			"

												I simply couldnt get into either Black Plague or Overture.  If you, like I, come to this title as a heavy fan of Amnesia and SOMA and are looking for a comparable experience, I feel that you will be disappointed.  Simply put, I feel the production quality of this game is significantly low enough to seriously break the immersion of disbelief at times.  Some examples of this are: laughably crude ""dream"" sequences that look like something out of a bad Amnesia custom story, ♥♥♥♥ poor animations and character models, and fumbled horror elements.  A sub-example of the last item is one time I kept getting caught by a patrolling monster, eventually the horror was lost and it became more of an annoyance.  Another would beThe same caliber of story that Frictional has delivered is all here.  The gameplay mechanics are also near identical.  But unfortunately it doesn't have the polish to pull off the same experience as their follow-up titles.  I think if you able to look at this as its own game in addition to having a serious appreciation for single-dev/handful-dev indie horror titles, you will like this alot.  But if you want the same caliber of experience as the aforementioned counterparts, it simply isn't here.			"

												Although I give this game a 2/10, I think this game still is interesting and fun, except for a few parts. Which is why I'm recommending it. I've played this whole game in a livestream on my youtube channel Elle And Gramps, if you are interested to check it out, I will leave a link:

Now as I said at the end of the second horror stream (really couldn't come up with a better title.) the game does it's stuff well, it's not overly scary but the ambiant is there and it's definitly enjoyable that way. However, I feel like the ennemy's A.I could've been made more sharp, and less easy to pass by. By the end of the game, you literally just run by them, knowing they can't kill you.Some parts are kind of confusing, definitly a bother every now and then to figure out how ♥♥♥♥ works.The story line is 100% linear, you cannot do anything different. Even after trying to die against the illusion to get rid of it, I still had to kill the illusion. Even after the request, I still betrayed.. So overall, I think that's a huge loss of points in my bookBut, like I've said, regardless of all the bads, I think it's worth playing even if it's definitly not a game of the year and it doesn't do anything.

												Penumbra: Black Plague is a very fun and story rich game. It acts as a sequel to Penumbra: Overture and it incorporates many elements of the original into the sequel, like dead versions of enemies from the original and the same overall setting; (Although it dissapointingly removed weapons). This game is mostly driven by horror, however in some parts it uses unique puzzles, which in some cases get mixed with horror; which gave an interesting end result. This game (like it's predecessor) used enemies, though the enemies in Penumbra: Overture were far less scary than the enemies in this game, for many reasons. One of which is that the enemies in this game talk to themselves when they are near you. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game, but you should also play the first one first as it helps a bit with the story (A mistake I made).			"

												I wanted to like this game, but couldn't. TLDR: It wasn't that much fun overall. Not really much of a horror game (not scary). I found the voice of Clarence to be rather annoying. The puzzles were bothersome at times. The ending took turn way out into left field. Longer review:I will start by saying that although the first installment of this series (Overture) has its flaws, I was able to finish the game without a walkthrough and the story was interesting. Black Plague on the other hand improved upon some of these flaws, but ended up making a worse game in my opinion. Story:Black Plague continues about where Overture left off. However, it goes in an entirely different direction by involving some organization that is apparently a gloabl order. It felt like much of what happened was created after the first game rather than having been the plan for the story all along. By the time I reached the ending, it felt like the story had gone into a whole other direction. And then there is Clarence. He is a voice in your head that (if you play you can figure out how he got there) was just really annoying. I understand the overall contribution of Clarence to the plot, but I would have done it differently myself. But perhaps his annoying voice and dialogue were exactly what the writer(s) wanted to show. Overall, it wasn't satisfying for me.Gameplay/Puzzles- The gameplay and object interaction were pretty standard if not better than Overture. I definitely think that Black Plague was better off without combat. The enemies were not difficult to face, but rather acted to obstruct you on the way to your next destination. Overall standard gameply. The puzzles were problematic for me as I wasn't really into the game and was in a hurry to finish it, so I often would miss an item that was needed to solve the puzzle. For example, one puzzle required a book or note to tell you how to complete it, but I never saw it and thus was frustrated as to why the puzzle made no sense. Thats on me, but I probably would have liked the puzzles more if they were actually realistic. For example: at the beginning of the game when you need a soda to short circuit the wiring in the refriderator room; I didn't realize putting in some random and crushed coin into the vending machine would get me the soda. I couldn't go back to get it because the boards over the spike pit had fallen. And there were perfectly fine liquids in the room. Why couldn't I have just used one of them? Anyways, the puzzles were not always consistent with the objects you could use to complete them. I personally didn't find the puzzles to be realistic at times (not that this game is meant to be real of course)Horror: There weren't any parts that I felt scared or surprised. The environment had good horror elements, but I could always see enemies coming and never really felt any danger unless I couldn't solve a puzzle fast enough. But the death trial and error system helped bme to not worry about death. Simply put, the game wasn't really scary. Just dark and spooky maybe. Graphics: Its an older game so I didn't expect anything great. I am sure it looked fine when it came out. The graphics aren't detrimental to enjoying the game.As I said at the beginning of this review, I didn't find the game to be enjoyable or fun. The story evolved in a way that didn't make much sense since there was no foreshadowing of it in the first game. There were some links of course such as the ""infection"" it self, but I think it all fell flat by the end. I guess if the game goes on sale and you don't have any better options available, it is not that expensive and will provide a few hours of gameplay. There are many positive reviews, so you may enjoy the game. If you are looking for a solid horror game, this is not it. It is important to note that the devs did make substantial improvements in these areas in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.			"

However, the ending puzzles, for example the one where you had to sacrifice yourself and then become someone else, was quite fun.I also like that you could select between disarming the bombs or pass by the bombs without tripping the laser, for example by the help of large barrels and boxes.

												This isn't the most horrifying game I've ever played, but definitely one of the most horrible ones.I really enjoyed Overture and I just had to play Black Plague after finishing it. And in the beginning I really thought it was better.But nooo, the developers had to introduce some really annoying things. It's nice that weapons have been removed, the were really unhandy. And not useful at all in this game - not because the new, scarier-than-the-Overture-dogs-looking enemies are dangerous. They're the opposite. They are so ♥♥♥♥ing slow. Just run past them, 5 seconds later they won't know where you are.Then there's Clarence. Some kind of demon who possesses you in the beginning and comments everything you do. I guess his comments are supposed to be funny. They're not. They aren't informative, they aren't interesting, but they are really long and distracting, sometimes they even block the controls so you just stay and wait until he stops annoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. He even spoils the most ""emotional"" moment in the game.The gameplay, too, becomes annoying. Try solving some riddles while having to run back to a hut every 10-15 seconds so you don't freeze to death. It's not even difficult, it's just extremely tedious. The riddles become really uninspired and in the end I mostly played by a walkthrough because I was done with this piece of crap.And lo, this ending! Instead of just staying on the ""horror"" plain, the game suddenly ascends onto a pseudo-metaphysical plain which doesn't fit to the rest at all. I would've liked to laugh, but it was way too stupid.I'm still going to play Penumbra: Requiem, but only because it's a 100% puzzle game without annoying enemies that just slow you down instead of making things more difficult.

												Slightly better than Red Lake. SlightlyOk, I wanted something interesting and thrilling. Got something weird randomness with a buch of jump-scares.Moving and stacking objects: Maybe the worst thing about this game. Occasionally you'll have to stack some boxes to jump over laser-triggered mines (which were put up by a delusional person, judging from their locations). And mines only go off when you pass through them, they ignore objects for some reason. So you'll have to put one box on top of another. But jumping on them will often move and destroy the structure. It is annoying as hell.Puzzles:[Mild Spoilers] If you want to get through that door, you'll have to inject some kind of ♥♥♥♥ into your arm and pass out. When you get up, the door will magically unlock. I don't think I need to add anything else.Jump Scares:They speak for themselves really. The only thing the game can frighten you with are jumping images and loud sounds. Additionally, it is just raw. There is a point where darkness literally bites and kills you. You have to cover two holes in the wall to avoid that....			"

												When it was released, Penumbra had a relatively sophisticated physics engine. Too much of the game relies on the player marveling at the ability ot move objects around. And when that wears off, which it does very quickly, you're left with simplistic, unsatisfying puzzles.High points of the game are the writing, which you observe in the form of scattered notes, and voice-over work. Overall, the game feels like a software physics project with game elements forced upon it.			"

												Black Plague: I don't understand how people keep raving about this game, when I kept getting objects STUCK IN the floor, objects I needed to solve puzzles.  At first I thought it was a feature to add to surrealism, but then I got stuck on the wrong side of said object in a tunnel and couldn't solve the puzzle to move on.  Maybe I'm spoiled since I played Amnesia first and then backtracked to Penumbra, but..the physics failure made this unplayable for me. :(			"

												This Linux port is not OK. I gave it a try for 40min, but in the end I gave up. It's the experience that turned me away.First I started it to see if my Intel card can take it. Surprinsingly, it appeared to work very well in 1280x1024 (good framerate for this type of game, decent texture quality). I had to configure it from using Pulse Audio to ALSA, but that's OK. A lot of applications don't get the Pulse Audio integration right. Then I grabbed a coffee and prepared to go through this game from A to Z. I wanted to experience all its features.The first hickup: multiple monitors. I have a second monitor connected to my laptop. The xrandr/xcb support for this is working perfectly (all applications [thus far] supporting multiple monitors have no issues). But this game simply doesn't get it right. The list of resolutions is weird (I don't know where it gets those), I can't predict on which screen it will start and if I increase the resolution past 1280x1024, it will use both monitors in one large canvas with the game centered. It's unusable. Thus, I'm stuck with a low(ish) resolution.The game tries to start in fullscreen mode, but today it started doing a decoration-less window mode. Very unusual. There does not seem to be a truly _windowed_ mode, which most Linux users will prefer specifically because fullscreen with X is a very complicated affair.The next hiccup: the sound. There's a constant ""click"", as if the game constantly misses the deadlines when feeding the audio sink.The next hiccup: CPU usage. Even though I'm in the main menu, the application consumes 100% of my CPU time. I appears to be constanly rendering something, event though I can't see anything noticeable changing. But maybe my driver is not so stellar. Actually, I'm sure it's not. When switching from X to the terminal, the CPU usage drops to ~6%.The game itself: I started with the tutorial. There's a step where I have to put a box into a coffin. Took me four tries to do that, because the box dissapears all of sudden. Eventually I managed to drop it in the coffin, but it made me woder if there was any QA involved in making this port.At this point I was pretty bummed and I was ready to do something else, but I kept doing the tutorial until my system rebooted (my laptop's fans didn't keep up with the generated heat; but that's an unrelated hardware issue I have). Hence: this review.All in all, the game looks very interesting and _maybe_ I'll try it again later, but it's a pitty that I had to step into all these issues which remind me of the Xfree86/artsd era. Maybe it works better on a desktop. Who knows,			"

												You may like the Penumbra trilogy if you loved Amnesia. Same Lovecraftian undercurrents, but everything feels much less polished: awkward combat, bad puzzles, etc. Overture and Requiem are still worth it. Black Plague however is just painful; it's a series of uninspired puzzles without any actual story, and it doesn't work.			"

												This is a horror game, in the sense that its horrifyingly bad.  It uses some old mouse system of interacting with things, meaning to open something you click it with the mouse, hold the key, then move the mouse somehow to open something.  Opening doors is a chore in this game, if real life was like this we would never be able to leave our homes.  Then again the first room in this game is designed so badly many people never make it out of the room.  Better off the games controls are some of the worst in the industry.  This game has daddy issues, as in its about finding out about an absent father or some nonsense, yea its not that interesting.Ha, I bet when the dev made this he was sitting there all like, man these controls are awesome, I'm so awesome, noone did this before, look how awesome I am.  Too bad its not awesome, and the reason noone opens doors and things like this is because its annoying. That is the feeling you get from this game its annoying, this game should be called Annoying: Black Plague Edition. Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												Great game! You don't find any weapons in this installment of 'Penumbra"", thus the emphasis on sneaking is always there. Enemies can't just be ambushed from the shadows as you can in 'Penumbra: Overture' to clear out an area and make it safe.If you want a scary and stressful time, get the Penumbra pack! Also, keep an eye out for 10 statues hidden throughout the game.			"

I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.Don't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds.

												Black Plague - a great 2nd after overture with a few more scares and some more challenging puzzles- the expansion - ""Requiem"" - was a bit of a let-down simply because it only featured puzzles.

												The Penumbra series is an impressive thing to behold. While Frictional Games' follow up title ""Amnesia"" managed to improve on this in nearly every way, Penumbra is still a very effective combat-light survival horror game.  You might find flaws in the interface, but you'll be sweating too hard most of the time to take much notice.			"

												The roots of Amnesia are undeniable in this standout entry from Frictional's sci-fi series. If the first part was a cautious walk the second is a full-tilt run: tighter narrative, better graphics, excellent level design, evocative sound, great enemies and even better physics puzzles. It also has the distinction of being a game that effectively crosses genres from mystery to horror fantasy to existential sci-fi and even buddy comedy on whim (granted the ""buddy"" is a psychic tumor). Admittedly Penumbra isn't an entirely frightening experience for the fact that the antagonists are a vulnerable batch of evil aliens (similar to Metro's Dark Ones). It absolutely has it's moments though, particularly the unseen creatures taking residence in the Kennel's long, dark hallwalls and the moment you're locked in with a person that's just succumb to infection. Bringing up the inventory or reading notes in real time also adds a tremendous ammount of immediacy to the proceedings (try fumbling through your pockets to heal while enemies are searching for you and you'll see). There is a third episode but it's a forgettable platformer which adds nothing to the narrative, nor the impressive ending, of Penumbra. Black Plague takes the sterility inherent  to puzzle games and injects the kind of story and mood you'd never really expect it could have.			"

												Penumbra: Overture's story and style were wonderful, but being able to just beat most of the monsters to death greatly undermined the horror element. The developer listened to complaints, however (which is something I wish the bigger companies would do) and produced Black Plague, which single-handedly fixes all the major problems with the original while continuing the intriguing story that I loved so much before. No longer can you expect to fight your way out of a tight spot, so your only options are stealth and pegging it. As a result, the atmosphere can get RIDICULOUSLY intense and your opportunities to relax become increasingly few later on.It's not quite the masterpiece of bone-shaking terror that Amnesia would become, but it's still bloody petrifying and easily worth looking into, particularly if you've already suffered through Amnesia and fancy even more abuse.

												To start: I used to add a header to every one of these reviews, but it oftentimes made the review too long to submit, so I've left it on my Backloggery page. Also, since this game comes with Penumbra: Requiem, I'll talk about that game in this review as well.Gameplay (Black Plague): Truth be told, you should probably refer back to the Overture review if you wanna know about the mechanics of the game. Since this is a sorta episodic game, I won't go into too much detail again about the mechanics. Just know that they remain largely unchanged. What has changed - and definitely for the better - is the atmosphere. Oh man, it's a lot better this time around. Again, it's not quite Dark Descent territory, but it's pretty dang good. The extra enemy variety helps out a lot as well. Another thing that has changed for the better is the puzzle design. They do require a bit more thought than the average puzzle in Overture would, but the puzzles still make logical sense and are less prone to breaking. All in all, it's the same from Overture but a lot better. 8/10.Gameplay (Requiem): If ya like puzzles and not being scared... go play Portal 2 or something. Seriously; I don't even know why this became a thing. This game is mostly puzzles with some platforming here and there, but there's no monsters. There's no atmosphere. It's pretty much Myst if you've turned the Gamma down to 0.1 or something. That's not a bad thing, though; a lot of the puzzles in this game are quite good. It's just not a Penumbra game. Also, the atmosphere... they're just taking the ♥♥♥♥ at this point. There's a Donkey Kong parody in there. No, I'm not joking. There's even chippy music. As if the game wasn't far removed enough from the Penumbra atmosphere. Again though, the puzzles are pretty good. It's just not a Penumbra game. 6/10.Story (Black Plague): A lot tighter of a story than Overture's. Clarence is a pretty neat and genuinely terrifying character/concept. Likewise, there's actually a couple of pretty heavy moments toward the end (for those who know what I'm talking about, pun well intended). Everything's pretty well explained and the ending wraps things up quite well. No need for a sequel. 8/10.Story (Requiem): ...and then this thing happened. Again, just... why? The story doesn't even take itself seriously. For anybody who bought Requiem from retail; I'm sorry. I apologize on behalf of Frictional (not affiliated). The characters are just silly, the premise doesn't make any dosh garn sense, the payoff is underwhelming, and it's just generally a mess. At least Dark Descent redeemed them. 3/10.Graphics (Black Plague): Again, a lot more of the same but better. Enemy design is the biggest standout as far as graphics goes. As for the technical side, same engine; same reliability. 4/5.Graphics (Requiem): None of the enemy design from Black Plague. At least areas are pretty varied, even if the framing device doesn't work. Again, for the technical side of the things, it's the same as Black Plague. 3/5.Sound (Black Plague): I'd say it's about the same as Overture's, which is to say very good. Enemies sound a lot more terrifying now, so that's a plus. Clarence sounds proper mental this time as opposed to cartoonishly mental. Good stuff. 5/5.Sound (Requiem): Way too try-hard. So much attempted atmosphere for so little worth fretting over. It gets kinda ridiculous, honestly. Ah well; it's not like anything else in the game was cohesive. 2/5.Overall scores for Black Plague are 8/8/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. Good stuff.Overall scores for Requiem are: 6/3/3/2; 4.7/10. Not good stuff.			"

												Penumbra: Black Plague might not have the best graphics, but it makes up for it with gameplay. Penumbra was developed by the same company that made Amnesia, and has many of the same aspects. It has enemies that roam around randomly, and puzzles that make you think WHILE being hunted down. In my opinion, the story for Black Plague is much more interesting than Amnesia's. The characters have amazing personalities (Clarence), and you will grow attached to them throughout the game. Some puzzles are unnecessarily hard, but I am proud to say I beat it without using a walkthrough.If you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, or Outlast, Definitely try this game.

Its  so good it has an uncanny way of transporting you in the game. You dont need virtual reality it does a good job of that alrteady. would be even more amazing to play though no doubt. It reminds me of amnesia the dark descent. Mainly in that though there are monsters you have no weopons in which you could defend yourself. I actually think its slightly scarier to play than amnesia.			"

												This is definitely the scariest game franchise there is, and this is coming from a guy who has been a fan of horror/scary games for a long time, i have played almost every horror game and franchise there is (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Clive Barker's, Fatal Frame, Condemned, Siren, Clock Tower, Alone in the Dark. System Shock, The Grudge, Cold Fear, etc...) and no franchise or game comes close to Penumbra, scariest one i have ever played for sure, the only game that could surprass it is Amnesia.Black Plague is the scariest oneRequiem is the less scary one			"

												I played this game off steam before so don't mind the 30 minute playtime. I invested quite a lot of playing hours into these games and I have never come across another series that did it quite like Penumbra. Satisfying story, excellent visuals, extremely well done suspensful moments coupled with probably the best interaction to the environment I've had ever. You really feel immersed in this world and invested in the task to uncover the story. I love these games.			"

												The Black Plague is a significantly shorter game (no more than five hours, generally) than it's predecessor, Overture.However, it's brevity is compensated by substantially more story and answers to players' burning questions on what the hell is happening in game.Penumbra: Black Plague still suffers from a lack of variety in monsters and challenges, though the enemy is far scarier than the models used for Overture. The Penumbra series in general is quite lacking in versatility and diversity of puzzles and challenges, but nevertheless makes for a very interesting adventure.I would recommend playing the first game to get the full story, but to be completely honest, Overture does not provide much at all to the story of the overall series, and Black Plague could be played alone with the majority of the themativ understanding still intact.Bottom line: The series in general has a brilliant story, but being an older game, suffers from repetitive puzzles and challenges. Overture lacked these excellent story elements, and Black Plague, while scarier and more immersive, was shorter and yet more repetitive. Together, the experience is fascinating albeit simple.			"

												After the disappointment that was Penumbra Overture, although I acknowledge it was an introduction to Black Plague, this game is indeed what Penumbra is all about. Having played Amnesia before, I believe this game feels fundamentally very similar, such as a parallel game (gameplay and mechanics are exactly the same) and at the same time very different (story, context and purpose). In this game there is an immediate sense of danger, there is no way to avoid enemies other than outsmart them, thinking fast and finding a solution right when they suddenly appear before you (while scarying the crap out of you). Also, you are CONSTANTLY solving puzzles. There is no way you can progress without solving a puzzle in the current room, every section of the game is a maze and requires going to point A to get item X to go back and open door B. and while you are going back the monsters come in. The story is where this game falls short. The motivation of this game is finding out what happened to the character's father, it is unknown if he is still alive. While you are at that, you get infected by an intelligent virus that talks to you (annoys you mostly) and can blurry your vision, confuse you, etc. That virus character is so annoying that made me really hate him and wish it was quickly over. Also, from Penumbra Overture I was expecting a different explanation to the existance of all those monsters, and it turned out to be a very different thing.Still, for horror game fans, it is an interesting experience, not superior to Amnesia, but fun nonetheless.

Penumbra: Black Plague is the second and longest official installment of the Penumbra horror epic. It begins immediately after the end of Penumbra: Overture, with the protagonist, Philip, awakening in a locked cell, having been incapacitated by an unknown entity. Black Plague fills in the sketch of the story begun in Overture, eventually unveiling the truth of the hidden facility disguised as a mine in northern Greenland, the method behind the madness of its inhabitants, both human and bestial, and finally Philip's father's dark secret.The game far surpasses its predecessor in the vastly increased level of terrifying surreal elements: in Overture, I was mainly running from spiders, hiding from mutant wolves, and being stalked by a madman. By contrast, in Black PlagueI waded through pools of blood to manipulate monstrous forearms growing from the walls and was forced into hallucinatory visions by a foulmouthed mental hitchhiker while fleeing for my life from disease-infested monstrosities.Gameplay-wise, Black Plague keeps the best aspects of Overture, and improves, refines, or discards the worse. All of the immersive, horrifying elements that made the first game an indie hit are maintained, along with environment-oriented puzzles and physical interaction via manual manipulation; Overture's clumsy combat mechanic has been completely removed in favor of more trap-based encounters with hostile creatures. By modern standards, the game is a bit graphically dated, but the writing and the ambience were more than enough to keep me fully immersed (and fully tensed) as I explored the hallways of the facility and the dark passages of Philip's mind.Penumbra: Black Plague is a psychological horror classic, and I recommend it to all fans of the genre.

												Very good game, much scarier than the original penumbra overture. I particularily liked the voice in my head, gave me something to look forward too. Enemies were a lot smarter and scarier although just as easy to avoid for the most part. The way the story played out was average. The end felt a little rushed but continued into the expansion pack requiem so I can't complain. The way items and puzzles were laid out was pretty bad, mostly because you get nearly no hints and have to deal with it yourself. I'd play this game again after a while, still have to beat requiem which I'm looking forward too. The game also felt quite a bit shorter than the original, with the exception of providing a more detailed story line.Storyline 5/5Characters 3/5Effects 3/5			"

												I'm a huge horror fan but sadly nothing scares me. I've been to some of the best haunted houses in America and I just have fun, but am never actually scared... (perhaps because I know it's all fake-Silent Hill 2 and 3 were the first games to instill a sense of doom in me. They remain to this day some of my favourite games. Penumbra: Black Plague, unlike its predecessor, is another game that actually made me feel horror. The creatures and atmosphere are amazing and there are moments that make you panic. I would recommend just getting this one as the first game in the series is boring and the only enemies are dogs and spider -.- and you have a WEAPON to kill them, where in Black Plague you have nothing, ever.8/10 from me c:			"

												Easily the best game of the Penumbra series. The movement is pretty smooth, the puzzles are a good challenge, it scares you while pacing itself and the story is good. The game is a tad bit buggy sometimes, but glitches don't occur often, so it's negligible. Unlike Overture's stupid combat system, there are no means of self defense. This, paired with the humming of machines and flourescent lights and other ambient noises makes the environment very creepy. A major flaw of this game is the budget: it's not too long and isn't very pretty looking. But who the hell cares? I think that might be the reason this game got such a low metacritic rating. But if you judged it on how scary it is, take the the total points of the Dead Space Series, divide by three, then add 10 and that's the score this game deserves. Short Review: Scary, fun/10, definitely worth playing.			"

												The second chapter in the Penumbra series brings back more of the same psychological horror that was put on display so brilliantly in Penumbra Overture. Some of the mechanics were tweaked a little to make the story flow better but all in all the game is just a continuation of the first. That's not to detract at all from what is offered because Black Plague is just fantastic.Like Overture, if you're at all a fan of horror then this is a game you shouldn't overlook. You'll be just as satisfied with this as the first.As far as Requiem, which comes with Black Plague, I'll just say that it is Penumbra's Godfather III.  Frictional isn't trying to do more of the same here, they are simply showing you how the Penumbra story ends.  Don't misunderestimate this title.			"

												Very immersive, creepy, disturbing, puzzle horror game.I never played OVERTURE, the previous game.But there is no real need as the previous game is explained in segments throughout this one.I really enjoyed this game. More than I did Amnesia, for the simple fact of the Date its set in. Amnesia is more like, reading an old book. This one is set in a year I recognise, or close enough, feels modern and through that I found I got into alot faster and enjoyed it more. Grab what you need and Run for the hills. This game has no weapons. You can throw items at enemies, but they dont die, they will just be distracted while you run away. But dont let the lack of combat put you off. This game is about the STORY, which is great. And sucking you into a nightmare, which, it does very well.Highly recommended for any horror fans, or anyone who played Amnesia or similar games.9 / 10			"

												This is where the Penumbra series shines, in my opinion. I'm having trouble remembering much about it because my brain seems to have blocked it out. If you're the kind of person who can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of horror games (and why would you be considering this otherwise?) you're going to love it. I found Black Plague to be scarier than Amnesia, but then I never really had a chance to get scared properly by Amnesia because there were always other people around when I was new so by the time I got to play alone I knew exactly what would happen and when, so your mileage may vary. The Penumbra pack is only $20 so stop reading this, get your ♥♥♥ out there and buy the games.			"

It's pretty much direct sequel to Overture. They removed that awful combat (thank god to that). This game included a lot of walking around in research facility, solving puzzles and solving the whole ""issue"" the story presented us.Horror element is almost nonexistent here. All you get is few hallucinations (and minor jumpscares from them) and some naked phallus aliens chasing you. (which really.. you can just run through them and use painkillers (if you have them)... if don't feel like sneaking) So I would recommend this games who enjoy puzzles and story, rather than for horror fans who would expect spooks from this game.

												Great puzzles (I cite the radio puzzle as the best I've seen in a game) and a lonesome, oppressive atmosphere (the setting is ripe for a horror tale) make this game a must for horror fans. For those unfamiliar with the genre it might be a bit of a dive into the deep end due to the clunky combat and the resultant emphasis on hiding rather than fighting. The physics engine adds a lot to the game, making it stick out a bit amongst its peers (especially for its time) as you can pick up items and place/throw them as you wish. This is primarily utilized for puzzles and creating obstacles to hide from enemies. The story doesn't go too far in this entry, mostly setting the scene for the sequel. It's worth experiencing, as it leads to something a bit more profound than what we're used to seeing in most horror titles.			"

Puzzles are still fun, hitting the sweet spot of not being too hard or too easy, and the story and its twists are fantastic, supplemented by great characters/dialog.

												Penumbra: Black Plague is basically a prototype version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This is not a criticism; just know that if you are coming hot off of Amnesia there will be some steps backward.Having gotten rid of the ability to fight back in Overture, Frictional Games makes a much more frightening game in Black Plague. The enemies you encounter in Black Plague are gross-looking, cannot be killed, and sometimes carry light sources to see you in the dark. Unfortunately, they are also dumb as rocks and there are plenty of objects you can jump on top of, safely out of reach, and look around to solve your predicament. At one point, I managed to glitch a mattress in a doorway to keep a monster out of the room I was in.Without spoiling too much, there are plenty of moments that made me jump or feel uncomfortable and the plot balances ""scary heeby-jeebies"" with actual plot development, letting the horror set in by implications of the happenings around you rather than the monsters you find haunting you.Overall, Black Plague is a vast improvement over Overture and from a design perspective, it's interesting to see how Frictional Games went from that game on to their more popular game, Amnesia. If you like Overture, Black Plague is better. If you like Amnesia, give the Penumbra series a shot (and check out the fan-made Penumbra mods for Amnesia; they take place after the official Penumbra games).			"

And that comes from a person who has played quite a lot of those.Personally for me this game even beats Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the matter of story and atmosphere.StoryThe story indeed is brilliant. It feels realistic, makes you truly involved in it.Every event has a cause and a detailed explanation. A very interesting one, too.Like in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the story is uncovered through the collection of notes and pages from diaries.There are also certain heartbreaking twists in both games, possibly the reason of my massive attraction.AtmosphereReminds Amnesia, but placed at a more recent time, with more real problems at hand.Instead of a lantern you have a flashlight, a glow stick and flares. The flashlight also requires batteries to work. Instead of darkness and ancient spirits, you have scientific research facilities and deadly viruses. In the first game you are also able to hold and use several weapons.ScaresNo jumpscares, only enemy AI. In the first game this is mostly undead dogs, and in the second game - something yet more interesting. The chase can mostly be avoided if one's good with stealth. Not always, however.The game is quite scary, but it mostly comes from the atmosphere.GameplayWell-done. No casualizing, there's full item interactions, descriptions; flashlight batteries are present. The gameplay is understandable and simple, while keeping the game challenging.In many ways it reminds Amnesia: The Dark Descent, except for the lack of sanity bar.ConclusionA good choice for anyone interested in a good exciting story, engaging atmosphere.For those who like scary spooky games - it's yours as well.However, if you are not interested in reading notes and absorbing the story throughout the game - you might as well enjoy something different.

												I love the Penumbra series, I think that in terms of ""scare factor"", it's one of the best games from the trilogy.But In saying this, the game lacks a decent storyline. Although it isn't bad, it isn't nearly as immersive as Penumbra: Overture's storyline and in fact, sometimes Black Plague's storyline can get a bit dull. So why am I recommending this game? Because I still think that despite what I've said, you will still get quite a lot of fun out of this game if you pay attention to the ""finer"" details.If you want to pretend that you're a badass by saying ""this game isn't that scary"", trying playing it with the lights out. Livestream it, I'll be sure to watch -_-			"

												I just gave Overture a negative recommendation due to the comparison with this game, which I feel is a huge improvement, and so I thought I should come and rate this one positively to reflect that comparison. In my opinion this game provides everything Overture has to offer and more. Even the story of the first game was explained in this one, making it complete on its own even without playing Overture.The story and characters are great, and the game wouldn't be what it is without them. It's definitely scary and both the scare factor and story compliment one another greatly. The puzzles are a nice addition, especially when also combined with the other two aspects. Definitely recommended.			"

												Penumbra: Overture had rabid dogs sprinting towards you at high speeds in dark, musty mine shafts; Black Plague has plodding naked people with giant heads wandering around fairly bright environments and this annoying virus ghost thing that never shuts up instead of good old Red. Aside from several nice setpieces I wouldn't consider it a scary or tense game compared to its predecessor (the slower enemies and better-lit stages make running past them a viable option in places where stealth was intended), but as a first-person adventure game it is a fairly solid, good-looking experience that's aged well and worth playing since it's bundled with Overture.

												I've played only a tiny bit of this game at the time of writing but I have never played something so consistently scary...Forget Hiding behind your Assault Rifle and Body Armour, you have no other weapon except your wits to protect you from the darkness...Creeping through Dark, abandonned offices, surrounded by noises...You're alone...Wait! Was that sound in your head? Who's there? Friend or Foe?This game is truly one of the few games that uses both Sight and Sound to maximum effect...Without any weapons or means of deffending yourself, you must switch off the lights and Hide in the very shadows that hunt you...Only will your ears tell you if it's safe...But then again...In a place where strange noises are in abundance, nothing can be rellied upon. Caution Advised.Play it in the dark all alone on until dark for a truly scary experience...One of the greatest games in its genre...Too bad about Clarence...			"

												Great game! You don't find any weapons in this installment of 'Penumbra"", thus the emphasis on sneaking is always there. Enemies can't just be ambushed from the shadows as you can in 'Penumbra: Overture' to clear out an area and make it safe.If you want a scary and stressful time, get the Penumbra pack! Also, keep an eye out for 10 statues hidden throughout the game.			"

												Another game from one of my favourite indie companies frictional games, the game itself is mostly about survival and beware you are not alone, for the puzzles you have to use a fair degree of intelligence to progress this means not looking online for a walkthrough, a problem i have is the game feels very short and the combat itself is a bit of a mess but then again these games aren't meant for combat so i can ignore that, i think that with a better soundtrack and a higher budget this game could reach the heights that it so rightly deserves but frictional have done a good job with the budget available and i will be looking forward to any new horror games this company produces i give this game a 76/100			"

												This game is quite good. I was unsure of these titles because I found both Amnesia games incredibly boring. But this game was very interesting. Ive played almost all horror games and most arnt scarey at all but this one did a good job. The creature (or whatever it is) always appears when you dont expect it and when it does appear your here, ""oh crap im gonna die."" The creature itself has a scarey atmosphere to it, the graphics are nothing to right home about but thats part of the reason why its so scarey looking. All in all its a good game worth the money.

												At first I thought it was going to be a first-person point-and-click so I got excited. But I soon learned the horrifying truth... that this would be a horror game! Environmental hazards, item puzzles, confusion, darkness and fear of the unknown... I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.

												The second installment of the Penumbra series, Black Plauge ticks all the boxes its predecessor failed to do. Its not without glitches but far less this time around. The save points are more common now and the enemies far less irritating when it comes to moving your character in search for the next clue. The puzzles are once again exceptional and the tone creepy and unsettling like its supposed to be. Would definitely recommend to any Penumbra or horror/mystery/puzzle fan in general.			"

												One of the best horror/puzzle games I've ever played and in my opinion it's the best one in the whole series of Penumbra. The underground laboratory and housing setting adds much immersion and the ""creatures"" that lurk down there do so as well. The Storyline is above-average in my opinion it's not God-Tier but its pretty good. There isn't much I can say about this as there is not much to say without spoiling it but I highly recommend this if your looking for a pretty good fright or just a good game to immerse yourself in.

												I am going to say that after SOMA, I hope Frictional tries something new out besides first person horror. It really seems that all these games are exactly the same. If you played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, don't bother playing this, it did not bring anything more to the table. The storyline and gameplay are at odds with one another, the grandiose monologues are empty and unaffective. I never felt anything but emptiness, stress, and dissatifaction the whole way through this game, and not in an aesthetically intriguing way - I just wish I never played this game. Amnesia at least made you feel like you were in hell, this game just made you feel like it was trying to tell you something but you were not sure what it was and just felt annoyed at all of its annoying voiceover and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPCs.

												Great follow up to the 1st part (Overture).  The puzzles you need to solve (again, like in the 1st part, they are evnvironmental for the most part) are substantially more challenging and there is  essentially  no combat in this one, rather, you need to truly make use of stealth this time around if you want to survive.  As for the umbilical gibbering manchildren things running around, I just about sh*t myself the first time I saw one (you'll know when the 1st sighting is about to occur as the character you are states that you need to hide, but I wasn't quite expecting what came walking through the door next).The lab/research facility a majority of this entry takes place in is definitely spooktacular and the graphics and sound are stll in top form (well, maybe not the graphics but the sound for sure).All in all this was a fun adventure and I can't wait to play the final part (Requiem).LATER (3/17/14 @ 6:30 PM EST):Well, I finally played + completed the final part (Requiem) and I have to say it was...interesting.  It kinda, sorta gave me the impression that it didn't quite belong in the Penumbra series, like it was a standalone game based, in part, on the 1st two games (Overture and Black Plague), but it was still a good game.  The puzzles were even more complex this time around and entirely environmental in nature; so much so that it should have been called Penumbra: Requiem for a Puzzle Solver.  Also, (this is a pseudo SPOILER if you read on and may throw some off from wanting to play the game at all knowing what Overture and Black Plague had to offer) there were no creatures at all save for a vague shadowy form under the water in the sewer area.Overall, this was probably my least favorite of the 3 parts in this series, but it was still fun and if you find yourself to be a hardcore Penumbra fan after the 1st two parts, then you should definitely give this one a go too!

												I think that people ignore this game and give all of their praise to Amnesia is CRIMINAL... Okay, it's not, but it's really annoying. Sure, Amnesia may have been a more polished experience (albeit with a convoluted story), but Black Plague introduced literally every noteworthy game mechanic that people think Amnesia invented. I also liked the story and characters better. I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.Don't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds. Some of the physics puzzles may get you stuck, but it's nothing a walkthrough won't help. If you liked Amnesia at all, then you'd at least like Black Plague.			"

												Easily the best game of the Penumbra series. The movement is pretty smooth, the puzzles are a good challenge, it scares you while pacing itself and the story is good. The game is a tad bit buggy sometimes, but glitches don't occur often, so it's negligible. Unlike Overture's stupid combat system, there are no means of self defense. This, paired with the humming of machines and flourescent lights and other ambient noises makes the environment very creepy. A major flaw of this game is the budget: it's not too long and isn't very pretty looking. But who the hell cares? I think that might be the reason this game got such a low metacritic rating. But if you judged it on how scary it is, take the the total points of the Dead Space Series, divide by three, then add 10 and that's the score this game deserves. Short Review: Scary, fun/10, definitely worth playing.			"

												I think that people ignore this game and give all of their praise to Amnesia is CRIMINAL... Okay, it's not, but it's really annoying. Sure, Amnesia may have been a more polished experience (albeit with a convoluted story), but Black Plague introduced literally every noteworthy game mechanic that people think Amnesia invented. I also liked the story and characters better. I can't think of any character in Amnesia that outdoes Clarence, and while story isn't as Lovecraftian or whatever, it at least made sense to me.Don't get me wrong; I like both games, but I'll always give the edge to Black Plague because of its -actual- originality, as well as its more modern setting, which appeals to me more on a personal level. You don't need to have played Overture, which is the Penumbra game that came before, and that's good, because Black Plague is better by leaps and bounds. Some of the physics puzzles may get you stuck, but it's nothing a walkthrough won't help. If you liked Amnesia at all, then you'd at least like Black Plague.			"

To be honest, this game I enjoyed more than Penumbra: Overture, if not as much! It as well as it's prequel, Penumbra: Overture is worth the money, but this time, it just might be MORE worth it, two more hours of gameplay than Penumbra: Overture did!

I would still recommend that you purchase Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition for two reasons; It's the only way to get Penumbra: Black Plague because Steam doesn't offer it by itself.Both games are aquired with the single purchase of Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition!(Why not get yourself and a friend a copy of this!)  :D[/i]Penumbra Series - Review(?)Penumbra is just a generally great series to play, it will more than likely satisfy players who enjoy horror games and puzzle games! (Off Topic) Additional CommentIf some feel the need for a number scale from 0-10 on how much I enjoyed the game and based on how well it was, by all means, leave a comment down below and I'll provide number scales for games I review here on Steam's Community Store Page Review area!  :ɔ "

												The sequel to overture has our protagonist pick up a fairly bizarre ""sidekick"" that provides for some comic relief and plot development among other things. Puzzles are a bit trickier this time around but still pretty sensible. This time you have no way of fighting the monsters which, like the previous game, is a bit of a non-issue since you can run to certain doors to escape them.			"

												Black Plague is a decent horror/puzzle/stealth game. Compared to Penumbra Overture, Overture was better for a few reasons.  Some of the scares from Black Plauge were recycled in the sense that how they scared you in the first game was what they also used in this game which lowers the suprise element, at least for me.  Black Plauge also brings in a lot of story which is a good thing for a game, but I think they might have overdone it a bit, they tried to do too much at the end. Without spoiling the end, it became very reminiscent of another popular game, story wise.  Lastly, the voice in the head was annoying and killed the mood for me. the good news is as stand alone game not compared to the first, the game is pretty good. It' s hard not to compare to the first game though as the story runs over, and if didn't play the first one, you would be really confused story wise.  Anyway, good maps, great atmosphere, freaky creatures, and decent puzzles.6.5/10			"

												You play as Phillip in the second tame of the Penumbra series. This one was definitely my favourite, I loved the story to this game that I still remember it very clearly months after finishing the game. I found that the game was lovely, had an interesting atmosphere, with fitting sound effects and mediocre graphics.There were a few little puzzles included here and there that you had to complete to progress in the game, but I liked that most of the puzzles weren't pressured by the presence of monsters/dogs. I like to take my time on puzzles. Once again, a very good buy and game from the Penumbra trilogy			"

												Penumbra: Overture's story and style were wonderful, but being able to just beat most of the monsters to death greatly undermined the horror element. The developer listened to complaints, however (which is something I wish the bigger companies would do) and produced Black Plague, which single-handedly fixes all the major problems with the original while continuing the intriguing story that I loved so much before. No longer can you expect to fight your way out of a tight spot, so your only options are stealth and pegging it. As a result, the atmosphere can get RIDICULOUSLY intense and your opportunities to relax become increasingly few later on.It's not quite the masterpiece of bone-shaking terror that Amnesia would become, but it's still bloody petrifying and easily worth looking into, particularly if you've already suffered through Amnesia and fancy even more abuse.

												The roots of Amnesia are undeniable in this standout entry from Frictional's sci-fi series. If the first part was a cautious walk the second is a full-tilt run: tighter narrative, better graphics, excellent level design, evocative sound, great enemies and even better physics puzzles. It also has the distinction of being a game that effectively crosses genres from mystery to horror fantasy to existential sci-fi and even buddy comedy on whim (granted the ""buddy"" is a psychic tumor). Admittedly Penumbra isn't an entirely frightening experience for the fact that the antagonists are a vulnerable batch of evil aliens (similar to Metro's Dark Ones). It absolutely has it's moments though, particularly the unseen creatures taking residence in the Kennel's long, dark hallwalls and the moment you're locked in with a person that's just succumb to infection. Bringing up the inventory or reading notes in real time also adds a tremendous ammount of immediacy to the proceedings (try fumbling through your pockets to heal while enemies are searching for you and you'll see). There is a third episode but it's a forgettable platformer which adds nothing to the narrative, nor the impressive ending, of Penumbra. Black Plague takes the sterility inherent  to puzzle games and injects the kind of story and mood you'd never really expect it could have.			"

												Continuing the story of Penumbra: Overture, Black Plague puts you back into the parka of Phillip as he winds ever deeper into the mysteries of ""The Facility"".

												I recommend Black Plague based on the scarcity of good horror games, but it is very flawed. It is much better than Overture, with combat completely removed, scarier enemies, and more varied locations. Penumbra actually has some scary moments this time. Problem-solving is generally better than in Overture, but again, logic can be inconsistent. Early on, the game teaches you that barricading doors with heavy objects doesn't work as the basic enemy simply flings the door open, but later, you have to do just that. Some sections seemed to be added just to worsen the game: a freezing outdoor segment that drains your health when away from fire, and a tedious computer puzzle involving the sorting of programs into circuit boards. If you can tolerate these annoyances, then Black Plague's interesting story and atmosphere make it a fairly good horror experience.			"

												Amazing game. A must have for any Amnesia fans. Penumbra: Black Plague features (as I call it) a pick up anything that you see layout.

												Penumbra: Black Plague, being a sequel to Penumbra: Overture, is of course a continuation of the same story with very similar gameplay. Considering how much I enjoyed Overture and that both games are on the short side (I finished this one with 6.3 hours logged in Steam), that was very much welcome. I got Overture with the first Humble Indie Bundle, and by the time I got around playing it the included offer to get the rest of Penumbra cheap had expired. Luckily it was part of the Halloween 2011 Steam sale and I finally got my hands on Black Plague and Requiem.  If youre at all interested in horror and puzzles I highly recommend the Penumbra games!			"

												Of the Penumbra series, Black Plague was the most thrilling. It left you in suspense sometimes wondering what is actually happening. You spend a lot more time running for your life as well. As recommended for the first of the series (Overture) you will enjoy the game more if you play in the dark and playing the whole game through. you get the most out of the series by playing it this way.

												A fantastic game, it takes a step up from Overture by introducing two new characters and seamlessly contuining the story. Not only did it become an atmospheric horror game by taking away all weapons, leaving you completely vulnerable to the enviroment and your enemies, but introduced such a level of character depth that I began to feel and sympathize for the characters, becoming even more immersed into the game.An absolutely amazing playthrough, I cannot wait to begin the last installment, Requiem, and to see what unfolds and happens to Philip as his story comes to an end.

												Pros:- Great atmosphere- Interresting story- Spooky (At times. I would say it's a 2spooky out of a scale of spooky to 5spooky)Neutral- The game is very puzzle heavy, and this can either be a turn on or turn off. Read all your notes and use common sense however, and you'll complete most of them without problems (Though some of them are complete bulls**t).- The graphics aren't terrible, but they aren't exactly appealing either. Though ""appealing"" was maybe not what they were going for graphicallyCons- Extremely short, like, 3.5 hours short, and that was with me dicking around, not know what to do for the most part. If you know what you're doing you can complete this in like 1.5-2 hours, honestly.- For a game marketing itself as a horror game, there just isn't much horror here, and what horror is there is kinda sloppily executed. The main monster just looks kinda ridiculous, It's just a white guy with his d*ck attached to his r**tum. Plus, you can take a handful of hits before dying, and the AI is dumb as dogshit. The game is like 65% puzzles/exploration and 35% horror.Overall: A weak 7/10			"

												It is a good game. It has got some creepy moments and some decent design. Being the best game in the penumbra series however i can't recomend the other games much, and this game is not without fault. It unfortunately falls apart near the end and i almost gave it a negative for that reason... This is no Amnesia1/outlast but it is still worth a spin if you saw most of what the genre offers and are a horror game fan.... Keep in mind it's an old game too, there are better games to spend your cash on but it's so cheap... What else can i say... It's an old indie game. Keep your expectations in check and appreciate it for what it happens to be.			"

												A natural, good progression from Overture in terms of plot (and I really like the way the main menu music has changed to reflect how things have changed).As in Overture, the writing feels sophisticated and the actual execution of the game feels quite OK most of the time (I am not really a large fan of puzzle games, but it worked for me as it was well-integrated with the progression of the storyline).Some people apparently don't like the ending. While I am note completely sure whether there are some logical holes in it (there's a lot to consider and remember), it does otherwise actually makes perfect sense when you consider one important and central detail of the larger plot. I quite liked the ending, actually.If the Penumbra games are on sale, they should definitely be bought - IMO.			"

												The roots of Amnesia are undeniable in this standout entry from Frictional's sci-fi series. If the first part was a cautious walk the second is a full-tilt run: tighter narrative, better graphics, excellent level design, evocative sound, great enemies and even better physics puzzles. It also has the distinction of being a game that effectively crosses genres from mystery to horror fantasy to existential sci-fi and even buddy comedy on whim (granted the ""buddy"" is a psychic tumor). Admittedly Penumbra isn't an entirely frightening experience for the fact that the antagonists are a vulnerable batch of evil aliens (similar to Metro's Dark Ones). It absolutely has it's moments though, particularly the unseen creatures taking residence in the Kennel's long, dark hallwalls and the moment you're locked in with a person that's just succumb to infection. Bringing up the inventory or reading notes in real time also adds a tremendous ammount of immediacy to the proceedings (try fumbling through your pockets to heal while enemies are searching for you and you'll see). There is a third episode but it's a forgettable platformer which adds nothing to the narrative, nor the impressive ending, of Penumbra. Black Plague takes the sterility inherent  to puzzle games and injects the kind of story and mood you'd never really expect it could have.			"

												More like it! A lot better than the first. A lot like Amneisa: the Dark Decent. Love the dream sequence and the end trials, also that you are slowly losing control of yourself. A pity they did not use the gasmask more when you where being hunted. That would have been true Claustrophobic horror.The second part. Requeim is not like the others. Its like a third small extra game where they put all the puzzels with they could not fit in the other games. You go around bigger puzzels and when you are finished go into a portal and get to the next puzzel. You do that like 9 times. Not really any story or any enemies. Feels a bit like portal put more scary minus the portalgun. They try to make you feel like there are enemies that can hurt you around, put there never is :P			"

												This horror game is one of the three games there are in the Penumbra Series that I think is the best of all of them.In the first game, Penumbra: Overture, you set to find your father in hopes that he's still alive.Clues lead you to an abandoned mineshaft that is crawling with monsters, but you make a friend down in the mines, Red.SPOILER PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PENUMBRA: OVERTURE! Red dies. After you leave the mineshaft, you were struck by a monster when entering a shady looking corridor, that event then leads to Penumbra: Black Plague.Penumbra: Black Plague takes place in the Archaic Elevated Caste, a complex built deep underground connected with the mine to aid in archaeological research. Researchers have found a virus that wiped out the whole caste, except forAmabel Swanson.(I don't want to talk anymore about the games because I think I will spoil the rest, so you'll have to play for yourself. I extremely recommend this series if you are into horror games, and or the Amnesia series as it's made by the same developers.) "

												Perhaps the most frightening game I have ever played.  Though there is nothing particularly original in the design, it is executed extremely well. The game maintains a constant feeling of helplessness and extreme paranoia interspersed with moments of well-executed levity.The engine is rough around the edges (though it is less apparent here than in Penumra's previous episode, in which the combat was poorly executed), I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to cower in a corner saying, ""Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!"" and then have a sleepless night.In fact, I'm writing this review because I can't play the game anymore because it's 9 pm and I know if I play a second longer I won't get a wink (of sleep or otherwise).You may want to play Penumbra: Overture before playing this game, as the plot continues from where the previous episode left off, but it is not necessary: the game can stand on its own.  And Penumbra: Overture isn't nearly as well-made.			"

But I couldn't get my hug from my waifu. Instead I crushed her head (cuz she was actually bald, ugly futa. - she became alien)Penumbra: run from nekkid aliens the puzzle edition.Comments:Isn't really much to say. It's pretty much direct sequel to Overture. They removed that awful combat (thank god to that). This game included a lot of walking around in research facility, solving puzzles and solving the whole ""issue"" the story presented us.Horror element is almost nonexistent here. All you get is few hallucinations (and minor jumpscares from them) and some naked phallus aliens chasing you. (which really.. you can just run through them and use painkillers (if you have them)... if don't feel like sneaking) So I would recommend this games who enjoy puzzles and story, rather than for horror fans who would expect spooks from this game. Or I would recommend this game to people who can't handle horror (as this has really minimal ""horror"")More puzzle, less horror.7/10 "

This one was definitely my favourite, I loved the story to this game that I still remember it very clearly months after finishing the game. I found that the game was lovely, had an interesting atmosphere, with fitting sound effects and mediocre graphics.There were a few little puzzles included here and there that you had to complete to progress in the game, but I liked that most of the puzzles weren't pressured by the presence of monsters/dogs. I like to take my time on puzzles. Once again, a very good buy and game from the Penumbra trilogy			"

												Mechanically, Black Plague improves on Overture by removing combat, making escape and evasion the only tactics when confronted with enemies. This doesn't mean they are any more difficult to deal with, however. They may look substantially more imposing than the first game's dogs, but they behave almost identically, making them very easy to exploit. The other elements of the game are simply more of the same, though that isn't a bad thing. Storywise, Black Plague leaves behind the  mines of Overture and throws the player into decrepit laboratories with the added atmospheric touch of significantly more sinisterly splattered blood and ominous corpses. More characters are introduced early on, though while this improves the player engagement this time around, one of them is very talkative and voiced in a manner that is highly incongruous with the setting. Think ""The Darkness"". The tone is a horrible mismatch, and the atmosphere suffers as a result.			"

												Penumbra Overture and Black Plague are both extremely appealing games for people who enjoy getting the ♥♥♥♥ scared out of them on occasion and a good story to go with the ♥♥♥♥ scaring and maybe picking up some boxes and throwing them for no reason. The first title is set in Greenland. You arrive in the cold and seek shelter in an abandoned mine shaft. Mistake number one. You would have been better off dying out in the snow. But that wouldn't be a very interesting game would it? I'm rambling here... The expansion for Black Plague, Requiem, was a disappointment. That is all I have to say about that other than to state that the amount of entertainment derived from the other 2 titles makes the bundle more than worth it. I screamed out loud on more than one occasion in fright. It's THAT good.			"

												After completing Penumbra Overture, I decided to play this game to further adapt myself to the horror genre found in games such as these. Unlike the first one, this was f***** scary. One look at that monster and I knew that this wasn't going to be easy. Of course my desire to finish the game got the best of me so I continued onward and became used to the creepy environment and that monster, so much in fact that I didn't even try to be stealthy and just ran for it.

												Real horror is a connection with the audience. It taps into our insecurities, plays on our weaknesses. Real horror is scary because, simply put, it feels real.This game didn't feel that way. Don't misunderstand; I enjoyed it. There's a lot to love about the title, the least of which is the well-integrated physics systems and the ""realistic"" puzzles. Don't expect doors to start opening just because you found a note somewhere. Not that kind of game, which is a relief. But for all that I felt it was more ""sci-fi romp"" (romp... why do critics and reviewers always use that word?) than ""survival horror."" At no point during the game did I actually feel that my life was in danger. The conditions are right. The execution is close to right. So what's lacking here?I think, in the end, the baddies just aren't imposing enough. They're slow, and forgiving to the point that if you run thirty feet away and turn a corner, they give up on you. That and they run simple patrols. Makes this feel more like a stealth mission than a life-threatening escape scenario.But do play it, because (before the weird end sequence), the writing is just too phenomenal to miss out on. Seriously. It's weird too see a game where the writing outshines everything else for once. It's like they took someone working on a bestseller and said ""hey, forget the book. Come write journal entries for our game."" Pretty astounding, really.3.8/5 for me.			"

												In my opinion, The Black Plague was even better than the original, Overture. My only problems, though, stemmed from the fact that numerous puzzles were just too hard and frustrating for me. Namely, the dreaded three or four final levels. I basically had to keep a pair of walkthroughs open in the Steam overlay so I could finally finish the game. People who are far smarter than me wouldn't have as much trouble as I did.Other than that, yes, it's a good game. The plot, the premise, the backstory... everything felt much deeper in here than in Overture. There also seemed to be more substance to the enemies here than in Overture, which were just angry, mangy dogs, annoying spiders and big, scary worms, whcih seemed to have little explanation or relevance to the story. This might be a bit of a spoiler...I noticed that much of what happened here really reminded me of System Shock 2. Hybrids= The Infected. SHODAN/The Many=the thing that is responsible for this whole mess. The Von Braun= The Shelter/Mines. The list goes on.Anyway, I liked Black Plague a bit more than Overture, though they were both pretty good.One last note, be careful with the graphics settings, especially screen resolution. I had problems with double images on screen, especially with the player's glowstick. I suspect this stems from the issues with widescreen monitors.			"

Puzzles are still fun, hitting the sweet spot of not being too hard or too easy, and the story and its twists are fantastic, supplemented by great characters/dialog.

												Black Plague, sequel to Overture, is yet again an astoundingly good game. Several of the wonky game-mechanics of it's predecessor, chiefly unweildy melee combat, have been scrubbed.The story, progressing ever onward, is well written from beginning to end. For a game like this, with low production values and a small dev. team, to weave such an interesting story is quite the accomplishment. It even has an ending which noticeably stirs the subtle messages earlier in the game.A genuinely eerie game, though incredibly satisfying to progress in, figure out, and ultimately beat, Black Plague is a great game, through and through, and should definitely be tried out at the very least.Unless you don't have what it takes? Can you play Penumbra end to end without fiddling with your gamma? Muting your sound? Reading through walk-throughs? I highly suggest avoiding the aforementioned. To do so would be to defeat the purpose of the game, and really take from the enjoyment of it all.			"

												The developers cut the disappointing parts of Overture (combat and weak/confusing story) and added an impressive amount of depth and plot on top of the existing foundation.This game is an exciting narrative with mostly interesting physical puzzles sprinkled throughout.  A couple of the puzzles felt tedious to me, particularly towards the end.  I didn't find the story to be particularly profound, though.  Even more dissapointingly, I had hoped more than anything that the game would build on the immersive, horrific atmosphere of the first episode, and genuinely creep me out even more, in the same way that SOMA did.  I found that the game fell well short of this.  Maybe it was Penumbra saturation, but this episode hardly felt like a horror game at all.  For 2008 tech, the world and graphics are spectacular and hold up well, but it felt like a video game and not the horrifying universe I wanted to wade into for a few hours.Fricitional -- as ever -- gets my strongest recommendation for a fun, thoughtful game that emphasizes story, atmosphere, and puzzles above shooting guns for 5 hours.

												I love the Penumbra series, I think that in terms of ""scare factor"", it's one of the best games from the trilogy.But In saying this, the game lacks a decent storyline. Although it isn't bad, it isn't nearly as immersive as Penumbra: Overture's storyline and in fact, sometimes Black Plague's storyline can get a bit dull. So why am I recommending this game? Because I still think that despite what I've said, you will still get quite a lot of fun out of this game if you pay attention to the ""finer"" details.If you want to pretend that you're a badass by saying ""this game isn't that scary"", trying playing it with the lights out.

												Penumbra: Black Plague picks up where Penumbra: Overture left off, but with a mild twist; you're playing as Philip from the first game again, but this time, the game is presented as a flashback. After discovering what became of Philip at the end of Overture, we find he has an entirely new set of problems to deal with, and as it turns out, they're much larger in scale. This time around, Philip is joined by a voice in his head that goes by the name Clarence, who simultaneously makes things feel a bit less lonely and increases the general menace of this new realm to explore.Set mostly in an underground bunker of sorts, Black Plague is a welcome change of pace from all the rocks, rocks, and more rocks of the first game, but has equally ingenious puzzles and challenges to its predecessor, albeit with more modern tools and components at your disposal. This time around, encounters with enemies are a bit more frequent as well, and given the higher intelligence of the area's enemies, these encounters are also a bit more frustrating.Despite being slightly more annoying and less looming-fear-based, Black Plague goes a long way toward explaining what's going on in Penumbra's setting, and what set off the events that drove Philip underground in the first place. The explanation for the primary force in motion is tied into real-world folklore as well, adding a tinge of realism to an otherwise fantastical situation and making it feel uncomfortably close to home.Interacting with the world around you and the world itself both feel a bit more polished this time around, with visual upgrades to all your environments and a more responsive set of controls. Music in the game tends toward the ambient end of things and is well-placed, managing not to step on Black Plague's excellent sound design. While it seems to be the standard for horror games, do try to play this with headphones (or really good surround sound) to get the full impact of the audio, as it's clear they put quite a bit of work into it.Included with Black Plague is Penumbra: Requiem, a puzzle-centric expansion of sorts that ties up a bunch of loose ends still dangling from the first two games while not quite being the third entry in the trilogy Frictional intended. Despite its short length, it's a good end to the series, and finishes the Penumbra games' slide from the real to the absolutely surreal.			"

												To anyone who has not yet played them, Frictional Games' Penumbra trilogy is a very appealing mix of thrilling horror and engaging storytelling that will capture you within its world and probably leave you pretty unsettled at various points of the games. By now, most folks have probably gotten desensitized from the large catalog of horror games that have been released since then, and any initial shock the games had (Overture and Black Plague) at their release has probably diminished due to the fact that the bar has been raised for how macabre and grotesque these horror games are being designed. So, to any survival horror fan wanting to give these games a go at this point in time, remember to look at these games as historical foundations for how survival horror games now are. Redefinitions of the genre, in my opinion.			"

												I just gave Overture a negative recommendation due to the comparison with this game, which I feel is a huge improvement, and so I thought I should come and rate this one positively to reflect that comparison. In my opinion this game provides everything Overture has to offer and more. Even the story of the first game was explained in this one, making it complete on its own even without playing Overture.The story and characters are great, and the game wouldn't be what it is without them. It's definitely scary and both the scare factor and story compliment one another greatly. The puzzles are a nice addition, especially when also combined with the other two aspects.

A long one coming throughOverture and especially Black Plague are, in my opinion, the most worthy horror games out there. And that comes from a person who has played quite a lot of those.Personally for me this game even beats Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the matter of story and atmosphere.StoryThe story indeed is brilliant. It feels realistic, makes you truly involved in it.Every event has a cause and a detailed explanation. A very interesting one, too.Like in Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the story is uncovered through the collection of notes and pages from diaries.There are also certain heartbreaking twists in both games, possibly the reason of my massive attraction.AtmosphereReminds Amnesia, but placed at a more recent time, with more real problems at hand.Instead of a lantern you have a flashlight, a glow stick and flares. The flashlight also requires batteries to work. Instead of darkness and ancient spirits, you have scientific research facilities and deadly viruses. In the first game you are also able to hold and use several weapons.ScaresNo jumpscares, only enemy AI. In the first game this is mostly undead dogs, and in the second game - something yet more interesting. The chase can mostly be avoided if one's good with stealth. Not always, however.The game is quite scary, but it mostly comes from the atmosphere.GameplayWell-done. No casualizing, there's full item interactions, descriptions; flashlight batteries are present. The gameplay is understandable and simple, while keeping the game challenging.In many ways it reminds Amnesia: The Dark Descent, except for the lack of sanity bar.ConclusionA good choice for anyone interested in a good exciting story, engaging atmosphere.For those who like scary spooky games - it's yours as well.However, if you are not interested in reading notes and absorbing the story throughout the game - you might as well enjoy something different.

												If you're looking for something different, look no further than the Penumbra series. In these games you are just a normal helpless dude trying to figure out the mystery behind what's going on in the story. Weaponless, you're forced to problemsolve puzzles and hide from your enemies. These games offer a very creepy atmosphere and a 3d interactive world. The ambient audio is what draws you in the most, so I recommend playing this in the dark with headphones or surround sound. The best one is Amnesia: Dark Descent. Give it a try if you're looking to take a break from shooters and use your brain.			"

												After the disappointment that was Penumbra Overture, although I acknowledge it was an introduction to Black Plague, this game is indeed what Penumbra is all about. Having played Amnesia before, I believe this game feels fundamentally very similar, such as a parallel game (gameplay and mechanics are exactly the same) and at the same time very different (story, context and purpose). In this game there is an immediate sense of danger, there is no way to avoid enemies other than outsmart them, thinking fast and finding a solution right when they suddenly appear before you (while scarying the crap out of you). Also, you are CONSTANTLY solving puzzles. There is no way you can progress without solving a puzzle in the current room, every section of the game is a maze and requires going to point A to get item X to go back and open door B. and while you are going back the monsters come in. The story is where this game falls short. The motivation of this game is finding out what happened to the character's father, it is unknown if he is still alive. While you are at that, you get infected by an intelligent virus that talks to you (annoys you mostly) and can blurry your vision, confuse you, etc. That virus character is so annoying that made me really hate him and wish it was quickly over. Also, from Penumbra Overture I was expecting a different explanation to the existance of all those monsters, and it turned out to be a very different thing.Still, for horror game fans, it is an interesting experience, not superior to Amnesia, but fun nonetheless.

												Very scary, one of the best horror games out on steam. But before you buy, there are a lot of puzzles to solve in this game. These puzzles are very tricky, so if you don't like puzzles then at least watch gameplay before you buy. This is my favorite horror game on steam so far. I like it a little bit more than Amnesia.

												So a quick ""review"". PROs and CONs first. Then some comments & random notes I have about the game.PROs:+Puzzles+Story+Horrid combat removed+Fun ""side-kick""CONs:-horror pretty much goneNotes:There was a damsel in distress... who promised me a big hug if I save her. But I couldn't get my hug from my waifu. Instead I crushed her head (cuz she was actually bald, ugly futa. - she became alien)Penumbra: run from nekkid aliens the puzzle edition.Comments:Isn't really much to say. It's pretty much direct sequel to Overture. They removed that awful combat (thank god to that). This game included a lot of walking around in research facility, solving puzzles and solving the whole ""issue"" the story presented us.Horror element is almost nonexistent here. All you get is few hallucinations (and minor jumpscares from them) and some naked phallus aliens chasing you. (which really.. you can just run through them and use painkillers (if you have them)... if don't feel like sneaking) So I would recommend this games who enjoy puzzles and story, rather than for horror fans who would expect spooks from this game. Or I would recommend this game to people who can't handle horror (as this has really minimal ""horror"")More puzzle, less horror.7/10 "

												A natural, good progression from Overture in terms of plot (and I really like the way the main menu music has changed to reflect how things have changed).As in Overture, the writing feels sophisticated and the actual execution of the game feels quite OK most of the time (I am not really a large fan of puzzle games, but it worked for me as it was well-integrated with the progression of the storyline).Some people apparently don't like the ending. While I am note completely sure whether there are some logical holes in it (there's a lot to consider and remember), it does otherwise actually makes perfect sense when you consider one important and central detail of the larger plot. I quite liked the ending, actually.If the Penumbra games are on sale, they should definitely be bought - IMO.			"

												buh....again, I reeeeaaaaaally wanted this to be scary... alas, Outlast has spoiled me rotten. T_TWas it scary? Not overly... a couple things got me good, but the atmosphere was lacking.This was not nearly as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but it was scarier than Penumbra: Requiem.Took me 8 hours to complete... and i'm not even sure I found all those little artifacts.The story was somewhat interesting... up until the very VERY end... but i'll leave that out. #wtf? #really?I really liked the puzzles in this one. :) They stumped me a couple times too.Controlling.. the usual mouse-keyboard arrangement.Bugs and glitches? I don't really remember having to deal with any. So... nothing that stood out if there was any. :)Motionsickness? yes..... oh god yes.... some parts of walking around made me feel ill.Do I recommend it? I guess so. As long as you don't have high expectations for the fear factor. Play for the story and the puzzles... not so much the scares. :)			"

												A great continuation of Penumbra: Overture.This time with an ... interesting 'companion'.Everything got a little bit better. Monsters got more scary. Puzzles more involving. Environment didn't change that much visually, but there's more to interact with. And again a cool story arc.Some places were getting a bit frustrating and came down to try - fail - repeat. But in the end, after finding the solution, it was worth it. Still, couldn't have finished this one without using a guide once in a while. Being in the dark and chased by monsters and not exactly knowing what to do can be a bit too much to handle at times :) "

												A surprisingly great game for the price I got it for, which was around 2 dollars on sale. It requires actual thinking and brainpower to get through certain areas of the game which is a trait most modern games lack. I personally think it has aged well and while the graphics wouldn't be considered the best of the best, they hold up well and will by no means affect the quality of gameplay, which is great. Strongly recommend, both as a good deal and as a surprisingly intriguing game in and of itself. You also get two expansions or whatever which I haven't tried yet, which just makes this deal that much better.Edit:After playing both Black Plague and Overture, I realized Overture is actually the first game in the series so I suggest playing that one first.

												I like the Penumbra series a lot because the atmosphere in the first two games is always haunting and scary.Another good aspect are the several puzzles that keep you busy, so it's not hiding and running away all the time troughout the game.There were moments, where I seriously thought ""What the hell?!"" and some dicisions you have to make in the game, make you feel really bad/sad.I started playing Penumbra: Overture, the prequel, with low expectations, but the story had me drawn under its magic spell right from the beginning.For a low budget game, this game truly stands out of the crowd, it really deserves more attention.I highly recommend trying the Penumbra series for yourself.

												I think that this was the best Penumbra yet in terms of gameplay and story development. The first game set the tone, atmosphere and story really well and ended excellently. This picked up from where the first left off and really took off- the experience was terrifying and yet so fun at the same time. Frustratingly, a bug prevented me from finishing it on my own computer.			"
