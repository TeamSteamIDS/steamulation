												Sale? CheckHuge Fan of the Series?  CheckThen it is worth it!  Otherwise, I'd avoid it.  Ankh 3 is actually a decent improvement over its predecessor and includes a lot of your favorite characters and that humor from the series...but I honestly don't think it is worth the increased price unless you were a die-hard fan of the other ones.

												Can I just say how odd it is that Ankh 2 and 3 have such epic-sounding titles, but are reduced to nothing more than standard puzzle solving with heavily-skewed logic and tons of stiff, dry humor. To be honest, in some respects  I like Ankh 3 more than Ankh 2. What about Ankh 1, you may ask? I've personally had enough to do with these games that I have no desire to see how it all started. But thanks for the offer, Steam. Why do I like Ankh 3 more than Ankh 2? Probably only one reason- the worlds are more colorfully and creatively designed. They're prettier to look at. But Ankh 3 does about everything else worse than Ankh 2. The story is cluttered and messy, with tons of ideas picked up then dropped (you get drunk and have a random dream of shooting a chicken out of rocket launcher that has no context, no build up for the story, and no humor to it). The puzzles are even more incredibly strange and painful to solve because they make no bloody sense. The new voice actors are leagues worse than those of Ankh 2. And, as I complained in Ankh 2, Ankh 3 relies too much on it's predecessors. It doesn't make any self-aware game jokes like Ankh 2, but there are a lot of reoccuring characters and ideas brought up you'll have no idea of what they are unless you've played at least Ankh 2. And the story tries to take all these silly shenanigans and cliche humor (especially from the ankh. Yeah, it can talk in this one and I hate the bloody thing. I forgot why it was so damn important halfway through the game, and just wanted to toss it), and make it seem big, climactic and important but seeing where everything was built off of, I had no reason to think anything like that. I despise Ankh 2 and 3, and they're currently my least favorite games in my library. I won't even call them the Ankh games anymore. I might as well call them the ""wankh"" games, because that's essentially was they are, and especially what Wankh 3: Butt of the Gods is. Do not buy this game. Spend your money on something better.

												i did not like this game at all. it's to simplistic and it has no charm. this is not a game i think many would like. purely based on the premise that this is not well thought out, the mechanichs and puzzles are also equally bad. which makes this a bad and boring game, in my opinion.

												Out of this game and its predecessor, I'd recommend Ankh 2 on gameplay alone. The fact that Ankh 2 is cheaper means I really can't recommend this game. It's... okay. I found the puzzles in this game a bit more basic. The world also deviates hugely from what I know of Ancient Egypt, more so than the other Ankh games, and I found it quite offputting. Stick with the previous version, you'll have more fun and more change in your wallet.			"

												The omens of the Battle of the Gods have been many, signaling the impending fight for supremacy over all other gods of Egypt. And of course, Assil will be caught in the middle of it all again. Together with his girlfriend Thara, he will have to prevent the sinister Seth from winning the battle and subjecting Egypt to his regime of terror. With the typical Ankh humour, numerous bizarre characters and gags by the wagonload, Ankh - Battle Of The Gods is again a candidate for the adventure gaming throne.Battle Of The Gods feature several new locations, including Luxor, the gambling capital of ancient Egypt. And an unexpected trip takes Assil to a far-away, exotic location, where he will have to deal with the entirely unfamiliar conventions of its native people. The new Ankh features even more detailed character models and smoother animations.			"
