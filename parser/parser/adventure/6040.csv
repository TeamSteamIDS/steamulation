												Originally planned as an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories, then later a movie, It was deemed too expensive to produce at that time. Couple years later you bring together Spielberg, Orson Scott Card, Brian Moriarty (who was behind some of Infocom's greats) and LucasArts and you get The Dig.Interesting development history aside, i really enjoy this game. I got it when it came out back in '95 and still own the original box and soundtrack. The Dig wasn't your typical lighthearted LucasArts adventure game dealing with survival and death on an alien world. In some cases that made for a challenging game, as a lot of the alien devices required a good bit of finagling to figure out how to solve them. Back then, there wasn't an internet readily available to turn to when you got stumped. The game could get frustrating in that aspect but there was still plenty to like; The serious nature of the setting, Robert Patrick voicing the main character (LucasArts games were getting a lot better in the voice department when they started getting Talkie versions of their games), the alien landscapes and the ambient music by Michael Land. Yes, i grew up in the golden age of adventure games, so i am going to be a bit bias about these gems that i love. Point n' Click is pretty much ingrained into my being and will always feel second nature to me. Doesn’t mean someone can't stumble upon The Dig, give an almost 20 year old game a spin and still find something really special. These hand drawn graphics still remain pleasing to me heh.			"

												The Dig is a facinating piece of DOS game history. The development history of the game is almost as interesting as the game itself, and I recommend you look it up. By modern gaming standards, I'm not sure if I would call it a 'good' game but there are lots of good things about it.These good things include gorgeous visuals and amazing sound design.I have to be brutally honest, though. You are probably not going to be able to complete this game without a walkthrough. This game is full of classic point and click puzzle bs. Items you're supposed to interact with can be hard to find among the lush background art, and the game's hints can be cryptic at best.  This game's puzzles will make you feel things. Most of these things will be frustration, but it's a very special type of frustration you don't get from modern games. I admit that it's a rewarding feeling to figure out a puzzle on your own A big selling point of the game is the cinematic writing, and there definitely is a cinematic feel. The quality of the writing declines as the game progresses, though. It feels rushed in my opinion.There are some genuinely funny moments, but at times you may be frustrated with the characters' stupidity. Actually, this is sort of a plus for me since I found it amusing. Then again, I think Plan 9 From Outer Space is a science fiction masterpiece, so your mileage may vary. I still enjoyed the game though, Maybe it's because I grew up on this stuff. But Despite it's flaws, you can tell there was a lot of effort put in. For the price, I say give it a shot.			"

												A legendary game, yet one of LucasArts' lesser known pieces due to its somewhat-awkward presentation.  The DIG started as an idea by Steven Spielbeg that he soon abandoned with nowhere to take it, handing it over to his friend George Lucas' studio to make something out of it.What they created was something magical.  An odyssey into space and the man's determination to survive and explore.Playing as the aging astronaut Commander Boston Low, you must traverse a strange and marvellously deadened world beyond our reach, of a planet long abandoned by most of its former inhabitants.  Joined by his two crewmates being the severe reporter Maggie Robbins and the cool-minded geologist Ludger Brink, Boston must use his natural survival instincts and quick-witted skills of human engineering to try and formulate a way to escape, explore, and uncover the origins of this mysterious planet, and how they must find their way back home.While the DIG may not be LucasArts' best work by far, it is certainly not one you should miss if you love their library.  The graphics are not the best, being that while the LucasArts style works well for more cartoony games such as Sam & Max or Monkey Island, it's a little more uncertain to do so with actual human characters and as a result they can look rather off during cutscenes.  Like ""monkeys wearing human masks"" off.Nevertheless the rest of the game shines through with its pure atmosphere.  The graphics for its weird alien backgrounds are gorgeous, the sound design is just absolutely at the top of its game more than ever from LucasArts with roaring waves, howling winds, deep resonance within space and the most oddest of creatures wallowing and shrieking from all around you.The dialogue is rather snarky in about 80% of its places but that only makes it more fun with the likes of Steve Blum and Robert Patrick delivering the most deadpan of deliveries.  The puzzles are...infamous to say the least and in truth one or two of them could have been much better designed.  I'll give you a hint for free, the head of the skeleton is not meant to be on the top left, but bottom right.Regardless, I say go ahead if you love LucasArts' work, and try out this gem from the past that, while is a little rough around the edges and is perhaps at the lower end of their library, is nevertheless one worthy of playing if you are a fan of such games.

												Old-school Lucasarts Adventure games are famous for setting the standard in storyline and puzzles.  The Dig was at the epitome of this company's era and it still shines bright.  Great graphics for its time and a well voiced cast made this stand out and it still does due its storyline.  The puzzles can be very difficult at times, but the challenge is well rewarded with the continuation of its storyline.  You are part of a crew that goes to explore a meteor that has approached Earth.  As you explore the meteor you find out that it's not a meteor and soon you are sent to the depths of space where you have figure out how to come back to Earth alive.			"

												A really hard one with its puzzles, but worth the atmosphere. Unlike the other Lucas Arts games The Dig takes a deeper look in science fiction. Discovering and exploring a lost civilization, pondering on humanity's existence, its condition - that's all that this game is about. I found that the story has a few darker turns, but occasionally it has that cheesiness that in some of the cut scenes. I felt that a couple were overplayed and were not appropriate if one was really in this situation. They have a certain Lucas silliness honestly. I recommend to get this game if you liked Myst. This being its unnoticed brother with a tendency for, like Myst a couple of not perfect puzzles. The game is slow and at times sluggish - you can't skip dialogue lines and some animations take too long. A great ambient soundtrack though makes the ride worth it. Its one of these nice commentaries on what lies there in the stars and the limits of a human being. A big thank you to The Vintage Feeling for being a really nice person and gifting a copy of the game to me.			"

												Despite a few unintuitive puzzles and a healthy dose of scifi cheesiness (particularly in the third act), The Dig deserves its place on many 'Best Adventure Games of All Time' lists.  I first played it twenty years after its release, yet I still found it absorbing and enjoyable.High-quality production values and voice-acting (for the time), excellent music, and a decent message beyond the typical 'beware of technological solutions to existential problems' scifi standard:  ('don't aspire toward a next life to the detriment of the one you're already living') .

The Dig			* 9/10I remember when I was a little kid there was a friend of mine that strongly advised me to play The Dig. I didn't have any money on my own and my parents were very strict in spending money with videogames so I never had any chance to try it... Until 20 years later I bought it on Steam... MUAHUAHUAHUAHUA!Ok, so I knew already this is a classic point & click adventure, made by the Great and Storical Lucas Arts which was leader in the sector so it was a guarantee on its own. What I didn't know was the subject and part of the plot was from Steven Spielberg... OK, not entirely, because this game took 5 years to develop, and there have been many different directors that changed, partly and sometimes completely, the game.Anyways you can feel the Spielberg touch, this is a beautiful science fiction adventure. The premise might look boring and quite abused, but remember this is a 1995 game: a giant asteroid is going to crash on earth. A team of astronauts with different specializations are being sent to blow it up and limit the impact damage. And now comes the first plot twist: once the field team blows up the minor charges to crack an opening to blow the asteroid from the inside, the find inner chambers and kind of technologic manufacts. As soon as they put together a few parts the asteroid morphs into a poliedric spaceship that brings the team to an abandoned planet, Almost dead with traces of civilization, mysterious artifacts and astonishing landscapes. Here our team will struggle to find a way to get back to planet Earth between internal conflicts and amazing discoveries.So... Yes, the story and the characters are amazing as well as the music, and the puzzles are not extreme and illogical, they just require some wandering, exploration and logic.+++PROs+++ STORY. One of the most important sides of an adventure, besides puzzles, is the story and here we have an amazing story. As already said even though the premise might look already seen a thousand times the plot twist demonstrates you know nothing and you have seen nothing. Everything happens in the unknown planet and the revelations you'll discover, together with the conclusion (with a minor but not so different alternate ending) is something that will amaze and make you wonder why nobody made a movie out of this. And actually this was supposed to be a movie as this game came from a Spielberg's idea, but the cost at the time was excessive, so... CHARACTERS. I admit I didn't relate too much to the three protagonists at the beginning, but the more you hear dialogues, and you see their interactions, the more I've appreciated them. I really liked the dialogues, their conflicts and the moments when Boston Law is on his own speaking and commenting about stuff on his own. MUSIC. Another very strong point of the game: beautiful strings and atmosphere tracks always accompany your journey in this unknown world. On top of that a dynamic engine will make music change according to your actions (this only in few particular situations, of course)---CONs--- INCOMPATIBILITIES. Of course this is the classic Ol game released and forgotten so when you play you'll see a small window pop up... And you can't set any option. Luckily there's always the Steam community ready to help, so I quickly found out that I had to check the DPI options in the compatibility tab of dig.exe properties, while for the full screen the good old ALT+ENTER will just work fine... B-) DURATION. Unfortunately it's quite short. Even though there are long dialogue sections this game really didn't lasted too long and it's a great pity... I Demand Moar!!! XD "

												If you're into classic point & click games, particularly Lucas Arts games, then you'll love this one. It's a nice adventure that has a few twists and surprises, a cool alternate ending, and a great movie-like atmosphere, to say the least. The puzzles range from easy to quite difficult (unless of course you watch a YouTube walkthrough of it :p).

												It's a great classic point-and-click adventure game from LucasArts. I've also played Full Throttle and Full Throttle is in my experience a much better game. The problem I had with The Dig is that some puzzles we're way too hard and time consuming. But that's also the beauty of these kind of games. The puzzles can't be too obvious and it should be pretty hard to figure things out. You don't want to just come in to a room and finish everything in it; in the first few seconds. So anyway if you want a nostalgic trip back to a good 90's point-and-click game written by Steven Spielberg, you can't go wrong with The Dig!			"

The voice acting is on point, the story is great from start to finish, the music suits the atmosphere perfectly and the environments are engrossing.  What happens to Brink is unforgettable.

												This is such a good game. A total classic point-and-click game with excellent music, graphics (for it's time) and voice acting. The store line is so complex, amazing, and not at all what you would expect. The puzzles are challenging, and yes, there is some ""back-and-forth"" that is required, (i.e. you will have to go from one side of the game to the other to get an object in order to move on). The back-and-forth though, while mildly annoying is totally worth it, in the context of the puzzles over-all, and the plot which continually makes you question, ""what is going on here?"" One of the best made games of the era in my opinion. Play it if you're a lover of classic point-and-click, or if you've never played a classic, PNC, you should take a break from the ""moderns"" every once in a while, and see what modern games have been built upon :)			"

												The Dig is one of the best science fiction games ever created, maybe even one of the best science fiction stories ever told. Sure it's a dated game, but in my personal opinion the story is what counts. The puzzles offer some difficult challenges to the player. If you can't figure out a puzzle, by all means, use the internet (It's better than complaining how you spent countless hours because you suck at the game.) The soundtrack was created by Michael Land, and it is definitely one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. As for the ""Outdated feel"" of the game, I wouldn't let that sort of thing bother me since it's full of AMAZING and UNIQUE layouts, backgrounds, characters and creatures. The cast is brilliant. Robert Patrick (T-1000 from T2) lent his voice talent as Boston Lowe. You get some great one-liners any classic and true Lucasarts fan would hold dear to their heart.This game is amazing. I would love to see it as a film some day.			"

												Oh boy. I remember loving this game as a kid, but never being able to beat it, so when I saw it was on Steam I couldn't help but give it a play through!As you may have guessed, I have a lot of nostagia for this game, but nevertheless, I think it is genuinely a game worth playing. Some might find it slow, but if you like puzzle/mood-oriented games, you'll like it. Also, If you are a fan of games like Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, the Indian Jones series and other point-and-click 90s games, you might as well give it a try if you like those kind of game mechanics.  **It's important to note, however, that this game has a more serious tone than DOFT, SAM, and the IJ series. You'll probably need to be in the mood sci-fi, of course.

												This game is very unique and I can recommend this everyone who likes adventure games, but if you are not familiar with the genre I suggest to postpone the game. As others mentioned, the music fits very well, the graphics and the story is okay also. There are some really good reviews, so I won't go into the details why this game is awesome.I've read all the negative comments because I was curious what are the cons.The dialogues are crucial in a point and click game, sometimes you have to interact with others to move forward,  deal with it.The other one was the difficulty. All I can say, welcome to the 90s. Yeah, the game is hard, and not so straight forward as games nowadays, but that makes it challenging. I don't think there are much pixel hunting and there are clues most of the cases, what to do. I agree that keys are annoying but I think a little trial-and-error can be forgiven in an alien environment. :) The thing with the bats annoyed me also, I was pretty sure I tried to use the flashlight earlier, but there was a clue here also. Most of the time, Brink was working on the relic but when time has come to scare him, he was fumbling with the crystals, and he was visible from the bat cave too. Nevertheless, I understand the frustration in this case. If you get boring due to the long movements and animations, you can skip these if you want. No matter, how long an animation is, you can skip it with Esc (it is in the manual too) and you can move quickly through scenes with double click: you are teleported to the double-clicked new area (e.g. room). So there are tricks to speed up the game.			"

'The Dig' charts the otherworldy voyage of three astronauts in their attempt to make heads or tails of mysteriously neglected alien technology after being transported there from an orbital mission above Earth. With LucasArts developing and a combination of Orson Scott Card and Steven Spielberg writing the game's story, you would expect something of a fairly high calibre. Unfortunately that isn't the case.Atmospherically the game is rich - warm coastal seascapes and alien sunsets accompanied by a wonderful ambient score which benefits from rich infusions of Wagnerian excerpts (the third track 'Ghosts' is sublime). The history of the defiled planet is intriguing to say the least, and labouring to uncover the secrets is actually pretty fun. But what drags down the game are the repetitve puzzles (I was absolutely sick of the rods), the embarrassingly dated animated and 3D sequences, the sub-standard dialogue, and a cast of boring characters. The ending which I chose was an incompatibly sappy finish to an otherwise cynical and forlorn narrative, but the other one could be better - it's not like I could have saved right before the end and watched both, since there's no way to save your progress from within the launcher. It was an admittedly tiring straight six hours.If you're a fan of point and click adventure games then this is half-heartedly recommended, but if not then it's maybe better to just leave The Dig alone.

												A classic LucasArts point and click adventure game that still holds up today with nice storytelling, music and environments. I remember knowing about this game when I was younger but never owned it. Finally playing through it now, I enjoyed it. The storytelling really shines in this game, it’s very clear what’s going on and what the goal is. You can tell lots of care went into how everything was delivered to you. They were going for a cinematic feel and did a good job. The art design, pixel graphics and music all mesh together to get you immersed in the story. The music needs a separate recognition, as it’s fantastic. I felt like I was in the middle of a Disney ride with the ambient and orchestral music. As with some older point and click games, there are some illogical steps in the story and puzzles. It is difficult to get through without a walkthrough. I had to use one a few times just to get me pointed in the right direction, as you feel lost several times. I always get discouraged using guides, but to keep it fun I wanted to get through the game in a timely manner.The game averages around 7 hours. Can go shorter or longer depending on how quickly you solve puzzles and progress the story. It’s short, but I felt it was an appropriate length. Compatibility wise, the game ran perfect on my computer.

Of course its not very pretty being all pixel graphics and all. But it has good voice acting and the controls are very simple. Only problem I've found is that that direction the story goes and what thay want you to do is not very intuative. Even after looking at a walkthrough I had no idea how they figured it out. Some of the puzzels have way to many combiations. Its fun to play ether as a fond reminder of the games you use to play or to see where the great games of today started out.

												After playing through several of Telltale's adventure games, as well as the latest Broken Sword, I had worked up a powerful appetite for some old-school point-and-click. I think I had played a demo for Dig waaaaaay back in my youth, and seeing it available on Steam, decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. As far as adventure games go, this is a very solid offering. The graphics do a good job holding up, and most of the visuals are still beautiful. The puzzles can be a bit complex (using alien technology isn't always straightforward), but almost always proceed logically (for a point-and-click). The sci-fi elements aren't particularly deep, but do a good job keeping the story (originally by Steven Spielberg) going. Finally, the dialogue, co-written by Ender's Game author Orson Scott Card, is a bit hokey but has a sort of charm to it.Overall, people looking for a fun throwback with high production values need look no further.

												The Dig is a decent LucasArts adventure, but not one of my favorites. It does have an interesting story and the classic LucasArts feel, but... I don't like the setting and some of the puzzles are really frustrating. Not just hard, but frustrating. As for the setting - it feels a lot like the end of Indiana Jones and Fate of Atlantis - I love that game, but I can't stand the final setting in the Atlantis itself. I guess I just don't like the weird scenery :)Overall - a good, but not a great game.			"

												The Dig is one of Lucasarts' less known and less succesful point and click adventure games. Unlike most of their comedic fare, this one's played entirely straight; a sci-fi story of exploration and solving puzzles. The interface is very simple, no ""use, look, pick up, etc"" commands, just a simple choice between interacting or examining. Despite that, it can be pretty challenging at times and even have you stumped for a good while.Good: fantastic music, seasoned voice actors (Robert Patrick, Steven Blum), nicely painted backgrounds, challenging puzzles, good gameplay length and some lovely animated cutscenes.Bad: at times frustrating, dialogue can be kind of stilted and will endlessly repeat as you try to solve puzzles, simple interface makes for less creative adventure gaming, low res sprites, and two or three puzzles that will really send you runing for gamefaqs.Overall: still a great classic. Avoid a walkthrough as much as you can and you'll definitely enjoy the experience!			"

												Enjoyable story with just enough interesting twists to keep you interested, and while the dialog can drone on at times it has enough personality and charm to make listening worth while. While the game is on the short side - only about six hours if you know what you're doing - the story is good enough to make it enjoyable if you're into sci-fi. Puzzles aren't anything too special, but aside from a couple that might have you stuck for quite a while they aren't too hard. Not sure it's worth the usual six bucks, but if you catch it on sale it's definitely worth it.			"

												The Dig. A legend.Back in the golden age of adventure gaming, The Dig was The Thing - something we talked about and which, when completed, brought us pride.Then, I forgot The Dig for some years. I played different games. And, for a while, didn't play at all. After realizing that work with no play made me a dull boy, I one day went through Steam - and bumped into The Dig.Now, older, I appreciate the flawless writing and a grand Sci/Fi epic even more. I'd love to see this as a movie - with early 80's effects, no less. Hell, maybe even the new style. This is now, regardless of media, one of my favourite Sci/Fi epics ever. The one from the age of Space Exploration. From the times when future still was an utopia.Fully recommended. And the graphics still are perfect.			"

												I grew up with point and click adventures, which gives you an idea where I am coming from. I have played The Dig in 2016 for the first time, so nobody should assume that I am blinded by nostalgia. Okay, here is what I think: The Dig is one of the best adventures that I have ever played. I loved it to pieces! My favourite titles are: Day of the Tentacle, Loom and Grim Fandango. I think The Dig is up there.I do NOT like Sam and Max and Monkey Island, because they have too much moon logic for my taste. The Dig is very logical in its progression and it is one of the (few) adventure games that I could finish without a walkthrough. (but beware, it took me around 15 hours). here is what I like about The Dig;- the interface (inventory & ComPad)- no red herrings (objects you collect will have a purpose)- If you are stuck you can talk with your colleagues about different topics and it provides some kind of hint system- puzzles - atmosphere (like a sci-fi movie)- voice acting (T1000 ;-)- graphics (the backgrounds are beautiful)I think what I love the most about the concept of this game is that you reaally feel like you are stranded in an alien world and need to figure out their technology to survive. Many people say that it has no humor, but I found myself chuckling many times. It is no slaptsick for sure, but The Dig has good dialoge and writing.Anyway, If you missed out on the Dig, do yourself a favor and pick it up during the next sale or buy the lucas Art adventure Pack. Fate of Atlantis is a good Adventure too (although not THAT good). I thin it is also a miracle that the DIg turned out as good as it is, because the production was very troubled.  "

												I've been waiting since 1995 to play this game but at the time didn't have a PC that could run it and when I did get one no one I knew had the CD-ROM and then I discovered other games, drinking, girls etc.Now many years later I finally got to sit down and play and finish the game. It was certainly a trip back to the old school Lucasarts' point 'n click. I'm going to try to give an objective review since I never played it before now.Audio: I've played both the GOG version and the Steam version. I couldn't read any difference despite what other reviews have said. The music is good, eerie at times, definitely atmospheric and I think works for the setting. A dead alien world. The dialogue is clear and fine but the voice acting is a bit inconsistent. Robert's voice as Commander Low is perfect. You can definitely tell the difference between a professional actor in his element and the other's sometimes wooden delivery of dialogue. That said every does a good job and I particularly liked the Alien language what little is heard anyway.Graphics: They are old. Great for their time. But old. At times I cringed at what used to be so stunning to my generation back in the day. Some of the cut scenes are quite good actually. The Tram underwater scens looks impressive for their time and I imagine I would have been blown away back then.Gameplay: The puzzles are tough. There is little in the way of hints. If you miss something going back through the tunnels and trams is tedious and annoying. Though you can at times skip bits of it by double clicking on the edge of the screen and you'll jump to the next scene which can be handy.The game requires you to figure things out by trial and error. Click part A to parts B thru Z and you may find a connect. Honestly... use the youtube walkthru if you get stuck. The game should be about enjoyment... no one is going to judge you for cheating on a 22 year old game when you get stuck. Some of the solutions are ridiculous and there is one puzzle I would have strangled the devs for at an early stage in the game that I think almost broke me.Surprisingly there is no combat like in Indiana or Monkey Island which I think is a bit of a let down when you're supposed to be a tough military commander and you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by a scientist... twice!There are limited people to interact with and in that the game gets very lonely in a way.Overall I liked it and it was fun to play it because I missed out all those years ago but... I don't think it's for anyone unless it's on your bucket list.			"

Con: Unskippable slow movement or lame one liners while trying to solve puzzles. Some hints are not clear. Some puzzles are not clear. You can fight past it though.If you like point and clicks and can live with the slow pace and other downfalls from that era, The Dig is a good game. But it is difficult. I refused to use a guide.

												Phenomenal game. I think this was probably an original idea by Steven Speilberg that he couldn't get a studio to take as a movie so he decided to do the next best thing at the time and make a game.  The story depth leaves a lot to be desired because there is are these mysterious aliens and obviously other worlds that have also been trapped in this ""thing"" and you want to know more, but in the end you just get to go home. It's worth the play, and a replay.  There was nothing like the old point and click games and this is the epitome.			"

												The Dig® is one of the most beautiful games of all time. It's not a game. It's a work of art and a true serendipity. The game was conceived by Steven Spielberg as an episode of a TV series called Amazing Stories, and later as a film, but the idea proved to be way too costly. Thankfully, they didn't scrap the idea and turned it into one of the most amazing adventure games ever made.The cutscenes may look dated and not as cool as the ones from Full Throttle, another Lucasarts masterpiece that came out that same year (1995), but the puzzles, music, sound FX and voices (well, maybe not Mary Weiss' and Steven Blum's performances) are top notch. Instead of spending large amounts of money into yet another generic, cookie cutter FPS, give this title a try. 21 years have passed, but it's still incredible.			"

												Whenever I play a new point-and-click adventure game, I always hope it lives up to the experience I had with my favorite adventure game, King's Quest 6. I grew up playing many point-and-click adventure games with King's Quest 6 and Myst being my favorite. I came into this not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised how cinematic the whole game felt. Although it doesn't live up to the great writing and story of King's Quest 6, it definitely is a must buy if you are a fan of point-and-click adventure games. The puzzles weren't too difficult, but I, admittedly, lost my patience on some.TL;DRPros:- Cinematic story and animations- Great voice acting- Most puzzles meshed well with the story (didn't feel artificial or random)Cons:- Sometimes identifying objects were difficult in a scene given the pixelation.- Some puzzles were very difficult without leaving any clues to help (requires a lot of patience and tinkering)			"

												I would have to say to tread carefully on this game. If you are a die-hard sci-fi fan, Lucasarts adventure game fan, or returning fan (played the game in your younger years) then I don't see a reason not to get this game. For the rest of us the game is mediocre at best. The best part of the game is the storyline. I found myself on the edge of my seat wondering what would befall Boston Low and his space crew, as they try to find their way back to earth. Sadly other than that, the game lacks in many of the other areas. The games tone is very serious, too serious in my eyes, lacking the humor that a majority of the Lucasarts games present. The art doesn't look good for this game anymore either. Games like Monkey Island or Indiana Jones, while drawn much the same as this game can get away with some of this old look because they are not about space and the future. This game just doesn't seem to fit right at all for 2016, 20 years since its release. Finally, the biggest reason that the game is sort of a flop by Lucasarts standards comes down to the puzzles. These puzzles are also some of the most abstract and difficult I have ever encountered. While I like a good challenge, I feel like the best games are balanced enough that you are able to solve puzzles without having to look at a guide in order to solve it and also not a game that the puzzles are spoon-fed to you. This one has many segments that a guide seems like an absolute must. The amount of time that is spent trying to figure out what to do slows down the pace of the game leaving the gamer as lost as the space crew gets. In the end I think that the puzzles were enough to get me to down vote this game. No this game is not horrible, but I don't think that as many people will enjoy the game as has been made out by other reviews.Check out my other adventure reviews on my page!			"

												Anyone who has been gaming for 20 years knows of the age of VGA adventure games. The dig is an amazing sci-fi adventure game, all mouse controlled. Uncover alien secrets on an asteroid that turns out not to be an asteroid... Some good puzzles and great dialogue are found within and Is a must have for Kings Quest/ police quest/ space quest/ leisure suit larry(dos) fans. This plays just like you remember it.			"

												This is going to be another difficult one to review.First off, let's all agree that the graphics (for their time) are gorgeous, the music is awe inspiring, the voice acting is first rate and the dialogue is excellent. It's a perfect showcase for all that is good about Lucasarts adventure games - especially given it's deadly serious nature. This was a departure at the time, as Lucasarts had a reputation for games that were wacky (Day of the Tentacle), darkly humourous (Sam and Max) or just plain straight forward satire (Monkey Island). The Dig is none of those. It's a masterpiece of story telling and a fine example of how the genre can be used to tell a drama.BUTThe puzzles are thoroughly obnoxious. A lot of them don't make much sense even after you solve them, and there's a *lot* of back tracking needed to see if anything has changed and what can be done. There's also a lot of pixel hunting as useable objects blend seamlessly into the background. So, The Dig is also an example of the worst of the genre.It's a very lovely game, but don't expect something straightfoward and logical like Broken Age or any of the Telltale games. You will be challenged. You will be frustrated. You will probably have to look up the solutions to some of the puzzles. But that was part of the genre in those days. People didn't complain how unfair Infocom adventures were at the time, but nobody would dare make one as illogical nowadays (Well, maybe Starship Titanic counts). Appreciate it for what it is and you'll enjoy yourself.			"

But you will never see end credits. Nevertheless, a smart gamer can figure it out or watch an unglitched verson on youtube. Fantasic voices and great animations.

												+Some colorful, interesting environments+Pretty sharp writing and voice acting for the 90's+Double-click to fast travel-Obtuse puzzles-Pixel hunting with dated graphics = missed clues and hours of turning around in circles-An overabundance of poor design choices-Sloooooow movementThe Dig is not a logical game. It holds a special place in adventure gamers' hearts for its numerous merits, and this means that a negative review will certainly be unpopular. But ignore the fact that this is marked 0% helpful and bear with me anyway. The flaws in this game are largely due to adventure gaming tropes like pixel hunting and obscure puzzle solutions, but the critical difference is that in other, better adventure games, these are not detrimental to the fun factor.Pixel hunting can be a pleasure if the environments are not only beautiful, but are crafted in a way that draws your eye to a certain place. In The Dig, objects are intentionally obscured using monochromatic color palettes. Also, there aren't many points during a puzzle where you will find yourself saying, ""I need to find (this) in order to make this work."" Partly due to the alien nature of the location, most inventory items are strange artifacts that must be arbitrarily used in combination with everything else in the environment until you figure out what they do. Items needed late in the game are mostly obtained very early on, which means you will try the Tusk with half of the entire game's points of interest until you actually use it correctly. I cannot stress this point enough: The Dig is illogical and thus not particularly fun.Again, I understand that other LucasArts adventure games like Monkey Island or Grim Fandango also have these problems, but these game's illogical solutions enhance their comedic value, whereas the Dig has no such reward.Play, in contrast, a game like Machinarium back-to-back with the Dig. In Machinarium, which also features a very strange world populated by strange machines, every puzzle contraption in every environment contains contextual clues that help the player understand what to do. There is a logical process to every puzzle, so while solutions are difficult, they never feel unfair, because each step in the puzzle reveals a critical aspect of its nature that, in turn, allows you to think differently about the next step. Machinarium is a hard game, but it is also a brilliant one. The Dig is also hard, but in a very different and ultimately unfulfilling way, since that logical process is not guided by design.The Dig has a ton of examples I can offer where the design is flawed:One puzzle has three holes that seem to beg the player to find three compatible objects to insert. In reality, you only need one object, as upon insertion, the other two holes magically sprout identical objects.In another situation, you collect alien rods that, upon examination, reveal colored symbols which turn out to be lock combinations for certain doors. You have several in your inventory, but there is no logical way to determine which combinations to use for which door, forcing constant trial-and-error. One of these rods, the first you pick up in fact, your player refuses to examine for no discernible reason. If the player logically assumes that each rod, when examined, will yield the same uninterested reaction, that player will never even realize that there are combinations to view until he/she has had the brilliant idea to examine the other rods for an arbitrary change in object design.In another puzzle, an image flashes on the screen - a location in the game that you have to go to. Unfortunately, the image is low detail and not very well drawn, and you can only access it once. Miss it or interpret it incorrectly, and you'll never know what the game was trying to tell you.Another puzzle involves scaring a colleague with some animals. The problem? The colleague, who remains at the same place for virtually the entire game, does not react to these animals at all when you release them before you're supposed to. But the same exact action performed later on when the game wants you to do it? The colleague suddenly freaks out.???????????????????????????????????????These design choices don't make the game unplayable, but they add a thick layer of frustration and ultimately take the fun out of finding the answer. And of course, you'll have to spend lots of time backtracking with your terribly slow walking speed to rescan the same static screens with your mouse to see if there was anything you didn't pick up on. In these situations, suddenly happening upon a solution or a critical puzzle piece does not feel rewarding; instead, it feels cheap. I had countless sparks of inspiration that didn't pan out, waiting for my guy to cross the screen at his casual pace to go and try another probably futile idea. Whereas a logical adventure game would have me stop and just think, ultimately coming up with the correct answer, you can apply no such mental process in The Dig. Most of it will be trial-and-error based, crossing your fingers each time that whatever nonsense thing you try will actually work.Plot-wise, The Dig is passably interesting, and there is some natural-feeling and well-written dialogue (Orson Scott Card), but the sci-fi plot turns into utter nonsense - a late-game assertion that there are 3 dimensions of time and 3 dimensions of space that combined form ""Space Time 6"" almost made me uninstall.I also fell asleep on the game no less than 3 times. Maybe it's the synthesizer playing endless loops of long, reverb-heavy chords on the Sci-Fi setting that lulled me. Or maybe it's the total lack of interest.Despite all of this, I finished the game, but mostly because I am a completionist that way. I cannot recommend this game to anyone at all. This isn't the 90's fault though, nor is it adventure gaming. Broken Sword, The Longest Journey, Riven, the Monkey Island series - all games that are vastly superior to The Dig. It is no surprise that it holds spot #92 on adventuregamers.com's Top 100 list.At one point, the characters in The Dig discuss what would have happened if they had overlooked a crucial item.""Who can understand why aliens do what they do?"" one says to the other. ""Maybe it's a test of our intelligence.""""Or maybe it's a test of our dumb luck,"" the other responds.I think it's the latter.2/10			"

												Really nice voice acting in this game. The graphics are dated, but it's still a decently done game with an interesting story and solidly challenging puzzles. Tip, if you buy this game. Make sure to find the map room and put the coordinates in for the tomb where you shine the light into. Trust me, this will save you quite a bit of grief.The dig still is just an awesome experince.

												The Dig is a hard game to recommend.  This is not to say that it is without its merits, as there are a great many things it does quite well.  The game’s opening is effective and catching with a wonderful sense of mystery and foreboding.  As the story progresses, the plot does take some odd turns but I found I enjoyed it.  And it must be stated that even late into the game the art direction is fantastic and settings feel alien and strange.That said, there are some big issues holding The Dig back: namely the puzzles.  After the opening segment, the puzzles quickly dive into nearly incomprehensible territory.  A great many of them are just frustrating and lacking any sort of direction or hints.  While this may be intentional, as exploring an alien world without guidance would undoubtedly be trying, it doesn’t make for a fun game.Overall, The Dig does have virtues but they are obscured by some terrible puzzle design.  I’d recommend the game only if one is exceptionally patient or willing to use a walkthrough.			"

												The game starts out great. An asteroid on collision course with Earth, a ship sent to divert it, the crew discovering mysteries when it arrives... Some would call it generic, but I love stories like this and it seemed like the LucasArts crew got everything right.Unfortunately, I was wrong. The quality drops quickly: the story becomes a mess, puzzles are forced and often illogical, and the ending... My God. That had to be THE worst game ending I've ever seen.If you like sci-fi and adventure games, you can try The Dig, but don't expect anything above average. And when you feel like the ending scene is very near, take of your headphones and close your eyes.			"

												Avoid, unless you played it back in the day and have a huge nostalgia boner for it. The game design and gameplay did not age well.A number of ridiculously far fetched puzzles, a few of which are plain illogical and counterintuitive, that too slowly unlock a forgettable story as you use a walkthrough pretty much every step of the way, while you you spend a lot of time walking back and forth, waiting for walking animations, screen scrolling, screen transitions and especially slow animations of puzzles. Many of the puzzles require too many mouse clicks to cycle through all the combinations of shapes and colours and make you wait for a slow animation to finish after every mouse click. What makes it worse is that you can't dial back, only forward. The story is not worth putting yourself through all that for.You absolutely can't play this without a walkthrough. Ask an NPC the same exact question 4 times, then another question 2 times or you can't progress. That doesn't make sense. The worst puzzle in The Dig is more far fetched and random than anything I've seen in other old point and click adventures.Yes the atmospheric music and voice acting are nice (for their time).Overall still not worth your time.

												While Lucasarts has a history in the golden era of point-and-click adventure games, this one may often go unnoticed by most, but it's not without reason.The game itself has all the trappings of what make games like Monkey Island, Full Throttle, and the like, great. Where the title fails to shine, however, is in the setting and content itself.You play as Boston Low, a military man by trade, tasked with saving Earth from an incoming asteroid. Long story short, one thing leads to another, and you find yourself trapped on an alien planet, with no clear way of getting home. One of the major fallacies of this genre is the so-called ""lunar logic"", or thinking that's so disconnected from any sort of rational logic that you would literally have to be the developers themselves in order to understand it. This often leads to players being forced to try every combination of items in their inventory, or clicking on everything multiple times (and consequently being forced to listening to the same tired dialouge over and over again). Lucasarts certainly isn't the only perpatrator of this crime, but they don't do a whole lot to mitigate the frustrations of this way of thinking in any of their games.Being on an alien planet, there's a lot that is unknown to you, any you'll come across and collect many items without any clear use. There are some cases where mundane objects are just that: Mundane. A jawbone is just a jawbone. A shovel is just a shovel. But what are these glowing rods? These strange crystals? This obscure puzzle?Being a veteran of point-and-clicks, I'm by no means looking to have my hand held throughout the game, but when the means of progression are so vauge, convoluted, and misleading, you start to look forward to the end of the game for no reason other than you're just tired of banging your head against the wall.The animated cutscenes are subpar for a Lucasarts title, even by 1995 standards, and the voice acting could certainly be better. Boston, even in shock and surprise, barely scrapes out more than a mumbling, almost gruff whisper of a voice. Maggie, your reporter-turned-savior-of-Earth-sidekick isn't anything special. And Brink, surprise surprise, is your standard-issue poorly voiced German maniac with some sort of god complex.All in all, by the time the credits rolled, I didn't feel much of anything. There wasn't any real sense of achievement, of happiness, or even lessons learned. A prompt alt+F4 followed by a ""Delete Local Content"" was the highlight of this gaming experience. I'd give it a pass, even for a point-and-click giant like Lucasarts, this is definetely one of their weaker titles. The campaign took roughly 9 hours, and that's with gratuitous amounts of walkthrough help for the more obscure parts of the game.			"

												Not one of Lucas Art's better adventures. It starts out OK as you wander around the planet but bland puzzles and repetitive backgrounds just turn the player off.

												Bad pacing, amazing intro but underdeveloped/bad story after all, very very bad gameplay. You basically have to randomly guess what's next and what to do to solve ""puzzles"" (if you can call it that, since there's no logic behind most). The screens are usually quite empty, having very few interactionable objects that are tough to see.Nothing but nostalgia justifies this being so well rated. This did not age as well as other games from the era, as did Grim Fandango.If you crave for an adventure game or if you're new to the genre, shoot for recent games. My indications would be Daedalic Entertainment's games (e.g., my personal favorite, The Night of the Rabbit) or WadjetEye Games' (Primordia is awesome, e.g.).			"

												The Dig, is more like digging Bullsh*&, quickly the game devolves into a pixel hunt clicking anything to solve puzzles.  The solvable doors use this key that uses shapes but there are many keys with many shapes and no way to dell what key goes to what door besides changing every shape for every door.  Ugh, yea it works, but its garbage, changing the shapes is so slow and tedious.  See the picture in screenshots that says button at the bottom with the green light?

												The Dig is a classic LucasArts adventure game. ...What, you're still here? Geez, you're a tough crowd. Okay, well it's your standard full-talkie puzzle-and-story-driven adventure fare running on everyone's favorite SCUMM engine seen in such games as The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Unlike those games, however, it uses a much more simplified interface which more closely resembles a typical Telltale adventure. One click fits all, and there aren't a vast many things you can click on in any one screen. Not that there's a lack of things to look at, however. Be prepared for some truly gorgeous alien scenery. And don't forget it - it may help calm you down when you inevitably get stuck. Don't get me wrong, The Dig isn't supermassively hard. But there always seems to be that one thing that just doesn't enter your mind, or something you never think to pick up, or the turtle skeleton puzzle. It doesn't help that you probably only have access to - and the materials to work on - one or two puzzles at any given time. So once you're stumped, there's nothing really to do but walk around as you become increasingly frustrated. This does, however, come hand-in-hand with an immense feeling of satisfaction whenever you complete a challenging puzzle without consulting the Internet, so it's not entirely a bad thing. Overall, The Dig is a little more serious than the LucasArts adventures you may already know and love, but in the long run it's a beautiful game with a strong atmosphere, a decent story, and several interesting and occasionally brain-racking puzzles. If you've played the other classics, The Dig deserves the next spot in your collection.			"

												One of the finest adventure games of the 90's, and an heavily underrated LucasArts game. It's unpredictable, often funny, and has two different endings. At first it was supposed to be a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, but he later decided to just produce a game out the story and concept, and you can definitely see the game has the high production values of Spielberg's blockbusters.Give it a try if you like adventure games with good plots and characters. Bonus point : the music is gorgeous.			"

												This was a game I always remember seeing when I was a bit younger, sure it was shown on Bad Influence or Gamesmaster and I thought it looked incredible and Stephen Spielberg's name was mentioned in line with it. So after about 15 years I finally got the chance to play it through, it really did capture me. Transported me right back into the old school of point and click adventures. I spent 17 hours on this game it says, there were a few moments I just got lost, I never looked at FAQ hence why the time is SO long. Characters are all voiced very well and the story had a good pace to it. Highly recommended.			"

												A very good cinematic ""AAA"" classic point n' click adventure. Based on a concept by Steven Spielberg. Not too hard, even for the time it was released in, so it's quite accessible to anyone with a thirst for discovery, exploration, and/or sci-fi in general.One of the best storylines in videogames.By the way, the soundtrack alone is just worth the price. It is OUTSTANDING.			"

												Hello everybody. This early 1990's VGA classic is the perfect text-book adventure game. It was written by Steven Speilberg!! And do you know why he choose to make this story into a game? Because he openly admitted that this story would be TOO BIG AND EXPANSIVE to make in to a film! So he chose the adventure game format (Steven even said that games of this time period could show so much more than he could film).			"

												Wow, where to begin? This is some intense gameplay right here. You couln't even imagine what they dig up, like, you don't even know, man. So crazy. And the digging! So much awesome, awesome digging. Dig through dirt, clay, rock, permafrost, garbage; if it's ever been dug, this game lets you dig it.But all that digging is never allowed to get in the way of the truly amazing story. The game asks you not only to dig, but makes you question why you're digging at all. It's not often that a video game dares to tackle such deep and divisive topics as digging but The Dig pulls it off. A wonderful cast of characters keeps you invested with the story if the subject matter doesn't. You'll find yourself getting attatched to some of the terrifically realized characters. When it becomes apparent that there's a traitor in your midst, an agent of Big Pile, you'll be left breathless as you try to find who it is before the whole dig is endangered, and the twist ending will blow your mind.

												The Dig is one of the best examples of the point-and-click graphical adventure game, near the end of the heyday of such games. Despite its limited graphics, it has very good voice acting and the story is pretty good. There are a few puzzles which are really hard, like you probably would have no idea what to do based on what they show you in-game, the way 1980s adventure puzzles were. Overall, I recommend it partly because the game itself is fun, though hard, and partly because it's an example of where computer games were going before everything went 3D.			"

												The Dig is a classic LucasArts adventure game. ...What, you're still here? Geez, you're a tough crowd. Okay, well it's your standard full-talkie puzzle-and-story-driven adventure fare running on everyone's favorite SCUMM engine seen in such games as The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Unlike those games, however, it uses a much more simplified interface which more closely resembles a typical Telltale adventure. One click fits all, and there aren't a vast many things you can click on in any one screen. Not that there's a lack of things to look at, however. Be prepared for some truly gorgeous alien scenery. And don't forget it - it may help calm you down when you inevitably get stuck. Don't get me wrong, The Dig isn't supermassively hard. But there always seems to be that one thing that just doesn't enter your mind, or something you never think to pick up, or the turtle skeleton puzzle. It doesn't help that you probably only have access to - and the materials to work on - one or two puzzles at any given time. So once you're stumped, there's nothing really to do but walk around as you become increasingly frustrated. This does, however, come hand-in-hand with an immense feeling of satisfaction whenever you complete a challenging puzzle without consulting the Internet, so it's not entirely a bad thing. Overall, The Dig is a little more serious than the LucasArts adventures you may already know and love, but in the long run it's a beautiful game with a strong atmosphere, a decent story, and several interesting and occasionally brain-racking puzzles. If you've played the other classics, The Dig deserves the next spot in your collection.			"

												 One of the greatest point and click aventure games of its' time. You know how you revist games and movies from your childhood and it's not as great as you remembered? I was afraid of this being the case with The Dig, but turns out that my fears were unfounded when I started playing this.  All my memories of playing this game as a kid came rushing back, and it was like I had everything memorized because I was able to solve everything in the game without even using a walkthough...which is kind of impressive for a person like me. I used to need walkthoughs badly when it came to games like Under A Steel Sky and Monkey Island. So I feel pretty good about that part.   Anyway, the characters and the story in the game is just as memorable as ever, and this is one aventure you won't forget easily. The graphics might be a little outdated to us now, but it's still beautiful as ever.			"

												An adventure in the classic point-and-click vein. These live or die on two things: the strengths of their story and puzzles. This game carries both.The story would fit right in as a sci-fi blockbuster: a team on a mission to save the earth from an asteroid discovers it's actually a ship, and get stranded on a deserted planet. And that's just the first 10 minutes. Time to explore the ruins and get back home. Includes the usual sci-fi commentary on the hazards of the pursuit of certain goals -- I'm trying to stay spoiler-free, but you'll understand as you find & use the green crystals.The puzzles are difficult but not unfair. (These days you have online walkthroughs, but where's the fun in that?) There's the usual inventory-combination tricks, but there are also environmental puzzles like operating the controls of a crane with the input of a series of colors, each of which performs a certain movement.Graphics are a little dated in HD times, but don't let that stop you.

												This is my favorite Lucasarts point and click adventure.  This game is based on a story by Steven Spielberg Originally this game was to be a major motion picture, then a story for the ""Amazing Tales"" tv series but eventually got made into this game.  The game features the voice talents of Robert Patrick (Terminator 2, Scorpion) and Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop, Star Wars Rebels).  As Commander Boston Low you must lead you team of astronauts back home when an extraordinary event leaves you stranded on a bizarre alien world.  This game has plenty of engaging puzzles and memorable scenes.  The landscapes are beautifully drawn and the story well thought out.  If you're looking for a new adventure game to sink your teeth into then be sure to pick up this gem.			"

												""That won't accomplish anything. That won't work. I can't do that. I can't use these two things together.."" And then all of a sudden you can. Bloody awesome. It's an old game, but it isn't great. This game was a pretty sub-par pixel-hunt of a light Adventure game in the nineties and that has only changed for the worse with the windowed mode that the game starts up in by default - it's really much easier to miss points of interest now that everything is so much smaller in a 640x480 window. I would really recommend hitting Alt+Enter a few times to switch between window mode and fullscreen, when you enter a new scene for the first time. Perhaps not all the time, because it certainly isn't pretty in full-screen.  The game is pretty easy, with just one brain-teaser, and it's kind of short in itself, but is made long by the slow moving and uninteruptable cutscenes and likewise dialogue. The hardest parts of the game are made hard by a really shoddy 2D design and slow moving. At least 80% of my gametime was spent on just moving around looking for items I missed. I spend about 12 hours completing it, even though Steam counted 17, because I also had an odd issue with unresponsive controls that made it impossible to save and quit the game for quite a while. Everything is really slow and painful in this game. There is no running and there is no skipping cutscenes or zapping your way through dialogue and only in some cases are you able to skip past the walking animation straight into the next scene. The game is much more a challenge of patience than of puzzling strength.  The story and dialogue is pretty boring, which makes it quite an unusual LucasArts Adventure game. In pretty much all LucasArts Adventure game dialogue is an essential part of the game with funny and wacky lines, but in The Dig dialogue is virtually completely devoid of any humor and substance. There are a few attempts of humor, but it's just cute and silly somehow. For the most part dialogue is completely pointless. The only time dialogue is remotely funny is when it happens during action sequences. The voices are not really bad, but the characters and lines are. At best you may almost be able to chuckle one time throughout the whole game. The puzzles are generally pretty easy and straight forward, but all the unskippable dialogue and incessant walking are quite taxing to the point where you'll be tempted to fly through the game with a walkthrough. There is really only one brain-teaser. I had to look up a solution once, because I got the head and tail piece mixed up. After you've depleted every ""topic"" in a conversation it goes blue, but it's reset on exit! Ugh!! Sometimes there is new content, but mostly there is not and it's really annoying to have to listen to the same uninterruptable dialogue again while you examine your options. I got stuck a few times, because of the 2D design and a really poor visual representation of interactive areas. The game is made up of scenes, that doesn't move until you walk close to the edge. The game also has a very poor depth of vision and there is no highlighting of points of interest even though most items do look different. As I said, ""pixel-hunt"" is the key-word and even though there are rarely more than a few points of interest in each scene you still need some attention to detail. There is no manual included in Steam and there is no menu in the game, but the function key F5 brings up the Settings/Game Menu. Sometimes it doesn't work. A few hints, which isn't going to spoil anything for you, but I will add spoiler tags nonetheless. There is a red metal rod, which can also be used in the Tomb room in a rather senseless way. At some point you come across a scene with a derelict spaceship - among other things there is chest just on the inside of the ship. Inside that chest is an item that will enable you to find the only item, and a vital one of that, that can't be found in any other way. At some point there is a scene with water in the middle, the area known as the Map Spire, that has a natural bridge across. On the west side is a Tram and on the east side is a Cavern. Just a few nodges east of the Tram there is also an Opening. Once inside the Cavern on the east side there is also a Nest on the left side. I am not really sure I like this game. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are craving for an Adventure game and your list has grown really short.  It's a very naive game on a more serious and somber note than is usual for LucasArts Adventure games. While there is no nudity, there is both violence and death. The game starts as a pretty mundane story with a cast of equally mundane and boring characters, then it becomes a sci-fi adventure and in the end it turns into a typical american meta-physical Happy End. Somehow the game actually reminds me in bits and pieces of the end of the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The influence of Steven Spielberg is quite clear, especially in the end, which is really too bad.  "

												I picked this up becuase I have very fond memories of this game from when I was in middle school, spending the summer with my friend, struggling over the crazy hard puzzles, tons of aha moments, and being immersed in a classic sci fi world.  I got nostalgic and decided to part with a couple bucks for old time's sake.~20 years later, the game is still amazing.  The graphics are obviously dated, though with the uptick in popularity in pixel graphics it's right at home with what is popular now with adventure games.  The 20 year hiatus made me forget the bulk of the puzzles, so it seems fresh enough, but I have certain scenes that stuck out in my memory, so triggering them again was like reliving a joyous time from my past.Obviously, I'm biased towards liking this game, but if you are reading the review of a sci fi point and click adventure game from 1995, you are probably just as biased as I am.  Now, some of the puzzles are rediculously random.  If you can play this game cold without getting a couple of hints from a walkthough, you sir, are in a different league of gamer than I am.  I won't look down on you if you need a hint every once in a while, I sure did (wtf orb with the pointy spinning bit).  But, randomness in the puzzles adds to the mystique of the alien world, so it works out thematically.Bottom line, I'm super glad that I found the game on Steam, and would recommend the game to anyone into challenging puzzles, great sci fi writing, and the golden age of adventure gaming.

												If you are a fan of telltale's 'The Walking Dead' and/or 'The Wolf Among Us', you will probably enjoy 'The Dig'. This is a classic point and click from LucasArts in their heyday. Telltale would never be what it is today without games like this, 'Full Throttle', 'Day of the Tentacle', and 'Grim Fandango'. This game is definately worth the 5 bucks, and you can probably catch it on a holiday sale for 2 bucks or less. The main character is voiced by T2's own T-1000 Robert Patrick!			"

												Wow, where to begin? This is some intense gameplay right here. You couln't even imagine what they dig up, like, you don't even know, man. So crazy. And the digging! So much awesome, awesome digging. Dig through dirt, clay, rock, permafrost, garbage; if it's ever been dug, this game lets you dig it.But all that digging is never allowed to get in the way of the truly amazing story. The game asks you not only to dig, but makes you question why you're digging at all. It's not often that a video game dares to tackle such deep and divisive topics as digging but The Dig pulls it off. A wonderful cast of characters keeps you invested with the story if the subject matter doesn't. You'll find yourself getting attatched to some of the terrifically realized characters. When it becomes apparent that there's a traitor in your midst, an agent of Big Pile, you'll be left breathless as you try to find who it is before the whole dig is endangered, and the twist ending will blow your mind.

												The Dig is a classic LucasArts adventure game. ...What, you're still here? Geez, you're a tough crowd. Okay, well it's your standard full-talkie puzzle-and-story-driven adventure fare running on everyone's favorite SCUMM engine seen in such games as The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Unlike those games, however, it uses a much more simplified interface which more closely resembles a typical Telltale adventure. One click fits all, and there aren't a vast many things you can click on in any one screen. Not that there's a lack of things to look at, however. Be prepared for some truly gorgeous alien scenery. And don't forget it - it may help calm you down when you inevitably get stuck. Don't get me wrong, The Dig isn't supermassively hard. But there always seems to be that one thing that just doesn't enter your mind, or something you never think to pick up, or the turtle skeleton puzzle. It doesn't help that you probably only have access to - and the materials to work on - one or two puzzles at any given time. So once you're stumped, there's nothing really to do but walk around as you become increasingly frustrated. This does, however, come hand-in-hand with an immense feeling of satisfaction whenever you complete a challenging puzzle without consulting the Internet, so it's not entirely a bad thing. Overall, The Dig is a little more serious than the LucasArts adventures you may already know and love, but in the long run it's a beautiful game with a strong atmosphere, a decent story, and several interesting and occasionally brain-racking puzzles. If you've played the other classics, The Dig deserves the next spot in your collection.			"

												One of the finest adventure games of the 90's, and an heavily underrated LucasArts game. It's unpredictable, often funny, and has two different endings. At first it was supposed to be a movie directed by Steven Spielberg, but he later decided to just produce a game out the story and concept, and you can definitely see the game has the high production values of Spielberg's blockbusters.Give it a try if you like adventure games with good plots and characters.

												A great game all in all, it has fluid animations that IMO have aged pretty well, an engaging story, and interesting character arcs.  But it's pretty hard.  The main reason I won was because of hints given to me while I was streaming the game, but even then it took me a while to figure things out.  Very easy to recommend unless you aren't experienced with point and clicks, in which case I'd direct you to LucasArts' other games like Monkey Island or Sam & Max.I give it 6.5/7 rods.			"

												A nice Lucasfilm adventure game from the golden ages of point-n-click. Somehow I missed this one and when I picked it up in a pack I thought I'd give it a try. While not as polished and slick as the Monkey Island series, this game still has a lot going for it. The humor is snarky, the pixel art is on-point, and the voice actors are pretty decent as well. The game is a pretty decent length for an old-school adventure game too, which is nice for those folks who want to get their money's worth in play time.The only problem I had was with the puzzles. Some felt intuative and satisfying, but too many were either obscure  guessing-games, irritating pixel hunts, or chore-like grocery lists. There were too many times that I was left trekking accross multiple environments aimlessly hoping to find the key to progressing, only to resort to a guide because I can't be bothered to click over every inch of ground. By the end of the game I was flipping over to the guide regularly because I just wanted to get through the puzzles to find out what happens in the story.TL;DR: I found the story enjoyable, but the puzzles less-so. Worth a buy though if you love classic point-n-click.			"

												Excellent old game from the 90s. This version is not a remastered or remake, is just the same old game but with a new compiled exe (from 2009 i think) so first you get great compatibility with modern 64bit windows and even macs. I would say that if you already played the game 20 years ago, (And you liked it) you get the chance to have it on your steam library, and not some old PC DOS CD that doesn't work anywhere and you won't take around with you anyway (of course). So if you already played it, and you love it, and it is ON SALE (for pretty much nothing) do yourself a favor a have this on your library, even just as historical reference of a  good  great sci fi adventure from many many years ago.If you didn't played this game 20 years ago, and you didn't even played games more than 10 years ago...it can be hard to know if you will adjust to the technical side of this game and have the patience to see the good story and great places and the music.... i know it would be hard for me even if i didn't had already played the game....So beware of this:The graphics are old (wich have some amazing backgrounds sometimes, but in a terribly low resolution (320x240) and full screen, not wide screen.As i said, backgrounds are hand drawn , great,  but not only that...characters animations (for special cut scenes in game) are hand drawn!! (wich is something very very rare) but still , it is hand drawn animation from the 90s from north america, so it won't look soo great, but still....with so much computer animation everywhere these days, suddenly seeing hand drawn animation looks...special somehow, i don't know if good, but different...music by the way is amazing...alltough it is done mainly with synth, it is very orchestral, it uses several segments from wagner overtures....yess...it's possibly the best game soundtrack ever...altough it is a little low quality (recording wise), still the epicness of this soundtracks reachs loud and clear from the first introduction scene. You even have the chance to look for the audio cd soundtrack wich has better recording quality.The story is very good, very surprisingly mature for a lucas arts game, very dramatic and very sci fi and existentialist.For me it shares many points with the movie INTERSTELLAR from Christoper Nolan, altough different things happen in the stories (no spoilers here) i think the base it's the same, you have your 4 (5) austronauts, the chief of the mission, wich is the more practical guy, then you have the scientist in the movie, and the geologist in the dig, and finally the  doctor/reporter. What happens then is different, but it deals with interstellar travels, alien planets...archeological digging...loneliness....the fate of the human civilization... also, interstellar was a script penned by steven spielberg, before the nolan brothers took it....the same as the dig wich was originally a steven spielberg project wich deemed to be too expensive to be made as a movie, so it was handed to the guys at lucas arts to make a game out of it (and it took them 6 years to be able to complete the game!)  i mean, c'mon, even the music from insterstellar it's similar to the digAs for the gaming part , it's very good, for the most part, it has some very clever puzzles wich are very original and go great with the theme of the story. They even tell a story as you uncover them, it's not something you see every day. That said, there are just a couple of very obscure puzzles that you will probably, almost certainly, need a walktrough, but it's allright, it doesn't take away from the rest. This is a world you want to know more, see the history, and know what happens until the very end.			"

												I was unable to play this game when it was orignally released, because simply I was a pre-teen with no job and no money :P.  After 10 long years I finally bought it and thourghly enjoyed it. LucasArts did know how to make adventure games. Other titles I would recommend by LucasArts would be Full Throttle and the Monkey Island series.			"

												It's worth the time, even if it's not the best of Lucas Art's games. Nice graphics and music for the time it was released. The plot is a bit simple, though, and I would say it's actually 50% point-and-click adventure and 50% puzzle game. Pretty short, too.			"

												So far, so good.It's a very captivating, very well designed, beautiful old school title. For the most part I found the puzzles really straight forward, but as you get into the game, it begins to get a bit knotty and annoying. I had to use the guide a few times and it took away from the experience. After a while I just found myself at odds to the logic of a few of these puzzles. That being said, I enjoyed the music, voice overs and general design of the game.I would recommend this game, but it can get a bit hard. A good guide is always a friend to have. The plus side is very much the alien discovery feel, it really captivates that well.For a decent immersion experience, try this game, it is worth its money. I bought my copy through a discounted Lucas Arts Adventure Pack deal. 3/5 - Could be so much better if the puzzles were simpler. I hated braking my immersion with a guide. "

												I rememberr purchasing this game when if first came out in '95.  I remember picking this one and Sierra's Kings Quest Quest VII.  I was single and in the military, so I could not afford much.  I enjoyed adventure games when I was not deployed to hot spots.  They kept me grounded.  I found ""The Dig"" after I came back from an especially hard deplyment and I thought the Commander'a voice sounded just like a professor I one know and the archaeologist's attitide was something that I had to deal with on the Base.  The coincidence was unususal.I liked adventure games and the theme of ""The Dig"" was interesting.  The graphics were quite good for comparable games like KQ VII.  At the time it was call SVGA and I enjoyed the game with higher resolution.  When I saw this game on Steam, I just had to have it just so that I could replay it once more.  After playing it for a short while, I liked what I saw.  I recommend this to all and I hope your experience is as good what I had remembered.			"

												This is my favorite Lucasarts point and click adventure.  This game is based on a story by Steven Spielberg Originally this game was to be a major motion picture, then a story for the ""Amazing Tales"" tv series but eventually got made into this game.  The game features the voice talents of Robert Patrick (Terminator 2, Scorpion) and Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop, Star Wars Rebels).  As Commander Boston Low you must lead you team of astronauts back home when an extraordinary event leaves you stranded on a bizarre alien world.  This game has plenty of engaging puzzles and memorable scenes.  The landscapes are beautifully drawn and the story well thought out.  If you're looking for a new adventure game to sink your teeth into then be sure to pick up this gem.			"

WITH-OUT any walkthrough.Anyway, some of the puzzels can get a first time player feeling stuck, so always explore and look around sooner or later you find the one thing you may have over looked.I give this game an 8.5 out of ten, partly due to fond memorys.get it play it and enjoy such a unque game.

												I first received this game for Christmas the year after it came out. I was a bit too young to figure it out then, but I was able to beat the game when I revisited it later.I picked up this copy when I saw it on sale. I figured it'd be a pleasant trip down memory lane. The game feels exactly like it did way back when. If you've played this game before, I'd recommend grabbing a copy if only for nostalgia.If you haven't played this game before, it's a pretty decent puzzle game. I felt pretty accomplished once I finally managed to beat it. The story elements are unlike anything I've run across since. I can't say too much for the graphics compared to modern standards, but they're still adequate enough to convey the 'alienness' of the world. The way the characters interact seems much more fluid than its contemporaries.			"

												I picked this up becuase I have very fond memories of this game from when I was in middle school, spending the summer with my friend, struggling over the crazy hard puzzles, tons of aha moments, and being immersed in a classic sci fi world.  I got nostalgic and decided to part with a couple bucks for old time's sake.~20 years later, the game is still amazing.  The graphics are obviously dated, though with the uptick in popularity in pixel graphics it's right at home with what is popular now with adventure games.  The 20 year hiatus made me forget the bulk of the puzzles, so it seems fresh enough, but I have certain scenes that stuck out in my memory, so triggering them again was like reliving a joyous time from my past.Obviously, I'm biased towards liking this game, but if you are reading the review of a sci fi point and click adventure game from 1995, you are probably just as biased as I am.  Now, some of the puzzles are rediculously random.  If you can play this game cold without getting a couple of hints from a walkthough, you sir, are in a different league of gamer than I am.  I won't look down on you if you need a hint every once in a while, I sure did (wtf orb with the pointy spinning bit).  But, randomness in the puzzles adds to the mystique of the alien world, so it works out thematically.Bottom line, I'm super glad that I found the game on Steam, and would recommend the game to anyone into challenging puzzles, great sci fi writing, and the golden age of adventure gaming.

												A nice Lucasfilm adventure game from the golden ages of point-n-click. Somehow I missed this one and when I picked it up in a pack I thought I'd give it a try. While not as polished and slick as the Monkey Island series, this game still has a lot going for it. The humor is snarky, the pixel art is on-point, and the voice actors are pretty decent as well. The game is a pretty decent length for an old-school adventure game too, which is nice for those folks who want to get their money's worth in play time.The only problem I had was with the puzzles. Some felt intuative and satisfying, but too many were either obscure  guessing-games, irritating pixel hunts, or chore-like grocery lists. There were too many times that I was left trekking accross multiple environments aimlessly hoping to find the key to progressing, only to resort to a guide because I can't be bothered to click over every inch of ground. By the end of the game I was flipping over to the guide regularly because I just wanted to get through the puzzles to find out what happens in the story.TL;DR: I found the story enjoyable, but the puzzles less-so. Worth a buy though if you love classic point-n-click.			"

If you've played this game before, I'd recommend grabbing a copy if only for nostalgia.If you haven't played this game before, it's a pretty decent puzzle game. I felt pretty accomplished once I finally managed to beat it. The story elements are unlike anything I've run across since. I can't say too much for the graphics compared to modern standards, but they're still adequate enough to convey the 'alienness' of the world. The way the characters interact seems much more fluid than its contemporaries.			"

												An eternal classic in the adventure game genre, The Dig manages to portray it's story without any hitches even today. The puzzles are all logical, but you have to be prepared to work for them unlike today's streamlined experiences.For all fans of a traditional science fiction storyarc with a twist, I heartily recommend it.

												I remember getting this game like it was yesterday. I still actually have the CD for it too yet it will not install anymore so I was so glad to see it on here! This is a brilliant click-adventure and even with new age games it still provides a fun dialog and interaction that any gamer would want. I highly recommend this to anyone and just so you know I also love games like Dark Souls, Fallout, and Skyrim so if I find things to be worth it you will too!			"

												Classic.Remember when your childhood was full of wonder when watching great motion pictures? Well, the dig is the same, only in game format. A great classic from LucasArts is now here again. <3			"

												One of the best 8 bit games I've ever played. Hours of fun gameplay and a magical musical score that is one of the best I've heard in a game.			"

												Amazing game, one of the best old school point&click, with a story written by Spielberg, very good soundtrack, and nice graphics, even today. Definitely my favourite point&click.			"

												A much more serious adventure from LucasArts, but no less enjoyable. It has a gorgeous alien world and great voice acting. The puzzles can be fiendishly difficult but the story really draws you in.			"

												I have fond memories of this game from when I was younger. I played through it again recently and have to say, it still holds up well. If you like point and click adventures, this one is very cool. Though, um, maybe don't look at those spoilerific screenshots, eh?			"

												This is a solid adventure game. It's old, yeah, but it has a lot of heart. The art and animation are well done, and the music is just.. it's perfect for the atmosphere. The sound quality is actually very nice, too. The voice acting is pretty solid, and the story is interesting. You may get stumped sometimes, but you can usually figure out what to do. If nothing else, there are plenty of guides out there. However, I suggest not spoiling it for yourself. Overall, it's just a good adventure game.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing The Dig. For the most part, it's a simple adventure game, but this title was a big-budget game for its time, and it shows. This game is fully voice-acted, which was incredibly rare at the time. The voice-acting and graphics are done very well. It's a bit slow at first, but it's pretty interesting once it picks up.This is definitely the shining star in the LucasArts Adventure Pack. I certainly played it enough to get $5 worth of entertainment.			"

												If you are a fan of telltale's 'The Walking Dead' and/or 'The Wolf Among Us', you will probably enjoy 'The Dig'. This is a classic point and click from LucasArts in their heyday. Telltale would never be what it is today without games like this, 'Full Throttle', 'Day of the Tentacle', and 'Grim Fandango'. This game is definately worth the 5 bucks, and you can probably catch it on a holiday sale for 2 bucks or less. The main character is voiced by T2's own T-1000 Robert Patrick!			"

												An overlooked gem from the glory days of Lucasarts. Based on an idea for a film that Spielberg felt was too expensive/impossible to produce with the technology of the day, this is classic Spielberg storytelling with some of the finest voice acting, art, and puzzle design created for a Lucasarts adventure game. I loved this game as a kid and it still holds up. So completely worth a play.			"

												This is just a clever game..It has a good vibe, the character acting fits the style and is done well, the story drags you in, the kind of game that makes you think...			"
