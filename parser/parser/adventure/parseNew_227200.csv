												For far too long have sci-fi games been centered around violence and killing.Thankfully this game is not one of those games. Waking Mars is a game about life and growth, not death and destruction.Instead of some space soldier, you play as an astrobiologist on a quest of knowledge and discovery. Along the way the game gives some educational facts about Earth and Mars as well as insight on possible interactions within an ecosystems.So if you desire games that are about growth or exploration, this contains both and should be on your wishlist or cart.

												Platform games aren't at the top of my list - mainly because of their limited world, low replayability and (many of them) being highly linear - however, Waking Mars is one of the most enjoyable games I've been playing lately, and for me, one of the best platform games to date. Its sci-fi/ Mars setting and artwork caught my attention; but it was the goal of creating and encouraging an ecosystem within the Red Planet that sold me on it. The story is simple and straightforward, but it is intelligently executed and really intriguing. Character development is little, but just right. There are no enemies, only yourself, the 'flauna' and the environment -  but you might be surprised at just how much of a threat you can pose to yourself. The goals are laid out before you in a no-nonsense manner: you are exploring, searching, gathering, manipulating, creating, and de-constructing to create, in a more favourable way to the environment's (and your) needs. There is something to be said for balance, and you learn by trial and error; but don't worry, there is nothing that you can't undo - though it may require a measure of patience.The game mechanics are superbly fluid - the game runs without a hitch (it's enough for me to say that if I can run this on my present setup, anyone can - trust me). The time, work and research that went into this game is incredible. Overall gameplay is relaxing with adequate moments of doubt, constant wonder and dashes of uncertainty. It is a wonder to me that I do feel a sense of real isolation while playing - I think this is thanks to the beauty of the graphical style and the great music - but this is exactly what I would expect, it's the lonely and mysterious Red Planet, after all. The time it will take you to complete this game? It depends on you. I completed it (EDITED: start to finish TWICE) at the listed time played. One of the best features of this game for me was the ability to revisit any area at any time without limit. This alone makes this platformer just so non-linear. As well as being vital - you will have to travel around to resupply your seeds, revisit some areas dependant on other areas' progress, or just to re-balance an area if need be - it is a real treat to be able to return and see how the caverns have been thriving (or not) in your absence.IMPORTANT: If non-stop action, mayhem and destruction - i.e. death-n-glory - are your bread-and-butter, you will fast become bored with Waking Mars. BUT......If you enjoy platform games, I believe this is a must for your collection and many will undoubtedly enjoy it. If you are a wary platformer like me, it may blow you away and you won't regret this purchase (reg. price is reasonable; on sale price, you'd be crazy not to try it). Happily jet-packing (and occasionally bouncing) around in the ever-deepening caverns of Mars to re-awaken it... 11/10			"

												Hard science fiction is a rare guest in video games. Not having any evil aliens or cool laser-shooting guns isn’t a good premise for dynamic action. Luckily, Waking Mars isn’t actually aiming at cheap thrills or fast-paced shooting, but rather prefers to be a meditative journey and succeeds at it.The year is 2093, player takes the role of Liang, chinese astronaut, taking part in international planetary mission to Mars, studying life that was discovered in an underground cavern system. If the thought of some green evil aliens pointing their death-ray guns had crossed your mind at this point, shoo it away. Or maybe you’ve thought of some ancient ruins, secure vaults,containing secrets of advanced precursors? You’re wrong again. Life that has been discovered is rather primitive. It is a strange kind of hybrid between plants and animals. It’s called Zoa. Not much is known about these species; you will be the first and only human to make contact with it and observe it in its natural habitat.And that is the game: travelling and observing, filling built in-game encyclopedia with articles describing behaviour and features of all types of these “plants”. Yes, there’s actually quite a lot of them. Some stay in place, some move around; some feel good on regular soil, some require acidic loam for growing. There are even those whose spores are exploding, killing all other Zoa around. There you have it, this is as much brutality as you can get in Waking Mars. While this is not the first video game declining use of violence as the main plot progression device and problem solver, not even the first among metroidvanias, it’s still an admirable feat. You wander around the caves, first on foot, later using jetpack, unveiling the beauty of an enclosed ecosystem, where various types of Zoa form a perfect cycle of life and death.Most common obstacles on the player’s path are Cerebranes, gigantic membranes covering passages between caverns. In order to open them you’ll have to increase biomass. Picking up spores and placing them on fertile ground sounds easy enough, and it actually is… at the beginning. Increasing variety of species requires careful planning to achieve that sweet spot when that number is finally high enough. You’ll have to make everything work together with maximum “profit”. At its heart the game is nearly a city-builder where you connect houses with roads, provide appliances, keeping in mind the energy, waste and communications. Being a space “gardener” is a rather soothing process if you let it be so. This game doesn’t like those who are in a hurry, who can tip off balance so easily and want some obvious solutions. Eventually they will stumble upon a cave, where just picking up seeds and placing them on all the green spots won’t be enough. I can’t really say that Waking Mars requires out-of-the-box thinking, it’s not actually that hard, but there is space for creativity here. You can try different solutions, experiment with Zoa proportions.The pace of the game is emphasized with main hero’s loneliness. Not in some metaphorical way, but in actual one. Liang is the only human here. His colleague Amani safely stays on the base and contacts him on the radio. This distant voice coming somewhere from above is as much company as you can get here. If you don’t count OCTO, mission’s AI, of course. It’s sci-fi after all. Dialogues being rare are wonderfully written, perfectly voiced and are presented in the right amount, are enough to keep the player’s head in the story progression, but not ruining that desolation mood.Distinctive art-style inspired by 60s and 70s illustrations of popular science magazines glues all of that together, making this truly unique. This is a niché game, sure. But it stands out even among other metroidvanias. Being slow-paced and reflective it never becomes boring. It has that long-lost sense of intergalactic adventure and discovery, which we lost decades ago, surrendering it to Lucas’ space fantasy. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against that. And shooting can be fun too. But can we have more games like Waking Mars as well, please?			"

												Can't believe I never got around to writing a review for this amazing game but here goes something. Waking mars is basically an adventure/action exploration based game that delivers a really nice sci-fi story about a planet in perpetual slumber that you must kick start so that a ecosystem of alien flora can thrive once more and then you can start to unravel the mystery of mars... who or what set this system up inside of a dead planet?The music is topnotch, that bears a mention as well.

												Waking Mars is a heavily story driven game with light metroidvania mechanics. Basically each room is a puzzle in which you are trying to increase the biomass by planting life. The artwork, from textures to character portraits, is top notch. The voice acting is professional, which in turn makes the plot focus of the game not bothersome. It's immersive exploring the caverns of mars where you discover strange things. Also, seeing mini ecosystems emerge by your garden keeping is very neat. I thought the plot driven aspect was going to be bothersome, but it's so competently handled it's not a negative.The only negatives that I could tell is that there's minimal in-game settings (no v-sync option I could find) and the ""remove"" function for planting is introduced a little too later in the game.If you're looking for a chill puzzle game with some exploration, get this.

												This is a well paced game focused on telling a story by letting you figure out how an alien ecosystem works. Its excellent minimalist script and remarkable voice acting do a great job at fleshing out the characters, and a few novel gameplay twists and a lot of attention paid to detail do the same for the caverns of Mars. There is no frantic combat: you follow research goals, meticulously analize ecosystems and provide solutions to advance your way deeper towars waking Mars' secret.I felt like playing a Stanisław Lem novel - occasionally sluggish and a little bit clunky, but full of a certain wonder at discovering something monumental, with a calm, reasoned and incredibly human scientist working on the challenge together with you. Original gameplay and excellent presentation make for a clear and wholehearted recommendation.			"

Waking Mars is effectively a life simulation adventure. It offers surprisingly good voice acting and storyboard for an indie title. There's quite a variety of interesting lifeforms with a decent amount of interaction for research opportunities. The jetpack movement controls are also implemented well making for a relaxing way to enjoy this sightseeing adventure.			"

												Ok lets starts by saying yes it is a little like a metroid vania clone and at the same time it doesnt try to emulate these games at all.The game layout is similar to metroid in that the caves open up and make one huge map for you to explore but then the game starts to show you that theres where the similarities end.Let me explain you start of on the surface of mars and then proceed to go underground to make first contact with a new lifeform,then there is one huge cave in and you find that the only way forward is to progress further into the cave and therfor further into the mystery that unfolds as you actually play the game.You eventually come across different lifeforms in the form of plants that you must actually feed with the various items you collect and then eventually you find that there is a whole eco system under the surface of mars and you also find out that the lifeforms you have received messages from actually need your help.To progress to the point where you eventually find the ones who need your help you have to manipulate the eco sysytem are there are (doors) plants that block your progression from one area to the next and will only open when you have raised the life in that area to a certain level.You eventually gain the ability to hover with the jetpack and this is invaluable in some later parts of the cave as some of the sections get quite tricky and this makes them slighty easier.I love the whole atmosphere that this game was aiming for and everything does its job perfectly,the graphics are good and the music and spoken dialouge work really well (the music suits the fact that you are basically on the red planet),the script is good and the eventual pay off at the end of the story is one that is worth waiting for.Just to say that this is a thinking persons game and there is no gunplay and basically the cave and the eco system are one huge puzzle and if that sounds interesting to you then this is your sort of game if not then stear clear and buy something else.All in all though i really love this game and would reccommend it to anyone who likes this sort of thing and enjoys a good sci fi story with great game play elements.

												Story = Interesting / pretty goodGameplay = really goodGraphics = good (aside from cutscenes / dialoges)Guidance = overwhelming to the point of confusionControls = pretty goodVoice acting = decentReplay value = not really... once 100% completed, why bother?Overall = Well worth the money, even at full price.Sumary:  I haven't completed a game in quite a long time... and I've never once gotten 100% achievements unlocked for any game. But this game was compelling enough for me to keep going and actually get it 100% completed. I'll admit that it got a little frustrating / confusing towards the end and I ended up resorting to some outside guidance through steam discussions in order to figure out my next move, but I'm sure I could have eventually figured it out on my own if I had that kind of patience. The 3 endings for the game (not including the optional pre-mature exiting the cave ending) really helped keep me interested in re-loading the game to see the other endings, and of course, the other endings kept getting better and better. The voice acting was a bit weird in places though. Like the 3rd ending where he goes up into space, her reaction was a little anti-climactic and didn't really feel like a realistic reaction. As far as the guidance goes... the game really tries to help you out throughout the entire game, it even gives you an interface of details for each species in the game which helps a lot, unfortunately, if you forget something task related, or make a big mistake (namely the explosive seeds when you first get them and ending related areas)... it's possible to end up being stuck in the game with no clue how to progress further since you can't get the cutscenes / dialogs to repeat, so make sure to read and listen very well the first time.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Highly recommended for those looking for something different than usual.			"

												Waking Mars is an exploration platformer where your primary direct game mechanics are picking up and throwing seeds.  Really.  And it is quite good.Basically, life has been discovered on Mars.  You are one of the astronauts who has been sent to explore said life on Mars.  You make first contact with them and discover that they are these plant-like lifeforms, that produce seeds, which you can use to plant more of them.  There are also, conveniently, barriers that open when you have enough of them growing.That last bit might seem like a convenient gameplay mechanic, but it actually ties into the story.  Yes, a surprisingly intriguing story follows from all this.  The whole game took me about 11 hours to complete, and I can vouch that the story is interesting.The game is an exploration-heavy metroidvania, consisting of interconnected areas to explore and grow things in.  There is a certain depth of strategy to how to grow things, since different things have different biomass values, and you need to exceed a certain biomass value to proceed, or to unlock other features.  Also, you can pick up some seeds, but not others, and not all terrain is suited for planting all things.  And then there are more complex mysteries that lie deeper within...Your exploration is punctuated by your contact with your fellow crew members -- one person back at base, and one AI who is a little annoying (and the other characters lampshade this).  These characters are okay -- if anything, their voice acting is better than their actual scripts, which are a little redundant.  That said, the characters are (needless to say) part of the plot.  And there are even multiple endings.In fact, you could actually make this game more like a silent-protagonist Metroid-like game with a strong element of the player learning game mechanics without being told -- I mean, heck, that's basically what happens anyway, except for the ""I wonder how you might be able to do such-and-such"" that the characters sometimes say.  I strongly recommend this if this game ever gets remade.Aside from the somewhat chatty NPCs and the occasionally irritating physics (the player-character insists on taking a moment to get his footing very often), this is an excellent game, so I definitely recommend it.(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Humble Bundle with Android 6.)

												What a brilliant game.Ever since I've seen TotalBiscuit's video about it, I've been curious to try this one, since it just happened to have one of my most favorite settings: terraforming Mars. However, it is not really terraforming, like making habitable to human life, no, it's about ""waking"" the planet!So what it is about, then? Basically, it's a puzzle game, with explorational elements, as you go through the caverns of deep and sometimes you have branching paths; though you can return to take the other way any time. There's a story to the game and while it is simple, it is just what it needs: A set of mysteries to make you want to explore the cavern.As for the puzzle elements, that's the best part: Basically, in each chamber, you have to reach a certain level of biomass. How you do that? By planting strange animal-plants called the Zoa. Different zoa have different seeds, some just reproduce, other seeds produce water or explode. Some zoa can move and depend on seeds to reproduce. Then there are zoa that eat the moving ones. What your task is in this game basically is to kickstart a whole ecosystem! Every lifeform in the game effects the other in some way or other, making you soon create a whole jungle full of life, each depending on each other to survive and reproduce. It is just brilliant!The only two downsides I can think of, first, the artstyle, which is really not the best, the animations are quite choppy (especially on the moving zoas), and while it certainly got its own charm, I did not find it that appealing. My other problem with the game is that maybe I would have loved if there would have been maybe a little more variaties of lifeforms with a more varied roles and dependencies. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's really like a bunch of them, but I would have liked more. Maybe because I just wanted the game to last even longer. :PDefinitely a buy for those who like 2D exploration and puzzle games.			"

												Incredibly engrossing, with great voice work and an art style all its own, Waking Mars caught me completely by surprise. Although it borrows heavily from many other games, most noticeably Metroid/Castlevania, it nonetheless feels very unique and is a refreshing change from the usual shooter heavy gameplay of other contemporaries.It's not however without any problems. The controls are far from ideal, with keyboard and mouse suffering being too imprecise, and controller support feeling tacked on do to a lack of full implementation. There are also times when the game just doesn't give you enough direction, instead forcing you to wander around until you stumble upon a path to the next area.In the end though Waking Mars is an absolute triumph despite its flaws. The presentation is superb, and I couldn't help getting sucked into the game for hours at a time. It definitely isn't for everyone, but those that let it sink its roots into them will find an experience unlike anything else, and a world simply begging to be explored.			"

												I'd recommend Waking Mars based on a score of 7/10. Story was interesting and funny. Voice acting well done. Animations and graphics were good. However, Waking Mars was lacking in something fundamental when I think of Metroidvania games. Maybe gaming skill or perhaps something more basic like keeping player engaged. You go through the process of planting seeds, deciding which plants to grow--which you are scored per area based on your choices--exploring, and collecting seeds. It's slow moving, and collecting seeds can be time consuming--even warping back to old areas, just to collect seeds for new areas, sometimes more than once per area.Watching plants through their animations can be slow growing. I suppose if you want all the achievements, be careful 5 staring each level, then moving on. You might actually miss something.			"

												This game has a cool premise, but in my opinion it has some serious flaws.  You can read the other reviews for what people like about the game, and I agree with some of that.  It is really neat to see the different ecosystems in each room grow and flourish.  My review will just detail the reason I quit playing.My big problem with the game, and the reason I quit playing after enjoying it for a few hours, is that simple mistakes can be too catastrophic.  It's fine to have a way for players to screw up.  A ""fail state"" is healthy for most games.  But usually that means just trying again, resetting the level.  The basic premise of this game is that you must create enough plants/creatures that are worth life points, and upon reaching a certain amount of life points in that room, you can move on to the next area.  I went ahead and threw some plants down in one room, not really thinking much of it.  Before I knew it, one particular plant (spores) had overrun the entire room, killing off everything else.  These plants are worth very few life points, so I needed to replace them with something more impressive.  I then realized that these spores had also ruined all of the fertile patches of ground, so that I could not plant the good things that would actually help me.  To undo this plague, I needed another plant (lava plant) that I didn't have the seeds for.  To get those seeds, I had to wander all over the map just hoping to encounter a lava plant.  There's no indication on the map of where you can get particular seeds, you just have to memorize where you might have left one of those plants.  It took me a while, but I eventually found ONE of the seeds that I needed, that I had apparently missed when collecting them before.  I think if I hadn't left that one seed behind before, I may have soft-locked the game.  Anyway, with this one lava seed I was able to destroy all the spores, as the lava overtook the room in a similar fashion to how the spores had.  The lava plants were still not worth enough life points, though, and I would have to go through another couple layers of destroying and replanting everything through various methods if I wanted to finally get things running.  Upon realizing how long this would take, I just gave up.  Trying to fix this mistake had become far too monotonous, and AFAIK there is no way to reset the level to just try again.  You're stuck spending forever cleaning it all up.This wasn't even the first time that placing an incorrect plant had awful consequences-- earlier I came across a tunnel with a couple of acidic fertile patches.  I had encountered only one type of plant that could be placed on these so far, so I went ahead and planted them there.  As it turns out, the only way to beat this level was to let loads of creatures march back and forth through this tunnel so that they can bring seeds back to their hive and reproduce.  If I had not placed my carnivorous plants, this would be very easy.  It would be an automatic win.  Since I did place the plants, though, these creatures I was supposed to breed were constantly being killed.  There was no way to remove the carnivorous plants-- I just had to sit and wait for good RNG to get the creatures through the tunnel safely.TL;DR -- This is a cool game until you make a mistake, and then it is an absolutely miserable experience.  I can not think of another game that has such incredibly time-consuming and unfun results when you do something wrong.			"

												This game is the proof that there can come good things from the Mobile Game scene... see... i never thought i would write that sentence, but here i have to.Originally released on the app store and for androids, then converted to a well done PC version that has no technical flaws as far as i can see. Brought to Steam Greenlight and voted by the community to be sold on steam. And the community was very right in this one.This game is much more an exploration adventure as it is a platformer, the story is dragging you in and there is allways something new to discover or to try out. Your exploration and experimentation gets rewarded. It starts of slow but gets more complex the deeper you go, unveiling the mysteries of Mars on the way.I do like the characters in the game, for some reason i can really identify with the main character, and the voice of the woman is just adorable. The main theme of the game is building ecosystems in caves. Thats what you do to generate biomass to advance in the story... Sounds dry, yes. But belive me its interresting and fun when you get involved. You also can mess it up. This game has the possibility of making and breaking the biosystems that you manage and build. Too many games have the possibility of failing completly eradicated, and thats not a good thing.The graphical style... alot of pepole seem to dislike it. For me, it simply works. And its unique and gives the game its own charme. Also, because of this it will be remembered, even in some years from now. I prefer that than cutting edge graphics with zero gameplay.Now go and buy this gem of a game and play it, its worth your time and money!			"

												The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Capsized and Aquaria, Waking Mars might look a bit underwhelming at first, but behind the slightly tacky look hides an interesting game with a cool mechanic evolving around a ""bio chain"" with it's own laws used to creat micro habitats in game. I liked it.3,5/ 5			"

												This is a highly original, non-linear exploration game with some really novel puzzles - if you like the idea of exploring caves/solving puzzles/uncovering a story - this IS the game for you!!It's not perfect tho - I got stuck a few times because the 'trigger' for the story progession didn't work in a couple of the rooms until I left/re-entered/swore at it/quit in a huff/came back later and repeated that a few times!!  I also spent a fair bit of time wandering around wondering what I'd NOT done and whether I'd missed stuff (it's non-linear so it can be hard to find help from others who did stuff in a different order!!) - and completing some of the rooms (purely because you CAN) can be VERY grindy.It's a disappointing you don't do more with the ecosystem/plants too - a sandbox high-score mode for some of the areas would have been really, really nice - a sequel (which would be cool!) should do just that!!It's hard to not recommend it for what are relatively minor frustrations tho and so I'm going ""Thumbs Up"" here!

												This is a great and addictive game of exploration and experimentation.On normal mode it's very easy as you can ""fly"" and have mostly to elude some dangers and catch some objects.The development of the story and the new elements you found were a strong draw to keep me playing this.Very, very, recommended.The only minor flaws I found are1. At times you have to go back to previous rooms and wait a little to collect some things but at least there is a map that make this easy.2. Sometimes even if you are seeing something on screen and your character is clearly seeing something, you have to stand in certain spots so that your character or your companions acknowledge this and you can continue.

												I've never played anything like Waking Mars.  It's a puzzle game based on manipulating an alien ecosystem.  Sometimes you need to find a way to get the plants to reproduce.  Sometimes you need to plant a particular combination of plants.  Sometimes you need to do something in particular with the plants (e.g. herd a mobile plant into a carnivorous plant).If you die you will lose your progress since you entered the room.  If you keep at it you will eventually succeed.The depiction of science is pretty accurate.  You will need to pay attention to what happens around you, read research, and experiment.  You will frequently learn things by accident.The only complaint I have is the game is mildly grindy in places.  Sometimes raising the biomass in a room sufficiently takes doing something repeatedly, for 10 to 15 minutes, rather than just figuring out what to do.  The key to minimizing the frustration with these rooms is usually feeding seeds to the mobile plants while standing next to a plant that produces seeds.  Each time a seed is eaten the seed-producing plant will release another, so this makes the process pretty fast. "

OverviewI have to admit I wasn't particularly hopeful that Waking Mars was going to turn out to be anything special, but at the time of writing (1.3 hours of game time) I have discovered (and if you know what the game is about, you'll realise thats a pun) that it is actually a bit of a hidden gem. It feels awesome exploring the caverns, identifying new species and figuring out what their weaknesses, diets and method of reporduction are. The drawn and animated species in the game look really awesome, and species from the same group have distinct visuals so you can tell they are related. Also, I didnt expect a game like this to have a story but it actually has quite a nice interesting one, and some of the artwork in the game is lovely.  It does, sadly get a little bit repetitive as when not discovering new species you are simply planting old ones in an attempt to beef up the biomass meter, to progress into the next area. Adding to that, due to the fact that the game is set on mars, everything looks fairly similar, red, orange and barren. While this is nice at first it starts to get a little boring, as you descend deeper into the caves it would be nice to see some different areas. Coming back to this review, I will admit I have completely lost the will to continue playing this game, it becomes very boring and repetitive over the course of the game.Positive+ Lifeforms+ The storyNegative- Repetitive- Lack of Diversity for LandscapeConclusionWaking Mars has an interesting start, and is very interesting to begin with but while I love the art style and models for the lifeforms on mars, I generally would not recommend this game.

												This is a very cool little game.  I recommend it for people who are looking for a non-violent exploration sci-fi experience.  The thing that makes this game unique is the core gameplay element of building ecosystems.  It basically consists of exploring cave systems and finding new forms of life.  These lifeforms are plant-like creature called Zoa which can be planted in different kinds of soil, and you acquire different seeds to do this.  Your goal is usually to raise biomass in any given area.  I loved the rewarding sense of accomplishment when you've built an ecosystem that sustains itself.  Some of the areas are fairly small but there are large open cave sections where you end up building a huge, prosperous system that just keeps getting more and more dense as the different creatures within it interact with one another.  You can also encounter areas which are fairly hard to achieve a desirable sustainability.  Of course, sustainability isn't necessarily your goal in this game, but it is very satisfying when you achieve it.  There is a strong element of scientific discovery in the game but also perhaps a lesson about ecology and how our choices affect outcome.  Aside from the fun of interacting with the various lifeforms, the storyline, while simple, is also very nice.  The two main characters are likeable and the resolution to the plot is pleasing.  Definitely try this out if you are looking for a different twist to the classic sidescroller.			"

												This is a game that provides an original experience - it's about growing and sustaining an ecosystem (I don't know why it's tagged as a platformer. You can fly, so there's no platforming element whatsoever). As you explore you'll encounter a number of different plant-like creatures, each with its own behaviors and method of reproduction. You have to figure out how each plant works on your own; there's not a lot of direct explanation, and this discovery aspect is the main draw of the game. Once you've got an idea of how things work, you can decide which plants to grow where in order to revive each area of the cave.The downside is that it's not all that well designed. The interactions between the lifeforms aren't very complicated, and growing the plants requires too much manual interaction, rather than organizing the environment so that it works on its own, like an ecosystem should. Still, it's worth checking out if you're interested in an experience that you haven't had before.			"

												Waking Mars is the story of your exploration though a vast unexplored cavern below the Martian surface. Along your journey you will discover plantlife which comes in all shapes and forms which you will utitilize to help you traverse the labyrinth of caves. As you discover new plant life, you will then research the plants in order to learn more about how they interact with their enviornment. For example, what does this plant eat, what is this plant vulnerrable to, and what happens when this plant becomes... really big? There are many different plant species and you will need to learn how they interact with one another if you want to sucessfully discover the secrets of the Martian caves.The voice acting is well done. The enviornments and graphics are quite pretty. It is rather gratifying to research the plants and  discover how they interact. Overall, Waking Mars is executed very well and was a pleasure to play. Waking Mars takes about 8 hours to finish. 9/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												I haven't exactly finished this game yet, but it is so beautiful I couldn't help but write a review. The artwork is really original, the controls are fluid and atisfying, the gameplay is intuitive with some quirky dialogue thrown in and there's a lovely sub-section of research information to read and learn about this bizarre planet we thought we knew so well. Waking Mars has a deep (you're traversing through caves) exploration asepct to it, there's no combat from what I've experinced so far, there's a lot of planting seeds and throwing stuff at random objects, and watching things grow and collecting water droplets and avoiding some weird acidic droplets or long protruding arm thingies that hurt. It looks very simple, it even plays very simply but it is still challenging enough, but not to the point where you need to stop and collect your thoughts, it's the type of game where you just keep going and eventually you (usually by accident) figure out where you're going and what you're doing.The soundtrack is blissful, as I mentioned above, the artwork is glorious to look at and I find myself taking many screenies because every cave has its own distinct beauty that I want to capture. Overall it is just plain fun, it is relaxing and easy to sink time into. P.S. Thank you to my good friend for buying me this game. :3 I love it so much!			"

												Its not all action, but when you get down to it, the story as you are bringing life to mars is rich and insane at times to see these plants come to life with a few well placed seeds, and to really see what you can do. Its an eco system on an alien planet, and you are bringing it back to life. I don't know about you, but that's pretty cool in my book. And honestly, that's not even the start of it when you bring up the problem solving puzzles it pushes on you.			"

												Time to put this one away and tell the verdict. Good indie gem this one i think. Game can be divided into three parts. first part is exploration and learning what the planet hides underneath the surface and then escaping the tunnels. This is the best part as the approach is semi-scientific 'look what the plants do and research them' Next part is further exploration of the system and final part is the X-files part of the game. Never got to the 'true ending' the second part really gets tedious if you can't play this game in one go preferably (you forget what is where and lose touch of the game). But i was satisfied nevertheless. Definitely worth the money if it comes to sale or hets bundled into a game bundle.			"

												One of the my personal favorite games. It's concept is unique and really stands out from other gaming experiences. Simply put, the gameplay consists in gardening, which may sound like one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulators at first, but it's so much more than that. For each plant you grow, you increase Mars's biomass (at least the cavern's) and you are truly ""waking up"" the planet from a life that existed a long time ago. The art and the soundtrack are also pleasant aspects of Waking Mars. If this has not convinced you yet, consider this: you are on Mars. You are an astronaut. You maneuver the character using a jetpack that's more fluid than AC Unity's controls. You wake up Mars on search of intelligent alien life. This title is worth more than your time and it's truly an original experience. On another hand the achievement hunting is not really a challenge to the player, but that's up to you if that's a pro or a con. Highly recommend it.

												Waking Mars is revolutionary. If I had to give it a genre, I would call it a Dynamic Puzzle Exploration Game. It is a 2D Platformer game with a very user-friendly item management system. It has definite influences from classic Nintendo games, combining the elements of exploration, isolation and atmosphere of Metroid with growing plants and food/nutrient management of Pikmin. Anyone who enjoys either of these should take a look at this game. Anyone who likes both (like myself) will probably sit down and play the entire game in one sitting. It is a rather short game, lasting anywhere from 5-12 hours, depending on how thorough you want to be. The 17 Steam Achievements are all very easy to get on your first playthrough if you give it effort.SYNOPSIS: The basic premise of the game is this: you are an astronaut exploring a recently-discovered cave system on Mars. The only other characters are the Mars HQ woman and your environmental suit AI. ZOA: As you enter the cave system, you discover living plant-like creatures, termed ""Zoa"" by your AI. These Zoa grow from different types of seeds planted in patches of fertile soil within the caves. You can carry a number of each type of seed at a time, saving them for later use. RESEARCH: As you interact with the environment, your AI develops a research log. Once you have discovered all of the elements of a certain subject, you unlock a Steam achievement for that subject. Some of the elements are fairly straight-forward; others will take some serious thinking or random luck.BIOMASS: Each Zoa in a chamber contributes to a Biomass counter. Once different levels of Biomass are reached, certain events occur. Some include barriers opening to new parts of the map, certain Zoa waking out of dormancy, etc.SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack is very ambient in nature and has an organic feel to it. It completes the atmospheric sense that the game presents well and does not distract from the action whatsoever.ART: This game does not have your run-of-the-mill shooter 3D render graphics, as it is only a platformer. That doesn't mean that it has the pixelated style that has been popularized of late. Waking Mars has beautifully drawn background layers that fade in and out, giving the illusion of real depth. The art team did an impressive job with very original plant-form creature design. It is a bit on the minimalist side and gives a very realistic, tangible feel to alien Mars.CONS: The only real downside to this game is the protagonist's personality. The AI is bright, happy and humorous. The HQ woman is funny at moments and believable the rest of the time. The main character is cold and sounds like he's talking in a combination of dictionary-speak and Medieval English. It is very awkward compared to the natural characters he talks to. This only really gets on your nerves during cutscenes, which you can skip (right mouse button).I picked this game up on sale, but after playing it I'd say it's definitely worth the inexpensive standard price. Final Score: 10/10			"

												Adventure/exploration/puzzle.  Well, that was easy.  Psh, who said reviews were hard.Oh, still reading.  Fine, Waking Mars pits you, a spacefaring scientist, against the harsh, unforgiving Martian landscape, except that you're mostly in underground caverns, and they are actually teeming with plant life.  I guess what you really are is a farmer, planting seeds, watering the crops, harvesting more seeds to plant and water, and so on.Ok, ok, try this again.  Waking Mars pits you, a spacefaring farmer, against the harsh, unforgiving Martian soil, except that you're a scientist, and the plants have a tendency to try to eat you.  I think that about covers it.  Oh, and you have a trusty sidekick, although all she really does is hang out in the safety of the spaceship sipping coffee and talking too much as you slowly run out of oxygen.  Oh well, at least your character has a job.  Employment opportunities are rather thin on Mars. "

PROS:+ fun gameplay+ nice UI & menu+ cool puzzles+ pretty visuals+ decent narrative & story+ 3 endingsCONS:- rather short main story- often repetitive gameplay- couple of moments where the voice acting seems offComment:I found this game in my 'Recommended' tab and it was on sale. So I bought it hoping it would be something good and fun. And it was a correct choice, let me tell you why. The game is based on platormer gameplay where you fly around with a jet pack, you pick up various seeds and then plant organisms. These are different and there is actually a layer of research of these lifeforms which was quite interesting. Main point of almost each level is to gain most (or maximum) biomass in order to progress further. You do this while trying to balance the environment because all the different ogranisms want to kill each other. It was fun but did get very tedious and repetitive in some levels. Overall the visuals and art style are simple but pretty. You can see this looks like a flash game and it is also visible that this is a mobile game. But it's a good port and the narrative, story and gameplay are enjoyable. Also several endings are a plus (although I feel like the secret ending is a copy from Mission to Mars). Overall not the most memorable game ever but it's fun and relaxing. Recommended!			"

This is a great game at the price. There was some hic up with the audio at a couple of points where it clipped and produced and annyoying chirp. But it did not take away from the other audio. The gamepad integration was a nice touch. It does make for a better experience when playing a platform type game. I expect this game to have some staying power.

												Very fun 2D Metroid feeling game but with more story and modern graphics.in Waking Mars you are seperated and must use alien plants and creatures as tools to progress and terraform the areas. while doing this you uncover the mystery of the ecosystem and how the whole biosphere works as a system. by the end of the game you have escaped and taken a bare and empty system of caverns and have turning it into a thriving living biosphere of interacing plants and creatures.offers about 8-14 hours of gameplay to totally finish and is very enjoyable along the way.

												This one really surprised me. Virtually no one on my friends list has it, and it has simplistic controls due to its mobile roots. It still manages to have interesting gameplay with decent balance with progressively increasing difficulty, but what really shocked me was the storyline. With its limited cast of Liang, Amani, and the A.R.T. emoticon robot who acts and sounds like Borderlands' Claptrap, it's managed to make me care about the two human characters. The dialogue intelligently mixes hard science with the fantasy aspects and sprinkles in just a little bit of technobabble. It's compelling to play and doesn't rely on overused gaming tropes like leveling up or endless gradual equipment power progression.The gameplay is a mix of puzzle and platformer. It's also pretty original. There are few hazards you need to navigate and lots of places to restore your health. The challenge comes with properly filling each area with a sufficient amount of biomass, using the seeds you collect and the fertile ground around you. Though sometimes you may find yourself brute forcing a couple puzzles by herding Phyta into a corner and regularly throwing seeds at them.			"

A Paladin's Review: Waking Mars. Enjoyable Exploration Extraordinaire.Genre: 2D Light Platformer, Exploration and Light Metroidvania. Developed & Published by: Tiger StylePlatform: Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by MyselfRead the unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsWaking Mars is a 2D platformer that's light on exploration and heavy on exploring the depths of a fictional Mars. Through this narrative driven story, you'll need to figure out how the plant and animal life interact with each other. Each area has a required amount of biomass so you'll need to solve the puzzle of the area while using physics to move plants or objects around to grow them. There isn't any combat in Waking Mars but you can potentially die thanks to lava and some aggressive species. So, you'll need to use your jetpack and wits to survive. All of which is to be learned by the player as they go along. There's unlocks to find and secrets to discover too. Overall Story ThoughtsThe year is 2097 on Mars. You play as a astronaut named Liang who is accompanied by an AI named “ART”. He is teamed up with another astronaut named Amani who assists by analyzing the data he brings in and being helpful support. At first, Liang is at an outpost that was built for this mission to Mars to explore the Lethe caves. The mission is to find the alien life that had been detected by scouts years ago. Liang is contemplative, quiet and mostly a loner. Amani is more of a upbeat, friendly kind of person. She acts as support and isn't playable in the game though you’ll have plenty of conversations. They have pretty good chemistry and bounce off each other well. ART is an artificial intelligence who speaks like he’s an AI from some bad 70s movie. ART…well, he’s “cute” at first but his computerized speech can get on your nerves as the game progresses. Liang and his team have been sent to Mars after an initial recon of the planet discovered life on the red planet. You play as Liang as he travels into the depths of the Mars caverns named “Lethe cavern”. There he will find the strange lifeforms and begin unraveling the mystery of Mars. The outpost he was working out of is destroyed due to an accident and Liang must return to base camp or run out of oxygen. The conditions on the surface of Mars are too harsh to travel over. So, Liang has to travel through the depths of Lethe cavern to reach the base camp. The caves are filled with dangerous hazards & deadly lifeforms but its also filled with life and intrigue for Liang. His curiosity leads him to continue exploring the depths of Lethe cavern. You’ll have to discover for yourself what those mysteries are. Its an enjoyable story really and the lack of violence really helps keep this game focused on exploration.I did have one major issue with this game’s story however and that was the ending. It ends abruptly, regardless of which ending you choose. No explanation for what will happen to the planet or the lifeforms you meet. No explanation for what waking up Mars will do for the planet or even the human society. Just nothing. It irritates me to end when a game leaves you hanging. I can’t tell if they didn't know how to end the game or if they planned on doing a sequel. PC Port ReportWhile this is a mobile ported to PC game, it comes with a reasonable settings menu. Keyboard config, resolution options and even joystick support. The art isn't as hi-resolution as I would have liked, but is passable in its current state. The PC port of this game is surprisingly solid. It comes with rebindable keys, joystick support, cinematic speed settings and resolution options. The resolution options were nicely varied and the game also featured resolution “auto-detect” which worked just fine. For the most part, the game stayed at a solid 60 FPS. Well done guys.  Final ThoughtsWaking Mars is a well done exploration adventure game. One of the most enjoyable exploration games to come around in a while. Tiger Style managed to make a game that was only about exploration fun and challenging at the same time and I have to give kudos. The characters were also interesting people to get to know. I also have to give them kudos for making a quality PC game from an iOS port. It's refreshing to see iOS app devs take care in the porting of their games. All that said, Waking Mars is an enjoyable game through the depths of a fictional Mars. While the game has some problems, the core of the game is a very solid experience. If you have any interest in exploration or adventure games, you should give Waking Mars a try.Read this review & more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												The ""hook"" of ""Waking Mars"", a Metroidvania-style platformer, is that it is almost completely non-violent. While similar games might have progress by running around and shooting the monsters, ""Waking Mars"" instead has you bring the monster to life. The various chambers have to be filled with sufficient biomass for you to progress, which you do by ""planting"" seeds (or more precisely, throwing them at various patches of fertile ground) within the caverns. Calm and relaxing, the danger - and difficulty - level is minimal and the game approaches a serene calmness that is nice change of pace. But while its non-violent take on the genre is unique, it isn't by itself enough to make an entertaining game. As I mentioned, the difficulty level is almost non-existent; despite its pretense, the Martian ecology it presents is extremely superficial and you can spam seeds to achieve victory. Or you could if you had sufficient numbers of seeds; you can only carry a handful of each and too often I had to scurry between caves looking for a specific plant to re-supply my stocks. This made the latter half of the game rather more of a grind than anything else. The lack of variety in levels is also a sore spot, and I quickly got tired of seeing the same red walls. Too frequent cut-scenes interrupted the game-flow as well. Nor were the endings - there are three of them - sufficient reward for all the effort. Kudos to the developers for trying something new, but all in all I found it a flawed game that wasn't much fun to play.			"

												Waking Mars is a good Metroidvania type of game. Well, that's not entirely true. You won't be using guns and you won't upgrade any gear except for your jetpack. But the level design plays like any of them anyway, and unlike the Metroidvania games it's actually split up in smaller levels instead of offering one giant world. I'm not even sure if the comparison is now justified anymore... Anyway, moving on.You've landed on Mars and your job is to discover the mysteries of the ecosystem when you become trapped in this huge cave. So you'll be picking up seeds and plant them in order to create life. Blue seeds go into the blue soil, green into the green soil, et cetera. Sounds fun, right ? It does. For a couple of hours, at least. Then it starts to feel repetitive, and it even manages to become frustrating, especially when you want to 5-star every level and your plants are eating or killing other forms of life around you, decreasing your rating.Other than creating life there are a few mini-games in the game to spice things up and to get the story going but it's nothing noteworthy to begin with.I do have to praise the developer for creating such colorful and sharp art. It looks great, but animating the cutscenes a little more would've been a good idea I think. Those parts are just too static.Soooo.... let's see. I have no idea why I finished the game in the first place so I guess it must've done something right in the end... ? I'm not sure. Check the game out and decide for yourself.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												Simply put, Waking Mars is a minimalist yet highly-intelligent science fiction epic presented in videogame format.This hidden gem of a game's main strength lies in its brilliant, eco-friendly story which quickly captivates you thanks to its well-written, professionally voice-acted and belivably humane cast of characters and an all-around good pacing. While the game may broadly be classified as a metroidvania, I'd like to tag it as interactive fiction with light puzzle elements due to its taking great cares with the story-telling.The actual gameplay mechanics, on the other hand, are all linked to single idea, which is, refreshingly, to re-create life on an otherwise barren planet. With that goal in mind, you (as scientist Liang) will explore the underground caverns of the titular planet, thinking, wondering, researching, experimenting and step by step, giving life to an alien habitat by literally planting the seeds of it. Simple yet effectively executed, this planting mechanic that forms the core of the game leads to lovely self-sustained eco-systems that flourish by the touch of your hands - and with that comes a great sense of accomplishment that is like no other.The caves of Mars themselves are a joy to traverse: elaborately designed and always rich in color. The tunes that accompany you throughout your adventure perfectly capture the mood of any given scene, never taking the forefront yet always enhancing the experience. The controls are fluid and easy to get a hold of, never detracting from the experience. In short, the game is flawless in its audio / visual departments and devoid of technical faults.All in all, a ten-hour science-fiction adventure with unique promises on all fronts that you'll be remembering fondly for a long time and that is as effective as any thought-provoking work of art in the said genre.

												It's been a while since I got involved in a videogame to that degree. Waking Mars is a very atmospheric game even though there's no atmosphere on Mars.Sometimes you may feel yourself a hero of some Mr. Bradbury's novel, planting all these beautiful and clever things. And when appoaching the ending I was all like 'Whoa! We are really communicating! Ok dude I'm all into this, talk to me!'It's time now to gather some strengths and to try not to be so bruteforce this time to get the alter ending.			"

												i first played this game on mobile. When i saw it on steam i added it to my collection. So don't bother to look at my playing time while reading this. I finished the game several times.There are some games around which chains you inside it with its stroyline. There are some other games which gives you fun while playing it. I get both from this game.I feel very excited when i play the game becouse of its storyline. You discover lifeforms, do some sort of science with them and re construct the ancient life on mars which is in dormant state. It has some alternate ends too. I wish it had lasted some more hours. I don't mean game is too short but i wanted to be in the storyline more and more and more. Looking forward to see Waking Mars II (Please plan to do it :P)Its god damn fun to re create the echosystems. I want so see more biology releated games around. People learn how important and fragile is the nature with such games.			"

												Imagine a game with Metroid-style exploration of a world, except instead of shooting everything that moves, you're a scientist on an expedition to explore Mars, you've discovered life in an underground cave system, and the only way to procede is to plant seeds and create little ecosystems in each chamber of the caverns to open up access to new areas. You have no special powers or abilities other than the seeds you collect and the jet pack on your space suit, and it's fairly interesting what that changes about the way a game like that plays and what things stay the same. There are lots of different ways to solve the rooms, depending on how they're laid out and what you're in the mood for doing with them, whether it's friendly and cooperative or antagonistic with everyone eating each other, micromanagement-heavy or something that sprouts from nothing and grows all on its own because of a couple careful decisions you made. The story and voice acting are pretty decent too, and it's worth spending the extra couple hours to get the ""real"" ending(s) if you're into the gameplay, both to find out more of what's going on and because figuring out how to make the most of what you've got in each room is usually what's the most fun.

												This is simply a beautifully crafted indie game. It invokes a real sense of exploration, discovery and wonder. I really enjoyed playing this game. If you ever find yourself watching wildlife you will find this game really immersive and enjoyable.  You could call it a 2d puzzle game, but that is just not doing it any justice. It uses simple 2d graphics to portray the martian landscape to really good effect. Before I played the game I thought the graphics were too basic, but somehow when actually playing the game I found the art beautiful.You land on Mars and have to explore, observe, experiment and learn how the martian ecosystem works. You can then manipulate the ecosystem to progress deeper into the cave system to discover yet more organisms and more complex interactions. It may sound daunting, but it is a very gradual path of discovery that is both addictive and rewarding.As well as the well designed graphics, physics, organisisms and their interactions, it also has a good story, multiple endings and great voice acting. It is just the right length, not padded or bloated. It is just a really sharp polished product.			"

												=== TL;DR section ==========================Scientific imagination and creativity: 10/10Writing: 9.5/10Story: 9/10Graphics 7/10Overall: 9.5/10*** best scientific exploration game ****** best extra-terrestrial gardening simulation ***Bottom line: Go get it, and play it.==========================================A very good and immersive game based on a very creative ecosystem and xeno-lifeforms, who makes for an absorbing exploration of this alien environment. This is pure sci-fi, with a very good story, well-written and well exposed. You play a scientist and explorer who explores a martian cave with an emphasis on research and scientific facts gathering. After some time, you start to understand how the pseudo-animals and pseudo-plants are working together and you can plant a ""seed"" here, remove a ""plant"" there, feed ""animals"" here, change the type of terrain here to plant another kind of ""seed""... and eventually, you get the desired result to continue your progression. Hazards are not so dangerous, and there is no fighting at all (just the avoiding of some lifeforms that may harm you in some places/phases). Your job is just to understand what's happening and what's in front of you, and how it all works together, so you can use it and make progress in the caves.Admittedly this is a game made for tablets and phones, as a few negative comments are pointing out ; but these people stopped too soon in the game (considering their time recorded in the game). Actually, there is lots of meat to this game, lots of things to discover and understand, lots of different lifeforms -most of them interact with each other- and lots of places to explore. If you like the game you're going to spend at least 12 hours there (this is the time needed for completing the game a first time and get one of the endings). The last remnants of the old martian lifeforms are dwelling in this cave, you're going to explore it, and eventually discover the secrets of Mars. The art is good, I love the style. The graphics are more than adequate (even if that's a mobile port). The music is very good. This is very atmospheric and the game made me completely lost track of time several time. There is almost no platform gaming in this game. Flying around with a jetpack is fun (you'll be occasionally walking and/or crawling too). But this is never really difficult and the rest is pure exploration, observation of the ecosystem and use of its natural behavior to help your own goals and progress.			"

												Waking Mars is a unique take on the Metroidvania concept.  You play a trapped scientist exploring an subterranean Martian ecosystem, and the only way to survive is to learn how the mysterious organisms coexist and manipulate those relationships to progress through the cave.You have no weapons, tools, or keys, except for the seeds of the creatures that surround you, and each room requires a different combination of organisms, planted in fertile soil, to survive the unique conditions there and open the way deeper into Mars' crust.  It is not a fast-paced experience, but it is rewarding.It is easy to recommend this game, but it is harder to decide to whom the game is best recommended.  It's nominally an action platformer, but both the action and the platforms are in short supply.  I think it's a management game more than anything else.  You have a supply of seeds, and a series of challenges to overcome with that inventory.  Some rooms will produce surplus seeds for you; others will require seeds from elsewhere to be completed.  Then you get your hands on the self-propagating pH-altering spores and things get a little frantic while you try to meet your goals without your carefully balanced rooms disintegrating.The story is well written and the voice acting is excellent.  The characters are skillfully realized.  The graphics are pretty, for sprites, and the music is good.  The gameplay has some rough edges, but nothing worth a thumbs down.  Mostly you will get information about new species that you don't think you've earned, and whenever a cutscene gets triggered you lose control of your character.  I never got dumped into magma or similar danger, but I think it could happen.  Fortunately the penalty for death is essentially nonexistent thanks to a robust autosave system.If you're into management and puzzles, this one is worth checking out.  It's not really for action platformer fans, though, unless you are interested in seeing the concept dramatically deconstructed.			"

												This is a great game about exploring and cultivating lifeforms on mars. What really makes it work well is the great art and soundtrack that make you feel immersed in the world as you are exploring it. Each new species and interaction you discover is exciting.Additionally, throughout the game there is frequent dialogue between the characters, that is actually really funny. That added a lot to the experience.Aside from this, on each level you have to plant things until there is a sufficiently strong ecosystem (""biomass"") to move on. This part of the game is fun, too, but less fun later on if you get bored of it. Especially once you have already discovered every species, and it's just a matter of planting enough of them to move on.Total playtime should be 6-10 hours (6 just to finish, 10 to get all endings and achievements). So it's a fairly quick, engaging game that you will be happy you played. Highly recommended!			"

If you can get it sale then it's definitely worth picking up if you find the description and screenshots at all interesting.			"

												I am having to say I would not reccomend this game to a friend. It's a good game, but is is a port and the normal price is too much. I got it on a great sale and it was fun to play, but I would not have payed full price for it. Also it's not really clear, but you have to get all rooms to at least 4/5 to complete the game I'm pretty sure.			"

												Waking Mars is a nice change of pace from the 2D sidescroller where you kill everything. Instead, this game tasks you with growing and cultivating all matter of plants as you traverse the caverns of everyone's favorite red world. The controls are responsive and simple, though the jetpack can be a little slippery if you're trying to push things in midair or corral creatures.The visuals are a mixed bag. The environments are gorgeous, evoking an artistic, arts 'n' crafts style, and the talking heads during dialog are detailed and realistic. The flora and fauna you encounter, however, feel a bit stiff and oddly-detailed, especially your character. They all end up looking like the product of a Flash game. Minor gripes, really.A bigger gripe has to be the dialogue. It's pretty well-packed with information and delivered very well, but not an ounce of it is interesting to listen to, and you'll end up skipping the long cutscenes. Your AI companion's attempt at comic relief is passable at best.Thankfully, the game makes up for the poor writing with some deep albeit repetitive gameplay. Introducing flora and fauna to the red planet is a balancing act; if you're not careful, you can find an area completely taken over by one kind of species, especially when you add different kinds of plants to the mix. Once you get a few hours in and have discovered almost every type of plant, the game falls into a bit of repetition as you wander around trying to find an ending.The plot itself isn't too special, but the magic of this game is all in the setting. I am a lone man wandering the caves of an alien planet, spreading life wherever I go. There's no real sense of conflict or danger in the game, but the element of discovery and the research mechanic add a great deal of immersion and a sense of wonder about the whole thing.If you want a ""puzzle"" platformer that will last you a weekend, Waking Mars is a fun expedition, and I had a good time with it, despite the so-so writing and inconsistent visual style.

												This was perhaps the most peaceful and relaxing game I've ever played. Serene music, tranquil and colourful ambience, a botanist-role type of character in side-scrolling gameplay where you plant, grow, and breed lifeforms underneath the surface of Mars, all the while swooping around caverns with a jetpack strapped to your back. Great character dialogue and interaction, and a good basic and interesting story with multiple unique endings. For a planet that represents war and destruction, this ironic game made Mars seem like a prosperous, creative heaven. Waking Mars was a breath of fresh air from all other games, and I highly recommend it to anyone, esp. to those who want a different, unique, and relaxing game to play.			"

												A wonderful atmospheric exploration game with a story.I'm charmed by the voice acting and character portraits.  I love the story and the way the way it unfolds as you explore, and that it's about finding alien life and not blowing it all up.  You get some choices about how to proceed through the cave.  Optional parts feed back into the central narrative instead of feeling like pointless side-quests.The gameplay is quite light, but satisfying enough.  Avoiding hazards provides some challenge, but death is uncommon  and doesn't punish the player.  The game is not overly long and it is very good about letting you stop anywhere and picking up where you left off.There are a lot of things this game is not (e.g. flashy or fast-paced), but I love it for what it is.

												Waking Mars is a 2D, open world, platform game; you step into the shoe of a scientist, or rather a gardener, planting plants in each room so that the next would unlock. The game offers a well written back story for any story driven gamer; including a well rounded character, and few supporting character.However, the gameplay fell a bit short. There are only a handful of different seeds available, and you're only allowed to carry a limited quantity at a time; for that reason, you'll constantly find yourself back in the same room replenishing your seeds. Had the game allows you to instantly replenish your seeds or simply making your seeds supply infinite, rather than making you slowly waiting at each individual plants, then this experience wouldn't be so bad to bear. On top of that, the game revolves around increasing biomass, which often pushes the player to plant those high value seeds rather than a variety of them. Adding that to the limited seed supply and you got a very repetitive game.In summery, if a rich story is enough to carry you through the game, then be sure to pick this game up. If you're more interested in a entertaining platorming or puzzle experience, you should look elsewhere.			"

It's a game about exploration and trying stuff out -not one of those games where 70% is tutorial and handholding on rails.It's entirely possible to fail the best ending by ruining the eco-system if you exterminate the flame seed species for example.Having said so - the game isn't really hard if you use your brain. You'll have fun seeding plants and watch them eat the multiplying critters. There is a sense of wonder when you walk into a new cavern and discover a new plant and explore the uses for it. I'd call it gardening metroid.Graphics are good once you get used to the art style.If you 100% the game is around 8 enjoyable hours long.Bonus: it's easy to get 100% achievements if you're into that.

												One of the better games I've played this year so far. Story and exploration reel you in before you realize it's happening. Controls are tight, art is nice, gameplay feels balanced and there's around 10 hours of stuff to see and experience. My only real beefs are:  it's way too easy to overwrite a save accidentally and reassigning controls is not intuitive at all. I see so much potential in how they could expand on the gameplay that I hope there's a sequel, and that's rare for me.			"

												An awesome indie game on all points. The graphics are simple but nonetheless nice and colorful, and the environment, though only made of caverns most of the time, is varied enough. The gameplay is as simple as the visuals but original and interesting since it is aimed at creating and controlling a martian environment. I could say the same regarding the story. The voice acting and soundtrack are good. I could add that if you are curious and like to explore, you'll find a few secondary objectives to do, which will tell you more about the story or the characters. Waking Mars is not really difficult, but plants and wildlife do not remain passive and they can make environment control tricky if you're not careful. What I find really enjoyable is the whole scientific background, as your character does research on the flora and fauna while making progress, and all the findings are written in some sort of database that you can consult anytime. The theories and explanations regarding the environment are quite interesting. Needless to say, a game that invites you to create instead of destroying is more than welcome.			"

The main game mechanic involves figuring out how different Martian species work and then creating the largest ecosystem possible.  For example one plant only creates seeds when it is watered, another plant shoots water pods. Plant them next to each other and get infinite seeds.If this sounds interesting; solid music, believable dialogue and excellent voice acting make this worth your time and money.			"

The story is simple, but it is well written and intriguing. You explore, search, gathering, manipulating, creating, and de-constructing to create, in a more favourable way to the environmental needsWaking Mars' gameplay is relaxing and there is hardly any interruptions. This alone makes Waking Mars not as linear as other platformer games I've played recently. You will have to travel around to re-supply your seeds, revisit some areas or just to re-balance an area if need beWaking Mars is a really relaxing six hour platformer game that people who love realxing games without none or very little action and platformer games, then this game is the game for you RECOMMENDED :)  "

Спасибо разработчикам. Настоятельно рекомендую всем любителям спокойных приключенческих платформеров.			"

												A fun exploration game with some light puzzle elements. The story was compelling, and the world was fun to explore. Jetpack was very easy to control and fun to move around with. The different plant types all had a unique role to play, and progressing through the game is relaxing. A couple of the rooms were difficult to 5-star, but for the most part, the difficulty was very manageable.			"

												Waking Mars is a relaxing atmospheric educational puzzle/sim game.  One of those sci-fi games that remind you of the feeling you got while reading Asimov for the first time. Bought it for 2€, got about 7 hours of quality gameplay. Definitely worth it.			"

												As an astrobiology enthusiast and someone completely new to the 2D genre, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. There are a diverse range of fairly realistic lifeforms to discover, that each have their role in the ecosystem. The visuals are great and the controls are easy. Certainly worth what I paid for it.

												It's a very enjoyable game to play with an interesting world full of puzzles and wierd alien life. However, even with everything fully replenished, the ending leaves much to be desired (it's a slow zoom out on a still picture while credits roll). Not knowing this before hand was very frustrating, but, as long as you keep this disappointing eventuality in mind when playing this game (and in life), the sting of the end isn't as daunting.EDIT: It appears that I have missed a ""Special ending,"" one that, upon further research, is a bit more interesting than the normal one. New lesson, everyone: double check that you haven't missed an important aspect of a game before writing a review about it.			"

												Waking Mars puts you into the shoes of Dr. Liang Qi, an astrobiologist sent to Mars to SCIENCE! 0CT0, an AI probe sent to investigate the planet's caverns, has gone missing in the vast network of tunnels that is Lethe Cavern. Assisting you are Amani Ronga, who chats with you from Base Camp, and ART, another AI who sounds like a Borderlands Claptrap.I like Liang. He's a thinker. When he speaks, he sounds... not quite subdued, but distracted, by the scientific inquiries and dilemmas surrounding him at all times. So that he's only able to spare a small portion of his thought processes for the conversation at hand. Amani provides the heart, and ART provides the comic relief. Altogether, they have a fascinating dynamic thatOH look at me all wrapped up in people gazing. Where are my manners? Let me tell you about the gameplay.Gameplay's weird, yo.This is a game about two things: research, and... well, waking Mars. Science-minded fellow that he is, you'll be helping Liang investigate all of the weird fauna and flora (which is also technically fauna, actually) of Lethe Cavern. You do this by collecting and planting ""seeds"", throwing things at things to see how they react, coaxing things to eat other things, and generally being a bother to everything. Every creature provides a boost to the biomass of an area, and as you become more knowledgeable of your surroundings, you can use that information to help you increase Lethe Cavern's biomass to all new heights, and spread it to all new depths.There is a story, here. Bits of mystery and intrigue to investigate. A couple different endings to shoot for. I won't spoil anything, but it's enough to give you goals as you go.Waking Mars looks nice. I should use a better word there, but ""nice"" is what I feel in my heart, so judge away. Everything looks painted, but not in an artsy-fartsy way. There's a bit of a papery look to things, but you probably won't notice most of the time. It actually makes the game look really cool at times, though, when there are like four or five layers of background scenery moving by at different speeds.Waking Mars is not for everyone. There's no shooting, and the closest thing you get to a puzzle is the basic physicsy calculational resource management gameplay. You may find yourself spending your time herding creatures or waiting for the local population to build itself up while watching handfuls of hard-earned biomass repeatedly wander straight to their stupid, stupid deaths. But it certainly hooked me, and I certainly enjoyed playing it. So if it sounds like your bag, then maybe take a crack it, why not?			"

												Waking Mars is an indie puzzle game that cleverly weaves an interesting narrative in between innovative gameplay. The puzzles themselves are fresh, the controls slick and intuitive and the level design striking and inviting exploration. The games story helps move the game forward without getting in the way of the core gameplay. Widescreen modes, the steam overlay, controller support and achievements are all here coming together to make an excellent purchase for enthusiasts of either puzzles or science fiction stories. Tiger Games has done an excellent job, and while this game falls short of being a masterpiece due to it's fairly short length, there is enough here to satisfy even the most discerning gamer.			"

												I played this for a while and lost interest, then had to start at the beginning when I picked it up again because I forgot how to play it.  The story is not too bad, and I don't mind the minimal graphics, but I just couldn't finish it.  It becomes harder with no real clue how to proceed most of the time.  It has a map for fast travel, but no clue what you're going to find there, since as I progressed through the game I couldn't keep track of how I had left each section of the cavern.  You have to have certain items in your posession, and can only carry a few, so near the end it became so much about running around--nope, not here, let's try this one--that it just got incredibly tedious.  Plus you're manuevering a jetpack trying to chase critters and floating balls with a mind of their own, and is unbelievably frustrating.  I tried to like it, then tried to finish it, but failed on both counts.  It's too bad, because it's a different sort of game and I like variety and more game choices, but it was not for me.			"

												A fun little indie puzzler! Probably even more satisfying as a handheld/mobile game (which it is), the fun mechanics and themes kept me hooked and interested till the end, and looking forward for a sequel. It does commit the now more-common sin of ""TWO ENDINGS"" where one is blatantly the more 'canon' ending for said hopeful sequel, but doesn't detract from my enjoyment of it. A bit of a popcorn game; look for it on a mobile device, perhaps, for prolonged ""I'm Bored"" shelf-life!			"

												I came to this game with negative expectations and it won me over.I bought this severeal years ago and assumed it would be just a reflection of that time's 2D indie boom. I was wrong though. The gameplay is easy to understand and the game is sincere in it's core. It wants the player to have a sense of discovery and exploration of an alien world in a different planet. And it works.The game is mostly simulation mixed with platforming. You investigate elements/creatures and their behaviors. Then you manipulate them to serve you and make the environment thriwe by making the elements relate with each other.The game has metroidvania type elements where you are granted new tools to fix old areas and you are required to do purposeful work with the tools. You get to know the areas well. You are having some part in creating your own experience in the game and the game not forcing you to progress linearly.There are certain parts though where the next steps aren't obvious and can cause some frustration. These were relatively short lived though and not really a big thing. I actually enjoyed it because it made me more attached to the puzzles the game had to offer and got to know the mechanics better.Only negative parts for me were:* Collision detection--> Got stuck in ground once but just once* Too much effort into making your robot companion ART funny--> The game is self aware of it being tedious though* Visuals look like cut & pasted jpegs--> However the use of assets were good and created memorable events and rooms with the assets even though the style wasn't really up there with the rest of the game* Achievement unlocking--> I had troubles getting 0CT0 achievement even though I had gotten the upgrade from itOverall I enjoyed what the game had to offer and was impressed how the game used it's mechanics and visual design. I didn't feel I wasted time while playing this game.			"

 Waking Mars In 2097, life is discovered on Mars. When your mission of first contact becomes trapped by a cave-in, you must master the alien ecosystem to survive. Soon you stumble upon more than anyone expected, and with time running out, you will make a decision that determines the fate of a lost planet. Waking Mars is a Action, Adventure game made on the 13th December 2012 and so far i am really enjoying it. The Controls are easy, the graphics are smooth and most of all it is fun to play.Pros:- Controls are very easy.- Story is fun to play- Environmental phyisics is good.Cons: - Some missions are quite hard.

												Here's a 2D Indie game that is most likely nothing like anything you've ever played. In a great way, I must add!In Waking Mars you're an explorer of Mars' caves and its newfound life. As you interact with more and more life, the game registers your findings in a log, showing the amount of work that has been put into designing everything about this game. Every piece of life is highly detailed, and it's worth reading the information you gather as you play.BUT this isn't a merely exploratory game, despite that being a big focus. After you learn about the life you encounter, you learn how to use it to your advantage, creating the most aproppriate habitat for a certain type of plant or animal to live. In doing so, they'll eventually interact with each other, prospering further and further, that being the main mechanic of this game. Each room has a certain Biomass level requirement for you to progress, a mechanic that makes sense in the context of this game , as the caves' natural defense is to block the exits until there's self-sustainable life in it.The story was there merely to guide you through your adventure deeper and deeper into Mars, giving you a helping hand in this journey.As you progress, you start grasping the game's mechanics, and you'll be able to create some pretty cool environments and interactions with everything at your disposal, which feels very satisfying. So, I'd advise anyone to definitely try out this game. The sense of discovery is present at all times, keeping you emersed in the world from start to finish. There's a constant drive to keep you moving forward and exploring more and that's a really big plus! The game's world and mechanics fit perfecty, which is fairly rare, so yea, give them your money already and... enjoy!			"

												Reminiscent of the gorgeous game ""Aquaria"", Waking Mars pits you against an unknown, terrifying, and yet beautiful landscape teeming with life; both peaceful and dangerous. The soundtrack befits the setting proposed, and is quite excellent; while the voice acting is on par with many of todays big budget games, perhaps even better! Platforming in Waking Mars is simple puzzle based fare, which is both well done and enjoyable.The mechanics are interesting, and the controls fluent. Waking Mars is definitely well worth the asking price in terms of content and gameplay that's given.			"

Once the zoa are all introduced, there is way too much backtracking. The Metroidvania is a genre that needs much more varied environments and better platforming. The ""game"" here should be shorter and second to the story and atmosphere, which are superior. The story isn't great, but it's decent.Got it in the Humble Freedom Bundle, so it was basically a dollar. But I don't recommend it at full price or even half price.			"

It's not a good platformer it's based around touvh controls and you can feel it.  It's slow and very easy to avoid things with a control.  It's more of a puzzle game that anything else, the story is decent but due to it pausing the game every time there is something to say it really slows you down and personally takes me out of the experience. Don't buy this for a plattformer game it's really not.  Being a port some of it feels rushed the menu isn't very good with a controller and it can be difficult to deal with at times.  Final though is it's not bad but not great, play it more for the story then the game play. 6/10			"

It's not a good platformer it's based around touvh controls and you can feel it.  It's slow and very easy to avoid things with a control.  It's more of a puzzle game that anything else, the story is decent but due to it pausing the game every time there is something to say it really slows you down and personally takes me out of the experience. Don't buy this for a plattformer game it's really not.  Being a port some of it feels rushed the menu isn't very good with a controller and it can be difficult to deal with at times.  Final though is it's not bad but not great, play it more for the story then the game play. 6/10			"

												game looks fun but the logitec wireless controller that I have does not seem to work properly. As far as I can tell this game does not work well with controller. Maybe it works better with a different controller like xbox controller...			"

Oh Yeah!!Game is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece.It don't really got any replay value to it, but you have to admit that it's pretty fun to find new Lifeforms and do some experiments with them.Only thing I would want more of is more interactable objects and perhaps better Sentinels!still a great game! 9/10			"

												This game is quite possibly one of the best examples of the practical application of physics I've ever seen. If you seed one of the planimals (they're neither plant or animal you see) you can make a rough simulation of an ecosystem. They launch a seed, seed rolls down a hill, seed hits terrain, seed plants and so on and so forth. I also love the art style. I notice it's become somewhat of a trend to do this kind of aesthetic, I don't even know how to properly describe it but basically it's a mix between photorealistic and game. Unlike a lot of trends it's one I hope people continue propagating because it's awesome. So is this game.			"

												Awesome game. I can't recommend it highly enough. Unique experience and yet there are some familiar Metroidvania style elements. In this game those you are creating life instead of taking it away.It looks and plays really well on the PC and there's controller support as well and keyboard and mouse. Played through it recently on Desura and it really drew me in in a way few games do. The ongoing story elements mixed really well with the exploration and ecosystem puzzle elements.I'd definitely like to see more games like this.			"

												This game was pretty neat with its concept. Kind of like real time strategy in a way. You are an astronaut trapped in the caves of mars and you have to use your seeds to raise the amount of life which opens the next cave. There is a bunch of stuff for completion oriented gamers and it has a nice set of choices that affect the game. For example you can choose to either leave the cave and escape or go back and search the cave more. However now that i have played through it I can not figure out how to return to the beginning or start a new profile.			"

												Waking Mars is truly the closest to a scientific game you can get without encluding any real science. You have the scientific method, and that's about it. You're given a journal, basic jetpack controls, and let out to play around on the inner caves of Mars. Seeds will spawn plants alarmingly quickly, and you record the attributes of the various animals and plants while balancing the populations in order to reach a ""life force"" cap to go to the next bit. It's a nice idea but after only like 5 plants it slows to a crawl as they drastically increase the cap necessitating hours of repetitive violent gardening. If you're tight for cash I wouldn't recommend as it's innovation is short lived. However if you're intrigued by the scientific method aspect I'd heartilly recommend.			"

												The graphics are nice, but the animation is crap. Controller support doesn't allow use of the d-pad, which is lame because the left stick doesn't appear to be using analog sensitivity. Menu is buggy and somewhat poorly designed.Despite all that, this is an interesting and refreshingly original game with simple but effective gameplay mechanics. Once you've adapted to the somewhat noobish design problems, the gameplay becomes addictively compelling. This is a short game, but if you can pick it up on sale it's worth playing.			"

												Waking Mars has to be the most grounded Science Fiction game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It feels like something that could actually happen through to the end. All four(?) of them.The paper cut-out art style makes everything pop in just the right way. It's all very well drawn. Not only is the art good, but the characters are extremely realistic and likeable people that will accompany you via radio on your journey through the vast underground Martian ecosystem.The best way to describe this game is as a casual 2-D puzzle platformer, gardening/ecosystem creation simulation. It's on the easy side, sure, but you'll definitely get your money's worth out of the story alone. For those asking a little more, you can try and perfect the game. All 110% of it! Personally, I reached 103% and two endings in 7.1 hours playtime, and I was stopping to admire a lot of scenery.The only cons I can really think of would be after a certain point, things get tedious. If you're looking to squeeze out every last bit of exploration, dialogue, and completion from this game, you're going to be doing a LOT of backtracking to places where you can easily access certain materials. But if you're going that far, you should be ready to deal with such tedium and technically forfeit your right to complain.All in all, I recommend this game for fans of simple puzzle games, space cadets, and anyone with general interest in good sci-fi. If you really want a deal, wait for it to go on sale or hope it gets thrown into a Humble Bundle again. Maybe even pick it up on Android or IOS if you rather game on-the-go.Finally, my recommendation for controls is a 360/PS3 gamepad. The keyboard and mouse controls just don't fit very well, but that's my personal opinion.Hope you liked the review and thanks for reading.			"

												So... I'm not really sure what to think of this game. I really don't. I'm not even sure if it's worth getting. The gameplay sucks, but it's very immersive. It's kinda boring, but still strangely alluring. It's...Basically, it's science. That is exactly the feeling you get from playing this game - it's like doing a PhD. No, not 'spend points on research', not 'mix random things together and see what happens', proper science.But not computer science. That's what SpaceChem is like.			"

												As someone with triple monitors, this game is unplayable. It stretches the screen to fit all monitors so you can't see what is happening above or below your character. To make matters worse,  the game locked my cursor to left 1/3 of the screen. This means when I press Esc to bring up the menu and see if there's any resolution settings, I can't move the cursor over to the menu. None of the resolution or windowed mode shortcuts in the command line seem to work. Rather, it just crashes the game. Should the game get updated with better resolution support, I may re-review. It looks promising.			"

												Waking Mars was an excellent platformer with cool science elements that keep your attention. The game requres a little bit of strategy in some areas, and adds a few puzzles to keep you thinking. The story is interesting, combing science with theories and fiction. There are at least three different endings, depending on certain chioces you've made torwards the end of the game. My only 'cons' are that some of the objectives aren't always marked or triggered right away, so sometimes you go right past and don't relize it. However there's usually enough information available to guide you in the right direction without holding your hand.Avery solid game for cheap that will give 5-8 hours of good entertainment.8\10			"

The plants have a life of thier own and also the way they react to the enviornment and soil is to be discovered, each beings compliments each other in different ways either by growing or by feeding or by destroying each other, a very unique bio adventure and one that you will not regret as you try to uncover the mystery beneath mars.

												Bought this game on 80% discount. Good thing.The story and the Mars atmosphere is great (Though I only played 11 mintues)Why am I already writing a review? Well the fun of exploring is constantly disturbed by the game forcing you to stop and listen to the people talking. You can't move at all while they are talking, and well you don't want to skip through it since the story is rather good.But not to be able to move around while listening to the story, it ruins your flow. Your ability as a gamer to engage yourself into the game is stopped and reset each time the people are talking. Which is bad since the story which seems good, is actually ruining the game when trying to present the story.Bad game design. For me at least.			"

												Don't let the ""cheaper"" animation fool you; this is well-developed game.  I tried it out last night and found myself binge-playing to finish it (took about 8 hours).  It may not be your cup of tea, but if the below sounds good to you, pick it up.Pros:* Tons of voice dialog (lead character is fantastic, supporting character is passable)* Intelligent writing* Graphics are minimalistic but have a good artistic quality* Puzzles are interesting and force you to think a fair amount* There is some scientific validity to most of the ideas here* Soundtrack is quite good* Overall atmosphere is intriguing with a great sense of scaleCons:* Some people might find the last parts of the game tough as it starts to lean more heavily on your memory of current objectives* Animation of models could have been slightly better than just a few frames* Possible to get caught and perma-killed by some situations or enemies* Some menus can be difficult to navigateNotes:The game is a essentially a puzzle platformer, has a reasonably slow pace and it is not a shooter in any way, so if that's not your style of game (or your mood of the moment), don't try to like this game.

												Waking Mars is a fun platformer. You must build an ecosystem and learn more about the mysteries of Mars. There really isn't anything spectacular about this game, but the mechanics play out very well. The game is sectioned off into certain areas that you explore and build ecosystems in. The way you manage to build your ecosystem is mostly freeform. It's was very refreshing to have a freedom of choice. The story is well written, but very minimalistic. Overall it's a solid title.

												Being a huge fan of sci-fi and metroid-ish style of open world exploring, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.The game as a whole amazed me with it's creativity, gameplay, and what amounts to its story. Discovering life on Mars and then building up its ecosystem how you want (not to say it might not come with its own consequences). Depending on how you create it can make it easier or more difficult for you to progress. The character's to me were pretty interesting as well.For the type of game this is some may find it boring as it's not really chalk full of action so it might not be for everyone. I wouldn't say it's too easy either as it can make you sit there and think about what you want to do and how you're gonna do it.Last bit I have to say was the secret ending wasn't how I thought it would be and I loved it. Definitely got some friends to recommend this game to.			"

												On the surface Waking Mars looks like a Metroid clone, similar to Capsized, but as the game progresses it stakes out its own ground. Like Metroid, it's built around exploration and puzzles that unlock access to further areas. However, unlike Metroid it's not built around combat - instead, there's a well-written and interesting scientific exploration mission underway, and your quest is to understand the ecosystems you discover.The puzzles are interesting and the visuals are good (though perhaps unexceptional for the style of game involved) - but what really sets Waking Mars apart and makes me enjoy it is that it really feels like a game of exploration, rather than a game of exploring until you find the next enemies to kill. For me, playing Waking Mars is like revisiting the best bits of the Metroid franchise.			"

												Interesting short game with a good concept, writing, voice acting, and mechanics.  While I found the strategy of the game as a whole a little repetitive, it was nonetheless fun to play through.  Probably the most endearing thing about the game was the world they built in it -- the ideas and art to back up those ideas are fantastic.  If you like science fiction, and especially xenobotany, you will probably like this game.  Recommended for:  Plant-lovers, sci-fi junkies who like a good story, casual strategy and puzzle game enthusiasts.Don't do it if:  You want gore or violence, need replay value (there's not much to this one), don't like comic relief robots (this one is particularly annoying but not too intrusive), or want complex strategy.

												Great game! The way the game and story line builds up keeps the game interesting but not overly challenging. You start off by exploring Mars and, as you get further and further into the game, you continue on with various objectives. There are smaller objectives coupled with your overall objective to help Mars and its lifeforms, making this a game you can actually play through multiple times while still exploring new things. Fantastic graphics, fun objectives. Highly recommended!			"

												An extraordinary game that is, hopefully, a representation of the possibilities of games as a medium, with gameplay that goes beyond violence and conflict as the only game mechanics of any importance. It's sort of a puzzle-solving, alien-gardening Metroid, with a jetpack, on Mars. Science/astronomy buffs will like it, a great sci-fi exploration plot.			"

This may sound somewhat boring but it is actually very engaging as there are many different ways to go about doing it. In addition the game has a moderately engaging story and decent humor.   The controls work smoothly and I haven't been irked by any quirks or bugs.  All and all it is very nice game and I highly recommend it.			"

												Waking Mars is a port of a tablet game, but unlike the typical tablet port it has excellent mouse & keyboard controls (and also supports game pads, although I didn't use mine). It has the structure of a Metroidvania, but where a Metroidvania has you fighting your way through enemies to acquire new equipment that allows access to new areas, Waking Mars is entirely non-violent (except for the occasional environmental hazard) and has you manipulating the ecosystem in order to open up new paths to explore.This is both interesting (going against the normal structure of the genre by leaving out enemies entirely) and terrible (it turns out that manipulating the ecosystem by growing and killing plants isn't a great gameplay experience). In fact, I once screwed up the plant life in a room so badly that I resorted to deleting the save file to reset it (fortunately, each room is saved in its own file, so I didn't lose my progress entirely). I suspect that it is actually possible to render the game unwinnable by accidentally eradicating some of the plant species entirely, although I didn't do this. I did kill off enough of some of the more troublesome species that it became difficult to remember where some of their specimens were in the game world in order to collect their seeds on the rare occasions I needed to use them to progress.Waking Mars is an interesting but not spectacular experience with some nicely drawn 2D art, good voice acting, actual minority characters for a change, and a gameplay mechanic that outlasted its welcome to the point where I took the easiest to obtain ending and didn't bother with the more difficult options. Not terrible, not wonderful, notable because  it is different.			"

												Waking Mars started life as an atmospheric puzzler on smart phones. It is now an atmospheric puzzler on Steam, with achivements and Steam Trading Cards. The game has no real difficulty as you are presented with a room with continuing complex puzzles (Which aren't very hard and hardly thought provoking). What the game has going for it is the story and atmosphere. You are an astronaut on a mission to discover what happened to an early lost droid on the exploration of a cave network on Mars. The story progresses a little beyond that and is fully voiced, yet not very convincingly. It's a nice ride while it lasts but the added materials don't warrant the extra charge for being a computer release.			"

The visuals or gameplay aren't exactly top notch, but the atmosphere and sense of discovery are great. I've never felt so much like a scientist exploring an alien world like in this game! There's only a couple of characters, but I really liked them. They were pretty likable and felt like real scientist types who'd get sent on a mission like this. Took me about 6 hours to find everything, which was a good length for a game of this scope and price range.			"

												Waking Mars is an interesting concept.  At it's heart, it's a rather Metroid-esque exploration game.  Rather than focusing on combat, however, your goal is to explore and build an ecosystem within a large cave system on Mars.  While it's pretty simplistic, it does take some work to balance the flora and fauna in each room as certain ones will destroy others and can hurt you as well.The game has a light story focused around the exploration which works well, though I wish the dialogue didn't force you to stop playing to listen to it.  It would be a lot nicer if it let you keep playing while the characters conversed.  It does have some nice hand-drawn character portraits though.  The characters themselves are pretty interesting, with the usual insulting AI and some decently acted humans.Graphically, the game looks quite nice with the same hand-drawn feel, though animation quality is pretty poor.  Some may like it others may not.  One thing I really wish was done better is the music.  Good music could have added so much more atmosphere to the game.Overall, it's a fun little game worth your time.  If you want to get the special ending though, you'll end up running back and forth all over the place for seeds which can get quite tedious.			"

												Waking Mars is an alien botany gardening sim, which is a string of words that instantly sold me on this game. You essentially create ecosystems by planting seeds that grow into plants, building ""biomass"" to unlock new areas and move forward. It's not so much a puzzle game for most of its run as it is a game of discovery, observing how different plants react to each other and trying to build a stable enviorment while only understanding part of what you're doing. Most of the game's delights are in that process of discovery. I've played a lot of novel games, and this one felt like it was exploring a new, fascinating gaming idea, where you model little ecosystems on the fly.Unfortunately, it never goes very deep- completing most of the areas is effortless, and while the story leaves a tantalizing hook dangling for you to resolve, doing so apparently requires getting a perfect score in every area. Getting that score means messing with a lot of finicky parts that I thought was too frustrating to be worth the time. I wish the game went deeper by creating new puzzle areas and challenges, instead of forcing you to be a completionist. So I never finished this game, but the five hours or so I put into it were pretty rewarding. Bonus points for the amusing way your AI-assistent speaks: video games have a lot of ""funny"" talking robots nowadays, but this one is especially good.You'll probably be seeing it a lot in indie bundles, which is where I got my copy. Pick it up if you have a few hours to spare for some inventive gaming.			"

												The game starts out rather simple - plant seeds, grow biomass, open doors - but rapidly grows more complex only a few levels in. Learning about each and every organism to craft a self-sustaining ecosystem is surprisingly addictive and the only way to progress. Several times I had to backtrack and set up a 'farm' of one species or another to continue. The interactions with the AIs are also adorable and contain some of the best twists in the game. The only real downside of Waking Mars is that the replay value is somewhat limited.			"

												I recomend this game to anyone who is a fan of scifi, adventure and world building. The designs are very creative, and the atmosphere is easy to lose yourself in as you explore. The writing is pretty good, and the world build solid. It's a great game to relax to and let your mind wander as you create and help life thrive. This game is well paced,  and goes by pretty quick. You can probably play it through within 7 hours.			"

												While simple in presentation, the game mechanics were thoughtful and engaging. Storyline puzzles spanning multiple regions of the gameworld created intriguing questions that often could not be solved until further exploration had been completed. The dialogue between characters through the course of the game developed interesting personalities and a genuine care about what happens to them as the game progresses. Controls were easy enough to not interfere with enjoying the game environment, yet nuanced enough to require some degree of precision and interaction.Personally, I enjoy a game that can be completed in a few sittings, much like the old Super Metroid which could be fully completed in under 3 hours. If the gameplay is good, and the game length not overly long, it makes a game with great replay value. I am already on my 3rd or 4th full playthrough over the course of a year and still enjoying what this game has to offer.With almost 500 games in my steam library alone, this game is easily one of my top 5%.

												This is a very interesting game with an even more interesting setting:Mars, the red planet.  You are Liang, a martian explorer who tampers with the unknown and suffers dearly for it.  He is, as a cause of his mistake, trapped in the opening chasm of subterranean Mars, with slim chances of returning home, will Liang try to move back to base camp at all costs, or will he remain on Mars as a reminder to all astronauts.

												This is a good break from a lot of the high adrenaline games out there. The story is great and the artwork is beautiful. I found myself wanting to see what else the game would reveal, and wanted to get all of the research before the end.You create your own biome within this cave on Mars, finding the best ways to get max mass, if you're a completionist. The whole process is paced well, and none of it feels like a chore. Backtracking is almost nonexistant, since the map includes a quick travel feature. I also really appreciate that the devs created an auto save before the two endings, so you can go back and get the other ending without having to restart the whole game. That is a big plus for people who want to play once and move on.With that said, I really enjoyed this game. The length is perfect. The only way it could go longer is if the writers could keep throwing up new discoveries and mystery. However, they go quick, to the point, with no useless filler. While the journey begins as a scientific expedition, there is much more purpose to be found in the depths. To find all of its secrets is up to you. Will you wake Mars?			"

												A very unique game. It feels really contemplative and relaxing. It's one of those few games that does non-aggression really well, which is reinforced by the very likable protagonist. He has this aura of calm wisdom around him that makes me wish I could go to his lectures IRL.From a gameplay standpoint, it's pretty repetitive and can be a little dull, but what keeps the game going is this feeling of wonder and discovery as you descend into an unknown world.The graphics are quite pretty and appeal to my sense of wanderlust. It also autosaves everything you do so you can boot it up, mess around and then quit within moments, which is something I greatly appreciate in video games - I find that as a working adult, I just don't have the time to play an entire videogame level in one go without convenient saving.

												Lovely, self-contained little game. Nice little story arc, fairly fun gameplay (gets a teensy bit repetitive after a while, but holds your interest for the 6ish hours it should take you to finish), interesting voice acting (JUST on the edge of cheesy, but not really). Graphics aren't super-stunning, but evoke the atmosphere they're after; soundtrack is great.Bonus points for the only two human characters being an Asian man and a woman of colour. Woot!			"

												Nonviolent exploration platform games are a rare breed. Waking Mars doesn't have to do much to stand out from such a thin crowd. And yet Tiger Style went above and beyond to make the game a standard-setting platformer on its own merits.This is yet another mobile game that doesn't feel at all like a mobile game. The controls are tight and smooth. The art assets are gorgeous, including the face close-ups which accompany all the dialogue. The voice actors are engaged and well-directed.Much has been made of the Metroid roots of the title. The chatty trio of protagonists somehow feel more alone on Mars than silent Samus did on Zebes. Tasks must be completed and resources collected in order to press forward. Paths branch and reconnect, many of them essentially optional. Still, Waking Mars feels like its own game rather than a derivative. The primary mechanic of the game - using alien seeds to establish life in the depths of a cave slowly waking from centuries of slumber - is novel and intuitively implemented. Waking Mars is no reskinned shooter.What most impressed me was the way the curtain was lifted on the final element of revelation. To some extent the game suffers from tutorial syndrome as your helpful companions chatter along; they always seem to be one step behind your own grasp of what you need to do. But the understanding of just what might really be going on under the regolith is something the game lets you deliciously realize on your own. This quiet revelation is well-paced with just the right hints along the way. The game is short, but it's full nonetheless and ends exactly where it should. The endings are brief but satisfying.It's absolutely worth picking up, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Waking Mars is a fun puzzle-like game where you have a lot more freedom and randomization than in most puzzles, and the storyline is pretty nice, too. It's a good way to waste a few days' time. I was surprised to find out there are basically three endings. The fact I apparently finished it before solving one of the major end puzzles gave the game some measure of replayability as I used my previous end save game to complete the bonus puzzle and unlock the two other endings.In later gameplay, though, one thing really started to bother me, and that was the fact that biodiversity simply didn't work. Instead of a circle of life, you'd have lifeforms destroying each other, taking over each other's growing spot and actually decreasing the total biomass. And since the only real goal, especially in the game's end-phase, is to maximize biomass, you'll generally end up replacing every single plant-lifeform in the whole cave system with the one that gives the most biomass, is harmless to you and the other lifeforms, and on top of that, acts as food production for all of the mobile lifeforms.As far as I can see, there is no way to make a self-regulating system which involves all of the life in the ecosystem, so yeah, that is a bit of a failure, in my opinion.This entire rant, however, just shows how engrossed I became in experimenting with the whole concept. Despite this minor annoyance at the end, it's still a very nice game, which I'll probably replay a few times in the future.			"

												How refreshing!  This game reminded me of Commodore 64 games of old, when the environment was as key to the game as anything else.  The gameplay concerns reviving a dead cavern one chamber at a time and using that life to progress through to the next step in the main character's story.  The puzzles that come of it are simple, fun, and the game has a lovely feel to it; nice to have themes of rebirth and renewal in a game.As a bonus, It's always refreshing to have a multi-ethnic cast without it being a plot point.

												Waking Mars is a unique game.  The idea is to spread and plant seeds in order to create biomass which unlocks new chambers and passages.  While the game isn't difficult, it's a fun and worthwhile adventure.  The production values aren't top of the line obviously, however they get the job done and there's a certain charm to the graphics.  I spent around 7 hours playing the game and I was never bored.  If you're looking for a game to pass time with that doesn't involve shooting and has minimal frustration, then you should check out Waking Mars.			"

												My first impression of this game was that of a cheap alien shooter with a jetpack. OOooooh how I was wrong. Sure its graphics are far from impressive, but that's not what they were aiming for.Now I'll start with what I enjoyed the most of this. The soundtrack. The music is so strange and unique, so it fits this alien world perfectly. But, truly, many of the tunes are just great tunes! You can check it out in the DLC, its free! What I'll remember most profoundly about this game is how unique it was. Its system is unlike any other game out there. Sure, it borrows a few generic concepts from Metroid, so yeah, its a Metroidvania game (but those are awesome!). But it differs in that theres no combat in the usual sense, no weapons, no direct attacking. Rather, you throw seeds around and grow different plants that have unique abilities, to suit your needs. Got hurt from acid or nasty plants? Grow a healing plant. Want to water a dry area to grow more plants? Grow a water plant. Then theres more unusual situations of having to grow predatorial plants to eat the ""enemies""... but I digress.Another unique thing is that there is no enemies, nor antagonist for that matter. Sure, the wildlife you encounter might attack you, but only if you invade their territory or get too close for comfort. They just mind their own business, being generally neutral, like the wild in real life. Its nice not to have stupid cliched ""bad guys"", and it just works! Its all about the exploration. This game is surprisingly deep and you'll have much to discover, everytime adding a new entry in a nifty little encyclopedia (like a Pokedex), giving you hints on how to interact with things in interesting ways. The game is very smart in how it always manages to surprise you. It presents you with a new lifeform, and you just gotta... experiment with it. Its really fun and I'm not gonna spoil any details. If theres one thing that it fails at, sadly, is replayability. Its very long and tedious at times, but it was worth it to see what happens next. If you already know what next, however, theres very little incentive to go through the hoops a second time.  I'd replay it in a heartbeat with a friend though, to showcase it!All in all, I REALLY recommend this game and strongly encourage game developpers to take a gander at it, this hidden gem of originality.

												Very ambient game, got it on sale for 2$ and it was a very pleasant surprise.You play as Liang, an astronaut a few centuries in the future sent to explore newly discovered life in a cave on mars after the disappearence of the rover 0ct0 in the aforementioned cave.what you discover is a curious mechanism of what appears to be a self perserving ecosystem:each chamber in the cave will not open until there is sufficient biomass in it- ensuring that the inner parts of the cave remain safe from the harsh conditions on the surface until it is ready.For me the characters (Liang and Amani) were very likeable and creating a self sufficient eco system that would ebb and flow from stage 4 to 5 within a chamber was very satisfying and felt natural.That being said, the gameplay was got very repeptetive and the scenery was quite monotone at some points (though I suppose being it's placed in mars there's not much to do about that.) and the jetpack was a bit clunky at some points (when you hit a rock with your foot and the game decides you're trying to walk)OVERALL:  - Very ambient, atmospheric game  - Science is just detailed enough to make you think how accurate it is  - Gameplay-driven story that is very interesting  - Likeable Characters  - Gets a bit tedious sometimes  - Repetetive towards the end  - Whole heartedly recommended!

												This is a pretty dang cool game. The gameplay and visual themes feel similar to Aquaria or Super Metroid. The music is nice and smooth but also catchy. Interacting with the new creatures you discover is interesting and sometimes challenging. You fill research logs by actually discovering what creatures do in different situations.I was worried from the description that the characters would seem kind of lifeless, but there's actually a lot of dialog that goes on in the game. Some of it is amusing, some is intriguing. You are a scientist on an exploratory mission that suddenly becomes dangerous, but your character has a tendency to see peace and serenity in situations where others might freak out. He seems pretty eloquent too, and gets a bit philosophical at times. Sometimes you wonder if it's a good idea to wake the life on Mars, and if humans are creating a positive or negative impact. Yet if you continue to play, the impact is unavoidable. Haven't finished it yet, but curious to see where it ends up.			"

												This is a really neat science fiction platformer. I love all of the thought that went into the life forms and how things interact with each other. Hell it even has good writing between the robot, Liang, and the lady at the base.The main focus off the game is a follow up exploration on Mars after your team loses track of the robot that was surrveying the area before you. Along the way you encounter life forms mostly plants.You have to make areas have enough Biomass (plant life) to open new areas and progress further to see what the heck is up with Mars.I can easily recommend this game if you like puzzle platformers.

												I received my copy from a Humble Bundle.Atmospheric and refined Metroidvania platformer/side scroller where the central mechanics are exploration through resource-balancing puzzle-solving. The central conceit is that you are attempting to solve the mystery of Mars' subterranean ecosystem. The visual presentation is top-notch for an indie side-scroller with some fine art direction and music. The voice acting and in-game briefings are glib and lack urgency. It didn't need to be Battlestar Galactica-intense, but when your habitat collapses on a distant planet with rescue a long way's away... one would expect even the hardiest, most intrepid explorers to react to the discovery of extraterrestial life with more than a ""Huh. I should research this further. This is very unexplained.""A bit much at full price, but definitely worth it on sale or part of a bundle.			"

												BUY THIS GAME! It's totally worth it (though I'm cheap and snagged it on sale)This is an amazing game, especially considering it doesn't involve guns, sand-box elements, or horror. Most sci-fi games out recently have been heavy on the fiction and light on the science. This game does an excellent job being adventurous without losing the theme of experimentation, exploration, and logic. It is a short but thoroughly enjoyable game and I'm happy I spent the money on it.Pros:-Great port to PC. I believe this was originally an APP, but it was ported to PC very well. Using mouse/keyboard or gamepad, the controls were wonderful and I didn't have a single glitch or crash.-Simple mechanics- Tossing seeds and floating on my jetpack. Super easy, but to balance the ecosystem, you need to do some planning. Challenging but not obnoxious.-Beautiful art AND music- This game nailed it with their art direction. Everythign is beautifully drawn and the music is appropriately surreal.-Great story- A nice storyline with two (four if you count AIs) memorable characters. You start off just searching for a lost robot and stumble upon so much more!-Three endings- You're given several options on how to end the game, each one with it's own footage.Cons: -No room for a sequel--Short--Could benefit from some sort of ""build your own ecosystem"" map.

Es un pequeño gran juego, si eres aficionado a la ciencia ficción llegas a intuir la trama, si no, aun así, vale la pena darle un lugar en la biblioteca de juegos. Sencillo, sin muchas pretensiones mas que el jugador pase un buen rato resolviendo los retos.			"

												Waking Mars is a unique game.  The idea is to spread and plant seeds in order to create biomass which unlocks new chambers and passages.  While the game isn't difficult, it's a fun and worthwhile adventure.  The production values aren't top of the line obviously, however they get the job done and there's a certain charm to the graphics.  I spent around 7 hours playing the game and I was never bored.  If you're looking for a game to pass time with that doesn't involve shooting and has minimal frustration, then you should check out Waking Mars.			"

												Waking Mars started life as an atmospheric puzzler on smart phones. It is now an atmospheric puzzler on Steam, with achivements and Steam Trading Cards. The game has no real difficulty as you are presented with a room with continuing complex puzzles (Which aren't very hard and hardly thought provoking). What the game has going for it is the story and atmosphere. You are an astronaut on a mission to discover what happened to an early lost droid on the exploration of a cave network on Mars. The story progresses a little beyond that and is fully voiced, yet not very convincingly. It's a nice ride while it lasts but the added materials don't warrant the extra charge for being a computer release.			"

Absolutely worth it, even at full price (of which I got on sale for $2.00If this game is on sale, buy it quick. Save it for a time when you just want to relax and forget about stuff.It is not a game that will cause you to get frustrated, but is pleasantly challenging.Compared with the anger caused by FPS games, or the frustration of challenges in games such as Myst, Riven, any mystery game, etc.However it is not so relaxed that you can zone out too far, such as Minecraft played in Peaceful.It simply is a pleasant game that is enjoyable without the need of solving your problems with excessive bloodshed.I would highly recommend this game.

												The Internet was out at my place, and I had Steam offline activated. I forget how I got this game, maybe from a humble bundle. I never really looked at it, so since I was bored I thought I'd give it a try. I was blown away by this game.The art and visuals are simple but excellent; the characters look like they were hand drawn based on models, which adds a lot to the sweet and sometimes humorous character dialogue. You really feel like you're investigating the life forms you encounter, as the game encourages you to try everything to interact with it. There is a little bit of a grind as you sometimes have to backtrack to replenish your collection of seeds, but if you plan it out well then you can establish little gardens with whatever Zoa you need more of in small clusters. I often had to revisit the Larian Gauntlet to trick more critters into becoming compost for me, after reproducing them in sufficient quantities. There's a certain honest charm about this game. You don't play some fantastic larger-than-life scientist fighting a military tough guy who's trying to take advantage of your discovery, and the aliens don't turn out to be xenomorph kill machines. You're just a dude with a jetpack who's trying to figure things out, and trying to stay alive at the same time. In a way, it's both liberating and humbling.Also, ART is my new favourite AI sidekick.			"

												Waking Mars is unlike any other game I have played, creating a wonderful mixture of platformer and environmental management. You find yourself trapped in an underground cave system on Mars shortly after the discovery of life on the planet. You must use these very organisms to manage the environment around you, helping them grow, reproduce, and even feed on each other as you unravel the mysteries of the red planet. I found myself unable to stop as I adventured through the various caverns, perfecting ecosystems, gathering resources, and spreading life to new areas.			"

												Mars, spacesuits and jetpacks. Don't let the action tag fool you though, there isn't any combat, much less any real action to speak of, just lots of gardening and pseudoscience. Indeed, Waking Mars is a xenoecological adventure to recover a missing exploration probe as you uncover the secrets hidden within the Lethe Cavern. Start out in a chamber mostly devoid of life, introduce moisture, plant seeds in fertile terrain and watch them spring to life! But as they start to spread out in the area, you might find that it may not be the most efficient ecosystem, or that certain Zoa may threaten to eliminate the rest of it! It's all very simple and there are limited patches for planting, but the number of cross interactions between different species and their environments makes for a surprising level of complexity. You may have beat a zone by hitting a certain biomass within it and unlocked new areas, but later you might want to revist them to increase the efficiency of the ecosystems in them, improving synergies and generating even more biomass. Or you just want to visit it to pick up some seeds for use in a new area. The game encourages you to build ecosystems that benefit heavily from synergistic interactions but isn't afraid to let you build insane unstable ones that have large amounts of biomass constantly in flux as life is rapidly reproduced as it is destroyed. Sometimes planting a single Zoa (ART, an AI program in your suit will tell you that they aren't plants!) too soon can make it hard to fix as it spreads all around before you can start planting your desired Zoa in other patches. Sometimes the easiest way to stop this happening is to kill it. You may however only carry a certain amount of each seed and that makes you have to think about how you have to go about planting them (though it also means  that it can be tedious if you are trying to populate an area with mainly one sort of Zoa). There is even the potential to wipe out an entire species, though many plants do reappear in later chambers if you accidentally do so in an early one.While many of the game's quirks make it arguably a better one, it is not without faults. You are almost required to revist some old chambers to do a quick restock of seeds every few chambers and while you can teleport between chambers you have visited I feel it could have been more streamlined.  Speaking of tedium, Ledon Zoa are amazing at providing biomass AND populating entire zones, but can be a nightmare to plant as they float upwards aimlessly, cannot be picked up and crumble with little force. ART is like a less charming Wheatley and can be quite jarring. Fortunately your player character, Liang, is the most likeable character in the game. The signal decoding segments can be a tad confusing and so can most of the endings.Overall an excellent title, more enjoyable than gardening.			"

												Waking Mars was a very big surprise for me.  I obtained the game as part of a Humble Bundle.  I'm a fan of Metroidvania games (action/exploration games like Metroid and Castlevania that focus on exploring a large 2D open world for upgrades and other goodies) so this did seem up my alley.The gameplay of Waking Mars is similar to metroidvanias in its 2D open world and ability to wander, but that's about where the similarities end.  The core gameplay of Waking Mars is flying around with a jetpack through large 2D spaces manipulating each areas's ecosystem in order to unlock more areas and complete main/side objectives.  The ecosystem is a web of plants and a couple of ""animals"" that depend on each to thrive and reproduce (there's also a research journal that explains each life form's use and abilities as you discover them).  Later in the game you'll find yourself going between several rooms to obtain seeds to enhance other rooms to their maximum biomass level.  Each room has a different ecosystem to work with and different challenges to overcome so the game never feels repetitive or monotonous.  There's no combat here, so you'll purely be picking up and throwing seeds as well as trying to herd around some of the larger seeds you can't carry.  Some plants can hurt and kill you, but the game has a very generous autosave system so death is never more than a minor hindrance as a result of being sloppy (note that I played on normal, the game offers casual and hard settings which I imagine do nothing but change how much damage you receive).On the technical side I was extremely impressed at the professional quality of this ""indie"" game.  Graphics are 2D but very detailed and look incredibly sharp and detailed at 1920x1200 screen resolution.  The screenshots on Steam really do not do the look of this game justice.  Voice acting sounds extremely professional and all dialogue in game is fully voiced.  The controls also felt fantastic for a mouse and keyboard user and zooming around on the jetpack and using the mouse to throw seeds felt extremely precise and natural.  The game also ran perfectly without a hitch in Gentoo Linux so clearly the developer has put a lot of effort into proper Linux support which is wonderful.  The only technical hiccup I had was screen tearing during scenes of heavy movement.  My monitor does that worse than many and I normally use vsync because of it but this game had no option for it and it wasn't bad enough to force it in the drivers.My first playthrough, getting all 17 achievements was 7.9 hours.  That may seem on the short side but that time was devoid of tedium or reptition, the game never overstayed its welcome and progressed very naturally.  The quality of this was so good I regret getting it so cheap as part of a Humble Bundle, its worth every bit of its current $9.99 US price tag.  If you like exploration games and/or the idea of manipulating an ecosystem for life to thrive you will enjoy this game!			"

												This is a pretty dang cool game. The gameplay and visual themes feel similar to Aquaria or Super Metroid. The music is nice and smooth but also catchy. Interacting with the new creatures you discover is interesting and sometimes challenging. You fill research logs by actually discovering what creatures do in different situations.I was worried from the description that the characters would seem kind of lifeless, but there's actually a lot of dialog that goes on in the game. Some of it is amusing, some is intriguing. You are a scientist on an exploratory mission that suddenly becomes dangerous, but your character has a tendency to see peace and serenity in situations where others might freak out. He seems pretty eloquent too, and gets a bit philosophical at times. Sometimes you wonder if it's a good idea to wake the life on Mars, and if humans are creating a positive or negative impact. Yet if you continue to play, the impact is unavoidable. Haven't finished it yet, but curious to see where it ends up.			"

Really gives the feeling of learning about a new world and new life very well, and your role to play in the unfolding events. The puzzles are interesting, and working to discover as much as you can about the caverns and the meaning of the life in the caves really justifies your solvng of them. Great game, and if you just try and escape then the game will be rather short but if you take a fascination in the world the game puts you in, then you'll spend plenty of time discovering as much as you can.

												Waking Mars is a fun puzzle-like game where you have a lot more freedom and randomization than in most puzzles, and the storyline is pretty nice, too. It's a good way to waste a few days' time. I was surprised to find out there are basically three endings. The fact I apparently finished it before solving one of the major end puzzles gave the game some measure of replayability as I used my previous end save game to complete the bonus puzzle and unlock the two other endings.In later gameplay, though, one thing really started to bother me, and that was the fact that biodiversity simply didn't work. Instead of a circle of life, you'd have lifeforms destroying each other, taking over each other's growing spot and actually decreasing the total biomass. And since the only real goal, especially in the game's end-phase, is to maximize biomass, you'll generally end up replacing every single plant-lifeform in the whole cave system with the one that gives the most biomass, is harmless to you and the other lifeforms, and on top of that, acts as food production for all of the mobile lifeforms.As far as I can see, there is no way to make a self-regulating system which involves all of the life in the ecosystem, so yeah, that is a bit of a failure, in my opinion.This entire rant, however, just shows how engrossed I became in experimenting with the whole concept. Despite this minor annoyance at the end, it's still a very nice game, which I'll probably replay a few times in the future.			"

If you like sci-fi games it probably won't matter. Otherwise I suggest looking into another Martian adventure puzzle game. Comparitively the mobile version fits the description and gameplay better. Still, it's not bad.			"

												This game is actually really good for just an app. I'm not usually a puzzle game person but this one sets itself above those kinds of games! The gameplay is very unique as you go through the mysterious and amazing world of mars. The voice acting is absolutely perfect as the dialogue is not only interesting but feels accurate and engrossing. The gameplay is fun and not too diffacult and the game isn't very long. Theres a few hiccups towards the end as its not clear cut but its still totally worth the two bucks I spent. If you enjoy a goods tory with an immersive world and fun puzzles, this game is tottally for you! there is nothing better then waking mars!			"

												Interesting game with quite vivid graphics and moderate animation. Plot and the whole idea of the game is just great! You will explore the life of Mars and have influence on it's development.  Not a sandbox, but still good to waste several hours playing it.Would like to mention pleasant ambient OST and dialogues are not so silly. English in the game is simple, but for scientific expressions and terms.8/10			"

												This game is a gem. It cannot be described otherwise.I found it on sale at a ridiculous price, and decided to give it a try as I was attracted by the premise of a game about ""mastering an ecosystem"", and by the reviews talking about quality narration and voice acting. This totally exceeded my expectations.Not only is this game a quite challenging and extremely enjoyable puzzle/explorer, with a set of original mechanics unlike anything I had ever played, but Waking Mars is a little masterpiece of science fiction. The way the developers struggled to create a set of ""rules"" according to which the wierd and colorful martian ""plant fauna"" functions and thrives, and yet managed to render it - if not entirely likely - at least scientifically plausible, is really something remarkable, and really shows passion and effort - and some good degree of competence in the matter. Story-wise, it's pretty simple and complete within itself, as a good short story should be. A great idea to begin with, that has been chiseled, polished and refined - a gem, as I said. The characters are among the most real and human I've ever found in a game, even if they're just a couple of static drawn faces talking through the radio - and in addition, the voice acting is tremendous. Especially considering this is an indie game.Something I really enjoyed about the story is that there's not something like an immediate danger, or an impending problem that has to be resolved before-it's-too-late. The only part in which you are in some kind of trouble, the only one part in which you are trapped within these caves and have to get out somehow, is not at all pivotal and actually ends before mid-game. After that, what's left to keep you going is just the fact that you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ curious. Both yourself, and your asian astronaut counterpart. The things you discover while venturing deeper and deeper inside this huge network of caves as ancient as the solar system, while making it flourish with life, are bound to keep you stuck with this game until everything is made clear. The kind of curiosity, suspence, and marvel that I experienced while playing through the game are the same that I'd feel while reading a well-written novel.In conclusion: this game is great. The gameplay is original and satisfying, and the setting, narration and atmosphere are terrific. And the price is ridiculous. If you like Clarke-tier hard science fiction, you'll love this. Buy it.

Eventually you are cut off from the rest of your team and have to navigate throughout the tunnels of mars back to them, discovering more about the red planet and it's wildlife as you go.The controls for this game are very well integrated, you'd never guess it used to be an android game.This game also has some puzzle elements to it, to continue on to different chambers you have to have a certain amount of life in the current chamber you're in. This can be very difficult as different animals and plants effect others.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something new and original.

There's only a couple of characters, but I really liked them. They were pretty likable and felt like real scientist types who'd get sent on a mission like this. Took me about 6 hours to find everything, which was a good length for a game of this scope and price range.			"

It felt really good doing the different missions/objectives and really had me trying my very best to get 5/5 biomass. The endings were interesting, and it showed me something I never would have dreamed of on my own.You can beat this game in a day or two with dedication and it didnt drag out too long at all thanks to its pacing. I was hesitant to play it at first because it sounded like it had a really slow, artsy, indie game vibe but really blew me away. Even if you dont end up liking it, try playing at least for a couple of hours to see how it feels.Also if you like building something from nothing this is the game for you.			"

												The basic premise of Waking Mars is that you're a scientist trapped in a Mars cave and must use various alien plant-like lifeforms in order to progress through the cave and make your way back to the surface. The gameplay begins very exploration-focused but becomes more complex and puzzle-like as you discover more lifeforms and must balance their properties to create a functioning ecosystem. This is all connected by a somewhat loose story that leads you to the discovery of the unknown history of the caves.Overall, it's a very enjoyable and well-made experience, however the tags might be a bit misleading. This is not really a platforming game nor is it a Metroidvania game. While the atmosphere is certainly reminiscent of Metroid, the gameplay is quite different.			"

												I started playing this game on a whim one day when I was really bored but didn't want to play anything too fast paced or strenuous.  For something that came from a random whim and a Humble Bundle purchase I could not have been more surprised.  The story was deeply moving, I found myself playing until 3 am trying to finish the game in one day.  I ended up giving up and going to bed when I realized there was at least another three hours left but I finished it the next day when I got up.The characters are perfectly written; just enough dialogue to get you to identify with them as people and understand what is happening to the planet.  All of the conversations are thoughtful and while I was, at first, simply trying to ensure my guy survived to get off planet I later found myself ignoring my (technically) impending doom.  The planet and it's emerging ecosystem was far more interesting.Considering the simple mechanics and that I even went for 100% completion (with some bad choices that required fixing) it's very surprising that the game took me 8.6 hours.  I wasn't rushing but even if I had I likely would have gotten 7 hours out of it.  I've beaten several AAA games in less time and been far less satisfied.  This game is worth a play, just don't be expecting action or horror.  You will explore not only a planet but why it is that way and how your simple bid to survive will impact that entire world and its inhabitants.			"

The story, gameplay, and characters are all unique, comfortable, and perfectly done.I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who actually has a brain.			"

												A beautiful, but relatively short game about discovering and reviving an alien ecosystem - a game about giving life instead of taking it. The artwork may be simple, but personally, I enjoy it a lot. The game has great voice acting, a nice soundtrack and a calm and friendly atmosphere. It offers three different endings, but you can see them quite easily and the replay-value is not very high. Also, it is a bit unstable, in its current state, expect some crashes. Still well worth a few bucks. I was through in around 7 hours, which is an ""okay"" length.			"

												Waking Mars is... interesting to say the least.First and foremost, the most notable aspect of the game, as noted by myself and many others (judging by other reviews), is that this puzzle platformer places the player in the somewhat unique position of creating life to get ahead in the game, rather than taking it. Instead of shooting bullets, you shoot life forms into fertile ground to enhance the local biome.The story is a powerful one, and is accompanied by a really nice sound track. The music is chill, and reminds me of the sound tracks from sci-fi games from the 90's. Ascendancy certainly came to mind (come on Valve, we need it on steam!). The story follows your character (A scientist named Liang) as he explores subterranean Mars for signs of life. You are joined via radio by colleague Amani and yout helpful robot friend ART. The conversations between Liang and Amani are one of the best aspects of the game, with some thought provoking exchanges.The game mechanics are a real joy, as you conduct research on the life forms to meet your objectives. This pleased my inner scientist to no end. The game handles really well and watching your ecosystems flourish is particularly rewarding.			"

												Gameplay is straightforward. Some of the minor aspects do take some getting used to like switching seeds (I use the blockpad and not the numbers at the top so it may be easier the other way.) The plot actually seems better than the puzzles. That didn't make or break anything for me really.Pros:-good story-sassy AI-dialog is voiced well-talksprites are well doneCons:-gameplay graphics aren't that good-puzzles aren't very challengingBottom line is I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't on sale for $1.99. If you like sci-fi games it probably won't matter. Otherwise I suggest looking into another Martian adventure puzzle game. Comparitively the mobile version fits the description and gameplay better. Still, it's not bad.			"

												Waking Mars is a game with a compelling story, good voice acting, and an interesting setting. The gameplay is very intuitive and easy to learn, although there is no tutorial so you have to just experiment with the buttons when you first start out. I had the opportunity to try it out with a mouse and keyboard and with a gamepad - both felt natural. The game also departs from the normal game trope of just ""killing bad guys"", and instead the main character explores and experiments with the game world. The game also rewards you with completed research points for experimenting with different combinations of seeds and life forms. I thoroughly enjoyed Waking Mars and would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the standard gaming fare. 10/10			"

												A fairly simple, and yet rather fun game.The gameplay is all about exploring the cavern on Mars, collecting, researching and planting the local ""plant"" life to unblock passageways and steadily make progress to find the lost remote exploration drone. Overall challenge is pretty casual, with no difficult platforming elements with only occasional hazards to avoid, leaving puzzles about what combination of local life to grow to build an ecosystem and experimentation to learn how each part interacts. The interactions between the main character in the cave, the supporting character at the base camp, as well as the quirky computer are well voice acted and really go a long way to help set the mood of the whole adventure. Has various endings related to how much of the game you have played and what choices you make. Graphics are good, but not great, using kind of flat 2D environment elements layered to simulate depth, but much better character and plant life art.			"

												Waking Mars started life as an atmospheric puzzler on smart phones. It is now an atmospheric puzzler on Steam, with achivements and Steam Trading Cards. The game has no real difficulty as you are presented with a room with continuing complex puzzles (Which aren't very hard and hardly thought provoking). What the game has going for it is the story and atmosphere. You are an astronaut on a mission to discover what happened to an early lost droid on the exploration of a cave network on Mars. The story progresses a little beyond that and is fully voiced, yet not very convincingly. It's a nice ride while it lasts but the added materials don't warrant the extra charge for being a computer release.			"

												The Internet was out at my place, and I had Steam offline activated. I forget how I got this game, maybe from a humble bundle. I never really looked at it, so since I was bored I thought I'd give it a try. I was blown away by this game.The art and visuals are simple but excellent; the characters look like they were hand drawn based on models, which adds a lot to the sweet and sometimes humorous character dialogue. You really feel like you're investigating the life forms you encounter, as the game encourages you to try everything to interact with it. There is a little bit of a grind as you sometimes have to backtrack to replenish your collection of seeds, but if you plan it out well then you can establish little gardens with whatever Zoa you need more of in small clusters. I often had to revisit the Larian Gauntlet to trick more critters into becoming compost for me, after reproducing them in sufficient quantities. There's a certain honest charm about this game. You don't play some fantastic larger-than-life scientist fighting a military tough guy who's trying to take advantage of your discovery, and the aliens don't turn out to be xenomorph kill machines. You're just a dude with a jetpack who's trying to figure things out, and trying to stay alive at the same time. In a way, it's both liberating and humbling.Also, ART is my new favourite AI sidekick.			"

												Fun and open exploration/puzzle game.Edit: I'm going to clarify my previously totally useless review. You play as an explorer on Mars who becomes trapped in a complex cave system. In the caves, you discover Martian life, which is mostly in plant form. The purpose of the game is an environmental puzzle of sorts to provoke the growth of the different forms of life throughout the cave systems. I found the puzzle mechanics very rewarding and quite fun to watch the things you create develop and interact.Another great plus is the story and voice acting. At first, the characters seem a bit cheesy, but they really warm up to you in the end. It's rare to find an indie game that has such charisma in character dialogue.The graphics are well done--not incredible, but I was still in awe a good number of times.			"

												Waking Mars is a very interesting game. I've always been on the lookout for games about ecology, and to my surprise Waking Mars turns out to be a really good example of this. As you explore a Martian cavern system you'll discover a variety of ""Zoa"" lifeforms that have different characteristics, behaviors, and interactions. It then becomes your job to manage the varied species carefully in order to maximize the living biomass in all parts of the cave. It's tricky, though - I've had at least two species near extinction before I realized what was going on, and I had to frantically protect and cultivate the few remaining specimens back to a safe population level.It's a compelling game that doesn't have many issues. The only problems I've noticed with it, besides somewhat sluggish and finnicky controls, are a bug with one of the achievements and an issue where on newer versions of Windows you need to go to the executable and disable display scaling on high DPI settings (under compatibility settings) or else the mouse becomes useless.Besides that, though, it's a game with interesting ecological mechanics that's well worth playing!

Combat is replaced by dodging hazards and tossing seeds into plant beds.  It works.Each room is a resource-balancing puzzle.  While warping around for resources was sometimes necessary, nothing was particularly frustrating.

												Waking Mars is an adventure/sci-fi game, the aim is to develope an eco system under the surface of Mars. You research about different plants and creatures which all behave differently. The story was great, the graphics are ok but could have been better in some places.I really became immersed into the game because of the freedom and exploration of the caves, researching about the different habitants.

												I know what you're thinking, ""This is a port of an android game? Pass!"" But I know you're not going to believe this it's actually interesting. Yes there are a few rare android games that are worth more than one playthrough and this is one of them.Waking Mars is a ""Sci-fi"" esqe game where you play as an astronaut cataloging different lifeforms on, where else? Mars. Eventually you are cut off from the rest of your team and have to navigate throughout the tunnels of mars back to them, discovering more about the red planet and it's wildlife as you go.The controls for this game are very well integrated, you'd never guess it used to be an android game.This game also has some puzzle elements to it, to continue on to different chambers you have to have a certain amount of life in the current chamber you're in. This can be very difficult as different animals and plants effect others.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something new and original. Don't judge this game just on the grounds that it's an android port. I beg you.			"

												Waking Mars is an interesting concept.  At it's heart, it's a rather Metroid-esque exploration game.  Rather than focusing on combat, however, your goal is to explore and build an ecosystem within a large cave system on Mars.  While it's pretty simplistic, it does take some work to balance the flora and fauna in each room as certain ones will destroy others and can hurt you as well.The game has a light story focused around the exploration which works well, though I wish the dialogue didn't force you to stop playing to listen to it.  It would be a lot nicer if it let you keep playing while the characters conversed.  It does have some nice hand-drawn character portraits though.  The characters themselves are pretty interesting, with the usual insulting AI and some decently acted humans.Graphically, the game looks quite nice with the same hand-drawn feel, though animation quality is pretty poor.  Some may like it others may not.  One thing I really wish was done better is the music.  Good music could have added so much more atmosphere to the game.Overall, it's a fun little game worth your time.  If you want to get the special ending though, you'll end up running back and forth all over the place for seeds which can get quite tedious.			"

												Waking Mars is a 2D platformer with gorgeous art, pretty good voice acting, and an interesting (if not-so-original) story. You play as a scientist exploring some of Mars' underground caverns when you're trapped by a cave-in. In order to escape, you must cultivate the local wildlife to reach deeper into the caves, where you encounter even more bizarre lifeforms, and uncover some of Mars' past.The story is intriguing enough to drive you to play to the end, even though the gameplay itself gets a little grindy. All of the Mars flora and fauna are well designed and fleshed out, with your research on them helping you make your way through the various puzzles.The game is pretty enjoyable, but $9.99 is pretty expensive for the maybe 6 hours you'll get out of it. Buy it on sale to enjoy it the most.			"

Daca nu detii deja Waking Mars, pot spune decat: BUY IT NAO !

It's a 2D game, but.. after you stat playing it, you will forget this minor detail and begin to take part of the story that the game is trying to tell. The gameplay is really interesing, you are free to explore everything you visited, it's not linear gameplay, you cand do the missions in any order you want, and besides this, you'll discover some really interesing things, that made me wonder about some things.. If you don't already own Waking Mars, I can only say: BUY IT NAO !			"

												Waking Mars is a very interesting game. I've always been on the lookout for games about ecology, and to my surprise Waking Mars turns out to be a really good example of this. As you explore a Martian cavern system you'll discover a variety of ""Zoa"" lifeforms that have different characteristics, behaviors, and interactions. It then becomes your job to manage the varied species carefully in order to maximize the living biomass in all parts of the cave. It's tricky, though - I've had at least two species near extinction before I realized what was going on, and I had to frantically protect and cultivate the few remaining specimens back to a safe population level.It's a compelling game that doesn't have many issues. The only problems I've noticed with it, besides somewhat sluggish and finnicky controls, are a bug with one of the achievements and an issue where on newer versions of Windows you need to go to the executable and disable display scaling on high DPI settings (under compatibility settings) or else the mouse becomes useless.Besides that, though, it's a game with interesting ecological mechanics that's well worth playing!

												This is a fantastic gateway drug into gaming. It's intellectually stimulating, nonlinear, nonviolent, and rewarding.The game has you traveling between chambers and establishing interactive ecosystems while negotiating emergent behaviours. Trying to raise the combined biomass of all your creatures is a delicate balancing act that has you weigh the utility of a given plant against its adverse or beneficial effects on the microcosmic chamber ecosystem. The challenges can be tackled nonlinearly, and while they can be cheesed—by taking resources from other chambers—the satisfaction of establishing a self-sustaining and propagating food web and growth pattern is pretty damn great.The visuals are bright and fantastic, with it's parallax-heavy and vaguely paper-like aesthetic giving the whole experience a much cheerier tone than you'd expect from 'trapped underground on mars by yourself.'The story is inspiring, if a bit slow. The AI companion is absolutely hilarious. It's a good way to spend an afternoon (or more, if you're interested in getting the special ending).			"

Product received for free
												Waking Mars is a fantastic puzzle platformer, but it's entirely story-driven, and is more reliant on its narrative than its gameplay. While the gameplay is rewarding and engaging, it's not particularly difficult. The game is extremely forgiving. There is quick-travel to any discovered location, deaths are meaningless, and every decision you make can be reverted. Even if you missed the special ending, you can simply load your file from the final location and try again.The plot is compelling, and the art is beautiful. The entire story is fully voice-acted, and while that feature alone has merit, the quality of the acting is the game's biggest letdown.The entire game can be completed in a single setting, and there's no replay value. But for what it is, it's worth recommending.			"
